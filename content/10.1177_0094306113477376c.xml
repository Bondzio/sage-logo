<p>Why is the same object produced in one place valued more highly than its functional equivalent produced elsewhere? Why are some tourism experiences more sought after (and more highly priced) than others? And what economic strategies make the most sense? These questions of value enable social scientists to consider how valuation differences undergird economic inequality and how values might be transformed in order to better serve the disadvantaged. Economic sociologists have long acknowledged and contested opposing binaries in the marketplace: status or standard, hierarchies or markets, symbolic or material. These binaries emerge from two (sometimes) opposing tendencies. On the one hand, sociologists have found themselves in fruitful dialogues with economists and wanted to demonstrate the worth of studying social life at close range. Some markets are not standard, operating by a different set of rules concerned with status, stigma, and identity, concerns squarely within sociology’s purview. On the other hand, cultural economic sociologists have worked to expose these binary oppositions between the symbolic and the material as themselves meaningful, symbolic distinctions that have observable consequences for the material world.</p>
<p>For a long time social networks served as the main social variable that helped explain differences in market outcomes: who gets a job, who gets promoted, who gets the biggest salary increases—in short, who will bring, generate, or has generated the most value. Over time, however, understanding the structure of network ties proved insufficient to the task. For example, when women occupied the same network positions as men, they did not experience the same benefits; they were not valued as highly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477376">Burt 1998</xref>). Different categories of persons (insider/outsider) may have found themselves with the right kind of social ties and placed in the right structural positions, but they lacked the legitimacy to utilize their ties in the ways they saw fit. As social scientists examined who has the legitimacy to act in a particular way towards a particular object, their analyses moved toward the meanings of ties and the capacity of status, identity, and stories to steer the course of action. The three books reviewed here reflect this move.</p>
<p><italic>The Worth of Goods</italic> (WG), edited by Jens Beckert and Patrik Aspers, examines the value of modern art, natural habitat, wine, mortgages, stocks, and fashion; rituals and totems underlie value creation, but they operate in ways amenable to existing economic approaches to value outside of sociology. In a chapter on “The Transcending Power of Goods,” Beckert offers a late-Durkheimian theory of valuation. He relies on Durkheim’s <italic>The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</italic> to examine the attraction to and evaluation of goods. He rejects it as an idiosyncratic urge and argues that it is instead a “realization of values shared in social groups and as confirmation of membership in a moral community” (p. 112).</p>
<p>Goods themselves are symbolic representations of the values shared in a moral community: The symbol stands for (and is evaluated as) the values of the group, with the good both “representing the moral community and at the same time ‘being’ this community” (p. 113). The power of the good depends on its property as a collective entity; many members of the social group share a particular perception, and so though that perception is individually experienced, it is only operative where a large number of people within a community share in the perception and demonstrate ritually their shared understandings.</p>
<p>As the authors in WG contend with the value of goods, some of them develop typologies to differentiate among different kinds of valuation regimes. Beckert and Aspers distinguish between regular and non-regular markets, standard versus status, low meaning dependence versus high meaning dependence. In the former, there is an evaluative scale independent of the immediate evaluators, but in the latter the evaluative scale depends on identities of the actors involved. Beckert’s chapter destabilizes the boundary between the dynamics operative in a standard versus a status market, and the introductory chapter itself is ambiguous in the relevance of status orders and of identity in each of these market types. Rather than relegate some market dynamics to a non-status (standard) versus a status sphere, the chapters in the volume permeate (but do not pollute) these boundaries.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with one of the non-status markets where pollution and disaster are priced. Marion Fourcade explores “the kinds of valuation technologies that are being deployed in cases where markets do not exist <italic>and</italic> are not even sought” (p. 46). She uses the case of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska to discern the concrete processes that enable the commodification of things, people, places, and sentiments. What is the worth of beauty, the wild, natural silence, virgin terrain? What do people care about and what makes some dimensions of their concerns more salient than others? To address these questions of valuation, she identifies the technologies of commensurability (e.g., legal categories facilitating compensation and framing parties, rights, and violations as well as the calculative tools widely used to assess damage) as well as the media of exchange (e.g., money, credits, services) that enable market logics to triumph over other logics of valuation.</p>
<p>The importance of law and of calculative tools gets extended to the mortgage market as Akos Rona-Tas and Stefanie Hiss’ chapter that shows how price anchoring processes led to poor forecasting in the subprime mortgage crisis. An ethnographic investigation of these sites in which compensation algorithms and the ratings systems are debated would probably reveal ritual action, symbolic polarities, and relational work in dynamic, consequential play.</p>
<p>Framing processes and calculative technologies also manifest themselves in fashion and art markets. Take, for example, Ashley Mears’ chapter on the editorial and commercial sides of the fashion modeling market. She begins the chapter by following the triumphs and fumbles of a fashion model who must learn the ropes of valuation and pricing. She utilizes Zelizer’s concept of circuits to acknowledge the bounded, meaningful qualities of exchange within relatively stable clusters of actors, optimizing varying combinations of economic and symbolic capital as bookers and clients evaluate and contract fashion models. The mechanisms enabling models to generate economic profits from their status include time (and ritual sacrifice, though this ritual element does not take center stage in the chapter).</p>
<p>Ironically, actors have to render their short-term, high profits as irrelevant in order to make high profits more nearly possible in the medium term. In her analysis, “prices are not reducible to status, as structural analyses of markets would suggest (Podolny 2005), but status is rendered meaningful and contested, as market actors relate to each other” (p. 175). The prices fashion models fetch are themselves constituted by bundles of stories about social arrangements, dynamic moves, and positions within a field of cultural production, “bind[ing] booker[s] and clients together” (p. 174).</p>
<p>Likewise, Olav Velthuis’ chapter on art markets examines the social and cultural dimensions of pricing devices. He asks what the institutional arrangements are that enable art to be sold at auction and what constraints there are on pricing and presentation in these institutional settings. He even provides examples from art auctions in China and India, emerging cultural economies, and then returns to the well-known auction of Damien Hirst in Britain to demonstrate how the bases for legitimacy differ in each of these settings. There are meaning structures, shared values, and community norms among market actors who engage in pricing, producing, and trading art, and prices operate within circuits of commerce, “where forms of exchange are accompanied by specified morals, manners, symbols, and rituals, each of which in turn has shared meanings for actors within a circuit” (p. 196).</p>
<p>Just as there are different formal and informal rules that govern economic exchanges, there are also different hierarchies of value based on the location of those exchanges. The meanings of what a thing is worth becomes encased in where the thing was produced, or rather in the collective stories told about and the symbols singularly attached to the place of production. These are the themes that <italic>The Cultural Wealth of Nations</italic> (CWN), edited by Nina Bandelj and Frederick F. Wherry, takes up.</p>
<p>CWN advances a cultural perspective on economic development to show that economic success can result from the symbolic resources that nations, regions, and communities have at their disposal. The volume’s contributors reject traditional understandings that deploying culture for economic purposes corrupts some “true cultural essence” (what Viviana Zelizer calls a Hostile Worlds approach). Rather, the contributors to the volume provide empirical detail about how cultural commodification occurs and what constrains it. At the same time, the contributors demonstrate how the true cultural essence of places and things is crucial for the sense of value that commodities command. In the volume’s case studies one finds different pathways to valuing and honoring collective stories and sacred traditions. An object believed to be sacred seemingly has the force to compel its observers to engage in or avoid certain behaviors toward it and to feel attraction, repulsion, fears of contagion and defilement, and emotionally-charged, righteous indignation at its violation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113477376">Marshall 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the value-generating process of sacralization, the authors find that not everyone is chosen. In fact, the economic rewards from tourism and from participating in the cultural marketplace are unequally distributed across the globe. What explains these distributions of symbolic resources and economic rewards? In the chapter “The Political Economy of Cultural Wealth,” Miguel Centeno and the volume’s editors detail these inequalities. World regions have relatively similar endowments of “natural” heritage sites (coral reefs, landscapes, etc) recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)—however, the lion’s share of cultural heritage lies in Europe and North America. The nature/nurture divide is stark; so too are their corresponding economic valuations. Likewise, the tourism that focuses on beaches and bars attracts different audiences and affirms different reputations when compared with the tourism that focuses on the bells of cathedrals and the high-brow works of museums—hence, the beaches, bars, and bells distinction that the authors make.</p>
<p>When considering the iconicity of landscapes, economic historian Dario Gaggio takes the reader to Tuscany. Gaggio offers “a cautionary tale for governments or private sector actors attempting to generate cultural wealth out of thin air. Cultural wealth accumulation has not been a linear process in Tuscany, nor has it been uncontroversial to decide what aspects of the Tuscan landscape and heritage would come to be seen as desirable. Policy decisions made for completely different goals have had important, but unintended, effects on Tuscany’s cultural wealth” (p. 91). Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113477376">Alejandro Portes and Margarita Mooney (2002)</xref> use the case of Emilia Romagna to argue against the assumption that social capital could be cultivated and institutionalized anywhere one finds willing participants, Gaggio uses the Tuscan countryside to demonstrate how the potential of symbolic capital to promote local economic development depends on the history of political struggle in the region where the development activities are launched.</p>
<p>Similarly, Frederick Wherry and Todd Crosby demonstrate how the conversion of symbolic capital into economic capital is not a straightforward process. Their chapter on the Culture Banks of Mali resembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113477376">Michael Woolcock’s (1998)</xref> well-known piece on social capital and development. Rather than social capital, the emphasis is on symbolic capital. Rather than social relationships serving as collateral for business loans, collective stories and traditional objects serve as collateral. The more the lender knows about the object (the more stories they can tell that a local council believes), the greater the value of loan. The linkage between collective stories, objects, and place are explicit. The bank functions as a museum promoting cultural preservation, a community center hosting festivals and educational programs, and a tourist site full of local content, operated by local people. The authors take us inside these circuits of commerce—the differently defined relations, the various media attached to those relations, and the third party enforcement of socially proscribed exchanges—and illustrate how these circuits work. They point out that when the bank tried to operate without emphasizing the various circuits, functions, and meanings that flow through it, interest lagged and the project failed. Only when a multiplicity of purposes and ritual gatherings were mounted in the space could the conversion of symbolic into economic capital proceed more smoothly.</p>
<p>This approach to local economic development as a holistic, dynamic process finds expression in the volume’s chapters on global value chains. In her examination of the Mundo Maya tourism project, Jennifer Bair applies global value chain analysis in a holistic way, capturing the struggles over how the value chain will be governed across five different national territories and among competing within-country institutions. She presents contingent, unfolding processes of value generation as actors and institutions shape, edit, and contest the collective narratives that render the Mayan route valuable. And she challenges traditional global value chains research that “too rarely interrogates how […] value is defined, by whom, and toward what end, leaving the narrowly economistic concept of ‘value-added’ as the default definition” (p. 196).</p>
<p>These economistic understandings of global value chains too often rely on simple formulas for increasing value within specific links of the value chain, namely by using technology to eliminate additional, unnecessary transactions (getting rid of the middlemen). Geographer Mark Graham challenges these understandings in his study of the Thai silk industry. He begins with the promise offered by the internet in enabling local producers to bypass middlemen brokers so that these producers can capture a greater share of the value their products generate. This process of disintermediation became an even greater challenge as silk producers attempted to discern what the end-consumers needed to hear about their products, the history of silk production, the specifics of their own workshop, and stories about where the silk was being produced. Many local producers did not have the social skills to navigate what to tell, how to tell it, and at what times to place emphasis on one aspect of their stories versus another. And buyers had no basis for trusting one internet provider from the northeast of the country versus another. Internet use to link with buyers increased for middlemen brokers but not so much for the local producers themselves. Without a shared understanding of how transactions and communications should unfold between buyer and seller, local producers found themselves in need of cultural brokers. The network infrastructure must be navigated with culturally-based social skill or the journey from producer to buyer will be less travelled.</p>
<p>Culturally-based social skill can work for or against the valuation of local producers. Consider how collective stories about the South African political miracle and Black Economic Empowerment get in the way of locals struggling to capture more economic value from their works. In their chapter on the South African wine industry, Stefano Ponte and Benoit Daviron argue that the notion of empowerment implies that blacks now own a large stake in the wine industry, but they do not. Worse, the conditions endured by black workers in the vineyards are largely ignored and seldom questioned by consumers wanting to support the new South Africa.</p>
<p>The irony runs deeper. The cultural wealth of South Africa includes collective narratives about its rich diversity, human and otherwise, and the country’s compliance with international standards in its multicultural policies and its human rights, yet these narratives have drawn attention away from the fact that the wine industry now largely depends on mono-cropping which robs the natural habitat of its bio-diversity, and global market pressures have led to the removal of many indigenous wine varieties that made South African wines unique (for the connoisseur, not for the masses). These negative outcomes in the wine industry are hard to discern because the focus is on whether the wines are “certified”—and these certification procedures render irrelevant the conditions of the workers and the transformation in local indigenous practices.</p>
<p>While the chapters in these two volumes debunk standard formulations of value and point to the dynamic struggles underlying valuation, Lyn Spillman’s <italic>Solidarity in Strategy: Making Business Meaningful in American Trade Associations</italic> (SS) overturns comfortable assumptions about how businesses and the business associations they join evaluate their interest. She begins the book by caroling the dragon she intends to slay: self-interested action in pursuit of economic profits. Where do their vocabularies about interests come from? How do the discursive categories that business owners and association leaders use to talk about their work affect the strategies they deploy to meet both private and civic goals? How can the solidarity inducing activities of business associations be understood as valuable beyond the economic profits they might nebulously net? Spillman takes her investigation into the dragon’s lair, demonstrating that “business associations produce cognitive categories, networks, and fields that create collective cognitive goods for economic action” (p. 346). She builds on Zelizer’s findings that economic action is not impermeable to the cultural, affective, and cognitive dimensions of life—it is rather co-constituted by them.</p>
<p>In the very associations where non-economic goals should not matter, Spillman finds non-economic goals and activities shoring up the associations’ memberships. In fact, there is no systematic evidence to support claims that business associations really do improve the economic performance of members or their industries. Because this is taken as “an article of faith,” the reader can begin to see how an assumption that once felt so familiar now feels strange. In SS, business associations are “cultural producers of ‘interested’ identities that are <italic>necessarily</italic> communal <italic>as well as</italic> strategic, solidaristic <italic>as well as</italic> cognitive” (p. 188).</p>
<p>Although she examines the economic-profit oriented activities of the associations, she balances her attentions with the associations’ intraindustry activities, including educational seminars, publishing research, establishing and coordinating industry standards and certification protocols, and sharing information. They reward their members with status, and recognize technical proficiencies and career-long contributions to the industry. They tell stories about how people in this kind of industry do certain kinds of things; the actions their association sees as legitimate for problem solving, however, may differ from the technically feasible actions that may maximize profits in the short-term. However, businesses and the associations they join act <italic>as if</italic> their articles of faith will deliver (economic) salvation eventually.</p>
<p>As the leaders of business associations express their association’s values, they often point to concerns associated with the civic sphere. These concerns include safety, protection, and transparency, in the case of the Firestop Contractors International Association. Consider an essay written by one of the directors of FCIA. Notice the value-rational commitment of life as something that should be valued in itself: “So you’re on the top floor. The sprinklers fail. Can you get down in time? Will you be able to see or breathe if there’s dark smoke in the halls? Will the smoke be toxic, poisonous? Will you get out? Who knows? So are you ready to gamble with your life? How much money can ‘they’ save to make it worth it to you? …I think some things are priceless. A life any life, is one of those!” (p. 317)</p>
<p>These moral claims go beyond life-and-death issues. They also include social justice concerns for serving under-served (minority) populations, providing equal access to the American dream, and rehabilitating neighborhoods, in the case of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers. Rather than take a cynical view toward the civic engagement of these associations, Spillman examines the co-mingling of economic and social goals. She trespasses the distinction between the civic sphere and its economic opposite. Like Zelizer, Spillman finds that the civic and the economic do operate in separate spheres or hostile worlds.</p>
<p>SS meets Zelizer’s challenge of engaging the meanings of economic lives; it also meets Jeffrey Alexander and Philip Smith’s challenge of building a strong program in cultural sociology by engaging in a thick description of the vocabularies and strategies of action as well as the symbols animating action in business associations while following a “normal science” approach to sampling these associations. She draws on a unique dataset developed with her collaborators (Rui Gao, Xiaohong Xu, Brian Miller, and Georgian Schiopu). It is a comprehensive, national census of 4,465 business associations operating in the United States from 2002–2003. She then takes a focal sample of 231 business associations that are emblematic of the variety of business activities represented in the national census. This focal sample includes statements of purpose, photographs from past meetings, letters from leaders, promotional materials, newsletters, award presentations, and various other materials that the association routinely produces. She is careful to rely on materials the organizations have generated so that she can analyze just how meaningful the day-to-day of associational life is, even for business associations. She is also able to show how the members of these organizations seek and maintain a sense of solidarity among its members and how their sense of we-ness affects their civic engagements and well as their business practices. Her attention to these methodological details should appeal even to scholars skeptical of a strong cultural program for the study of economic life and should provide a template for cultural economic sociologists bringing a Zelizerian approach to market dynamics to the worlds of finance, banking, construction, healthcare (hospital management systems), marketing, and the cultural industries—a variety of fields and, in each, a variety of values.</p>
<p>To conclude, in these three works we find sociologists asking what is valuable and why. Their explicit evocation of Emile Durkheim as their theoretical forebear ties their analyses together across geography and methodology, but they differ in which version of Durkheim they privilege. The very medium of exchange in the standard market has come under interrogation, systematically forced to divulge its secrets: the institutional bases of its goals and the ritualized order of its operations. What value is and how it changes, what the various ways of assessing worth are and how they are generated, these questions have led to new lines of inquiry into the worth of goods, the cultural wealth of nations, and the value of business activities.</p>
