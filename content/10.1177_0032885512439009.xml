<abstract>
<p>The significance of successful completion of a prison term and the eventual release from prison is that it marks not only the end of incarceration, but also the beginning of a second cycle of societal retribution, which inevitably comes, regardless of whether the former offender is reformed or not. The extent of retribution in the second cycle depends upon the offense type and is more pronounced if the offense was a felony, and particularly so if it was sexually-motivated. This study draws from intensive ethnographic interviews with former prison inmates with the aim of estimating the effect of incarceration on their lives while in prison and after release. The study reveals manifest and latent effects of incarceration and finds that further retribution continues upon release when society takes over with vindictiveness that follows the former offenders almost forever. The main policy implications of long-term imprisonment are made, and areas of further research suggested.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512439009">Hudson (1993</xref>, p. 32), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512439009">Diver (2008</xref>, p. 486) argues that “our ‘carceral society’ often conspires to effect a continuum of punishments far beyond that needed to extinguish ‘behavior and bring about attitude change’ in offenders.” Criminologists have delineated five principal rationales for incarcerating offenders. They include the need to correct behavior by resocializing the offender into how to become law abiding (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032885512439009">O’Sullivan, 2000</xref>); to discourage future criminal behavior by instilling fear of state reprisals both to the offender (specific deterrence) and to others (general deterrence); retribution or punishment by just deserts, which is aptly typified by the doctrine of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; to physically remove offenders from the community in order to keep them from further offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032885512439009">Casper, 1995</xref>); and to provide expiation to society through restitution, which is represented by the suffering produced by imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032885512439009">McDermott, 2001</xref>). Although there is relative agreement among society members that the justice system has to be tough on crime and isolate convicted offenders accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032885512439009">Roberts &amp; Hough, 2005</xref>), which in part explains the current surge of the prison population, incarceration has been portrayed as more of a correctional than a punitive measure. As a result, we have departments of corrections, correctional facilities, correctional officers, corrections budget, and so forth, all in reference to the prison institution and its concomitants.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that offenders return to reoffending after criminal sanctions because they have been bestowed with a stigmatizing label that they ultimately embrace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512439009">Bernburg, Krohn, &amp; Rivera, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032885512439009">Chiricos, Barrick, Bales, &amp; Bontrager, 2007</xref>). When the label takes the form of official intervention, the labeled person experiences increased involvement in crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032885512439009">Bernburg &amp; Krohn, 2003</xref>), which attracts further labeling in a process that reinforces the belief in the person that he or she is indeed what the label designates and the person strives even more to live by the label. The societal reaction that ensues after the criminal label has been conferred often leaves the person with limited choices, encouraging an affinity to delinquent and criminal gangs. This is true even for juvenile offenders where justice intervention affects subsequent behavior through an intervening involvement in deviant social groups that are more accepting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512439009">Bernburg et al., 2006</xref>). There is also evidence to demonstrate that among individuals who commit crime, those who are successfully labeled felons are much more likely to reoffend than those who are diverted or treated in ways that do not leave the felon imprint on their records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032885512439009">Chiricos et al., 2007</xref>). This study seeks to explore the manifest and latent effects of incarceration, to systematically survey the extent to which the traditional goals of incarceration are realized, and to examine the ways in which society reacts toward former offenders upon their return from prison.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected from parolees. The rationale was that because parolees were in the interface of both worlds of incarceration and freedom in the general society, they were at the best position to comment on life in prison and life after imprisonment. Prior to commencement of interviews, the Institutional Review Board’s approval was sought and obtained. The terms of the approval, including participants’ informed consent, voluntary participation, and data confidentiality, were accordingly adhered to. Initial encounters were made with the participants in the summer/fall of 2009 in the parole offices where the participants reported from time to time, in keeping with their parole conditions.</p>
<p>The participants were approached covertly and individually informed about the study, using a prepared script that detailed the nature and purpose of the study, the type of questions to be asked, and the identity of the principal investigator. They were informed that participation in the study was voluntary and that if they elected to participate, their responses would be treated confidentially. They were also informed that the final report would contain verbatim excerpts of their de-identified responses. They were then asked whether they would be interested in participating. For those who voluntarily agreed to participate, a location convenient to them was arranged and private interview appointments were set up for later dates. This was also meant to protect their identities. Although most of those who were contacted showed initial willingness to participate in the study, many of them did not show up on their interview dates. After 5 months of data gathering, 29 participants successfully completed the interviews, 2 terminated the interviews at different stages, and 1 declined to participate as soon as the first question was read. A total of 29 usable interviews were ultimately entered for the analysis.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Due to their unwillingness to participate in studies that probe their behavior and experiences, offenders in the free society comprise a difficult-to-find population. As a result, this study utilized a nonrandom sampling method that selected anyone who met two basic conditions: They were on parole at the time of the study and were voluntarily willing to participate. Despite the nonrandom pick of participants, the recruitment yielded a fairly representative sample that reflected the demographic characteristics of the study population. The sample also included first and multiple offenders, sex offenders, as well as a wide spectrum of number of years served in prison. The composition of the participants is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032885512439009">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The participants were asked a range of open-ended questions to afford an ample opportunity to delve into their personal experiences in and out of the justice system. They were also asked questions pertaining to their early childhood experiences and the circumstances of their most recent incarceration. Comments on the prison life from their own experience were also elicited. The participants’ views were also sought regarding the extent to which their incarceration met the traditional goals of reformation, deterrence, retribution, and incapacitation. In addition, the participants were asked to describe the process of readjusting to the free society after imprisonment and their experiences thereafter. The interviews were recorded using an audio device and later transcribed verbatim. Research notes were also taken, especially on aspects such as gestures and facial or emotional expressions, which would not be captured by the audio recorder. Participants’ names and other personal identifiers were kept out of the recorded data. Each interview lasted an average of 45 min.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Findings</title>
<p>The in-depth ethnographic interviews yielded several significant themes, which were drawn by tallying the frequency of occurrence of a response among the participants. The most significant themes included violence, racial relations in prison, sexual assault, financial implications of incarceration, lack of liberty, denial of liability, and societal reaction upon release. These themes are presented along with relevant literature in the following sections. Excerpts of the interview responses are reported verbatim, except on a few occasions where punctuations have been altered to enhance readability.</p>
<sec id="section6-0032885512439009">
<title>Violence and Racial Relations in Prison</title>
<p>Prison violence is a multifaceted phenomenon that continues to afflict prison populations, including both inmates and the prison guards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0032885512439009">Atlas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0032885512439009">Byrne &amp; Hummer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512439009">Lahm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032885512439009">Weedon, 2005</xref>). The violence is intricately predicated on prison norms, which largely value the ability to stand out as the dominant aggressor. As one participant noted, “You don’t even have to be provoked; it might be as simple as looking into somebody’s room or sitting on an empty chair that belongs to somebody who has been there for many years but you just came in while he is in the bathroom; that is enough to send you to hospital or to cost your life.” Or, in the words of another participant, “Just because you look a little different than me, I don’t like you; because of the way you wear your clothes, I don’t like you; if you have more commissary (groceries) than I have, I don’t like you; that is enough for a bloody fight.” However, inmates on life sentence have an unusual reputation for relative serenity as long as they are not provoked, and this was a common expression by most of the participants. One male participant observed, “I prefer to do time among lifers because the respect level is higher and they know the true value of friendship; to many of them, it’s like if you need my shirt more than I do, you can have it; but if you cross the monster that lives inside them, they have no problem killing you even on the spot.” The view that life sentence inmates tend to show a friendlier demeanor as long as they are left alone was corroborated by another participant who reported, “Among lifers there is less stealing because if you steal my stuff and I’ve got life, I’ll kill you, I don’t care if it’s a 20-cents noodle you stole but it’s the principle behind stealing.”</p>
<p>Prison violence and inmates’ racial background were found to be intertwined, and research in this area abounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512439009">Berg &amp; DeLisi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512439009">Harer &amp; Steffensmeier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512439009">Meiners, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512439009">Ross &amp; Hawkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512439009">Spiegel, 2007</xref>). This may explain the official practice in many prison facilities to racially segregate inmates as a means of keeping away racial confrontations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512439009">Trulson, Marquart, Hemmens, &amp; Carroll, 2008</xref>). However, racially instigated violence still occurs and the outcome is mostly determined by the dominant race in the facility. One participant reported, “The racial minority in prison is always preyed against and fighting becomes the second nature; you have to do whatever you need to survive.” It was also reported that correctional officers often orchestrate the racial tensions in order to keep the inmates from uniting, which may facilitate an uprising against the prison administration. Participants reported that officers achieve this by starting rumors that pit one group against another. Asked why inmates engage in racial conflicts while fully aware that they are being manipulated, one participant responded, “You may be unwilling to fight but if someone is coming at you with a knife or other weapons, what do you do?” It was also revealed that in some cases officers receive “hazardous condition remuneration” when they quell riots.</p>
<p>It was demonstrated that minority inmates have a greater sense of in-group belonging than do white inmates, and this sense tends to play out when aggressive incidences break out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032885512439009">Moss, 2009</xref>). One white male participant explained, “If a fight goes down between a white man and a black man, no matter what, the white man won’t win; if he gets the best of the black man, because you are beating up on my brother, I’ll whip up on you, but the whites do not stand up for each other; you are alone in prison if you are a white man.” This view was given credence by the observations of a black male participant who asserted, “If black and white guys go against each other, I will break it up but if I can’t we have to resolve it in some way; if there has to be bloodshed, let there be bloodshed.” There are also other factors for violence in prison, which reflect the typical grounds of violence in the general society. An example was offered by a participant who observed, “If I loan you something, I expect it back; but if you walk around every day like you don’t owe me nothing, I’ll come for it.”</p>
<p>A great deal of violence in prisons is directed to sex offenders, particularly those who are incarcerated for child molestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512439009">Trammell &amp; Chenault, 2009</xref>), in spite of the fact that few studies have paid attention to this area. Many inmates who perpetrate this type of violence justify it as a way of maintaining social distance from the detestable offenders. To escape the violence, most sex offenders seek protective custody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512439009">Trammell &amp; Chenault, 2009</xref>). However, because there is no way of determining genuine cases, protective custody is not harasser proof as was articulated by one participant who explained, “The bully may still follow you to the protective custody; he only needs to say he too is scared and he’ll come in and do what he wants and by the time they come to get him, you are sitting in hospital, bleeding.” Other defense tactics by sex offender inmates include lying about their offenses, which often has very low chances of success. One male sex offender participant explained his failed tactics: “For about three years I lied that I was there for robbery and I was always looking over my back; everybody was cool with me and I could hang out with everybody but half way through, someone found out and told on me to other dudes; I almost got killed; I mean, you can’t fight everybody but I was taken to PC (protective custody).”</p>
<p>In general, prison violence occurs mainly because of the prison culture that values masculinity and the ability to fight regardless of who is on the offense. A participant summed it thus: “You have to protect your manhood and live by a different code where a lot of things that you could let go when you are out you can’t let go when you are in a penitentiary because if you do, people take that as a sign of weakness; they will then mistreat you until you have to stand up for yourself; but on the street you can pretty much pass that because, you know, who cares?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0032885512439009">
<title>Sexual Assault in Prison</title>
<p>Because incarceration keeps inmates from heterosexual relationships and, therefore, prevents the conventional expression of masculinity for men and femininity for women, prison inmates endure acute emotional and psychological distress that leads some of them into aggressive behavior and homosexual tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512439009">Knowles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512439009">Trammell &amp; Chenault, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0032885512439009">Wyatt, 2006</xref>). With little defense resources and the constant presence of motivated offenders, prisoners face a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than the free citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512439009">Flanigen, 2009</xref>). Many sexual attacks in prison may be unpremeditated, but most occur as a result of calculated moves by the assailants, especially when they judge that the target may not be able to wade off the assault. As reported by one participant, “In prison you don’t want people to think you’re soft; they will run all over you and even try to get in your pants.” More experienced and stronger inmates also entrap unsuspecting and weaker inmates by lending them money until they are unable to pay back, which was found to be easy and common among inmates who do not have financial support from family members. One participant explained, “If you get in debts and can’t pay, you’ve got to fight or they’ll turn you into a <italic>feg</italic> (homosexual); they’ll be like hey dude, you know the money you owe me, you know, we can just go to the bathroom and handle the business real quick and get it over with.”</p>
<p>Another major factor in prison sexual assault is naiveté. This mostly affects first-time inmates who are unaware of social relationships behind the bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0032885512439009">Blackburn, Mullings, &amp; Marquart, 2008</xref>). Many participants explained that in prison, it is difficult to avoid physical and sexual violence altogether because once an inmate becomes a target, the inmate will have to take one of two choices—fight or submit. According to one participant, “If you are weak or don’t want to bring violence into your life and don’t hang with anybody, a big dude will probably approach and befriend you and begin to share his stuff with you, hang with you and then, when nobody is around, he will suddenly turn against you and strike.”</p>
<p>Among female inmates, the motivation for sexual assault may differ from that of men in many significant ways such as the nature of offending, but the phenomenon is still common in female correctional facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032885512439009">Alarid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032885512439009">Hensley, Koscheski, &amp; Tewksbury, 2005</xref>). Unlike the case of male inmates among whom perpetration is almost always by other inmates, female inmates are the targets of sexual assault by other female inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032885512439009">Moss, 2009</xref>) as well as by prison staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0032885512439009">Struckman-Johnson &amp; Struckman-Johnson, 2002</xref>), which may present even a greater challenge given the authority of the staff over the inmate. One female participant explained, “Some male guards sexually harass you and when you report it to supervisors, they side with them and you are put in trouble for false accusation; many people choose to live with it.” Most cases of physical violence among female inmates are occasioned by friendship rivalries and, like in the male world, first-time inmates are affected the most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512439009">Wolff &amp; Jing, 2009</xref>). Here, too, provocation is simple as illuminated by a female participant: “I can come into the prison and you are sitting at that table and I sit and begin talking to you and say, ‘okay I’ll see you later’ and now that we’ve sat and talked, I’m your girlfriend and I don’t even know it and any other girl who talks to me will have to explain or they’re going to fight over me.” To female inmates, craved relationships are meant to fill in for the badly missed presence of loved ones. A participant recalled, “I saw people in there who didn’t get no letters, no visits and no phone calls at all, so the only contacts they had were other inmates and they yen for intimacy more than those who have lots of outside contacts.”</p>

<title>Financial Implications of Incarceration</title>
<p>Literature shows that incarceration is expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512439009">Ristad, 2008</xref>). According to U.S. Courts (<italic>U.S. Courts</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512439009">2009</xref>), the daily cost of keeping an inmate in a federal prison in 2008 was US$70.75 and US$65.25 in community correction centers, whereas life in prison costs about US$62 a day per inmate. The state does not cater for the entire daily expenses of inmates beyond food, basic health, and shelter. Participants in this study explained that even food, which is taken for granted and assumed by the general society to be readily available in prison, is hardly accessible in sufficient amounts, even to those who find it palatable; most inmates eat the prison food barely to survive. A female participant lamented, “Prison food sucks; you don’t know what it is half the time plus it’s not even enough; you are hungry all the time.” Asked to comment on the availability of other basic necessities in prison, another female participant explained, “You have to buy your own commissaries (groceries) and <italic>hygienes</italic> (personal supplies) and if you are working, you earn only 12 cents an hour or 15, very lucky if you are paid 20; I mean, who makes that kind of money?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0032885512439009">
<title>Denial of Liberty and Its Retributive Effects</title>
<p>Whereas other traditional goals of imprisonment, such as rehabilitation, have received varying evaluations of success, incapacitation is the single most easily attained goal. However, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512439009">Kolber (2009)</xref>, if two people commit the same crime and are sentenced to equal terms in the same prison, they have identical punishments only in name, as one may experience incarceration as challenging but tolerable and the other is thoroughly tormented by it. In the current study, a female participant noted,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Once you are in prison, it doesn’t matter what you did; you are controlled until you almost feel like a little kid; you have to be told when to eat, when to use the bathroom, what to wear, when to go to sleep, and you miss everything; you miss eating ice cream, holding a TV remote, taking a shower, all those matter a lot.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The effect of imprisonment was also highlighted in the following recollection of participants:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Being snatched away from your family, you are not the only one that pays for your crime; everybody that loves you, they pay too; you hurt your mom, dad, kids and everyone that cares about you; it hurts them to visit you and see you like that; in their hearts they really don’t wanna be there and they wouldn’t be there if you weren’t in there. (Male inmate, aged 48 years)</p>
<p>Incarceration didn’t teach me nothing except how to do some bad things better; only thing prison did, they separated me from my family for a long time; you miss your kids birthdays and their basketball games; you miss family weddings, family members die and you don’t get to say good bye to them; you can’t help your mother, it hurts. (Male inmate, aged 60 years)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another leading goal of imprisonment, in addition to retribution, is to reform offenders and to help them resume usual responsibilities in society through rehabilitation programs. However, participants explained that most of the prison programs mainly target inmates serving long-term sentences and life imprisonment and have no room for short-term inmates. A female respondent who served only one year bewailed, “Prisons need to offer something for short-timers who come in the middle of programs and can’t be allowed in; what’s available for short-timers is only Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, which hold hour-long night groups, but they only talk about their experience with the substances; no one wants to do that; you are only triggering yourself and makes you miss it.” It was also noted that gain time credits that inmates earn for participating in prison programs, which form part of the basis of early release, benefit career offenders more than first-time and minor offenders. In the words of one female participant whose educational level prior to arrest was an associate degree,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Repeat offenders, drug addicts and the less educated people have more chances of getting out early than someone who is educated, is a first-time offender and is not a drug addict. Prisons offer time cuts to let you out early if you do educational courses and get GED, or take drug classes. If you are already educated beyond a GED, you can’t get the time cut because you can’t take those classes. If you are not a drug addict, you can’t get time cut because you can’t take drug classes. So drug addicts and the uneducated, and usually those are the repeat offenders, end up getting out before someone who is educated and is a first-time offender. (Female inmate, aged 27 years, first-time offender)</p>

<title>Denial of Liability and Resentment of the System</title>
<p>Most inmates feel that the justice system is unfair to them, and this feeling is stronger among sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512439009">Colton, Roberts, &amp; Vanstone, 2009</xref>). Even among those who accept liability, there is a growing feeling that the punishment received was disproportionate to the effect of the crime. Many also express the feeling that they would benefit from a second chance if it was extended to them, but lament that the justice system is so vindictive that there is no room for a second chance. The verbatim excerpts below demonstrate the feeling among offenders.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was only a (drug) user but sold to support my habit; I made only three sales of US$320 in all and they gave me 50 years suspend 10 do 20. If you take somebody’s life I think you deserve the time but if you sell dope I think you deserve rehabilitation; when you lock me up, I’m just absent from the drug because my character defects follow me inside the prison; I can sell other things like blankets or even my body. (Female inmate, aged 55 years)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Arguing that his punishment was excessive, another offender who had served time for strong armed robbery recounted his case:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It wasn’t like I went out to the street and pulled a gun on you and said give me your money. No, you owed me money, and when I ask for it, you pull a knife on me and when I wrestle the knife from you and stub you a couple of times and take no more than you owed me, that’s not a strong armed robbery. (Male inmate, aged 59 years)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The resentment of the justice system and the denial of liability are more remarkable among sex offenders, possibly due to the stereotypes and the potential embarrassment associated with sex offending. Their justification for their actions tends to be stronger when the victim is a consenting teenager as opposed to child molestation. The resentment of the severity of the punishment was captured by the tone of three sex offender respondents reproduced below:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She lied to me that she just turned 18 but still they wouldn’t take no leniency, nothing; they gave me 10 years for, I mean, I know I did wrong, you know, for sitting with a 16 year old, but it’s not like I messed with little kids and I didn’t even try to force nothing to her. (Male inmate, aged 29 years)</p>
<p>I did not have any sexual contact with her although I did put my hand across her shoulders and touched her while we watched a movie. She even wrote statements showing that nothing (sexual) actually happened, and I was given 4 suspend 2 but then I was violated (parole was revoked) because I skipped the group (counseling classes) so they took me back to prison. (Male inmate, aged 26 years)</p>
<p>I met him in a bar and he bought me drinks, and since this was an adults-only place, I didn’t think he could be a minor and we continued dating for a while; I was sentenced to 6 do 3 for sexual misconduct with a minor; I got cut off (probation was revoked) because I didn’t have the money to pay for the probation fees, so they sent me back. (Female inmate, aged 37 years)</p>

<title>From Prison to Societal Reaction</title>
<p>Getting accustomed to the daily routines in the conventional world after release is a daunting task, particularly to individuals who have served extended periods of time in prison. Some become so institutionalized that they cannot manage freedom, as in the case of one male participant who explained his experience upon release: “It was awkward to cook on a stove and do laundry and things like that; your normal day-to-day activities are not normal in prison; they do your laundry and they feed you; it felt weird to wear different clothes, take out trash, go to the refrigerator, and just do what you want.” Others had aligned their lives to the prison lifestyle to the point where they become unable to debrief themselves upon release. One participant noted, “I lived in a single-man cell for so long, always listening for the door to open, so I sleep very lightly up to now; like I can’t share a bed with anyone, including my girlfriend, because if she moves even a little, I will come up swinging; I have to sleep on the couch while my girlfriend sleeps on the bed because one night I almost hurt her real bad.” A female offender explained that because prisoners are not allowed to dance or touch anybody, “when you come out and everybody is all over wanting to hug you, you’re like, stop, keep your distance; I had issues with people getting close to me at first, but now I’m getting used to it.”</p>
<p>The adjustment process for former drug users is even more telling as elucidated by a female respondent, whose charges were drug use and related drug offending: “The hardest part of adjusting to the free society is to avoid old friends; if you used drugs and you choose to stop and all your friends are drug users, it becomes very hard; everybody I know uses drugs; I find my life boring, no social life.” Even after one has surmounted the challenges of emotional and social adjustment to the free society, most participants reported that the society remains forever vindictive, especially in the job market. A female participant shared her experience:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I get turned away wherever I go; I can’t get a job; I can’t rent an apartment and can’t go for a nursing course because they say I won’t get a medical board license, all because they think I’m still a dangerous person; so what’s the use of sending me to prison if I come out and have to go through all this, or what else do I need to do to pay my debt to society?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Everyone who participated in the study was grappling with varying degrees of difficulty in finding a job, in addition to other forms of societal rejection. One of the parole conditions is that the parolee must find and keep a job, notwithstanding the fact that employers are hardly endeared to a job applicant with a felony background. This creates enormous pressure on parolees because, in the words of one respondent, “You get only one month to find a job or go back to prison; you have no option of quitting a job or being fired; rules are so many and if you can’t keep one, you will be violated (parole revoked) and sent back in; it’s simply easier to remain in custody and complete your time.” The experience of one female participant may represent what many former inmates go through: “I need to get a license and I desperately need a job; they say they are hiring, but as soon as they see my name they freeze; yet I have an education, I have the experience, I am a hard worker; I just need somebody to give me a chance but nobody will.” This situation is frustrating, according to a 27-year-old male participant, who lamented, “Having a felony is a big strike against you; it is super hard not having money, no food, and nothing to do; you try everything possible and you are turned away everywhere; you can only go for so long before you have to make a choice and nine out of ten times you will stick up (commit a another crime) and end up going back to prison.”</p>
<p>The societal rejection is not limited to employment alone. Law enforcement officials seem to have borrowed from the old adage that “once a thief always a thief” in the way in which they deal with suspects who have previously been convicted of a felony. A male respondent who served time for aggravated assault reported, “The police still treat me as armed and dangerous; if they pull me over, even if I’m in the passenger’s sit, they still pull guns on me.” Narrating her ordeal after release, a 55-year-old woman explains how hard it is to live with a felony background:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was a drug user who sold only to support my habit but they convicted me like a dealer and now I have no chance in society. I’m a drug dealer so I don’t qualify for subsidized housing, no assistance, no food stumps, no nothing. The drug charge puts a damp on everything. The department complex, I can’t go in under them because of my drug charges; places that hire felons for tax cuts don’t have no jobs now. It’s a big struggle and it’s so easy to say I can go sell (drugs again) and get what I need at once.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The way in which the society members treat former prison inmates was perhaps summed up analogically by the 46-year-old male respondent who posed the following question: “If your child pees on himself and you whip him, do you come back later in the day and whip him and then you remember it a week later and whip him again, and three months later you remember it and still want to whip him for the very same thing?”</p>

<sec id="section12-0032885512439009">
<title>Societal Reaction to Sex Offenders</title>
<p>The first and formal societal response to sex offenders is encapsulated in the Jacob Wetterling Act, enacted following the 1989 kidnap and eventual disappearance of the 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling. The law requires that anyone convicted of a sexual offense be registered, but the length of registration varies across states and according to the nature of the offense. This law was given a new impetus and renamed Megan’s Law in 1996 after the 1994 brutal rape and murder of the 7-year-old Megan Kanka in New Jersey. The law now requires all 50 states to create and maintain a system of notifying the community if and when a sex offender moves in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512439009">Center for Sex Offender Management, 2001</xref>). It has long been established that housing is a basic human need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512439009">Williams, 2008</xref>, on <italic>Abraham Maslow</italic>, 1908-1970), but research has also shown that whereas one third of offenders are homeless or lived in precarious housing situations prior to imprisonment, two thirds become homeless and experience social exclusion upon release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032885512439009">Dyb, 2009</xref>). One of the salient consequences that sex offenders have to live with, in addition to the same sneer suffered by other convicted felons, is the sex offender registry requirements whereby one of the conditions is that the offenders should not live within a certain distance of a school, a daycare, a public park, a church, or a school bus stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032885512439009">Schiavone &amp; Jeglic, 2009</xref>). These restrictions may present nearly insurmountable challenges to some offenders and serve only to increase resentment of the system and the likelihood of recidivism. Indeed, registration and restriction of sex offenders have been found to stigmatize and isolate the offenders, affect their financial and emotional well-being, and lower their chance of leading a stable life, all of which make it conducive for reoffending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032885512439009">Schiavone &amp; Jeglic, 2009</xref>). One male respondent who claimed his sexual offense with a teenage girl was consensual reported, “I am not allowed to talk to kids; even if I pass my own kids I can’t say nothing to them regardless if they walk by me and cry for me; I don’t justify what I did but still, I mean, this is too harsh; I’m not violent.” In explaining how hard it was to cope with the registry conditions, another participant narrated:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t have any place to stay; I couldn’t live with my mom because she lives with my daughter and I’m not allowed to see her, I can’t live with my uncle because there’s a school nearby; I have to live with friends but still I can’t go to the park and play basket ball with them and have to stay back if they go to places like the zoo. If I want to move somewhere I’ve to have the address run to make sure it’s not within the one thousand meter thing, but everywhere you go there’s a daycare or a school, and it makes it hard even to find a job because you can’t live near your work place if it’s near a school. It makes it impossible to comply.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to the Center for Sex Offender Management, most states use one or more of the following practices in disseminating sex offender information to the community: media release, door-to-door flyers, mailed flyers, or Internet distribution. Several states also utilize other methods. In Louisiana, the offender is required to place an advertisement in a local newspaper and mail the notification to neighbors and the superintendent of the school district in which he or she intends to reside, whereas in Texas, judges can order the posting of signs on an offender’s home warning neighbors that a sex offender resides there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512439009">Center for Sex Offender Management, 2001</xref>). The publication of sex offenders’ names and pictures makes it all the more difficult for them to settle back in the community. Existing research has shown that although the general public supports residency and work restriction for sex offenders, there is not much support for publication of their names in newspapers or other types of media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032885512439009">Comartin, Kernsmith, &amp; Kernsmith, 2009</xref>). The resultant banishment occasioned by the registry requirements also produces stress, depression, and hopelessness among sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512439009">Tewksbury &amp; Lees, 2006</xref>). Citing the effect of such publication of their identity, many sex offender participants in this study cited instances where the public turns aggressive on them. A 28-year-old male respondent explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You do your time (in prison) and don’t want no more trouble in your life, but people look at you like you are a constant danger; they harassed me, followed me around and pinned stuff on my car with nasty words; one time guys followed me from a store and screamed “sex offender”; I told the police but they say there’s nothing they can do. I’ve been chased and almost beaten; even cops follow me sometimes; I can’t go anywhere without people that I know; I can’t talk to kids; even if they ask me something, I’m supposed to walk away and it makes you look mean always.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For female sex offenders, societal reaction tends to bring both harassment and embarrassment. A female participant who claimed her sex offense was to date a minor whom she believed to be older than 18 explained, “I’m required to go to a counseling group of 25 sex offenders and sex predators where I’m the only female but they don’t care; I also have to pay 40 dollars per session and there’s a session every other week, yet I don’t have a job and if I skip a session, I be violated and I don’t want to go back to prison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0032885512439009">
<title>Reflections on the Good Old Days in Prison</title>
<p>The disdain with which former inmates are treated in the society leads some to remember, perhaps nostalgically, their days in prison. A male participant reminisced, “Life was easier in prison; I used to run a shylock, lending commissary to those who needed, and they would pay me at a cost.” When asked how he ensured compliance, he replied: “If you don’t pay, I knew a couple of guys that didn’t have any money at all, and they were pretty big guys; I just tell them, hey men, that guy over there owes me 20 bucks; if you go collect my money you can have half of it.” Being incarcerated for long periods of time may also lead to total assimilation of the prison culture and a pro rata loss of touch with conventional norms of behavior, with the result that the former offender experiences social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032885512439009">Dyb, 2009</xref>). Consequently, the person might deliberately consider reoffending in order to return to the now-familiar lifestyle, although it is difficult to distinguish between reoffending for such reasons and the typical recidivism occasioned by resentment of incarceration, especially for the first-time imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512439009">Nieuwbeerta, Nagin, &amp; Blokland, 2009</xref>). The following claims by two participants corroborate this notion:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I can live in prison better than I live here; I know how to make it in there; a tattoo, a portrait, a little hustle here and there, things like that could get me easy money but it’s so big out here, it’s terrifying to be in large groups of people; it’s so noisy and my nerves can’t handle that even right now. (Male inmate, aged 41 years)</p>
<p>There’s so much responsibility out here; in prison I know the ins and outs and the dos and don’ts; because there’s a daily routine, if you know what to expect it’s not so stressful; but out here you are on your own and everything is so confusing; I feel lost; you have to pay your light, water, gas, rent; I mean it’s like a never-ending hectic cycle; you feel like you would like to go back. (Male inmate, aged 33 years)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, in spite of the hardships in prison and the challenges of resocialization in the conventional world, not every former inmate resents the experience. One 24-year-old male participant recalled, with a tinge of appreciation-cum-bitterness, “If I never went to prison I would be dead by now; I was on the road to destruction; it took me to get locked up in order to grow up; I hate that I had to go through all this for me to change.” Similar sentiments were echoed by a 33-year-old woman who averred, “Everything that we have here except for the male species is in prison; if you can deal with being away from your loved ones and embrace the situation, because you have to do it any ways, you can come out better if you take advantage of all the opportunities offered there.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0032885512439009" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated that incarceration does much more in the lives of offenders but negates the age-old traditional goals of reformation, deterrence, retribution, incapacitation, and restitution. Foremost, the reformation goal is rendered fallacious by the society’s unwillingness to give the offenders a chance to demonstrate they have reformed. Once a person is labeled a <italic>felon</italic> and incarcerated, the person enters into an almost-binding life-long relationship with the society, in which society views the person with inexorable suspicion, notwithstanding the person’s possible reformation or feelings of remorse for his or her criminal acts. The lack of a chance to prove reform or show remorse fans the societal suspicion even more, and the cycle continues, to the detriment of the former offender.</p>
<p>Moreover, the traditional goal of deterrence by incarceration is refuted by the nature of rejection that former offenders encounter everywhere they turn. Quite paradoxically, the rejection encourages them to return to crime as a way to establish meaningful friendships and gain acceptance among peers and also as a method of eking out a living when avenues for genuine employment are blocked. However, incarceration and all the attendant ramifications may succeed in deterring other people from criminal behavior, and the findings of this study did not disprove general deterrence. In addition, retribution in the <italic>lex talionis</italic> doctrine of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” does not suitably represent the balance between the effect of the offense and the combined amount of punishment that offenders bear both in prison and after release. For if incarceration was solely for the purpose of retribution, denial of liberty for a specified duration would be a more definitive way in which offenders would appreciate punishment as a consequence of their bad choices. Subsequently, their past crimes should cease to be used against them as long as they successfully served their time in custody. This, however, is not the case as retribution continues endlessly long after the completion of the prison term. The other goal of incarceration, which is incapacitation by physically removing the offender from the streets, would work under two conditions: The offender never returns to the streets as in life without parole, or, the offender returns reformed. Because the majority of the people who go to prison will return to the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512439009">Mbuba, 2009</xref>) and because behavior reform as a result of imprisonment is not likely, imprisonment for incapacitation remains a mirage, for the most part.</p>
<p>Lastly, as was demonstrated by the findings of this study, the goal of restitution, which rests on the notion that incarceration is a method of compelling offenders to pay their debts of misbehavior to society, is badly flawed. True restitution takes place when the payment is acknowledged by the recipient. However, society does not acknowledge offenders’ payment of their debts, and this is epitomized by the vengeance with which former offenders are treated upon reentry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0032885512439009" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion and Policy Recommendations</title>
<p>This study yielded a number of salient findings. Foremost, the main effects of incarceration were explored, and the latent retribution as well as the more manifest loss of liberty were found to exist to a large extent in prison, and these effects impinge on inmates’ reformation process in many different ways. Also, the societal indignation that confronts the former offenders upon their release from prison is so retributive and endless that most offenders end up losing sight of the true intention of incarceration, which, according to them, is not to pay their debt to society. Moreover, as demonstrated by the findings of the study, the traditional goals of imprisonment have steadily waned and become increasingly superfluous over the years. As long as society continues to scoff at former inmates even after they have successfully completed their time in prison and all forms of subsequent supervision, which in their minds represent the payment of their debt to society, all hope of reducing recidivism might remain just that—hope.</p>
<p>Given that most of the imprisoned offenders are eventually released back to the streets, imprisonment would be a more meaningful avenue for behavior change if its inherent punishment was not ambiguous. Policies that call for criminal background checks should be reevaluated to allow for the removal of the <italic>felon</italic> label once the offender meets all the necessary conditions for atonement. In addition, the fact that some offenders who served extended imprisonment will nostalgically reminisce their days in prison might be an important pointer to policy makers to rethink the utility of any length of imprisonment beyond “short-sharp-shock.” Evidently, the emotional suffering that an offender goes through as a result of being kept away from his or her family, friends, and other loved ones is highest at the start of the prison term and diminishes with the passage of time. Inmates then make new friends as they seek meaning in their new life circumstances, and with time, they begin to enjoy the company of their new friends to the extent that they no longer look forward to leaving prison. Indeed, if released, they would do anything, including reoffending, to return to prison and reclaim the now-assimilated alliances. In effect, long-term imprisonment backfires as a method of punishment, produces more criminal activities due to resentment and urge to reunite with old buddies who are still behind bars, and costs tax payers their money to keep the offenders in prison. For the majority of offenders, especially the nonviolent variety, shorter prison terms may not only obviate resentment but would also allow the inmates to return to their communities before their ties with those communities are completely severed and before they form enduring relationships with hardcore offenders who must be kept away. The main challenge to this policy implication is to establish the threshold of prison time beyond which emotional suffering begins to diminish. Further research in that regard is hereby recommended.</p>
<p>Finally, although there is no claim that this study represents all the sociodemographic traits of offenders across the crime spectrum, the results are consistent with the existing literature. Nevertheless, it should be recognized that different correctional facilities may have different normative frameworks and inmates’ experiences may differ not only from one person to another but also from one facility to another. Even more pertinently, different states have varying standards in the way in which offenders are treated in and out of prison. These variations have to be taken into account while attempting to generalize the findings of this study.</p>
