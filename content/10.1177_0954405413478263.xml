<p>An important machining process for KDP is the slicing of workpieces into desired shapes. Currently, slicing methods include outer diameter (OD) sawing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954405413478263">11</xref></sup> inner diameter (ID) sawing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954405413478263">12</xref></sup> band sawing, and wire sawing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954405413478263">13</xref></sup> OD sawing uses a thin blade with diamond abrasives plated on its OD. As the blade diameter gets larger, the deflection at the edge of the blade will become larger under the same force. This can cause the blade to vibrate with larger amplitude, resulting in higher kerf loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954405413478263">11</xref></sup> ID sawing uses a hollow blade with diamond abrasives plated on its ID. Compared with OD sawing, ID sawing has higher stiffness, lower kerf loss, and better slicing quality. However, the blade stiffness is still a bottleneck when the blade diameter increases to a certain value. This limits its application in slicing large-size KDP crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954405413478263">14</xref></sup> Band sawing uses either a steel band saw with teeth or a steel band saw with plated diamond abrasives. Although it has a high kerf loss, this method is still used to slice large-size KDP workpieces.</p>
<p>Compared with the aforementioned slicing methods, wire sawing is especially suitable for slicing large KDP crystal materials, primarily due to its lower kerf loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954405413478263">15</xref></sup> There are two types of wire sawing, free abrasive and fixed abrasive. In comparison with fixed abrasive wire sawing, free abrasive wire sawing takes longer time to cut the same size of KDP crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954405413478263">14</xref></sup> It has other problems such as embedment of the abrasive particles into KDP workpiece surfaces and the environmental pollution when disposing the used slurry.</p>
<p>Although wire sawing has many advantages in slicing KDP crystal materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954405413478263">16</xref></sup> there is only one reported study on the subsurface damage in wire sawing of KDP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954405413478263">17</xref></sup> There are no reported studies about the effects of input variables (such as feed rate and diamond grit size) on workpiece surface profile and subsurface damage in wire sawing of KDP.</p>
<p>This article reports an experimental investigation using fixed abrasive wire sawing of KDP. Output parameters include surface roughness, flatness error, parallelism error, and subsurface damage. Effects of wire sawing input variables (feed rate and diamond grit size) on output parameters are investigated. Comparisons of wire sawing and band sawing are also made.</p>

<p>Two types of diamond plated stainless steel wires were obtained from Kejing Automation Equipment Company (Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China). The first type had diamond grit size of 40 µm and wire diameter of 0.3 mm. The second type had diamond grit size of 60 µm and wire diameter of 0.4 mm.

<p>Two input variables (feed rate and diamond grit size) were investigated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954405413478263">Table 2</xref> shows their values used in the wire sawing experiments. Wire speed was 60 m/min. If the wire length was 65 m, the reciprocating period would be 135 s (including the time for the wire to slow down and change its moving direction). The coolant (mineral lubricant) had a viscosity of less than 10 cSt and was supplied to the slicing area with a flow rate of 180 mL/min. In order to slice workpiece with good flatness error, the tension stress was selected to be as close as possible to the maximum allowable tension stress while still could maintain a reasonable wire life. The maximum allowable tension stress was determined by prior experiments. A tension stress higher than the maximum tension allowable would result in an early broken of the wire. Too low a tension stress would result in a longer wire life but a sliced surface with poor flatness error.</p>

<title>Measurement procedures</title>
<p>Surface roughness was measured on sliced surfaces along the feed direction using a surface profilometer (Talysurf CSI 2000; Taylor Hobson Ltd, Leicester, UK). The KDP workpiece was fixed on the worktable of the profilometer. Then the probe (diameter of the styles was 1 µm) was adjusted to touch the workpiece surface with very small contact force. Then, the worktable started to move at a speed of 0.2 mm/s with the cutoff distance of 2.5 mm. The surface roughness in this study was characterized by average surface roughness (Ra) and the peak-to-valley roughness (Rz).</p>
<p>Flatness error measures the deviation of a sliced surface to an ideal surface that is perfectly flat. Parallelism error measures how parallel the two sliced surfaces are. Both flatness and parallelism errors were measured using a PRISMO Navigator Measuring Center (model PRISMO7S-ACC; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at Modern Manufacturing Technology Institute of Dalian University of Technology.</p>
<p>Subsurface damage (including dislocations and cracks) was measured using the cross-sectional polishing and etching methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405413478263">Figure 5</xref>, two sliced surfaces (facing each other) were glued together. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954405413478263">Figure 6</xref>, polishing was done on the surfaces perpendicular to the sliced surfaces and parallel to the workpiece feed direction. The polishing slurry was the mixture of SiO<sub>2</sub> (grits size ranged from 7 to 20 nm) and alcohol. The polishing pad was black finishing leather rotating at a speed of 80 r/min. Surface roughness (Ra) of the polished KDP cross-sectional surface was around 5 nm. The etchant was prepared by mixing 60 mL of glacial acetic acid, 5 mL of deionized water, and 4 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. After etching, damaged areas on the polished surface became visible since their etching rate was faster than undamaged ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954405413478263">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>All sliced surface profiles show a periodical feature. Based on the calculated relationship between feed rate and wire sawing reciprocating period, it was found that the periodical feature was caused by the wire sawing reciprocating action (the wire changed its moving direction). For example, the wire that was 65 m long would need about 135 s to finish a cycle of reciprocation (wire speed was 60 m/min). During this period of time, the workpiece was fed about 1.35 mm (calculated by multiplication of time and feed rate that was 0.6 mm/min), approximately equal to the peak-to-peak distance of the periodical feature, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954405413478263">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<p>In comparison, wire sawing sliced surfaces had large flatness error but lower parallelism error, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954405413478263">Figure 15</xref>. The flatness error of the wire sawing sliced surface was 129 µm when the feed rate was 0.3 mm/min and 106 µm when the feed rate was 0.6 mm/min. The parallelism error between two wire sawing sliced surfaces was 0.232 mm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954405413478263">Figure 16</xref> shows the comparison of flatness and parallelism errors between wire sawing and steel band sawing.</p>

<title>Subsurface damage</title>
<p>The effects of feed rate on subsurface damage in wire sawing (diamond grit size = 60 µm) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954405413478263">Figure 17</xref>. As the feed rate increased from 0.2 to 0.6 mm/min, subsurface damage increased significantly. However, when the feed rate was in the range of 0.6–2 mm/min, subsurface damage remained relatively constant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954405413478263">Figure 18</xref> shows subsurface damage caused by wire sawing (diamond grit size = 40 µm) when feed rate was 0.3 mm/min. The maximum value was 26.7 µm. In comparison, subsurface damage depth caused by wire sawing with larger diamond grit size (60 µm) was much deeper than that with smaller diamond grit size (40 µm).</p>

<p>In order to remove all the subsurface damage and the geometrical imperfection (flatness and parallelism errors) induced by slicing, subsequent machining processes are needed after slicing. The amount of material to be removed would be determined by the largest of subsurface damage, flatness error, and parallelism error. For band sawing, since the largest was parallelism error (1.260 mm), the minimum amount of material that should be removed by the subsequent finishing processes would be 1.260 mm. For wire sawing, the parallelism error was 0.232 mm; therefore, the minimum amount of material that should be removed would be 0.232 mm. In summary, wire sawing requires less material to be removed by subsequent finishing processes, which saves raw crystal material and reduces the machining time after slicing.</p>
