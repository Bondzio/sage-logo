<p>Half of Latina/o entrepreneurs in Zulema Valdez’s study of restaurant owners in Houston, Texas earn $50,000 or less in yearly income. This median largely splits Latinas on the low end from the men who dominate the upper income brackets. Given these modest income prospects and all the difficulties of business ownership, one might question why a Latina, in particular, would open a restaurant. Valdez’s data allow her to address this question, and the answer comes as no surprise: just like everybody else, Latinas want to make money.</p>
<p>The wise approach Valdez employs keeps her from stopping there, and leads her to explain the more interesting process of how early motivations change based on entrepreneurs’ experiences of business ownership from different social locations. In a persuasive use of an intersectional framework, Valdez reveals how privilege and disadvantage are reproduced for business owners, finding evidence of cumulative advantage and disadvantage in entrepreneurs’ goals and motivations. For example, the goal of economic self-sufficiency may propel someone into entrepreneurship, but when she struggles to get a loan, has to lay off employees soon after opening, and needs to bring the kids to the restaurant with her because she cannot spare the money for a caregiver, her goals may change. She may come to prioritize her desire to never again work in a dirty, dangerous wage job—her most likely other option—over the possibility of a solid economic entrepreneurial success. The risks of business ownership, even when odds of a low income are very high, seem worth it not because of the actualization of a previously articulated “rational choice” in which all possible factors are taken into account, but on the basis of experience that is shaped by particular intersections of race, ethnicity, class, and gender within a specific market. The relatively privileged experiences of a white man who easily assembles loans from different sources, uses his college education and family business training to earn $130,000 a year within the first few years of opening his restaurant, operate similarly to shape his reasons for staying in business and his measures of success. Privilege and disadvantage are reproduced in these ways, which transform into markers of “business acumen” in the popular imagination: he obviously does better in business because he is a better businessman.</p>
<p>Like most current intersectional studies, <italic>The New Entrepreneurs</italic> draws readers toward fascinating comparisons like the above, but cannot explain all the patterns and discrepancies that appear. Take high-skilled foreign-born Mexican women, for example. Valdez finds that these women do better, economically, as entrepreneurs than as wage workers. The same is <italic>not</italic> true of high-skilled foreign-born Mexican men. Valdez argues that an intersectional approach helps us understand how someone disadvantaged by particular combinations of race, class, gender, and ethnicity “carry their vulnerable status with them” as entrepreneurs. Given the success of high-skilled foreign-born Mexican women entrepreneurs relative to wage workers, a reader may be left wondering if disadvantage accumulates for this group of entrepreneurs? Is there a reason that high-skilled foreign-born Mexican men do not benefit economically from their gender location, and if so, what is it? In one of those peculiar intersectional twists, Valdez shows that this group of high-skilled women earns more than other women, but they still do not earn as much as high-skilled men—both entrepreneurs and wage workers. The interesting and unforeseen comparison then, might be between high-earning, high-skilled, foreign-born Mexican women <italic>entrepreneurs</italic> and higher-earning, foreign-born Mexican men <italic>wage workers</italic>. Explaining, rather than just pointing out, the sometimes contradictory processes that contribute to disparities between these groups would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Valdez prioritizes Latina/o experiences in this book and confirms that many Latina/os do not situate themselves within American social scientists’ problematic system of racial and ethnic classification. Some Latina/os may, in some situations, set themselves apart from “blacks,” for instance. This does not make them “white.” Valdez is also not content to rest on notions of ethnic entrepreneurship that presuppose harmony and support within ethnically-designated groups, contributing intersectional insights and a less romantic notion of ethnic group affiliation. Since she is dealing with entrepreneurs—those most rugged of individuals—Valdez also dares to cast a critical eye on the ways Latina/o and black entrepreneurs in Houston invoke individualism and color-blind racism, likely to their own detriment. By taking issue with elements of an embedded market approach, ethnic entrepreneurship tropes, a widely shared racial classification system, and even her own study participants’ views on race, ethnicity, and capitalism, Valdez demonstrates her provocative and critical stance.</p>
<p>At the same time, it may be true that we learn more about what is wrong with social science from this book than we do about entrepreneurs. This is not a book that one might pass along to a friend in Houston to illuminate the state of entrepreneurship there, despite its being filled with interesting stories grounded in an accessible discussion of underlying statistical patterns. Valdez’s robust ethnographic approach does not yield surprising findings about entrepreneurs, themselves, but rather prompts her to remix some long-established sociological approaches so that she can account for how the intersecting dynamics of race, ethnicity, class, and gender shape embedded opportunities for success which, when realized, shape entrepreneurs’ very understandings of the success they experience.</p>
