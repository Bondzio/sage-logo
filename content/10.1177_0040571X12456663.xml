<p>Two of the articles in this issue of <italic>Theology</italic> share features in common. The contributions by Alison Hennegan and Frances M. Young are both sermons that are also acts of remembering. Alison Hennegan reflects on the practice of remembering those killed in war. Professor Young’s sermon, published here for the first time, was given at the memorial service for the Revd Professor Daniel W. Hardy in 2008.</p>
<p>Most human cultures remember the past in informal and formal ways. For cultures rooted in Christianity, however, perhaps there is a particular reason why memory plays a central role. In accounts of the institution of the Lord’s Supper by both Paul and Luke, Jesus makes the eucharistic meal an act by which his friends remember him. Christians worship Jesus by remembering him, giving thanks for the gift of his body as Jesus gave thanks for the gift of bread. Such acts of remembering constitute the Church as the body of the one remembered. It is an act of thanksgiving because by his death and resurrection Jesus reconciles sinful humanity to God.</p>
<p>At the end of the last century, the political dimensions of memory in relation to reconciliation were played out in two contexts shaped by the Christian tradition. In Ralf K. Wüstenberg’s fascinating comparative study of <italic>The Political Dimension of Reconciliation</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12456663">1</xref></sup> the contrast between the ways of dealing with the past in Germany after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and approaches taken by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa is described and explored. In both processes remembering the past played a key role in dealing with recent national history following a major political change. But the approaches taken in Germany and South Africa were strikingly different.</p>
<p>In Germany the term used to describe both the process and the sought-after outcome was <italic>aufarbeitung</italic>, a difficult word to translate, which carries the sense of working through the past. This was achieved by providing access to information by opening the files of the Stasi, the East German secret police. Opening one’s file meant, for many, confronting the fact that close friends and family had provided information to the Stasi on one’s activities, often over many years.</p>
<p>In a relatively minor way, the Stasi briefly came into contact with my own life. In the summer of 1989, I undertook a placement as an ordinand in an Evangelische Gemeinde in the GDR, in a small town halfway between Berlin and the Polish border. A charming local policeman visited me during my eight-week stay and we talked about Marxism and religion. When the Gauck Administration (led by a Protestant pastor, Joachim Gauck) began providing access to the Stasi files, the pastor with whom I had stayed in 1989 visited the commission to read his own fat file. Least shocking of his discoveries was that the policeman I met to discuss politics was a Stasi officer who recorded our (on my part rambling and ill-informed) chat. More seriously, my host discovered that his sister had been informing on him and their parents for nearly two decades. This, for her, was not a practical compromise to improve her chances of professional advancement but of genuine Communist political conviction.</p>
<p>The German process of remembering the past was about justice, achieved by giving access to information; no deliberate effort was made to effect reconciliation between friends or families affected by such betrayals. Many prosecutions followed, mostly of former GDR citizens judged to have broken the laws of the Federal Republic of which they had not been citizens at the time of their offences. Justice rather than forgiveness was the intended and actual outcome. Yet, there were many cases where the recovery of the factual truth of what had happened did make possible interpersonal reconciliation. That, certainly, was the outcome of my own friend’s subsequent conversations with the sister who had informed on him.</p>
<p>In South Africa, by contrast, the Truth and Reconciliation Process had built into its aims and methods not only a revealing of the facts but also an acknowledgement of them by perpetrators and victims. Justice was ‘taken up’ into the achievement of reconciliation. This took strikingly ritualized forms, Wüstenberg notes, in which reconciliation was signed between perpetrator and victim by the shaking of hands at the end of the hearing.</p>
<p>Both processes of true remembering have, in different ways, helped Germany and South Africa come to terms politically and perhaps morally with their past. Countries that very consciously change direction without such processes of honest remembering (one thinks of Austria after Nazism, or Spain after Fascism, or Serbia after Milošević) seem to carry festering wounds of their past far longer, finding it hard to become healthy again.</p>
