<abstract>
<p>A growing body of research indicates that the majority of juveniles in the justice system have a diagnosable mental health disorder. With juvenile justice systems typically inadequately equipped to meet the treatment needs of these juveniles, increasing reliance is being placed on intersystem cooperation between the juvenile justice and adolescent mental health systems. The system of care (SOC) model has become a popular strategy for fostering intersystem coordination and collaboration and for diverting youth from the justice system to the mental health system. Local-level data from the first state to implement a SOC model on a statewide basis are analyzed. Interrupted time series analysis is used to assess whether implementation of an SOC is associated with a decrease in out-of-home placements ordered by the juvenile justice system. In 11 of 14 court jurisdictions no significant decreases in court-ordered out-of-home placements associated with SOC implementation are observed. The implications of the findings from this study for juvenile justice policy implementation are discussed.</p>

<p>Policy makers and practitioners have grappled with how to best handle the large numbers of juvenile court–involved youths with mental health disorders. Two frequent responses are to build mental health diagnosis and treatment capacity in the juvenile correctional system or, alternatively, to foster intersystem coordination and collaboration strategies between the juvenile justice and adolescent mental health systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403411414408">Cocozza &amp; Skowyra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411414408">Pullman, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403411414408">Thomas, Gourley, &amp; Mele, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411414408">Wasserman et al., 2003</xref>). This study examines the impact of the second approach—intersystem coordination and collaboration—on out-of-home placements ordered by family court judges.</p>
<p>The system of care (SOC) approach has become a popular strategy for fostering intersystem coordination and collaboration between distinct child-serving systems, including mental health and juvenile justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411414408">Anderson, Wright, Kooreman, Mohr, &amp; Russell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411414408">Stroul &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>). The approach relies on intersystem funding to build programs and services to serve adolescents with mental health disorders, irrespective of the system that they are involved with. The goal is to provide behavioral health treatment options that will serve as appropriate treatment alternatives to those typically relied on when such programs and services are not available, such as placement in juvenile correctional facilities.</p>
<p>This study examined the impact of the implementation of a SOC on out-of-home placements to juvenile correctional facilities ordered by family court judges. The diversion of adolescents with mental health disorders from the juvenile correctional system to the SOC was a policy goal established by officials in New Jersey, the first state to implement a SOC statewide. Using interrupted times series analysis on local-court jurisdiction-level data, we examined whether the introduction of a key component of the SOC, a case management entity for high-acuity-needs adolescents, was associated with a decrease in court-ordered out-of-home placements to juvenile correctional facilities.</p>

<title>Juveniles With Mental Health Disorders in the Juvenile Justice System</title>
<p>Despite a significant decrease over the last 15 years, a high number of juveniles remain involved with the juvenile justice system. Each year more than 2.1 million juveniles are arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403411414408">Puzzanchera, 2009</xref>) and more than 320,000 juveniles are held in secure detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411414408">Harms, 2003</xref>). Annually, courts with jurisdiction over juvenile cases adjudicate nearly 1.7 million juveniles delinquent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403411414408">Puzzanchera &amp; Sickmund, 2008</xref>). On any given day more than 104,000 juveniles are in an out-of-home placement ordered by a juvenile court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403411414408"><italic>OJJDP Statistical Briefing Book</italic>, 2008</xref>). Juvenile justice processing statistics provide only part of the picture, however. The majority of juveniles within the juvenile justice system endure an additional complication—mental health disorders.</p>
<p>A growing body of research provides evidence that the prevalence of mental health disorders among juveniles in the juvenile justice system is considerably higher than it is among juveniles in the general population. In fact, evidence indicates that whereas approximately 20% of American children and adolescents have a diagnosable mental disorder, a majority of juveniles in the juvenile justice system have diagnosable mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403411414408">Soler, 2002</xref>). A study of 1,829 juveniles who were arrested and detained in Cook County, Illinois, for example, found that nearly two thirds (66.3%) of men and nearly three quarters (73.8%) of women met the diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411414408">Teplin, Abram, McClelland, Dulcan, &amp; Mericle, 2002</xref>). A 2004 study of 320 juveniles committed to secure correctional facilities in two states found that 67.2% of youths had one or more diagnosable mental health disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411414408">Wasserman, Ko, &amp; McReynolds, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403411414408">Skowyra and Cocozza (2007</xref>, p. vii) found that “up to 70 percent” of juveniles in the juvenile justice system have mental health disorders with “at least 20 percent experiencing disorders so severe that their ability to function is significantly impaired.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403411414408">Goldstrom, Jaiquan, Henderson, Male, and Manderscheid (2000)</xref> have also concluded that 20% of youth in the juvenile justice system have a serious mental health disorder.</p>
<p>To some, the fact that so many juveniles with mental health disorders are in the juvenile justice system in the first place is attributable to the lack of appropriate treatment resources in the children’s mental health system. Pullman et al. (p. 376) conclude “because of a lack of available and accessible mental health programs, in many regions of the country, the juvenile justice system has become the default mental health service provider for youth with severe problems.” Yet, if children with mental health disorders are forced into the juvenile justice system because of a lack of mental health treatment resources, the juvenile justice system is generally ill equipped to provide appropriate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411414408">Pullman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403411414408">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). A national survey of availability of mental health services in juvenile justice facilities found that fewer than half provided services other than mental health screening and medication oversight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403411414408">Goldstrom et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In recognition of the disparity between the need for mental health treatment among juveniles in the juvenile justice system and the ability of that system to provide adequate treatment, some have recommended improvements to the juvenile justice system’s capacity to appropriately respond to the juveniles with mental health disorders. In April, 2002, for example, a consensus conference of national experts on juvenile justice and mental health recommended that the juvenile justice system implement mental health screening and assessments and provide staff training in reliable and valid screening and assessment procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411414408">Wasserman et al., 2003</xref>, p. 758).</p>
<p>Others have focused on improving the capacity of public mental health systems to respond to the mental health needs of juveniles who would otherwise be, or who currently are, in the juvenile justice system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403411414408">Thomas et al. (2005</xref>, p. 156) suggest that appropriate community-based behavioral health care could have a preventative effect wherein “many youth would have their behavioral health disorders identified and treated before their behaviors resulted in the juvenile justice system’s involvement.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403411414408">Janku and Yan (2009</xref>, p. 415), noting the dearth of appropriate mental health treatment resources in the juvenile justice system, conclude that “the only alternative may be to order treatment in the mental health system.”</p>
<p>An emerging trend for meeting the treatment needs of juveniles in the juvenile justice system is to focus on intersystem collaboration, rather than the development of specialized services in one system. In this approach, juvenile justice and children’s mental health systems work together to jointly meet the treatment needs of juveniles with mental disorders whose conduct also raises public safety concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411414408">Pullman et al. (2006</xref>, p. 388) found that juveniles served through an intersystem collaborative approach “were less likely to recidivate than youth receiving mental health and juvenile justice services in a traditional manner.” They concluded, “There is broad agreement that multiagency collaboration among child-serving agencies (including mental health, juvenile justice, education, and others) is required to overcome limitations of unilateral treatment—that is, treatment provided through one agency without coordination with other service providers—and provides the array of services needed to effectively treat offenders with mental health needs” (p. 377).</p>
<p>An evaluation of an intersystem collaborative in Illinois that provided linkages to community-based mental health providers for youths arrested and detained found that “by linking youths with significant mental health needs to existing community-based services, it appears possible both to ameliorate psychopathology and to reduce delinquency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411414408">Lyons, Griffin, Quintenz, Jenuwine, &amp; Shasha, 2003</xref>, p. 1629). In a review of the issues surrounding youth with mental health disorders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403411414408">Cocozza and Skowyra (2000</xref>, p. 7) conclude,
<disp-quote>
<p>Cross-system collaboration must form the basis for all solutions. The field is beginning to understand that the needs and issues surrounding individuals with mental health disorders cannot be placed at the doorstep of any single agency or system. . . . Although an individual system can help to improve the care and treatment of youth with mental illness in the juvenile justice system, effective solutions require that multiple relevant agencies coordinate and integrate strategies and services.</p>

<title>The System of Care Model</title>
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has endorsed a SOC approach to providing services to children and adolescents with mental health disorders that has become a popular strategy for fostering intersystem coordination and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411414408">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411414408">Stroul &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>). The SOC approach involves blended funding from multiple agencies (e.g., mental health and juvenile justice) and the development of an organized and easily accessible array of behavioral healthcare services. Emphasis is placed on genuine family and child involvement, individualized service plans, a focus on strengths (rather than deficits), and cultural competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411414408">Stroul &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The design of the SOC model is based on the belief that the development of a continuum of community-based treatment options is usually necessary to address gaps in services and that “the lack of coordination between agencies seriously limits the effectiveness of individual service components” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411414408">Stroul &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>, p. v). A core principle of the SOC model is that existing systems have an “overreliance on more expensive and more restrictive services than are actually needed” and that out-of-home placements can be reduced through the provision of the SOC’s comprehensive continuum of community-based services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411414408">Stroul &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>, p. v). The SOC approach is popular. SAMSHA began funding SOC planning and implementation in 1997; by 2004, 45 communities were implementing systems of care with SAMSHA funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403411414408">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>New Jersey’s System of Care Implementation</title>
<p>In February 2001, New Jersey began to implement a child and adolescent behavioral health system modeled on the SOC approach; this was the first effort to implement a SOC on a statewide basis. Key system components included a case management entity for children with low acuity needs, a case management entity for children with high-acuity needs (case management organizations or CMOs), an around-the-clock on-site crisis response system (mobile response and stabilization services [MRSS]), and family service organizations to provide peer support to consumers and their families. Implementation was rolled out on a court-jurisdiction-by-court-jurisdiction basis, with some court jurisdictions (single- or multiple-county family court areas) implementing separate system components at varying points in time. In January 2006 the last three court jurisdictions began operations of this system of care model.</p>
<p>This statewide implementation was New Jersey’s first attempt to implement a child and adolescent behavioral healthcare system. A concerted focus of system design and implementation was on intersystem coordination and collaboration. Planning documents for the system explicitly stated that the new system was intended to serve juveniles with mental health disorders who had heretofore been served by the juvenile justice system. A focus “on children and families with persistent difficulties, serious emotional or behavioral disturbances and multiple system involvement, particularly children in, or at imminent risk for, placement outside their home or community” and diversion of children with mental health disorders into the SOC from the juvenile justice system was a key aim of New Jersey’s SOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411414408">New Jersey Department of Human Services, 2000</xref>, p. ii).</p>
<p>CMOs were the case management entities specifically created to develop and provide community-based treatment plans for high-acuity-needs youths who were at imminent risk of out-of-home placement. Standardized assessment tools were used on all youths at intake in order to determine acuity levels and to determine which youths would be referred to CMOs. Each CMO was contracted to serve 200 youths. As each court jurisdiction began implementation of the SOC, a minimum of one third of the admissions to CMOs, the care management entity for juveniles with high-acuity needs, had to come directly from the juvenile justice system. Thus, each CMO, when fully subscribed, was required to serve 66 youths at risk of out-of-home placement in juvenile correctional facilities.</p>
<p>This study examines whether a key policy goal of New Jersey’s SOC initiative was successful. Specifically, we explore whether implementation of New Jersey’s child and adolescent mental health system was associated with a decrease in out-of-home-placements in juvenile correctional facilities (both residential group centers and secure correctional facilities) ordered by family court judges, as would be expected if New Jersey’s SOC successfully diverted juveniles with high-acuity mental health disorders from the juvenile justice system to the SOC. By assessing, at the superior court jurisdiction level, whether the implementation of one key component of the SOC, the CMO, was associated with a reduction in out-of-home placements to juvenile correctional facilities, this study examines whether the SOCs intersystem collaborative approach reduced the demand for out-of-home juvenile correctional services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0887403411414408" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To test New Jersey’s SOC initiative, it was necessary to obtain monthly data on the number of juvenile correctional out-of-home placements (including orders to residential group centers and secure correctional facilities operated by the New Jersey Juvenile Justice Commission [JJC]) for each court jurisdiction in New Jersey. Monthly time series data for the period January 1999 through December 2009 of JJC out-of-home placements ordered by the family court were obtained for each New Jersey court jurisdiction from the New Jersey JJC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403411414408">1</xref></sup> New Jersey’s SOC was implemented at different times across all 15 court jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The use of the monthly data coupled with the desire to examine the effect of SOC implementation on the monthly out-of-home placements motivated the utilization of a multiple interrupted time series design. The multiple interrupted time series design is attractive for a few reasons. First, the staggered implementation of the SOC across court jurisdictions allows for a more powerful test of the effects of the initiative on out-of-home placements. The multiple-site approach, coupled with the various implementations across court jurisdictions, allows for greater minimization of threats to validity than, for example, one statewide analysis with state-level data or an analysis conducted on one court jurisdiction. The threat of local history is minimized by such a design by virtue of the fact that the effect of the CMO on out-of-home placements was tested across multiple independent locales. To our knowledge, there was no global historical event, at the state or national levels, which would have compromised the validity of the findings in this study either. Selection bias as a threat is minimized by the fact that, with one exception as noted, all of the court jurisdictions within New Jersey were used for the analyses. No changes to instrumentation were made during the data collection process within any court jurisdiction. There is no reason to believe that testing effects would be more pronounced in one court jurisdiction, or multiple court jurisdictions, over others. Maturation should not have contaminated the results in any way.</p>
<p>One potential shortcoming, however, is that court jurisdiction–level data did not make it possible to assess the acuity of the juveniles coming into contact with the juvenile court in each court jurisdiction. Although an aggregate measure of juvenile acuity, per month in each court jurisdiction, may have correlated with the dependent variable, such data were not available for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0887403411414408">2</xref></sup> The univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was thus considered to model out-of-home placements in each court jurisdiction and to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the SOC.</p>
<p>Systems of care were implemented on a rolling court-jurisdiction-by-court-jurisdiction schedule over a period of 84 months until statewide implementation was completed. All system of care components were contracted for by the state’s child and adolescent mental health agency using identical contract provisions; there were no significant differences in system components between jurisdictions. Within court jurisdictions, individual components of the SOC were sometimes also implemented on a rolling schedule. The CMOs, the case management entity for high-acuity-needs adolescents, were used to construct the independent variable in this study.</p>
<p>The independent variable, or the intervention term, for each court jurisdiction was coded in such a way as to capture the unique characteristics of the implementation of a CMO in that court jurisdiction. Although each CMO was contracted to serve 200 youths, the number of months taken to reach that full level of service varied for each CMO. In each court jurisdiction the independent variable was coded “0” throughout the series until the first month that the CMO began accepting clients and “1” in the month that the CMO became fully subscribed with 200 clients and in every month thereafter. Intervening months were equal to fractions of the “ramp-up period” such that a county that took 5 months for their CMO to become fully subscribed had “0s” in all the months leading up to CMO implementation, .2 in Month 1, .4 in Month 2, .6 in Month 3, .8 in Month 4, and up to Month 5 when the independent variable coding became and remained “1” for the remainder of the series. The interrupted time series analyses allowed us to determine whether the implementation of the CMOs was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the number of correctional out-of-home placements ordered by the family court.</p>

<sec id="section5-0887403411414408">
<title>Analytical Protocol</title>
<p>Time series analysis is an iterative process of model identification, model estimation, and model evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411414408">McCleary, Hay, Meidinger, &amp; McDowall, 1980</xref>). The model identification stage began with an assessment of stationarity for the series of out-of-home placements in each court jurisdiction. The assessment for stationarity in the mean began with a visual inspection of the out-of-home placements in each jurisdiction through time. A stationary series for out-of-home placements would feature monthly values that randomly fluctuate about the average out-of-home placements in each jurisdiction. Unit root testing was also performed using the augmented Dickey–Fuller test to assess stationarity. If a series exhibited nonstationarity, the series was differenced (or integrated) to an order, “<italic>d</italic>.” Because arrests for juveniles over the past decade have followed a downward trend, decreasing 26.4% from 1999 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403411414408">New Jersey State Police, 2000</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403411414408">2009</xref>), a trend estimate was included in the unit root tests for each court jurisdiction. If there was evidence of trend, the series was detrended using least squares regression. Following the assessment for stationarity and trend, the series was then examined using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots on the integrated (or nonintegrated) series to determine whether the series exhibited autoregressive, moving average, or mixed autoregressive moving average behavior and to what degree (as reflected in the values assigned to <italic>p</italic> or <italic>q</italic> by the researcher during model estimation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0887403411414408">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Model estimation of the univariate time series model with the CMO intervention term was carried out using values for “<italic>p</italic>” and “<italic>q</italic>” as determined by the results shown in the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots during the model identification stage. The criteria for a model to proceed to the model validation stage included statistically significant values (i.e., <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05<italic>)</italic> for the autoregressive estimate, “φ,” and/or the moving average estimate, “θ,” parameters and whether each parameter estimate ranged between −1 and 1. (e.g., McDowall et al., 1980, p. 47).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0887403411414408">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Model validation was performed using graphical and statistical procedures. The graphical procedures began with a time series plot of residuals. The time series plot of residuals was examined for consistency in variance about the mean and a constant mean. White noise tests were performed on the residuals using a cumulative periodogram with a corresponding Bartlett’s statistic B and probability value and Portmanteau Q statistic and probability value. Visual inspections of ordered residuals using the Q norm plot and a histogram were also undertaken. If the residuals exhibited white noise, if the residuals were normally distributed (or more so relative to alternative models) as evidenced by quantiles of the residuals plotted against quantiles of the standard normal distribution, and the cumulative periodogram revealed no problems with respect to remaining seasonal behavior in the series, the model was retained and the results were reported. If the model validation process indicated a poor model, alternative values for the autoregressive and/or moving average components were used and the estimation procedure was repeated. Model validation results across specifications were then compared using the methods described above in addition to the value of the mean squared error; that is, the specification with the smallest mean squared error was preferred over alternative specifications.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All of the series for the court jurisdictions, with the exception of the Cumberland/Gloucester/Salem court jurisdiction, appeared to drift randomly about a constant mean. In Essex, Hudson, Passaic, and Union, there appeared to be a negative trending behavior. The results of the unit root tests revealed that all of the court jurisdictions had stationary series.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0887403411414408">5</xref></sup> With the exception of the first five court jurisdictions, all of the court jurisdictions exhibited negative drift. Thus, given the lack of a unit root and the lack of drift in the series for the first five court jurisdictions, these out-of-home placement series did not need to be detrended via least squares estimation. The remaining nine court jurisdictions were detrended using least squares regression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0887403411414408">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0887403411414408">7</xref></sup> Following the assessment of stationarity and the trending behavior in each court jurisdiction, autocorrelation function plots and partial autocorrelation function plots were generated to assist in determining whether any remaining autoregressive, moving average, or mixed (i.e., autoregressive <italic>and</italic> moving average) behavior remained within the series.</p>
<p>The interrupted time series analyses for each court jurisdiction were undertaken with constraints imposed on orders of “<italic>p</italic>” and “<italic>q</italic>” following an inspection of autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function plots. The interrupted time series analyses for each court jurisdiction are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403411414408">Table 1</xref>. Statistically significant reductions in out-of-home placements occurred in three court jurisdictions: Burlington, Camden, and Hunterdon/Sussex/Warren. The Camden court jurisdiction had the largest predicted reduction in out-of-home placements during the CMO intervention period (i.e., −6.632). Smaller reductions of −1.053 and −1.001 were predicted in the Burlington and Hunterdon/Somerset/Warren court jurisdictions, respectively. The remaining court jurisdictions were examined using autoregressive models and moving average models, each of various orders. None of the remaining court jurisdictions had interruption terms that approached a substantial reduction in predicted out-of-home placements and none of the interruption terms were statistically significant.</p>

<p>Plots of the predicted out-of-home placements for the three court jurisdictions with statistically significant reductions in out-of-home placements, along with the starting point and ending point of the CMO intervention period in each court jurisdiction, are featured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403411414408">Figure 1</xref>. The plot for the Burlington court jurisdiction in the postimplementation period reveals that out-of-home placements were predicted to remain fairly stable over nearly 6 years. The Hunterdon/Sussex/Warren court jurisdiction required that a least squares regression be estimated on the out-of-home placements variable to detrend the series. The series, however, still appeared to retain a small amount of negative trend as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403411414408">Figure 1</xref>. Lastly, the plot of predicted values for the Camden court jurisdiction reveals a slight upward drift in the preimplementation period, followed by a downward drift in the 4-year postimplementation period.</p>

<p>Model validation for the results in all jurisdictions began with a time series plot of the residuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0887403411414408">8</xref></sup> Given that time series analyses assume a constant mean and variance, we examined each of the plots for random, constant variation about a fixed mean. The residual plot for the Burlington county jurisdiction appeared to exhibit level stationarity but not variance stationarity. In the Camden jurisdiction, the residuals near 2007 begin to decline away from “0” through the year 2010. Finally, the Hunterdon/Sussex/Warren jurisdiction residual plot demonstrated a slight quadratic shape about the mean. The residuals in these three jurisdictions were subject to additional scrutiny including white noise tests. The cumulative periodograms for the three jurisdictions indicated that the residuals are within the error bands about the reference line. These results were indicative of white noise (or random) error variation as assumed in time series analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0887403411414408">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all, three jurisdictions exhibited statistically significant reductions in out-of-home placements. Although we did raise one potential shortcoming in our data and corresponding analytical protocol—our inability to control for the acuity of juveniles within each jurisdiction—we believe that such a control would not have changed the results of our study substantially. In other words, had we instead found that the majority of jurisdictions exhibited statistically significant reductions in out-of-home placements, we would then be more concerned about our inability to control for juvenile acuity within each jurisdiction. Three jurisdictions with statistically significant reductions, and varied ones at that, seem to indicate to us that overall the evidence points to null results.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Beginning in June 2002 and continuing through December 2007, New Jersey began the first statewide implementation of the system of care model of child and adolescent mental health services. A key policy goal of this system was that juveniles with mental health issues, irrespective of whether they were primarily involved with the mental health, child protective, or juvenile justice systems, would have timely access to a continuum of appropriate and effective behavioral health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411414408">New Jersey Department of Human Services, 2000</xref>, p. ii). Prior to the introduction of the SOC, New Jersey did not have a separate and distinct mental health system tailored to the needs of children and adolescents.</p>
<p>The expectation of New Jersey policy makers was that the SOC would better serve some juveniles enmeshed in the juvenile justice system when their illegal behavior was a manifestation of a mental illness. Specifically, the expectation was that such juveniles who had previously been sentenced by family court judges to out-of-home juvenile correctional placements (both residential group homes and secure correctional facilities) would instead be referred to the SOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411414408">New Jersey Department of Human Services, 2000</xref>). This study examined whether implementation in each court jurisdiction of the core SOC component most likely to affect such juveniles, case management organizations (CMOs) for coordinating services for high-acuity-needs juveniles, resulted in a reduction of out-of-home correctional placements ordered by family court judges. We found that CMO introduction was associated with a statistically significant reduction in such court-ordered juvenile correctional out-of-home placements in only 3 of 14 court jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Why was the policy goal of the SOC introduction apparently not achieved in more court jurisdictions? Although there is no empirically supported answer to that question derived from the present research, we can speculate. As the SOC was implemented, an effort was made to ensure that juveniles were drawn into the new system equally from the mental health, child protective, and juvenile justice systems. Often, however, juveniles in the justice system present with difficult-to-manage, disruptive behavior that makes them unattractive to mental health service providers. That is often why they are in the juvenile justice system in the first place—they have exhibited harmful and destructive behavior.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403411414408">Pumariega et al. (1999)</xref> conclude that mental health providers are often hesitant to accept responsibility for juveniles who are involved with the justice system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403411414408">Skowyra and Cocozza (2007)</xref> note a tension between the juvenile justice and mental health systems and a reluctance for either system to take responsibility for a juvenile who is involved with the other system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411414408">Redding (1999)</xref> has also noted the reluctance of mental health systems to serve justice system–involved youths. Given this issue, as the SOC was rolled out, there may have been an attempt to focus on more easily served clients that came from the mental health and child protective systems.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the phenomena of “net-widening” may have occurred with the implementation of the SOC. This phenomenon occurs when new dispositional or treatment alternatives, such as those offered by the SOC, are introduced and are used with a population they were not intended to serve. This “net-widening” effect of new treatment programs not being used for the population who they were designed to serve is a common finding in juvenile justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403411414408">Decker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411414408">Ezell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411414408">Tonry, 1998</xref>). As the SOC was implemented in each court jurisdiction, the policy goal of including juvenile justice system involved youths may have been met, but those included in the SOC could have been lower-acuity-needs juveniles. This would have meant that easier-to-serve, low-acuity-needs youths from the juvenile justice system were selected, leaving the higher-acuity-needs juveniles in the juvenile justice system to be served. It is, however, the high-acuity-needs juveniles who are most likely to be ordered to an out-of-home placement by family court judges. We, unfortunately, were not able to control for the typical level of acuity exhibited by the juveniles within each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of the SOC in each court jurisdiction presented family court judges with an array of new dispositional options that previously were not available to them. The possibility exists that judges in the 11 court jurisdictions where there were no significant reductions in correctional out-of-home placements were reluctant to call upon these new resources until they were confident that the services were appropriate and effective. Developing a feeling of familiarity and acceptance of new services may take time and may be based on judges making trial referrals to such services to assess the quality of services provided.</p>
<p>In an effort to determine why the diversion of youths from juvenile justice out-of-home placements did not occur at the anticipated level, we interviewed the Director and Deputy Director of New Jersey’s Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS), the agency responsible for implementation of the SOC. Both administrators noted that though new CMOs were required to execute memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with an array of what they termed “system partners” (e.g., child protective services, school officials, service providers, etc.), they were not required to execute MOUs with family courts. This was characterized as an oversight, but they both felt that this omission left an impression that coordination with the juvenile justice system was not as important as coordination with other child serving systems (N. Robinson &amp; B. Hancock, personal communication, April 26, 2010).</p>
<p>Both DCBHS administrators also noted that all of the people hired as executive directors of the CMOs had clinical backgrounds and came from mental health agencies. None had experience with the juvenile courts. The CMO directors’ lack of knowledge about, and familiarity with, family courts made coordination and collaboration between the SOC and the courts more difficult, the DCBHS administrators thought. They cited as an example a CMO director in one court jurisdiction who, at an initial meeting with the jurisdiction’s family court judge and court staff, announced that she would be deciding the dispositional orders for CMO-involved youths who were court involved. The judge was so upset that he refused to include the CMO director in subsequent meetings (N. Robinson &amp; B. Hancock, personal communication, April 26, 2010).</p>
<p>Both DCBHS administrators noted two issues about family court judges that they felt would explain the failure of the SOC implementation to draw juveniles out of juvenile correctional out-of-home placements. First, they felt that the judiciary’s system of rotating judges among the various court divisions (family, criminal, civil, etc.) meant that many judges lacked “training, knowledge, and understanding about handling delinquent youth,” resulting in the SOC being a resource that was not fully or appropriately used initially by the family court judges. Second, both DCBHS administrators said that judicial “buy-in” to the new SOC was lacking and that many family court judges had to be coaxed into experimenting with the SOC (N. Robinson &amp; B. Hancock, personal communication, April 26, 2010).</p>
<p>We also asked the DCBHS administrators if the three court jurisdictions in which the SOC policy goal was apparently achieved had some key characteristic(s) that differentiate them from the court jurisdictions where there was no significant reduction of juvenile correctional out-of-home placements associated with the introduction of the SOC’s CMOs. They noted that Burlington was the pilot jurisdiction for SOC implementation and received considerable attention and resources as the SOC rolled out. They also noted that Camden was under intense pressure from the Office of the Child Advocate, the state’s independent child services ombudsman, to reduce detention center crowding. This pressure, they felt, made it more likely that the judges in that jurisdiction would have embraced the services offered by the SOC as alternatives to detention placement. Last, they noted that the Hunterdon/Somerset/Warren jurisdiction typically placed lower-acuity children in out-of-home placements than other court jurisdictions. They felt that the community-based alternatives offered by the SOC were more likely to be seen as appropriate for these lower-acuity children than for higher-acuity-needs children from other court jurisdictions (N. Robinson &amp; B. Hancock, personal communication, April 26, 2010).</p>
<p>Clearly a major policy goal of New Jersey’s SOC, the diversion of youth with mental health disorders from juvenile correctional placements into appropriate behavioral health programs and services, was not achieved on the scale anticipated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411414408">Lin (2000</xref>, p. 35) describes the period when policies go from formulation to implementation “as a period when things go wrong: when a promising policy gets derailed because of actors with divergent interests, because the policy mandate is unclear, or because of a lack of resources or political support.” In this case, inadequate attention to the interface between two child-serving systems that are often in conflict—the juvenile justice and child mental health systems—in the implementation of New Jersey’s first child and adolescent mental health system seems to have contributed to the failure to meet this key policy goal.</p>
<p>This inadequate attention appears manifest in the selection of CMO personnel, in the requirements for development of memorandum of understanding by the CMOs and in a failure to educate family court judges and get them to feel comfortable with the new resources that New Jersey’s SOC presented to them. With respect to the latter issue, judicial “buy-in,” it is quite possible that this developed over time. This study tested a gradual and sustained reduction in out-of-home placements in New Jersey court jurisdictions. It is possible that if judges experimented and began to feel comfortable with the resources the SOC provided over time, a delayed impact may have occurred. Further research would be necessary to assess that possibility.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The fact that 11 of 14 court jurisdictions did not experience significant reductions in out-of-home placements in juvenile correctional facilities when the CMOs were implemented represents, in our view, evidence that a key policy goal for New Jersey’s SOC—diversion of youth with mental health disorders from the juvenile justice system into the SOC—did not occur. Despite the explicit focus of this intersystem goal at the policy level, our interviews with the administrators overseeing the SOC indicate that insufficient focus and attention were paid to the coordination and collaboration between juvenile justice and mental health systems at the implementation level. This highlights a key issue in policy implementation—the frequent divergence between policies as designed and policies as implemented.</p>
<p>As New Jersey implemented its first child and adolescent mental health system, a major undertaking in its own right, it also attempted to integrate services between two often conflicting child-serving systems—the juvenile justice and mental health systems. New Jersey’s failure to achieve this policy goal highlights that importance of devoting significant attention to the details of implementation, including resources, mandates, and training, to maximize the chances that the policy as implemented closely resembles the policy as designed. In addition, the failure of New Jersey’s SOC to achieve this major policy goal highlights the importance of building an evaluation component into an implementation plan, something that New Jersey did not do. An ongoing policy evaluation could have identified this shortfall early in the implementation period and allowed for a quick readjustment of the policy implementation plan.</p>
<p>Our research utilized aggregate-level data at the court jurisdiction level. Additional research utilizing individual-level data, including measures of juvenile’s mental health diagnoses and acuity, is needed to more specifically determine if, and if so, how, the handling of court-involved juveniles with mental health disorders was affected by the implementation of the SOC. In addition, as implementation moves further along, additional research might determine whether a delayed impact was felt as a result of SOC implementation.</p>

<p>The letters “<italic>p</italic>”, “<italic>d</italic>”, and “<italic>q</italic>” represent the three structural parameters in the univariate ARIMA time series model, and they govern the type of process used to represent the behavior of the dependent variable through time. The first parameter “<italic>p</italic>” represents the autoregressive component. The second parameter <italic>“d”</italic> represents the degree of differencing (or integration) that is performed on a series, if necessary, to make it stationary. The third parameter <italic>“q”</italic> represents the moving average parameter. Repeated time series observations are said to exhibit autoregressive behavior if the most recent observation is influenced by the error term of the preceding observation; the influence of preceding observations, however, begins to geometrically decline over time meaning that the error terms from previous observations have an exponentially decreasing influence on the current observation. Moving average behavior, on the other hand, represents a one-time shock to the observations in the series and/or a seasonal shock to the observations in the series (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411414408">McCleary et al., 1980</xref>, p. 61). A time series model can also be mixed, meaning that the series exhibits autoregressive behavior and moving average behavior.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0887403411414408">
<label>4.</label>
<p>The point here is that autoregressive processes and moving average processes share a “duality” (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403411414408">Gottman, 1981</xref>, pp. 123-124); specifically, autoregressive processes and moving average processes algebraically can be shown to be representations of each other when the autoregressive and moving average parameter estimates exceed −1 or 1. Thus, in order for autoregressive and moving average processes to not make a redundant contribution to a series, the estimate for the autoregressive component “φ” and/or the estimate of the moving average component “θ” must range between −1 and 1.</p></fn>

<p>The linear regression procedure consisted of estimating a least squares regression model of the total out-of-home placement for each court jurisdiction regressed on time. A new detrended series was then constructed by subtracting the predicted values generated from the least squares regression model from the observed out-of-home placements for each month in the series and the resulting residuals were then used in all subsequent steps beginning with model identification.</p></fn>

<p>Additional white noise tests included Bartlett’s statistic and the Portmanteau Q statistic. The results of these tests for all three jurisdictions indicated that the residuals were white noise. Finally, quantiles of the ordered residuals were plotted against quantiles of the standard normal distribution. The residuals for the Burlington jurisdiction exhibited an asymmetric distribution against the standard normal distribution reference line; thus, inferential conclusions drawn from Burlington jurisdiction should be cautiously interpreted. The Hunterdon/Sussex/Warren jurisdiction exhibited points in the tails of the distribution that deviated from the reference line.</p></fn>
