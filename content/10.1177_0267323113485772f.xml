<p>The main title of this book derives from a phrase used by John W Work III in his introductory address to an afternoon concert held in May 1941 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Fisk University. The reference is to everyday vernacular music, and in the book Stephen Wade delves deep into this music as it is represented in a selection of field recordings made in North America between 1934 and 1942. As with those who performed at the Fisk concert, the people featured in these recordings were locally based amateur musicians. They played largely within their own communities. Although two or three of them had previously been recorded, most of them were making their first, and only, recordings. This was also their first opportunity for presenting their music for posterity through a specifically modern form of communications technology. They were included in an earlier collection curated by Wade, <italic>A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings</italic>, released on Rounder in 1997. That CD totalled 30 tracks; this book focuses on just 13 of them. The vernacular status of the people recorded has presumably been an important criterion in their selection, with professional folk performers like David ‘Honeyboy’ Edwards, Sonny Terry and Woody Guthrie included in the 1997 CD, but not featuring here. Another significant aspect of these performances, which again seems to have influenced their selection for study in the book, is that they have become widely known in other forms, such as orchestral works, dramas and even commercial jingles. As a selection they clearly represent a cross-slice of vernacular creativity in early 20th-century America, and that alone merits their choice as the basis for chapter-length treatments. They show us the vibrancy as well as diversity of that creativity as it emerged from the rhythms and textures of common experience, while also marking out the ways in which each performer made the song or tune their own.</p>
<p>With his baker’s dozen of songs and instrumentals, Wade presents us with detail not only about the performers and their music but also about those who remember them, their families and fellow musicians, their local social and cultural contexts. Dedicated investigation on Wade’s part has been necessary because for the most part the performers disappeared back into their personal lives once the phonograph recordings had been made, returning to what we may call the obscurity of close localities, with intimate familiarity being the insider experience of those who lived within them. It is from obscurity that for the most part Wade had to rescue them from. What is wonderful, and in some ways surprising, is how much information and insight Wade brings to bear on both the songs and their singers, or musicians and their tunes. He begins with the story of WH Stepp, whose 1942 fiddle recording of ‘Bonaparte’s Retreat’ was incorporated, almost note for note, in the score of Aaron Copland’s <italic>Rodeo.</italic> Alan Lomax found Stepp to be ‘the best fiddler I have heard in Ky [i.e. Kentucky]’, and this is borne out in Stepp’s masterful transformation of the tune from march tempo to that of a hoedown. It is this which provides a central musical element in the cowgirl’s romantic triumph over the ranch-owner’s daughter during the square-dance Cinderella-like ending of the ballet that became known as <italic>Rodeo</italic>, though of course Copland recapitulated the tune within a philharmonic framework, bringing in tympani and horns, reeds and brass, xylophone and wood blocks. Added to this extension of its cultural identity but in a steep descent, Stepp’s melody was also incorporated into a recent TV commercial for beef steaks.</p>
<p>Wade has a fascinating chapter on the history of the song ‘Rock Island Line’ and its various transmutations across commercial and spiritual value frameworks, one line of which leads from the 1934 Arkansas State Penitentiary recording, centred around Kelly Pace, through to Leadbelly’s various embellishments and then its centrality in the British skiffle movement via the massive hit Lonnie Donegan had with it. Quintessential skiffle was manifest in the Nashville Washboard Band’s rendition of ‘Soldier’s Joy’, recorded at Fisk University in 1934, played with washboard, banjo-mandolin, guitar, lard-can bass, frying pans, tin plates and bell. Unlike a European string quartet that seamlessly blends different elements of sound into a unified whole, Wade points out that ‘their coruscating performance’ of this late 18th-century British fiddle tune was due to its combination of disparate timbres and contrasting rhythmic shifts (pp. 139, 144). Olly Wilson has called this combination the heterogeneous sound ideal in African-American music, and this particular recording, which demonstrates that ideal so effectively, is an example-in-miniature of modern transatlantic musical exchange and transfiguration.</p>
<p>In other chapters we hear the back stories to, and discover the broader contexts of, such songs as ‘Another Man Done Gone’ (sung by Vera Hall), ‘Shortenin’ Bread’ (lead singing role taken by Ora Dell Graham) and ‘Ain’t No Grave Can Hold My Body Down’ (given vocal splendour by Bozie Sturdivant). These are now all well-known pieces, having entered into much wider circulation than was the case when they were initially recorded. For example, over the 70 years since Hall’s first recording of ‘Another Man Done Gone’ for Lomax’s disc cutter, it has been covered by many other performers, from Odetta and Johnny Cash to the Carolina Chocolate Drops. Yet there are at least three aspects of Hall’s performance of this song that are quite distinctive. First, it is unlikely that these subsequent performers would have entered into the song in the same way as Hall, who spoke of sounding it before she caught the words, that is to say remembering sounds before turning to vocal expression. Second, Hall was a localized performer, singing mainly in home and church, while at the same time finding audiences well beyond her own community. That kind of cultural location, between local community and far broader, hugely diverse points of aural reception, seems now to be characteristic, if not specific to that early- to mid-20th-century period, and to have become increasingly less likely ever since, at least in the West. Third, Hall’s version, as Ward makes clear, resonated with local circumstances, but also has a reflective, spiritual quality to it that ‘conveys a message akin to a civil rights anthem’ (p. 172). This quality is not represented in most recorded versions of the song, and there are now over fifty of them. In Vera Hall’s own poignant words, ‘any songs that we sing have reference to the life that we live’ (cited p. 178).</p>
<p>Twelve chapters cover the 13 songs dealt with in the book, and across them all there is much to take pleasure in. The songs are not only studied in the social contexts from where they originated and along the tracks they have variously travelled, but are also closely related to vivid profiles of the musicians involved, most of them unheralded yet still part of a range of vibrant traditions of musicking that, in these remarkable examples from them, transcend any commercialist exploitation or intent. Wade’s writing is lucid and accessible, while deeply in tune with its material; he wears his years of research lightly but has meticulously woven every stitch of his scholarly garment. The book is accompanied by a CD of the 13 songs and a wide mixture of well-chosen illustrations, many of which are themselves the fruit of Wade’s research. Looking back at the initial Rounder album, one might wish for more information on the reasons for excluding the other 17 tracks from close scrutiny, or at least a fuller outline of his reasons for selecting what he has as the main objects of focus. Yet that should not detract from this excellent example of musical scholarship in which Wade not only reconstructs key elements of vernacular creativity, but also shows how, over the past century or so, they have become part of the American musical landscape. He accomplishes both tasks with a sure step and a sharp ear.</p>
