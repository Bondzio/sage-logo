<title>Background:</title>
<p>Surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) includes both open and arthroscopic procedures. Encouraging results have been reported for the majority of patients after surgical hip dislocation; however, most of these reports were short term and included only small cohorts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512445884">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine the results of surgical hip dislocation in a large cohort of FAI patients at a midterm follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512445884">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512445884">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective study including 185 consecutive patients (mean age, 30 years; 40% female) with 233 hips treated was conducted. We determined clinical outcomes in terms of range of motion and analyzed radiographs for several criteria including the alpha angle preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. At latest follow-up, on average 61 months postoperatively, patient satisfaction, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Hip Outcome Score, SF-12, and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale scores were determined. All revisions and conversions to total hip arthroplasty (THA) were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512445884">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Both hip flexion and internal rotation improved from preoperatively to postoperatively. Alpha angles decreased from 65.1° ± 14.2° to 42.4° ± 4.9°. At 5 years, 82% of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of surgery, and 81% would undergo the same surgery again. There were 83% who rated their overall hip function as normal or nearly normal. Mean scores for the WOMAC pain, stiffness, and function subscales were 10.3 ± 15.8, 15.9 ± 17.4, and 9.6 ± 13.0 points; for Hip Outcome Score activities of daily living and sport subscales were 89.0 ± 13.1 and 75.6 ± 23.0 points; and for the SF-12 Physical Component Scale and Mental Component Scale were 47.4 ± 6.3 and 52.3 ± 7.4 points, respectively. The mean UCLA activity level was 7.7 ± 1.9. Conversion to THA was performed in 7 hips (3%). Seven hips (3%) underwent other major revisions, and 11 (4.7%) underwent minor revisions. Female patients had a significantly increased risk for conversion to THA (odds ratio, 13.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-92.6) and major revision (odds ratio, 19.2; 95% CI, 2.4-152.9). The mean body mass index was significantly lower in those patients who underwent conversion to THA. The need for microfracture because of residual full-thickness cartilage defects after rim trimming was a significant (<italic>P</italic> = .04) predictor of subjective dissatisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512445884">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that surgical hip dislocation is a successful procedure for the treatment of FAI. A majority of patients were satisfied with the results of surgery at a midterm follow-up. Older and slim female patients were at an increased risk for a less successful outcome in terms of conversion to THA and revision surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>Surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has evolved over time, coincident with a more detailed understanding of the pathomorphology and pathomechanism. Femoroacetabular impingement is characterized by variants of hip anatomy causing damage to the labrum and labrochondral junction by abnormal contact between the femoral neck and acetabular rim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512445884">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512445884">20</xref></sup> The anatomic abnormalities might be located at the acetabular side (pincer FAI), femoral side (cam FAI), or on both (mixed FAI). Today’s surgical approaches include open and arthroscopic procedures that share the basic principle of removal or repair of unstable tissue and reshaping of bone to eliminate the pathological contact during normal activities. Surgery is intended to return these relatively young patients to their previous activities without pain and may prevent or slow down hip joint degeneration, that is, osteoarthritis. Outcome studies report clinically good to excellent results in 68% to 96% of patients after an open procedure, that is, surgical hip dislocation, at short-term to midterm follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512445884">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512445884">25</xref></sup> However, direct evidence of any long-term effect on the progression of osteoarthritis has not yet been demonstrated. One major weakness of most current studies reporting on the results of open FAI surgery is a relatively small sample size. To our knowledge, the largest series has been published by Peters et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445884">27</xref></sup> in 2010 and is composed of 96 hips with a mean follow-up of 26 months. Additionally, most investigations determined the clinical outcome only using clinician-based measures such as the Merle d’Aubigné or the Harris Hip Score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512445884">25</xref></sup> The patient perspective in outcome assessment is, however, of utmost importance, especially considering that most of these clinician-based measures were developed for patients with end-stage osteoarthritis rather than FAI. The present study therefore aimed (1) to assess the patient-reported outcomes in a large patient series at a midterm follow-up after open FAI treatment, (2) to determine the proportion of patients who underwent conversion to total joint replacement and any other major or minor revision surgery, and (3) to identify predictors of a good or poor subjective outcome (satisfaction vs dissatisfaction).</p>

<title>Patient Cohort and Study Design</title>
<p>After appropriate ethical committee approval, we conducted a retrospective study that included all consecutive patients who underwent a surgical hip dislocation for the treatment of symptomatic FAI at our institution between July 2003 and December 2005. All patients were operated by the same surgeon. The resulting cohort comprised 192 patients with 240 surgically treated hips. The patients were contacted by postal survey with an enclosed questionnaire set (see Clinical and Radiographic Outcome Assessment) in November and December 2009. Reminders were sent after 4 weeks, and patients who did not respond were contacted by telephone. During the telephone interviews, we requested information about satisfaction and any additional surgeries, including joint replacement. Overall, 160 patients (200 hips) completed the questionnaire set, 25 patients (33 hips) were interviewed by telephone, and 7 patients (7 hips) were lost to follow-up. This corresponds to a follow-up rate of 97%. Of the 185 patients (233 hips) included in the study, 74 (40%) were female (86 hips), and 111 (60%) were male (147 hips). The mean age at the time of surgery was 30.0 ± 9.3 years (range, 14-55 years), the mean height was 174.7 ± 9.2 cm (range, 155-193 cm), the mean weight was 74.1 ± 13.6 kg (range, 51-117 kg), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.2 ± 3.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 18.0-38.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The mean follow-up was 60.7 ± 11.8 months (range, 24-120 months). The broader range of follow-up is explained by the fact that some patients operated upon within the time frame indicated earlier had a surgical hip dislocation on the contralateral side before, and some underwent a surgical hip dislocation on the contralateral side later on. Thirty patients (30 hips, 12.9%) had undergone 36 previous surgeries, mainly hip arthroscopies or correctional osteotomies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512445884">Table 1</xref>). The mean age and gender distribution in this group did not differ from the remaining cohort.</p>

<title>FAI Diagnosis, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, and Surgical Treatment</title>
<p>The diagnosis of FAI was based on patient history, clinical examination (reduced flexion, usually &lt;95°, and internal rotation, usually &lt;10°, positive impingement test result), conventional radiographs (anteroposterior [AP] pelvis and cross-table lateral or Dunn view), and obligatory magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the involved hip using intra-articular gadolinium contrast. Hips with acetabular retroversion (indicated by the crossover sign) or coxa profunda/protrusio were classified as pincer type. An alpha angle &gt;50° (measured on MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512445884">26</xref></sup>) was considered diagnostic for cam-type FAI. Mixed-type impingement was indicated by an alpha angle &gt;50° and retroversion or coxa profunda/protrusio. Patients without a clear correlation between the clinical and radiological/MRI findings, atypical pain type or location, and with symptoms primarily of muscular tightness and weakness underwent nonoperative treatment before surgery was indicated. Nonoperative treatment consisted of activity modification as far as possible, physical therapy with strengthening and coordination exercises, and if necessary pain medication. Usually, surgical hip dislocation was reserved for patients without advanced degenerative radiographic changes (ie, Tönnis grade 0 or 1). In cases with more advanced Tönnis grades (ie, 2 or 3), surgical hip dislocation was offered as a “salvage procedure” in symptomatic young patients (reflected by the mean age of 27 years of those with Tönnis grade 2 or 3 in the present series). In those cases, all patients were informed about the uncertain prognosis, and hip surgery was performed only when a patient specifically requested intervention.</p>
<p>Surgery was performed under regional or general anesthesia with the patients in a lateral decubitus position. We routinely used a Henry approach that follows the interval between the gluteus medius and maximus without splitting gluteus maximus fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512445884">16</xref></sup> Starting in 2006, a Z-shaped stepped trochanteric osteotomy replaced the earlier flat osteotomy. Refixation of both osteotomy types was accomplished with two 3.5-mm cortical screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512445884">2</xref></sup> With a Z-shaped capsulotomy and subsequent cutting of the ligamentum teres, the femoral head could be completely dislocated, allowing full visualization of the hip joint. Acetabular and labral lesions were addressed first. In cases with acetabular overcoverage, partial labral ossification, or labral lesions, the labrum was detached from the acetabular rim, the rim trimmed, and the labrum refixed using 2 to 5 bone anchors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512445884">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512445884">2</xref>). Frayed or degenerative labral fibers were sparsely debrided longitudinally; the resection of a complete segment of the labrum was avoided whenever possible. Based on the intraoperative appearance of the labrum, a labral lesion severity score (0-3) was created. An intact labrum was defined as grade 0, an undersurface lesion as grade 1, a complex lesion with complete detachment or an undersurface lesion with an associated labral ganglion as grade 2, and labral ossification or a complex lesion with an associated labral ganglion as grade 3. In areas with carpet-like chondral lesions in continuity with all adjacent cartilage, drilling into the subchondral plate was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512445884">29</xref></sup> with the idea that ingrowing tissue would stabilize the cartilage. However, unstable chondral flap lesions were resected (chondroplasty), and if necessary, microfracturing was performed. A cartilage area lesion size was calculated by multiplying the lesion length in hours (eg, from 12 o’clock to 3 o’clock = 3 hours) with the depth of the lesion toward the fossa in millimeters (mm·h). This method of measurement better takes into account the anatomic variability of hip size (eg, slim female vs tall male). Osteochondroplasty to create an optimized waist at the femoral head-neck junction was performed over the entire length of the femoral neck to the intertrochanteric line or even further when it was necessary to remove additional bone underneath the capsular insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512445884">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512445884">4</xref>). Special attention was given to the contour of the anterior distal region to ensure sufficient impingement-free flexion and to reduce the risk of extra-articular subspinous impingement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512445884">19</xref></sup> After relocation of the femoral head, repeated impingement testing was used to verify sufficient correction, that is, intraoperative impingement-free internal rotation of &gt;30° and flexion of &gt;110°.</p>

<title>Postoperative Care</title>
<p>When a flat trochanteric osteotomy was performed, weightbearing was restricted to one fourth of the body weight for 6 weeks and flexion limited to 70°. Active abduction and full weightbearing were allowed after 6 weeks. After the introduction of the stepped osteotomy, the length of partial weightbearing was reduced to 4 weeks and flexion allowed to 90°. Low molecular weight heparin was given for 6 weeks. To avoid postoperative adhesions, continuous passive motion (CPM) of the involved leg was started directly after surgery at 30° of flexion and rapidly increased to 70° or 90° depending on osteotomy type. Patients were encouraged to use an ergometer at home. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times per day was given for 2 weeks postoperatively as heterotopic ossification prophylaxis. The first clinical and radiographic evaluation was at 6 weeks. After confirmation of trochanteric union, patients began unlimited passive and active range of motion (ROM) and hip abductor strengthening exercises. At the same time, sensorimotor exercises were emphasized to promote neuromuscular control of the pelvis and lower extremity. In a second clinical evaluation, residual deficits were analyzed and the therapy program adapted accordingly. At that time, depending on the muscular rehabilitation status, patients were allowed to restart their typical sport activities. The final routine clinical and radiographic follow-up was scheduled 1 year after surgery.</p>

<title>Clinical and Radiographic Outcome Assessment</title>
<p>Information regarding ROM, complications, conversion to joint replacement, and other reoperations was gathered from patient records and operation notes. Reoperations due to joint-related problems were considered as major revisions (eg, hip arthroscopy) and reoperations not related to the joint itself as minor revisions (eg, reclosure of a fascial defect). To determine the patient-reported outcomes, a questionnaire set was sent to the patients as indicated above.

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Depending on data distribution (Shapiro-Wilk <italic>W</italic> test), comparisons were made using Student <italic>t</italic> or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. For correlations between scores and/or patient variables, the Spearman correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) was used. Group differences in revision rates or satisfaction were analyzed with use of the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test, and the according odds ratios were calculated. Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves were drawn with conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA) as the end point. To identify predictors of a poor subjective outcome, we performed multivariate logistic regression (conditional) analyses using satisfaction as the dependent variable. Satisfaction was dichotomized into “yes” and “no,” with “yes” including those patients who indicated to be satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of surgery and “no” including all others. Only patients with unilateral surgery were included to avoid any bias. The independent variables were entered and analyzed separately for different families of variables: (1) demographics (age, gender, BMI, marital status, educational level, smoking), (2) associated surgery (previous surgery, removal of trochanteric screws, revision surgery), (3) intraoperative findings (labral lesion severity score, chondral thinning, osteophytes, chondral lesion, area size of chondral lesion), (4) surgical measures (labral debridement/resection, rim trimming, labral takedown and refixation, chondroplasty, remaining cartilage-bare area, microfracture), (5) ROM (internal rotation, flexion), and (6) radiographic parameters (CCD, FAI type, profunda/protrusion, LCE, acetabular index, extrusion index, offset ratio, alpha angle, Tönnis grade). The significance level was defined at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 for all tests. Unless otherwise stated, the results are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>The mean duration of surgery was 117.1 ± 18.6 minutes. Labral lesions were present in 207 of the hips (88.8%). According to our labral lesion severity score, 26 labrums were classified as grade 0 (11.2%), 69 as grade 1 (29.6%), 65 as grade 2 (27.9%), and 73 as grade 3 (31.3%). The labral lesion severity score correlated moderately with age (<italic>r</italic> = .31). Formal labral refixation was performed in 128 hips (54.9%), not only for unstable tears but also after resection of partial ossification or overhanging bone. Reattachment of the labrum required 3 bone anchors on average. A normal labrum was left untouched in 26 hips (11.2%), sparse debridement of frayed or loose fibers was performed in 190 hips (81.6%, including some in which the labrum was repaired), and resection of segments of a completely ossified labrum was necessary in 17 hips (7.3%). Acetabular cartilage lesions were present in 149 hips (63.7%), and chondroplasty was done in 131 hips (56.2%). The mean area lesion size was 16.4 mm·h (range, 0-90 mm·h). After rim trimming, a cartilage-bare area remained in 112 hips (48.1%). When the cartilage-bare area exceeded 3-mm width, microfracturing was performed. This was necessary in 47 of the 112 cases (40.2%). The mean area lesion size in hips with microfracturing was 30.2 mm·h compared with 13.0 mm·h in those without (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The initial lesion size was associated with Tönnis grades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512445884">Table 2</xref>) and alpha angles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512445884">Table 3</xref>). Hips that underwent microfracturing also had significantly higher preoperative mean Tönnis scores than those without microfracturing (0.89 vs 0.47; <italic>P</italic> = .002). Osteochondroplasty at the femoral head-neck junction was done in all but one hip (99.6%). The intraoperatively determined impingement-free internal rotation and flexion averaged 43.4° ± 11.9° (range, 10°-70°) and 108.0° ± 11.0° (range, 100°-120°), respectively.</p>

<title>Complications and Revisions</title>
<p>Two minor intraoperative complications occurred while seating bone anchors; one anchor broke (left in place), and another anchor impressed the cartilage from the subchondral side (could be removed). One superficial vein thrombosis occurred postoperatively. No osteonecrosis of the femoral head was observed. In 7 hips (3.0%), conversion to THA was performed at a mean of 33.6 ± 21.3 months (range, 6-64 months) after surgery, 6 in female patients and 1 in a male patient (mean age at the time of surgical hip dislocation, 34.1 years). Nine hips (3.9%) underwent 11 major revisions after a mean of 30.0 ± 14.9 months (range, 10-55 months), and 11 hips (4.7%) had 13 minor revisions after a mean of 14.2 ± 18.5 months (range, 1-68 months) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512445884">Table 4</xref>). Two of the major revisions were not directly related to the initial surgery because both patients sustained an unrelated traumatic hip injury; one patient suffered a labral tear and underwent hip arthroscopy, and the second patient had a cartilage lesion of the femoral head that was treated by a second surgical dislocation. Excluding these 2 cases, 9 major revisions were necessary in 7 hips (3.0%), all performed in female patients. Displacement of the trochanter requiring refixation occurred in 4 patients, all with the older flat osteotomy. These were classified beside others as minor revisions because the indication was not an intra-articular complaint or problem. Eight of the minor revisions were performed in female hips and 5 in male hips. Trochanteric screws were removed in 150 hips (64.4%) after a mean of 9.7 ± 7.4 months (range, 2-62 months). Survival probability of the hip joint was 97% (95% confidence interval, 96%-98%) at 5 years with joint replacement as the end point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512445884">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

There were 47.4% of patients who were very satisfied with the results of surgery, 34.5% were satisfied, and 9.2% indicated “neither/nor.” Dissatisfaction was indicated by 3.9%, and 4.9% were very dissatisfied. Of those patients who underwent revision, 52.4% were still satisfied or very satisfied with the results of surgery. Overall, 81% of the patients would undergo the same surgery again, and 19% would not. There were 54.1% of patients who stated that their expectations were completely fulfilled, and 32.7% considered their expectations as being largely fulfilled. There were 13.2% who stated that their expectations were only partially or not fulfilled. Overall hip function was rated as follows: normal, 33.1%; nearly normal, 50.3%; abnormal, 13.9%; and severely abnormal, 2.7%.

The LCE angles decreased (<italic>P</italic> = .0027) from 29.3° ± 7.1° (range, 11°-53°) to 27.9° ± 6.8° (range, 8°-43°). The acetabular index remained unchanged (<italic>P</italic> = .36) with 5.5° ± 5.7° (range, –11° to 21°) before surgery and 5.2° ± 5.7° (range, –12° to 22°) postoperatively. The extrusion index also remained unchanged (<italic>P</italic> = .31) with a mean of 18.3% ± 7.1% (range, 0%-37%) preoperatively and 18.7% ± 7.0% (range, 3%-50%) after surgery.

One year after surgery, 88.2% of the hips were still classified as grade 0 or 1 and 11.8% as grade 2 or 3. The 7 cases that were converted to THA did not show a pronounced progression of Tönnis grades at 1 year when compared with the patients who were not converted.

<p>Female patients were more likely to undergo conversion to THA and revision surgery or to be dissatisfied with surgery than were male patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0363546512445884">Table 6</xref>). Score values did not differ between female and male patients except for activity levels, which were significantly lower in female patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0363546512445884">Table 6</xref>).

Score values did not differ between the older and the younger patients except for activity levels, which were significantly lower in older patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0363546512445884">Table 7</xref>). The mean BMI was significantly lower in those patients who were converted to THA (21.3 vs 24.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = .03). Four of the 7 THA conversions and 8 of the 11 major revisions were performed in the 20 slimmest patients (BMI, 18.0-20.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). There were no differences in terms of THA conversion, revision, satisfaction, or score values between patients who underwent previous hip surgery and those who did not and between patients with cartilage lesions and those without. There was also no direct association between the Tönnis grade and THA conversion or revision. Multivariate regression analyses revealed 3 significant predictors of subjective (dis)satisfaction at the final follow-up: revision surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .001), labral lesion severity score (<italic>P</italic> = .035), and microfracturing (<italic>P</italic> = .042). Revision surgery and microfracturing were both predictors of a poor outcome (ie, dissatisfaction), while higher labral lesion severity scores were associated with a good outcome (ie, satisfaction).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The concept of FAI has evolved over the past decade and is now widely accepted as a cause of hip pain in younger patients. Furthermore, FAI disorders have been linked to the development of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512445884">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512445884">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512445884">13</xref></sup> Operative treatment of symptomatic FAI has become more commonplace around the world, but unfortunately, published data reporting the outcomes of such surgery are rather sparse. Clohisy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512445884">10</xref></sup> recently performed a systematic literature review and summarized the results of 11 different studies, 6 of them using the open approach, that is, surgical hip dislocation. A more comprehensive review was performed by Ng and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512445884">25</xref></sup> including 23 original case series, of which 11 reported on outcomes after open FAI surgery. Most of these studies are short-term reports (mean follow-ups ranging from 10 months to 5.2 years) and/or composed of only a small number of patients (from 5 to 52 cases). Peters et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445884">27</xref></sup> recently published a comparatively large series of 96 hips with a mean follow-up of 26 months. All these studies consistently indicated improvements after surgery, with clinically good to excellent results in 68% to 96% of the cases.</p>
<p>The present results are based on a larger series with 233 hips assessed 2 to 10 years (mean, 5 years) after surgical hip dislocation and underline previous findings that open treatment is effective in most, but not all, patients presenting with FAI. Peters et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445884">27</xref></sup> reported on 5 THA conversions (and one case with decreased Harris Hip Score) in their series of 96 hips (5.2%). The conversion rate of 3% in the present series was somewhat lower, even though the follow-up time was longer (61 vs 26 months). This difference is hard to explain considering that the gender distribution and mean age were quite similar (older and female patients were at increased risk for THA in this study). Tönnis grades were also comparable, and we could not find a significant association between conversion to THA and the presence of cartilage and/or labral lesions at the time of index surgery. Peters et al pointed out that failed hips were more likely to have Outerbridge grade IV acetabular cartilage lesions than those that did not fail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445884">27</xref></sup> This observation parallels previous findings, although a significant statistical association has not yet been proven. In our 7 THAs, only 3 hips had cartilage defects down to the subchondral bone, but 4 hips were found to have partial ossification of the labrum. In 2 of the 7 hips, osteophytes within the acetabular fossa were observed. In one hip, though, an undersurface labral lesion was the only damage detected during index surgery. It might be, however, that despite the size of our series, the number of failures in terms of conversion to THA was too small to find meaningful associations with intraoperative findings. Nevertheless, 2 apparent findings were that 6 of the 7 conversions were performed in pincer-type female hips and that the patients who were converted to THA had significantly lower BMI values. Pincer-type FAI is frequently observed in women with hyperlaxity and with a deep socket (ie, coxa profunda or protrusion). One possible explanation might be that, although correcting the bony impingement, hyperlaxity is not addressed. Moreover, overcorrection might induce joint instability, leading to persistent symptoms and thus to the subsequent conversion to joint replacement.</p>
<p>Similarly, all major revisions (excluding the 2 reoperations necessitated by an unrelated second injury) were performed in female hips. Most of these revisions were hip arthroscopies related to capsular thickening and adhesions with persistent pain after surgery. Beck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512445884">4</xref></sup> has shown that adhesions might be responsible for groin pain after FAI surgery and that CPM directly started after surgery can be preventive. We also routinely start CPM directly after operative treatment, but the present data suggest that the formation of adhesions might not be avoidable in all cases. Minor revisions were mainly related to soft tissue problems such as a fascial dehiscence or inflammation of the trochanteric bursa. Displacement of the trochanteric osteotomy occurred in 4 hips, requiring subsequent refixation. This proportion is obviously lower than the 20% rate experienced by Yun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512445884">36</xref></sup> but quite similar to that reported by Peters et al (2 of 96).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445884">27</xref></sup> Yun and associates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512445884">36</xref></sup> suggested the use of different fixation materials such as plates or additional wires to improve the trochanteric fixation; however, these authors obviously used a conventional flat trochanteric osteotomy. All 4 displacements in the present series also occurred in hips that underwent a flat trochanteric osteotomy. Since the introduction of the stepped osteotomy in 2006 (we recommend a step of 6 mm),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512445884">2</xref></sup> no trochanteric dislocations have occurred in our practice. Refixation with 2 cortical 3.5-mm screws should be therefore considered as a safe procedure. Nevertheless, the screws might induce minor local symptoms, requiring their removal later on. Hardware removal was indeed performed in about 64% of the present cases at a mean of 10 months postoperatively. As this was done as outpatient surgery with local anesthesia and anesthesia standby, it did not create a major burden to the patients. Multivariate regression analysis also showed that removal of trochanteric screws was not associated with subjective dissatisfaction at last follow-up. The high proportion of 64% can be explained by the fact that we routinely recommend removal of the trochanteric screws 2 to 3 months after surgery to avoid local symptoms that might impair full hip abductor strengthening.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the clinical outcomes, the vast majority of our patients were satisfied with the results of surgery (82%), they indicated that their expectations were fulfilled (87%), and they would undergo the same surgery again (81%). Although these results are very encouraging, one important finding was that female and older patients did worse than male and younger patients. The worse subjective outcomes in female patients might be explained by the higher rate of revision surgery, as indicated above. Hence, revision surgery was identified as a strong predictor of dissatisfaction, which is easily comprehensible. However, still half of the patients undergoing revision were nevertheless satisfied with the results of surgery. In hypermobile female patients, despite normal postoperative acetabular coverage (LCE) and despite a careful osteochondroplasty avoiding a stepped resection that could compromise the negative pressure in the joint, the results were less predictable. We consider the combination of pincer-type FAI and hypermobility as one major factor contributing to the less successful outcomes. The association of hypermobility and outcomes after FAI surgery warrants more attention in future studies. As could be expected, more advanced joint degeneration at the time of surgery was a predictor of subjective dissatisfaction at last follow-up. Patients with higher Tönnis grades tended to have worse subjective outcomes, and patients in whom microfracturing was required for treating larger full-thickness chondral defects remaining after rim trimming also were more likely to be dissatisfied. At first view, the finding that increasing grades of labral degeneration, as determined by the labral lesion severity index, were associated with better subjective ratings might appear illogical. However, this finding suggests that patients experience more symptoms with unstable labral lesions and will hence benefit more from treatment addressing the labral injury. The labral damage severity score, which was developed based on intraoperative findings, could also be applied on MRI in future studies.</p>
<p>Although statistically significant, the improvements in motion observed here might seem clinically irrelevant. Also, the motion at 1 year was consistently less than that achieved during surgery. However, even small improvements in terminal motion may be very helpful in terms of daily activities and some sports. This is especially true for the 9° gain (to 16°) in internal rotation at 90° of flexion because this roughly corresponds to a 100% improvement. The fact that patients seldom achieve the intraoperative motion is probably explained by soft tissue restraints in the healed capsule, although reattachment of the gluteus minimus and medius (which insert on the osteotomy fragment) may also play a role. In any case, the fact that postoperative flexion/internal rotation is generally less than the potential motion indicates that these patients are effectively protected from joint damage from recurrent impingement. We have come to regard excessive motion as undesirable because, as in anterior ankle impingement, hypermobile patients can suffer recurrent impingement despite extensive recontouring of the joint.</p>
<p>Most previous studies of open treatment only used the clinician-based Merle d’Aubigné or Harris Hip Scores as outcome measures, and direct comparisons of score values with the present study are therefore difficult. Beaulé et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445884">3</xref></sup> in 2007 investigated the outcomes in 34 patients at a mean of 3.1 years after open FAI surgery using the WOMAC, SF-12, and UCLA. The postoperative score values indicated by Beaulé et al compare very well with those found in this investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445884">3</xref></sup> Clohisy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512445884">9</xref></sup> determined baseline score values for 51 patients scheduled for FAI surgery using the SF-12 and UCLA activity scale. Preoperative score values of 7.1 for the UCLA and of 43.5 and 48.1 points for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, respectively, suggest that patient-reported baseline scores are indeed abnormal in patients presenting with FAI. These reports and our postoperative SF-12 values can be compared with the normative values recently reported for young Canadian adults and for Colombians aged 18 to 34 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512445884">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512445884">30</xref></sup> There are yet no reports that used the relatively new HOS to investigate outcomes after open FAI surgery. Philippon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512445884">28</xref></sup> indicated values of 85 and 72 points for the HOS activities of daily living and sports subscales, respectively, in a subgroup of patients who rated their outcomes as excellent or good 3.1 years after hip arthroscopy. Our HOS results are in line with this report. As might be expected, higher values of 95 and 89 points for the HOS activities of daily living and sports subscales, respectively, and of 51 and 54 points for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, respectively, were recently reported for a cohort of professional athletes 45 months after open FAI treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512445884">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study also has some limitations. The first is the lack of radiographic follow-up data beyond 1 year after surgery. However, the main focus of this study was on patient-reported outcomes and revision rates. Moreover, Beck et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445884">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512445884">6</xref></sup> suggested that radiographic changes might not be expected within the first 5 years after surgery. Nevertheless, a clinical and radiographic re-evaluation of all patients of this cohort is planned at a mean of 10 years after surgery. Second, the outcome scores were only determined at follow-up. Preoperative outcome scores were not routinely assessed at our institution, and some of the measures were not available in German at that time. While this limitation debars the determination of changes in terms of questionnaire scores within this cohort, the values assessed at follow-up allow comparisons with the current literature and might serve as reference values for future reports. Third, not all patients sent back the written forms but were interviewed by telephone. Although the determined results might be biased by these 2 different settings, previous studies have shown no or only little differences between telephone and mail assessments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512445884">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512445884">31</xref></sup> Finally, another issue that might confound the results is the heterogeneity of the study group. However, this consecutive cohort comprising younger and older patients and hips with or without previous surgery represents the overall clinical practice, and it is therefore free of selection bias. We could not find any differences related to age, gender distribution, or outcomes between patients who had previous surgery and those who had not. Therefore, the inclusion of all patients treated within a given time frame also represents a strength of this study, which represents the largest series of patients in the current literature treated for FAI by surgical hip dislocation at a midterm follow-up.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that surgical hip dislocation is a generally successful procedure for the treatment of FAI. It is safe in that no patient suffered a complication such as osteonecrosis, instability, fracture, or nerve injury that would lead to additional disability. A majority of the patients were satisfied with the outcome after a midterm follow-up. Conversion to THA was necessary in 3% of the hips, and major revisions related to joint problems occurred in another 3%. Although these figures are encouraging, some factors like the combination of being an older and slim woman, or the necessity for microfracturing in a larger cartilage-bare area remaining after rim trimming, led to significantly worse outcomes. Interestingly, the severity of labral damage correlated inversely with the subjective outcome, indicating that patients highly benefit from addressing a labral abnormality.</p>
