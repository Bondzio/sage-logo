<body>
<p>In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in applying neuroscience techniques to address questions in business and economics research. The majority of applications of neuroscience techniques to problems in this field can be found in neuroeconomics, where these techniques are used to explore specific research questions with regard to cooperation, trust, risk assessment, reputation, social norms, and many more (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094428112449656">Camerer, Loewenstein, &amp; Prelec, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094428112449656">Loewenstein, Rick, &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>). Neuroeconomics, an interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of economics and neuroscience, investigates the neural foundations of economic behavior. In this research paradigm, behavioral tasks adopted from experimental economics are merged with neuroscience methods to investigate the neural and neurochemical systems involved in the processing of these tasks. Based on these investigations and existing knowledge about the functional specialization of different brain systems, neuroeconomists can open the black box of neural processing and draw conclusions about the motivational and cognitive processes underlying the observed behaviors.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this combined approach of experimental economics and neuroscience is to test theories that cannot be explored appropriately with other approaches. On the one hand, neuroscience techniques can assess brain functions while participants perform tasks in a controlled experimental setting. This can aid the researcher in uncovering neural functioning at the basis of an observable behavior to explore why a participant behaved in a certain way. Researchers can, thus, more precisely determine the motivation behind a given behavior. As a consequence, researchers can form better theories about the underlying reasons for observable behaviors in a given context and create more accurate tests of their theories than if they were to use other, less direct measures such as standard self-report measures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, neuroeconomics can assist with testing competing theories against each other to eliminate inaccurate or ill-fitting theories (i.e., theory pruning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094428112449656">Leavitt, Mitchell, &amp; Peterson, 2010</xref>). Competing theories often provide different arguments regarding the underlying reasons why a participant shows a certain behavior. In the current form of null hypothesis significance testing, finding a significant effect for a given hypothesis only means that the findings produced by our study cannot discount the explanation we have given. However, it does not mean that, in fact, our explanation provided in the hypothesis is true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094428112449656">Cohen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094428112449656">Leavitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094428112449656">Nickerson, 2000</xref>). Through complex experimental designs we can sometimes contrast arguments provided by one theory against arguments provided by another. But still, we do not get a definite answer to the question: “How does this work?”</p>
<p>Adding neuroscience methods to a standard experimental design can often provide a very elegant and straightforward way to demonstrate the neural substrates behind a given behavior and, thus, can help answer exactly why somebody showed a given behavior. This in turn gives researchers an opportunity to pitch theories about the underlying reasons of any given behavior against each other and find out whether a theory matches with the actual physiological response.</p>
<p>While a few studies in the field of organizational research have used economic games and a few studies have used neuroscience methods, we are not aware of organizational research that combines these techniques. Similar to the value for economics research, we believe that the pairing of experimental gaming and neuroscience techniques has unique value for organizational researchers. Lately, organizational research has seen several calls for the incorporation of neuroscience techniques. Being some of the most prominent proponents of organizational neuroscience, W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker, Cropanzano, and Sanfey (2011)</xref> argue that the inclusion of the neural level of analysis into organizational research will help to extend existing theories by adding “detail to our accounts of human behavior” (p. 950). The authors further argue that the adoption of such a neuroscience perspective in the context of organizational research promises three essential benefits: (a) extending existing organizational theories, (b) encouraging new organizational research directions, and (c) resolving existing conceptual disagreements in organizational research. Pairing neuroscience techniques with experimental economic games goes one step further. The experimental design allows researchers to draw causal inferences about the relationship between several constructs of interest without interference from other variables, thus isolating particular relationships. Adding neuroscience methods on top of that allows organizational researchers to determine the underlying causes of the observed behavior and extends the conclusions we can draw from our findings. This in turn allows organizational researchers to build better theories and design more rigorous tests for these theories.</p>
<p>In the current article, we want to introduce the readers to core neuroscience and experimental game techniques and demonstrate how the combination of both can be applied in organizational research to address research questions that cannot be addressed using other methodologies. While this in and of itself is not enough to warrant a wider use of these neuro-game techniques, the current article also strives to highlight the particular theoretical advances that become possible when using these particular techniques.</p>
<p>After a brief review of commonly used interaction games and neuroscience techniques, we will introduce specific examples for four neuroscience/interaction game pairings. Our aim is to demonstrate the utility of these approaches for concrete research problems in organizational research. In addition, we extend our discussion of this approach to a more commonly used organizational research method: synthetic task environments. We will conclude with a discussion of the potential benefits and limitations of the neuroeconomic research approach and implications for future research.</p>

<title>Economic Games</title>
<p>Economic games (EGs) are adopted from experimental economics and used to model various social exchange situations in a laboratory setting. They are a common method of inquiry in behavioral decision research in fields such as politics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1094428112449656">Rand et al., 2009</xref>), sociology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094428112449656">Burns, 2010</xref>), psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1094428112449656">Volk, Thöni, &amp; Ruigrok, 2011</xref>), and of course economics (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094428112449656">Camerer, 2003</xref>). Economic games use an experimental design to study decision making in social interactions. At the core of all economic games is a scenario that prompts two or more players to make a decision independently of each other that has a predetermined economic consequence for themselves as well as for the other player. Participants are provided with a restricted number of behavioral choices. These choices vary in the degree to which they signal cooperation and risk taking in the social relationship between the two participants. Each choice has an associated monetary reward that can be manipulated to increase or decrease the stakes. Observing the participants’ choices, researchers draw conclusions about work-related attitudes and behaviors such as cooperation, trust, or fairness.</p>
<p>In all games a participant is teamed up either with another human participant or with a computer pretending to be another human participant. The latter is a form of deception that is strictly proscribed in experimental economics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094428112449656">Bonetti, 1998</xref>) but is increasingly used in organizational research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, &amp; Murnighan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra &amp; Murnighan, 2002</xref>). The games are played via a computer interface. In the following, we provide a brief summary of the four economic games that are most commonly used in economics and organizational research.</p>
<sec id="section2-1094428112449656">
<title>Prisoner’s Dilemma Game</title>
<p>The prisoner’s dilemma game is an experimental task that allows researchers to examine cooperation in situations in which the desire to act in one’s own best interest (i.e., maximizing personal gains) is pitted against the desire to further the interests of the collective (i.e., maximizing collective gains) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094428112449656">Axelrod, 1984</xref>). In the standard prisoner’s dilemma game, two players are provided with two basic decision choices: to cooperate with the other participant or to defect. Both players have to make this choice simultaneously and independently of each other. They are not allowed to directly communicate and coordinate their choices.</p>
<p>If both players defect, then both receive a low monetary payoff Y. If only one player defects, that player receives a very high payoff W, while the other receives a very low payoff Z. Finally, if both players cooperate, they both receive a moderate payoff X. The monetary rewards are chosen so that W &gt; X &gt; Y &gt; Z. The prisoner’s dilemma game, therefore, confronts the participants with a classic social dilemma situation, in which the highest possible outcome for the team can be achieved by cooperating, but each individual team member benefits most from not cooperating when the other player chooses to cooperate.</p>
<p>In organizational research, this game has been used in different variations to study questions regarding intragroup conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094428112449656">Gunnthorsdottir &amp; Rapoport, 2006</xref>), the repair of broken relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al., 2002</xref>), the effects of surveillance and sanctioning systems on cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1094428112449656">Tenbrunsel &amp; Messick, 1999</xref>), the effects of language and exposure to foreign cultures on cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094428112449656">Akkermans, Harzing, &amp; Van Witteloostuijn, 2010</xref>), and the relationship between conflict orientation, competitive negotiation tactics, and unethical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094428112449656">Schweitzer, DeChurch, &amp; Gibson, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1094428112449656">
<title>Trust Game</title>
<p>The trust game proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094428112449656">Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995)</xref> is an experimental task designed to investigate trust and trustworthiness. In this two-player game one player takes the role of an investor and the other player takes the role of a trustee. At the beginning of the game, both investor and trustee are endowed with an equal amount of money X (e.g., US$10) to create a level playing field. In the first stage of the game, only the investor can send money to the trustee. The investor can choose to send any amount between zero and X. The amount sent by the investor (y) is then tripled so that the trustee receives 3y. In the second stage of the game, the trustee is free to send any amount of money between zero and 3y back to the investor. If z denotes the final transfer from the trustee to the investor, the payoff of the investor is X – y + z, while the payoff of the trustee is X + 3y – z.</p>
<p>In this game gains are obtainable through cooperation. However, the investor who decides to send money to the trustee (i.e., to trust the trustee) faces the risk of being exploited by the trustee who has no monetary incentive to transfer anything back to the investor. An investor who still transfers money trusts that the trustee will give back enough to make this initial trust worthwhile. The investor’s decision to send money expresses trust, with the amount y sent by the investor expressing the level of trust. The trustee’s decision to return money measures trustworthiness, with the amount z returned by the trustee expressing the level of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>In organizational research, this game has been used to study the nonconscious activation of interpersonal trusting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094428112449656">Huang &amp; Murnighan, 2010</xref>), the effects of binding and nonbinding contracts on trust development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra &amp; Murnighan, 2002</xref>), the effect of status on trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094428112449656">Lount &amp; Pettit, 2012</xref>), trust repair after deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1094428112449656">Schweitzer, Hershey, &amp; Bradlow, 2006</xref>), the effects of financial compensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094428112449656">Desmet, De Cremer, &amp; van Dijk, 2011</xref>) and voluntary self-sanctioning mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094428112449656">Nakayachi &amp; Watabe, 2005</xref>) on trust repair, and the effects of group decision making on trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1094428112449656">Song, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1094428112449656">
<title>Ultimatum Game</title>
<p>The ultimatum game developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094428112449656">Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze (1982)</xref> is an experimental task that allows the study of strategic negotiation situations. In the standard ultimatum game one player is taking the role of a proposer and a second player is taking the role of a responder. The proposer is endowed with an amount of money X. The proposer then makes a decision how to divide the money between himself or herself and the responder and offers this division of the money to the responder. If the responder accepts the proposed division, then both earn the specified amounts. If the responder rejects the offer, both get nothing. The game can be played over multiple rounds.</p>
<p>The game resembles a negotiation situation in which participants try to achieve the best outcome for themselves. The proposed division reflects the proposer’s perception of what constitutes an offer that is likely to be accepted by the responder. The decision of the responder indicates what he or she perceives to be an acceptable offer.</p>
<p>In organizational research, this game has been used in different variations to study the role of fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094428112449656">Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1995</xref>), emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1094428112449656">Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1996</xref>), and physical attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick &amp; Schweitzer, 1999</xref>) in bargaining situations; the dynamics of deception and retribution in bargaining situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094428112449656">Boles, Croson, &amp; Murnighan, 2000</xref>); and the effects of cultural orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1094428112449656">Valenzuela, Srivastava, &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094428112449656">Brooks &amp; Schweitzer, 2011</xref>) on bargaining behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1094428112449656">
<title>Dictator Game</title>
<p>The dictator game developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094428112449656">Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin, and Sefton (1994)</xref> is an experimental task designed to examine concern for others. This game is technically a two-player game in which one player takes the role of a dictator and the other player takes the role of a recipient. However, the game is actually a one-person decision task: One player, the dictator, is endowed with an amount of money X and can decide whether or not to pass on some of this money to the recipient who otherwise would walk out of the game with nothing.</p>
<p>The recipient in this game is a passive player devoid of any strategic role. The recipient can neither send some of the transferred money back (as in the trust game) nor reject the offer (as in the ultimatum game). Accordingly, the dictator has no monetary incentive to transfer anything to the recipient. A dictator who still transfers money (i.e., makes a donation to the recipient) can be considered as prosocial. The more money the dictator transfers the more prosocial he or she is toward the recipient.</p>
<p>In organizational research, this game has been used to study the long-term effects of transient emotions on decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade &amp; Ariely, 2009</xref>), the dynamics of power changes in interpersonal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1094428112449656">Sivanathan, Pillutla, &amp; Murnighan, 2008</xref>), the role of physical and vocal attractiveness in bargaining situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1094428112449656">Rosenblat, 2008</xref>), and the impact of contracts and social norms on prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094428112449656">Kessler &amp; Leider, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Advantages of Economic Games</title>
<sec id="section7-1094428112449656">
<title>Measuring Actual Behaviors</title>
<p>One of the main advantages of this approach is that the games allow researchers to observe actual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094428112449656">Colquitt, 2008</xref>). Much of the research in organizational studies is conducted using survey methods aimed at eliciting self-reports of behavior and participant perceptions. Less frequent, but still common, are studies that ask respondents to make choices in hypothetical situations. Observational and experimental research aimed at collecting and measuring actual behavior are much rarer (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094428112449656">Grant &amp; Wall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094428112449656">Highhouse, 2009</xref>). The specific advantage of measuring actual behaviors becomes most salient when actual behaviors are likely to differ from behaviors in hypothetical situations or from self-reported behaviors, for example, when self-presentation and social desirability biases come into play (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094428112449656">DeMaio, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1094428112449656">Schwarz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1094428112449656">Schwarz &amp; Oyserman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Consider the example of studying breach of cooperation. Measuring actual behavior instead of relying on hypothetical scenarios is important in this context. It is likely that hypothetical scenarios involving a breach of cooperation are less emotion-laden than an actual breach of cooperation in a real setting with real consequences to one’s own situation. Responses to a breach of cooperation in a hypothetical scenario would be less valid and generalizable to a real organizational context than observing participants’ behavioral response to a real abuse of cooperation. The decision-making scenarios underlying economic games are monetarily incentivized to induce value into making decisions and create real stakes that will motivate individuals to reveal their true behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1094428112449656">Smith, 1976</xref>). Of course, we acknowledge that the experimental setting of economic games differs to some degree from complex, real-life organizational settings in which individuals are subject to many more pressures. Nevertheless, economic games provide a more comparable setting to real field work settings than hypothetical scenarios and will more closely match the true behavior in a real setting.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, observing actual behaviors in a concrete situation can be superior to survey responses. For example, in situations in which cooperation might be the socially desirable response, participants might be more likely to indicate in a survey that they would cooperate if they were in a given situation than to actually show cooperation in a real task in which they can increase their personal gain by not cooperating. However, in economic games participants can benefit more from defection than from cooperation when the other person cooperates. This reduces the effects of social desirability and self-presentation and more closely matches the dilemma individuals face when choosing between personal gains and compliance with social norms of cooperation present in real-life situations. As a consequence, economic games and field studies are likely to produce similar findings.</p>
<p>However, observational field studies often have one big problem: Studying negative events, such as a breach of cooperation, is extremely difficult. It would be unethical to manipulate breaches of cooperation in a field setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, observational field studies of negative events often rely on participants’ retroactive reflections on the event. Economic games allow researchers to manipulate negative as well as positive events and measure participants’ actual behavior in a given situation. As a result, economic games often allow researchers to elicit more real and valid responses than other methodologies can.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1094428112449656">
<title>Inferring Causality</title>
<p>Economic games allow researchers to infer causality. Understanding and describing the nature of causal relationships is an important element of any theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1094428112449656">Sutton &amp; Staw, 1995</xref>) and particularly relevant for practitioners who develop interventions in organizations based on theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094428112449656">Colquitt, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094428112449656">Cook and Campbell (1979)</xref> explain that demonstrating causality requires evidence on covariation between cause and effect, the chronological order of cause and effect, and the nonexistence of alternative explanations for the observed cause–effect relationship. In particular the last point, the so-called unmeasured or omitted variables problem, is unresolvable in field research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094428112449656">Colquitt, 2008</xref>). Economic games, on the other hand, use decision-making situations that are embedded in a well-defined and constrained context of social interactions in which anonymous participants play the games once without communicating—unless the effects of knowing the other players, playing repeatedly, or exchanging information are the focus of the study. Participants are usually randomly assigned to different conditions such as conditions with and without communication or identification. This highly restricted research setting provides investigators with the required level of experimental control for ruling out alternative explanations. Economic games are accordingly preferable to field research when stronger causal inferences need to be made, for example, when new theories are tested.</p>

<p>Economic games are highly adaptable. They provide a baseline design of some of the most frequent social exchange situations in organizational settings. These include situations in which participants have to decide whether to trust another person, repay trust, cooperate, free-ride, or be fair. The simplicity of the games allows for a great deal of adaptability to the specific research needs of the investigator. Richness and complexity can be added as required and the games can easily be integrated into all kinds of social scenarios. At the same time, given that all game variations are based on the same standardized, basic design, results from different studies are highly comparable. The comparability to other studies using a particular game provides information about representativeness of findings and generalizability. In organizational research, lack of comparability of methods across studies often becomes an impediment to the growth of knowledge in the field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094428112449656">Dietz, Bedwell, Oglesby, Salas, &amp; Keeton, 2012</xref>). Economic games are a great alternative to unique experimental designs as they achieve both adaptability through customization and comparability at the same time.</p>

<title>Economic Games and Neuroscience</title>
<p>More recently, teams of economists and neuroscientists have started to extend the utility of economic games by combining them with neuroscience methods to explore the neural foundations of economic behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094428112449656">Camerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094428112449656">Loewenstein et al., 2008</xref>). This new research paradigm offers the promise of generating a more complete picture of human behaviors, in particular of the underlying motivational processes. While economic games provide a forum for measuring actual behavior, they shed only limited light on the roots of the observed behaviors. Neuroscience methods, on the other hand, allow researchers to more thoroughly test their hypotheses and to investigate competing theories.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the ultimatum game: A person might reject an unfair offer out of an emotional upheaval such as anger or disgust or out of a more cognitive consideration such as inequity aversion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1094428112449656">Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). Or take the prisoner’s dilemma game: A person might cooperate in the prisoner’s dilemma game because she is altruistic and hence enjoys cooperation, or she follows some form of a reciprocity norm, feeling obliged to conform and reciprocate the cooperation of others. And to make things more complicated, she may even think she cooperates for altruistic reasons, even though she unconsciously follows a social norm. Thus, the mere observation of cooperative behavior in prisoner’s dilemma games does not allow inferences about the motivational processes underlying this cooperativeness.</p>
<p>One could say, why do we not just ask the participants why they decided to reject the ultimatum game offer or why they cooperated in the prisoner’s dilemma game? Unfortunately, asking people about their motives is often not helpful for different reasons. First, self-presentation, social desirability biases, and self-deception potentially distort self-reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094428112449656">Bing, Kluemper, Davison, Taylor, &amp; Novicevic, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094428112449656">DeMaio, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1094428112449656">Paulhus, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1094428112449656">Schwarz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1094428112449656">Schwarz &amp; Oyserman, 2001</xref>). Second, and more important, people often have little or no introspective access to the true motives underlying their behaviors and hence cannot report them accurately (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094428112449656">Greenwald &amp; Banaji, 1995</xref>). In the prisoner’s dilemma example, only the first option would show true unconditional cooperativeness.</p>
<p>Using neuroscience methods in combination with economic games (i.e., neuroeconomics) can provide clarification here. Neuroeconomics allows researchers to isolate behaviors and conditions by experimental manipulation, create conditions for causal inference regarding the relationship between two variables, test specific hypotheses against each other, and determine the underlying neurological basis for specific behaviors. To illustrate this a bit more, we would like to explore the following simplified example of a typical brain function. The brain’s main task is to process incoming information from the sensory neurons in the body, generate a response to these stimuli, and return neural stimulation to the rest of the body to initiate a response (e.g., muscle, hormonal). The brain implements two basic processes to react to incoming stimuli, automatic and controlled processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1094428112449656">Schneider &amp; Shiffrin, 1977</xref>). Automatic processes are heuristic-based and occur rapidly and often nonconsciously in responses to stimuli. Controlled processes, in contrast, involve conscious and deliberate corrections of these prepotent response tendencies and hence take longer in their reaction time than automatic processes. Since automatic processes occur first and since controlled processes require larger amounts of cognitive capacity, the former are prepotent and influence behavior most of the time. This means that most people behave most of the time according to automatic, prepotent response tendencies unless they exert effortful cognitive control or willpower to suppress them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094428112449656">Camerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1094428112449656">Rydell &amp; McConnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1094428112449656">Sanfey, Loewenstein, McClure, &amp; Cohen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1094428112449656">Wilson, Lindsey, &amp; Schooler, 2000</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094428112449656">Bing, LeBreton, Davison, Migetz, &amp; James, 2007</xref>, for a more differentiated discussion of the different ways in which implicit and explicit cognitions may affect behavior).</p>
<p>Since we are often not aware of the automatic processes determining our behaviors, we cannot report them. Furthermore, since we make sense of our world largely in terms of controlled processes, we tend to falsely interpret behaviors resulting from unconscious-automatic processes as being controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094428112449656">Camerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1094428112449656">Wolford, Miller, &amp; Gazzaniga, 2000</xref>). As a result, we often have an inaccurate perception of the true causes of our behaviors. This is particularly problematic for organizational behavior research that attempts to understand the motives behind organizationally relevant behaviors but relies primarily on self-report measures (for a comprehensive discussion, see W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Neuroeconomics takes a different approach by inferring the motives behind behaviors directly from their neural microfoundations. In this research paradigm, economic games are combined with neuroscience methods to identify the neural (and neurochemical) systems involved in the processing of a variety of economic behaviors. By applying existing knowledge about the functional specialization of the identified brain systems, investigators can make inferences about the motivational processes underlying the observed behaviors. For example, by analyzing brain activity in regions known to be associated with either automatic or controlled processing during cooperation, neuroeconomists can draw conclusions about the relative importance of cognition and affect in interpersonal cooperation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1094428112449656">Rilling et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context it is important to mention that despite the strong reliance on self-reports in organizational research, the measurement of implicit influences operating outside of conscious awareness and control is not new to the field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094428112449656">Bing et al. (2007)</xref> provide an excellent discussion of the different methods for measuring implicit social cognitions currently used by organizational researchers. These methods include the Thematic Apperception Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094428112449656">Lilienfeld, Wood, &amp; Garb, 2000</xref>), the Attributional Style Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1094428112449656">Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, &amp; von Baeyer, 1979</xref>), Implicit Association Tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094428112449656">Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998</xref>), and Conditional Reasoning Tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094428112449656">James, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>While all these methods can be used to investigate implicit attitudes, they have an important disadvantage when compared to neuroscience methods: They cannot be administered while participants are engaged in other tasks. The Thematic Apperception Test is typically administered as a one-on-one interview, the Attributional Style Questionnaire and Conditional Reasoning Tests as pencil-and-paper tasks, and Implicit Association Tests as computer-based tasks. All methods require the participants’ full attention and can therefore only be conducted before or after engaging in another task. This is problematic for behavioral researchers who are interested in the occurrence and prevalence of unconscious-automatic processes during different behavioral states. The great advantage of neuroscience methods is that they can be performed simultaneously with other tasks, which allows researchers to analyze the timing, duration, and intensity of unconscious-automatic processes in response to behavioral stimuli.</p>
<p>The neuroscience methods employed by neuroeconomics to identify the neural foundations of economic behaviors involve a wide range of techniques, including physiological measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1094428112449656">van’t Wout, Kahn, Sanfey, &amp; Aleman, 2006</xref>), neurochemical studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094428112449656">Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, &amp; Fehr, 2005</xref>), brain lesion studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094428112449656">Krajbich, Adolphs, Tranel, Denburg, &amp; Camerer, 2009</xref>), and brain imaging (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1094428112449656">Rilling et al., 2007</xref>). While all these methods are used, brain imaging—and here in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—is by far the most commonly used method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094428112449656">Kable, 2011</xref>). The next section will briefly describe this technique. Afterward, we will describe how organizational research can employ neuroeconomics, and more specifically the combination between economic games and brain imagining, to further research in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1094428112449656">
<title>Brain Imaging</title>
<p>Given the dominance of fMRI in neuroeconomics research, we will focus in this article on the combination of economic games and fMRI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a brain imaging technique that measures changes of cerebral blood flow to examine the activation of different brain areas. More specifically, it measures changes in blood oxygenation. The method is based on the fact that increased neural activity in a brain region leads to locally increased oxygen consumption, which is followed by an increased flow of oxygenated blood to this region. The hemoglobin in this oxygenated blood has different magnetic properties than hemoglobin in deoxygenated blood. The resulting higher concentration of oxygenated blood and the corresponding change in magnetic properties in activated brain areas can be visualized by an MRI scanner using a strong magnetic field. Accordingly, fMRI is very effective in imaging neural activity at high spatial resolution in the entire human brain, including deeper brain regions.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094428112449656">Kable (2011)</xref> points out that the superior spatial resolution of fMRI, namely, the unparalleled ability to accurately locate the source of neural activity within the brain, is one main reason for the heavy reliance on fMRI in neuroeconomics. A second reason, according to Kable, is the widespread availability of fMRI equipment in research institutions, including MRI scanners and user-friendly software for the analysis of fMRI data. In addition, the widespread use of fMRI means that the methodology is tried and tested and that neuroscientists can confidently interpret brain functioning. We refer the reader interested in a more detailed account of fMRI and other neuroscience techniques to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094428112449656">Kable (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>In the following section, we will explore how the inclusion of fMRI into economic game experiments and the resulting improved understanding of the motivational processes underlying the measured behaviors enable investigators to reap these benefits. We will highlight in particular the potential uses of neuroeconomic techniques for organizational researchers.</p>

<title>Neuroeconomics for Organizational Research</title>
<p>A few studies in organizational research have employed economic games to study their topic of interest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094428112449656">Brooks &amp; Schweitzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094428112449656">Gunnthorsdottir &amp; Rapoport, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1094428112449656">Schweitzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1094428112449656">Tenbrunsel &amp; Messick, 1999</xref>). However, we are not aware of any studies that have applied a neuroeconomics approach to organizational research. We believe that neuroeconomics offers great potential to develop new theories and improve theory testing. We further believe that neuroeconomics can help us understand on a more profound level the workings of our brain and the mechanisms behind some of the relationships between concepts organizational researchers are most interested in (e.g., trust, cooperation, competition). On the one hand, this will help us to design better research that can in turn generate deeper, more comprehensive knowledge. On the other hand, insights about the mechanisms behind our behaviors can greatly improve the design and enhance the success of interventions.</p>
<p>In the following sections we would like to demonstrate the possibilities that neuroeconomics opens up for organizational research. We will discuss the combination of fMRI with each of the four previously introduced games. For each game, we will present a sample article from organizational research that has used the respective economic game to study their topic of interest. For each sample study, we will briefly summarize how the game was used and what the authors found. We will then demonstrate how the authors could have used fMRI to clarify their findings by testing competing explanations for their findings and by extending their theory testing. We will show how the neuroeconomics approach could have greatly increased the contribution to theory and the meaningfulness of the findings and conclusions in each of the presented studies.</p>
<p>In addition, we will extend our exploration of the added benefit of neuroscience techniques to a type of task more commonly used in organizational research, synthetic task environments. Organizational research frequently uses synthetic task environments to engage participants in tasks that feel real to observe concepts like trust and cooperation in a dynamic setting, while still exerting more experimental control than possible in field research. As such, we will discuss synthetic task environments as an alternative to economic games for situations in which fidelity is crucial. Similar to the sections on economic games, we will provide a sample study that used synthetic task environments and demonstrate how the application of neuroscience techniques can take findings and conclusions from this approach further.</p>

<title>Prisoner’s Dilemma Game</title>
<sec id="section14-1094428112449656">
<title>Sample Study From Organizational Research</title>
<p>We want to start with an example of a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al. (2002)</xref> that has used the prisoner’s dilemma game to explore questions regarding the repair of broken relationships. More specifically, Bottom et al. used the prisoner’s dilemma game to analyze different strategies for rebuilding collaborative partnerships after breaches of cooperation. The reestablishment of cooperation after one party opportunistically disrupted the cooperative interaction is a difficult, yet important part of relationship management in organizations. The study by Bottom et al. investigated the effectiveness of different forms of apologies and promises of restitution in achieving forgiveness and hence restoring mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>To study restitution to a breach of cooperation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al. (2002)</xref> first had to establish a cooperative relationship between the participant and his or her counterpart (here a computer program). Priming cooperative behaviors in the beginning of the game, the computer program matched the participant’s choices and sent cooperative written messages to further stimulate cooperation. After 5 cooperative rounds in the short condition and 15 rounds in the long condition, the program suddenly defected and sent a message that either acknowledged or denied the intent to defect (i.e., “I was just trying to do a little better for myself” vs. “I didn’t mean to do that”). The breach of cooperation was followed by a number of noncooperative rounds before the program sent a written apology and offered different forms of restitution (monetary compensation) for returning to cooperation. After 5 more rounds the experiment ended and was followed by a questionnaire that assessed future intentions to interact with the game partner and participants’ affective state during the experiment as a measure of their forgiveness.</p>
<p>Based on this design, the study provided some interesting insights into the effectiveness of different strategies for restoring cooperation in collaborative partnerships after defection. Apologies were effective but less effective than restitutions. Higher restitutions were not more effective than lower restitutions. And most interestingly, while denials of intent to breach cooperation were most effective in long-term interactions (long condition), acknowledgments of intent were more effective in short-term interactions (short condition).</p>
<p>Several of these findings were surprising to the authors and did not match with their carefully developed, original hypotheses. The authors provided potential explanations for some of the effects in the discussion section of the paper but had to invite future research to study these open questions. For example, it was not clear why small restitutions were just as effective as large ones in generating subsequent cooperation and positive affect. It was also not clear why denials of intent were more effective in long-term relationships but acknowledgments of intent were more effective in short-term relationships. We would like to demonstrate now how pairing the prisoner’s dilemma game with fMRI techniques might have resolved some of these open questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1094428112449656">
<title>Benefits From Adding fMRI</title>
<p>The effectiveness of restitution in the current study was assessed by measuring cooperative behaviors after the breach of cooperation, the individual’s affective reactions to the breach, and the individual’s intent to cooperate with the opponent in the future. While these measures assess whether or not the individuals cooperate after the breach (i.e., actual behavior), how they think they feel about the breach, and whether or not they intend to collaborate in the future (i.e., self-report of thoughts and feelings), we do not know what is actually going on in their mind before the cognitive processing to produce an appropriate response. However, this could be an important source of information for the researcher.</p>
<p>For example, it can be argued that at the core of future collaborations and restored trust between the two players is forgiveness for the breach of cooperation. Previous research has shown that there are two general forms of forgiveness, decisional forgiveness involving a positive change in behavior toward the transgressor and emotional forgiveness involving additionally a positive change in emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1094428112449656">Worthington &amp; Scherer, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094428112449656">Hook, Worthington, and Utsey (2009)</xref> provide an excellent example to illustrate the difference:<disp-quote>
<p>An individual may be hurt when his or her partner has an affair. The individual may make a decision to forgive, meaning that he or she intends to act toward the partner in ways that are less negative (e.g., will not take revenge on the partner, will not avoid the partner) and more positive (e.g., will be friendly toward the partner, will spend time with the partner). However, even though the individual has made a sincere decision to forgive (and will attempt to follow through on the decision), he or she may not experience full emotional forgiveness. If the individual feels emotional forgiveness toward the partner, his or her emotions would be less negative (e.g., less anger, less hurt) and more positive (e.g., more compassion, more love). (p. 824)</p>
</disp-quote>The example illustrates the important difference between these two facets of forgiveness. People may decide to forgive a transgressor and sincerely believe in their forgiveness, yet still be flooded with negative emotions when something reminds them of the transgression. Research has accordingly shown that forgiveness can be labile and fluctuates substantially over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094428112449656">Karremans &amp; Van Lange, 2010</xref>). Only emotional forgiveness that involves the replacement of negative, unforgiving emotions leads to genuine forgiveness and sustainable changes in behavior.</p>
<p>The analysis of the long-term effectiveness of different strategies for rebuilding partnerships after breaches of cooperation requires accordingly an understanding of the motivational processes underlying the reported or observed forgiveness. Strategies that lead to emotional forgiveness are much more efficient in fully rebuilding broken partnerships in the long run than those leading to decisional forgiveness.</p>
<p>Such an understanding could have been gained in the context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al.’s (2002)</xref> experiment by additionally using fMRI to examine brain activation patterns associated with different forms of apologies and promises of restitution. In such an experiment, participants’ brain activity during a treatment condition (e.g., in response to a specific penance) would be compared with either baseline activity or activity during a control condition. By comparing the brain activities evoked by the two compared conditions, it is possible to determine which brain region is additionally activated due to the extra processing of the treatment condition.</p>
<p>Emotional processes such as anger and hurt are related to activity in specific brain regions, including the limbic system, which is the emotional center of the brain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094428112449656">Dalgleish, 2004</xref>). Hence, increased activation in the limbic system indicates the occurrence of some form of emotional processes. One way to measure emotional forgiveness would therefore be to use fMRI to observe participants’ brain activation patterns while they are reminded of the transgression after they were offered specific apologies or promises of restitution. Increased activations in the limbic system would indicate the presence of emotions related to the transgression and accordingly, a lack of emotional forgiveness. No activation changes in the limbic system, on the other hand, would indicate that the participant experiences no emotional upheaval when thinking of the transgression and that the offered apologies and/or restitutions were effective in promoting emotional forgiveness.</p>
<p>Decisional forgiveness that involves the exertion of effortful cognitive control to suppress negative emotions related to the transgression event can also be measured with fMRI. Controlled-cognitive processes engage the prefrontal cortex, which is the center for higher-order cognition (e.g., E. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1094428112449656">Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>). Hence, increased activity in the prefrontal cortex in addition to increased activity in the limbic system would indicate that the participant attempts to suppress the negative emotions related to the transgression by exerting cognitive control or willpower (attempts to follow through on the decision to forgive).</p>
<p>An illustration of a similar approach can be seen in a recent neuroeconomics study on the neural correlates of monetary intertemporal choice, namely, the choice between monetary payoffs that occur at different points in time. It demonstrates how emotional processes and the attempt to suppress them can be measured. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094428112449656">McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, and Cohen (2004)</xref> hypothesized that people have a tendency to prefer small but more immediate over large but more delayed monetary rewards due to impulsive-affective (i.e., emotional) processes related to activity in the limbic system. They also hypothesized that higher-order cognitive processes related to activity in the prefrontal cortex are required to forego the temptation of an immediate reward and seek a superior but more delayed reward.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous discussion of emotional and decisional forgiveness, this reasoning implies that just as we are often flooded with negative emotions when something reminds us of a transgression, we are also flooded with emotions when facing the opportunity of an immediate reward. In both cases these emotions can be suppressed by cognitive control.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094428112449656">McClure et al. (2004)</xref> tested their hypotheses in an fMRI study in which participants’ brains were scanned while they faced a series of monetary intertemporal choices. In line with their predictions, they found that brain regions related to emotional processes (i.e., parts of the limbic system) were disproportionately activated when participants chose smaller but more immediate rewards. Furthermore, they found increased activity in brain areas supporting cognitive processes (i.e., regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex) in addition to activity in the limbic system when participants chose larger delayed rewards. Limbic structures were more active than the lateral prefrontal cortex when participants chose immediate rewards (indicating the prevalence of emotions), while the opposite was true when participants chose delayed rewards (indicating cognitive control of emotional processes).</p>
<p>In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094428112449656">Bottom et al. (2002)</xref> could have used fMRI in their study to distinguish between emotional and decisional forgiveness by investigating participants’ brain activation patterns in the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, Bottom et al. might have been able to look at whether small and large penance both lead to decisional forgiveness, but whether only large penance leads to emotional forgiveness. This could mean that in a short experiment such as this, both short and large penance might lead to a positive change in behaviors toward the transgressor (as observed in the study), but that in longer relationships the small penance might be ineffective because it does not result in emotional forgiveness. As another example, Bottom et al. find that different forms of restitution are effective in short-term versus long-term relationships. With fMRI, the authors could have measured brain activity in both designs and could have compared how the different forms of restitution might cause different forms of forgiveness. In that sense, the authors could have explored why certain forms of retribution lead to cooperative behaviors when others do not.</p>
<p>While an observation of different brain patterns does not immediately tell us about the psychological processes behind the restorative functions of some restitutions, this information can help us look in the right direction. More specifically, knowing that certain types of restitutions reduce emotional responses when reminded of the transgression while others do not can help researchers form new theories about the underlying psychological processes that make certain forms of restitutions more successful in certain contexts. This example illustrates how the use of fMRI in combination with the prisoner’s dilemma game can extend existing theories by adding “detail to our accounts of human behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">W. J. Becker at al., 2011</xref>, p. 950).</p>

<title>Trust Game</title>

<title>Sample Study From Organizational Research</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra and Murnighan (2002)</xref> used the trust game to analyze the effects of binding and nonbinding contracts on trust development. Both types of contracts play an important role in organizational settings. Binding contracts mitigate the risks and uncertainties involved in interactions between individuals and organizations by specifying the terms of the interaction as well as the sanctioning mechanisms in case of violations of these terms. Nonbinding contracts are in contrast implicit, informal understandings based on verbal or handshake agreements that are not strictly enforceable. Given that binding contracts are typically used during early interactions when trust has not been established, it is important to understand how they affect trust development between the involved parties.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra and Murnighan (2002)</xref> hypothesized that binding contracts, in contrast to nonbinding contracts, have a negative impact on the development of trust. They suggest that binding contracts generate situational attributions for any compliant behavior of the contract partner, namely, the partner complies only because of the sanctioning structure of the contract. Nonbinding contracts without sanctioning mechanisms, in contrast, generate personal attributions, namely, the partner complies despite options to defect and is hence trustworthy. Given that personal attributions are a primary mechanism of trust development and that binding contracts fail to generate such attributions, Malhotra and Murnighan proposed that binding contracts impede trust development.</p>
<p>They tested this hypothesis in two multiround trust game experiments. In both experiments participants took the investor role and played (unknowingly) for four rounds against a computer program that took the trustee role. In Experiment 1, the trustee (i.e., the computer program) proposed in some conditions a binding contract, which was operationalized as a predetermined payoff that both players received without having to play the game (i.e., the contract dictated that the investor had to trust and the trustee had to honor trust). Participants then played the first two rounds with binding contracts (i.e., they received a predetermined payoff) and the second two rounds without contracts. In Experiment 2, the trustee proposed in some conditions a nonbinding contract, which was operationalized as a short, informal message indicating a willingness to honor trust. Participants then played the first two rounds with nonbinding contracts and the second two rounds without contracts. The focal question was how the type of contract employed during the first two rounds shaped trust development and thus behavior in the second two rounds in which the contracts were removed.</p>
<p>The results of the study supported the authors’ hypothesis such that trust was significantly lower in the context in which participants had played the first two rounds with a binding contract rather than a nonbinding contract. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra and Murnighan (2002)</xref> concluded that while binding contracts are often necessary during early interactions when trust has not been established, they also make it difficult to build trust. Nonbinding contracts in contrast do not impede trust development but involve the risk of exploitation. Both types of contracts leave the involved parties in a dilemma between avoiding exploitation or building trust.</p>
<p>The concern here is that while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra and Murninghan’s (2002)</xref> findings are hypothesis conform, whether or not attributions are the cause of the behavioral differences between the two conditions is only inferred. We only know that the findings are conform with an argument based on attribution theory. However, whether people make social attributions, when they occur, and in how far these attributions directly affect their thinking and behavior is difficult to assess. Social attributions are therefore often inferred but not directly measured. Malhotra and Murnighan, for example, inferred participants’ attributions about the game partner’s behavior indirectly from two questions that asked “How much did you trust” and “How much did you like” the game partner. For one, these two questions are only a very rough measure of attributional processes. Second, being that they were measured at the conclusion of the experiment, they cannot easily be linked to participants’ behavior during the experiment.</p>
<p>A more direct test of the role of social attributions could have been performed with fMRI. We would like to demonstrate now how pairing the trust game with fMRI techniques could support a more in-depth exploration of that question.</p>

<title>Benefits From Adding fMRI</title>
<p>Neuroscience research has identified specific brain regions that are reliably activated when people make inferences about the mental states of others, including what they feel, believe, and how they will behave. This so-called theory of mind module has been consistently linked to the medial frontal cortex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094428112449656">Amodio &amp; Frith, 2006</xref>). Other studies that directly investigated neural activity during social attributions confirmed the pivotal role of the medial frontal cortex in judgments of other person’s behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094428112449656">Harris, Todorov, &amp; Fiske, 2005</xref>). fMRI observations of activity in the medial frontal cortex therefore provide a more precise and direct indicator of social attributions than any survey or other indirect measure ever could. In addition, other measures of attributional processes such as attributional style questionnaires (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1094428112449656">Peterson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1094428112449656">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>) cannot typically be administered while participants perform other tasks. The great advantage of combining economic games and fMRI is that they can be performed simultaneously, which allows one to measure whether social attributions occur in a given situation, when they occur, the intensity with which they occur, and how they affect behavior.</p>
<p>In our earlier example we argued that people may cooperate out of altruism or reciprocity. Altruistic cooperation does not involve social attribution processes; altruists cooperate independently of what others do and how they will react. Reciprocal cooperation, on the other hand, is based on inferences about the intentions of others. Reciprocal cooperators will only collaborate if they expect others to do so as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094428112449656">Frey &amp; Meier, 2004</xref>). Reciprocal cooperation involves, therefore, some form of trust in the exchange partner while altruistic cooperation does not. This example mirrors what is happening in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094428112449656">Malhotra and Murninghan’s (2002)</xref> study. In the context in which participants play with a nonbinding contract, their cooperation in the trust game may or may not be based on social attributions and, hence, trust. If they cooperate altruistically, they will not engage in social attributions about their game partner. Trust is in this case not necessarily involved. However, if they cooperate out of reciprocity, they will make inferences about the motives and intentions of their game partner and only cooperate if they trust him or her.</p>
<p>Neuroscience would suggest that if people engage in social attributions, then we would see increased activation in the medial frontal cortex. Indeed, recent neuroeconomics research demonstrates that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex predicts social attribution processes and behavioral outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094428112449656">McCabe, Houser, Ryan, Smith, and Trouard (2001)</xref> used fMRI to observe brain activation patterns while participants played trust and reciprocity games with human and computer partners. The participants were informed when they played with a computer and knew that the computer would always play a fixed strategy, namely, the moves of the computer were completely predictable. Given that participants are unlikely to make social attributions (i.e., try to infer how their counterpart will behave) when they play with a computer that follows a known strategy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094428112449656">McCabe et al. (2001)</xref> hypothesized that increased medial prefrontal cortex activations would only be observed in the condition with human counterparts. Their results showed that this was indeed the case. Moreover, when they divided their participants into cooperative and noncooperative players, they observed increased medial prefrontal cortex activations in the human–human condition only for the former group. The latter group showed no significantly different activation patterns between the human–human and human–computer condition, suggesting that increased medial prefrontal cortex activation was only present when participants attempted to cooperate with their human counterpart and hence tried to infer his or her likely response (i.e., engaged in social attributions).</p>
<p>The aforementioned example demonstrates that neuroscience techniques can enable researchers to gain a better understanding of the bases for cooperation in a given context. As a result, they can form better theories regarding the underlying processes of cooperation and how attributions might affect these processes. This in turn can result in a more meaningful understanding of the construct of cooperation and of the antecedents of cooperation. It can also help researchers understand when and why people choose not to cooperate. Over time, understanding the underlying processes better can result in a refinement of the existing theories regarding cooperative behaviors.</p>

<title>Sample Study From Organizational Research</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer (1999)</xref> used the ultimatum game to investigate the so-called beauty premium or plainness penalty phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094428112449656">Hamermesh &amp; Biddle, 1994</xref>). Research has shown that employees of above-average beauty earn more (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094428112449656">Frieze, Olson, &amp; Russell, 1991</xref>) and have better chances to be hired and promoted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094428112449656">Marlowe, Schneider, &amp; Nelson, 1996</xref>) than employees of below-average beauty. A lingering question is whether the higher earning and promotion rates of physically attractive people are due to a demand effect (i.e., beautiful people demand more) or a supply effect (i.e., beautiful people are made better offers).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer (1999)</xref> used the ultimatum game to investigate this question in a negotiation situation because “the game is free from the influence past relationships, qualifications, or future expectations might exert and designed to disentangle dynamics of the bargaining process” (p. 210). In their experiment, participants were shown photographs of their game partners before they played the ultimatum game either in the role of a proposer or responder. The photographs were judged according to their attractiveness by a separate group of raters that were not involved in the experiment. Solnick and Schweitzer observed that while attractive participants did not demand more than unattractive participants in the responder role, they were offered more. The results of the study thus support the supply hypothesis and refute the demand hypothesis.</p>

<title>Benefits From Adding fMRI</title>
<p>According to W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al. (2011)</xref>, a neuroscience approach can assist organizational researchers in resolving conceptual disagreements. In the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer’s (1999)</xref> study, the findings suggest that the beauty premium results from a supply rather than a demand effect. However, the question why physically attractive people receive favorable treatment in the first place remains unanswered. Two competing explanations in the literature are the physical attractiveness stereotype (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094428112449656">Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, &amp; Longo, 1991</xref>) and taste-based discrimination (G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094428112449656">Becker, 1957</xref>). Applied to the labor market, the physical attractiveness stereotype suggests that attractive employees are favorably treated by employers (e.g., offered higher wages) because they are perceived to be intellectually and socially more competent and hence deserve more. The explanation provided by taste-based discrimination implies that employers treat attractive persons favorably because they derive pleasure from interacting with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1094428112449656">Rosenblat, 2008</xref>). This conceptual disagreement could be resolved by using fMRI to investigate neural activity in the brain’s reward circuitry.</p>
<p>The brain processes stimuli that elicit pleasure (e.g., food, water, drugs, or money) in the reward circuitry, which includes the striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1094428112449656">Schultz, 2002</xref>). Using fMRI, it is possible to determine when these brain regions are activated, which indicates the experience of pleasure. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1094428112449656">Tabibnia, Satpute, and Lieberman (2008)</xref> demonstrates how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer (1999)</xref> could have tested the physical attractiveness stereotype and taste-based discrimination theories against each other by combining the ultimatum game with fMRI observations of the brain’s reward system.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1094428112449656">Tabibnia et al. (2008)</xref> investigated in their study the hedonic value of being treated fairly by others. Similar to the question whether people derive pleasure from interacting with attractive persons, the question here was whether people derive pleasure from fair treatment (in addition to the pleasure that comes from other rewarding effects related to more fairness such as higher monetary offers in the ultimatum game). The researchers addressed this question in an fMRI study in which they scanned the brain reward circuitry of responders in an ultimatum game in which they received either fair or unfair offers. Since fair offers are associated with higher monetary payoffs than unfair offers, one experimental protocol implemented fair and unfair offers of the same monetary value. This allowed the researchers to dissociate the rewarding effects of higher monetary payoffs from the rewarding effects of being treated fairly. Tabibnia et al. found that fair offers led to stronger activations than unfair offers of the same monetary value in brain regions associated with reward processes, including the ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala. This finding supports the interpretation that being treated fairly is intrinsically rewarding over and above the rewarding effect of higher expected payoffs.</p>
<p>In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer (1999)</xref> could have tested whether the brain’s reward system is active while participants interact with attractive people. This would provide strong support for the taste-based discrimination hypothesis. Indeed, a recent fMRI study found that passively viewing beautiful faces led to strong activations in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the brain’s reward circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094428112449656">Aharon et al., 2001</xref>). Along similar lines, Solnick and Schweitzer could have used fMRI in combination with their ultimatum game experiment to answer the question why physically attractive people were favorably treated in the first place.</p>
<p>This of course could be useful in many situations in which members of an organization show a preference for or bias toward one group of people over another. Research on gender biases, racial discrimination, stereotyping, reverse discrimination, or halo effects could potentially all benefit from an examination using a combination of economic games and neuroscience techniques. This would provide clarification regarding the underlying motivational processes for the bias, would help theoretical advancement in these fields, and could maybe even aid in finding efficient interventions to reduce or eliminate the influence that these biases have on mental processing and decision making.</p>

<title>Dictator Game</title>
<sec id="section23-1094428112449656">
<title>Sample Study From Organizational Research</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade and Ariely (2009)</xref> used the dictator game in combination with the ultimatum game to investigate the long-term effects of transient emotions on decision making. While the important role of emotions and their impact on decision making in organizational settings has long been established (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094428112449656">Fisher &amp; Ashkanasy, 2000</xref>), Andrade and Ariely were specifically interested in how pervasive the influence of fleeting incidental emotions is on decision making. This question has important organizational implications. If past emotions indeed affect future decisions even after the original emotional state has long faded away, it is likely that private emotional upheavals will carry over to affect important work-related decisions at a later point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094428112449656">Ariely, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade and Ariely’s (2009)</xref> experiment, participants’ emotions were manipulated (by showing them an angry vs. a happy video) before they played a first ultimatum game in the role of a responder. The results of this ultimatum game confirmed the direct effect of incidental emotions on decision making, namely, participants primed with an angry video were more likely to reject unfair offers (i.e., offers &lt; 50%) than participants primed with a happy video. After the first ultimatum game participants worked on a 20-minute filler task designed to neutralize their emotions. They then played a second ultimatum game in the role of a proposer. The results of this second ultimatum game demonstrated the enduring effect of incidental emotions. Those initially primed with an angry video not only requested more fairness in the first ultimatum game (by rejecting more unfair offers) but also behaved more fairly in the second ultimatum game (by making higher offers).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade and Ariely (2009)</xref> explain that the latter result might either be due to a false-consensus or a behavioral-consistency effect. The false-consensus effect implies that participants offered more in the second ultimatum game because they expected the responder to reject low offers just as they did themselves in the first ultimatum game. The behavioral-consistency effect implies that participants offered more to be consistent in their behavior. The authors subsequently used a dictator game to disentangle the two effects. Participants took on the role of the dictator. Recipients in the dictator game are passive players who cannot reject the dictator’s offer. The false-consensus effect is therefore irrelevant in this setting. If once angry participants still make higher offers as dictators in the final dictator game, this is most likely due to a conscious or unconscious attempt to behave consistently fair across the two ultimatum games and the dictator game. If once angry participants do not make higher offers as dictators, the fact that they made higher offers in the second ultimatum game is most likely due to a false-consensus effect. Andrade and Ariely found that once angry participants were indeed making higher offers in the dictator game, providing support for the behavioral-consistency explanation.</p>
<p>Yet the question of how exactly participants’ past decisions affect their future decision making remains unanswered. The authors discuss two competing explanations: belief-based consistency and mechanical consistency. An explanation based on belief-based consistency implies that when people are confronted with a decision-making situation, they recall past decisions made in a similar context as an indication of their preferences. Applied to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade and Ariely (2009)</xref> study, this means that those initially primed with an angry video made fairer decisions in the second ultimatum game because they recalled their request for more fairness in the first ultimatum game. Hence, they were believed to have a preference for fairness even though their initial fairness was unconsciously triggered by an incidental emotion. The explanation based on mechanical consistency implies that participants mechanically repeat their previous behavioral pattern without making deliberate inferences about the reasons for their past behaviors.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two effects is important as it tells us something about how enduring the impact of incidental emotions on decision making really is. Mechanical consistency will disappear if the time between two decisions is long enough. Belief-based consistency, however, means that “virtually any subsequent action which invokes the same set of beliefs would be indirectly influenced by prior choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade &amp; Ariely, 2009</xref>, p. 7). fMRI can help to separate these two effects.</p>

<title>Benefits From Adding fMRI</title>
<p>If peoples’ past decisions affect their future decisions, creating some form of memory is a necessary precursor. Models of human long-term memory distinguish between two general forms of memory: declarative memory, which refers to the retrieval of memories we consciously recall, and nondeclarative memory, which refers to the unconscious and automatic retrieval of memories required to perform habitual behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1094428112449656">Squire, 2004</xref>). Neuroscience research has demonstrated that declarative and nondeclarative memory processes are related to activity in different brain regions. Declarative memory engages medial temporal lobe structures, while nondeclarative memory engages a number of different brain regions, including the striatum, amygdale, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1094428112449656">Squire, 2004</xref>). From a brain anatomy point of view, the main distinction between the two memory systems is whether or not they engage the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Or, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1094428112449656">Reber (2008)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>To provide a taxonomy for organizing the types of memory, the set of related memory phenomena that depend crucially on the MTL memory system is termed declarative memory while memory that does not depend on the MTL is termed nondeclarative memory. (p. 113)</p>
</disp-quote>A neuroscience study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1094428112449656">Poldrack et al. (2001</xref>, Experiment 1) demonstrates how fMRI can help to distinguish between different forms of memory by depicting the relationship between MTL activation and declarative memory processes, on the one hand, and MTL deactivation and nondeclarative memory processes, on the other hand. Poldrack et al. employed fMRI to compare brain activation patterns while participants performed a baseline task with brain activation during a task that either engaged nondeclarative memory (weather prediction task with feedback-based learning) or declarative memory (weather prediction task with paired-associate learning). In line with theoretical predictions, they found reduced MTL activity during the nondeclarative memory task and increased MTL activity during the declarative memory task when compared to the baseline task.</p>
<p>In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094428112449656">Andrade and Ariely (2009)</xref> could have used fMRI to investigate whether the observed behavioral consistency effect was due to belief-based or mechanical consistency. The explanation based on belief-based consistency emphasizes the role of declarative memory as in this case people consciously recall past decisions made in a similar context as an indication of their preferences. The mechanical explanation, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of nondeclarative memory as in this case people unconsciously and habit-like repeat past behaviors. Monitoring neural activity in the MTL during repeated decision making would make it possible to separate belief-based from mechanical consistency in the Andrade and Ariely study.</p>
<p>This example provides another illustration of how neuroeconomics can assist organizational researchers in resolving conceptual disagreements. As such, the neuroeconomic research approach delivers on the promises made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al.

<title>Synthetic Task Environments</title>
<p>In the previous sections of this article we have focused on introducing the traditional approach to neuroeconomics that combines experimental economic games with neuroscience methods. As described, this approach maximizes the researcher’s control over the situation and over the introduced variables, which in turn allows the researcher to make causal inferences about the relationship between the focal variables in the design. On the flipside, organizational research often bemoans that with increased experimental control comes a lack of fidelity. How can we trust that findings from a contrived laboratory setting generalize to real settings, in which participants are influenced by many more factors and variables? On the other hand, field research suffers from a lack of control such that researchers can rarely be certain that the variables they study are not in fact influenced by other variables they did not measure. The trade-off between control and fidelity has long been a serious problem for the credibility and applicability of organizational research.</p>
<p>As a response to this dilemma, an increasing number of researchers use methods that try to balance control and fidelity. One of these is a group of methods termed <italic>synthetic task environments</italic>. Synthetic task environments encompass a large number of different methodologies that provide a realistic setting in which participants can engage in tasks that to a varying degree resemble tasks in the real world of organizations. In particular, synthetic task environments aim at recreating the psychological conditions that are incumbent in organizational work while at the same time providing a safe environment to manipulate conditions to better test relationships between variables of interest to the researcher. One of the main advantages of synthetic task environments is that they simulate the dynamic environment in which members of organizations, and in particular teams, operate. This allows researchers to study team collaboration in more realistic settings than some of the experimental tasks introduced previously would be able to allow. In that sense, as a methodology, synthetic task environments represent a bridge between largely constrained lab settings that provide high internal validity and largely unconstrained field settings that provide high external validity.</p>
<p>A recent review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094428112449656">Dietz et al. (2012)</xref> introduces different synthetic task environments and summarizes their benefits, challenges, and the possibilities for future use of these techniques in organizational settings. The authors discuss video games and simulations, microworlds, and virtual worlds as examples. We believe that it is of value to explore synthetic task environments as an alternative to economic games for situations in which high fidelity is crucial. While we believe that experimental control is a very important advantage of economic games, we also acknowledge that researchers in some situations are more concerned about fidelity than about control. In these situations, synthetic task environments can provide a more realistic setting while still maintaining some experimental control. In the following, we would like to explore the utility of synthetic task environments for organizational researchers by providing a sample study that has used a synthetic task environment.</p>

<title>Sample Study From Organizational Research</title>
<p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094428112449656">Marks, Zaccaro, and Mathieu (2000)</xref> examines the effects of team mental models on team performance. Team mental models are knowledge structures that team members form about the roles, tasks, and processes necessary to perform a given task. In this study, the authors test how the relationship between mental models and team performance is mediated by communication processes, the idea being that quality communication between team members is the mechanism through which team members put mental models into action. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the formation of mental models is positively affected by pre-mission leader briefings and team interaction training. A particular characteristic of this study is that the authors argue that the relationships between variables will be strengthened in novel situations. They give the example of action teams, which often carry out their work in highly unfamiliar and ambiguous situations.</p>
<p>To test their hypotheses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094428112449656">Marks et al. (2000)</xref> engaged participants in teams of three in a simulation task called Team Wargame Interaction Simulation Training. In this simulation, each team member operates a tank. Each player can control his or her own tank (i.e., movement, shooting, aiming, etc.), but not the tanks of the other participants. To coordinate with each other, team members had to communicate via headsets. The team’s task was to shoot 10 enemy targets and, once shot, to move these targets into their own territory. Only two of the three tanks were able to shoot at targets, and only one tank was able to move objects. Accordingly, the team members had to figure out how to collaborate to solve their task.</p>
<p>Prior to the actual simulation, the experimental group received a video-based team interaction training that provided suggestion for how to coordinate the team members’ interactions. The control group watched a video that laid out all the task information but did not provide team interaction training. In addition, all teams received leader briefings, but only for one group did the briefing contain information about significant risks in the simulation and how to overcome them, opportunities on the battlefield, and action priorities. All teams first performed in a routine environment and then performed in two novel environments.</p>
<p>Team mental models were measured before team performance periods by having participants complete team interaction concept maps, in which team members were asked to map out the actions they believed were necessary to complete the task. These maps were then assessed regarding their similarity across team members and their accuracy as judged by external raters. Team communication was recorded during the game and then content coded by external raters via preexisting categories for quality of team communication. Team performance was assessed based on the actual number of enemy targets destroyed and moved. Participants played three rounds of the simulation.</p>
<p>Findings show that leader briefings, revealing important information, and team interaction training prior to task performance created more similar and more accurate mental models among the team members. These two factors also resulted in better adaptation to novel environments. Communication processes mediated the relationship between shared mental models and team performance as predicted. The authors continue to discuss the importance of mental models as information-processing structures.</p>
<p>One critical aspect of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094428112449656">Marks et al. (2000)</xref> study is that the relationship between shared mental models, team communication quality, and team performance remains a “black box.” While the authors observe a significant relationship of team communication quality with both mental model similarity and team performance, it remains unclear whether communication processes indeed mediated this relationship. For example, it is also possible that shared mental models lead to improved team performance because team members form emotional bonds and have more positive and rewarding experiences during task performance. As a side effect of these affective influences, the team’s communication quality may also improve. In the following section, we highlight how fMRI could help to open this black box by investigating what is actually happening in the neural circuits while participants are playing to pinpoint more precisely the effects that shared mental models have on team communication processes.</p>

<sec id="section27-1094428112449656">
<title>Benefits From Adding fMRI</title>
<p>Communication involves the processing of incoming and outgoing information. Human information-processing capacities are, however, severely limited (e.g., G. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094428112449656">Miller, 1956</xref>). It is of no use to communicate information to individuals who are cognitively overloaded as they lack the capacity to process the information. High-quality team communication that leads to improved team performance requires accordingly a balanced distribution of task-related information among team members to avoid that some team members are cognitively over- or underloaded. Shared mental models allow teams to better predict the resource needs of team members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1094428112449656">Klimoski &amp; Mohammed, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1094428112449656">Rouse, Cannon-Bowers, &amp; Salas, 1992</xref>). As such, they are better able than teams without shared mental models to estimate the cognitive capabilities and loads of individual team members and distribute information accordingly. One way through which communication processes can mediate the relationship between shared mental models and team performance is, therefore, by balancing the utilization of the limited cognitive resources within the team.</p>
<p>Using fMRI, it is possible to investigate the cognitive processing capacity curves of individual team members while they are engaged in synthetic task environments. One of the biggest advantages of fMRI techniques is that measurement happens exactly at the same moment that a stimulus is processed. Thus, specific communication processes during the game or simulation become intimately linked to neural responses and cognitive processing of the neural stimuli. As already outlined previously, cognitive processes trigger activation in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., E. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1094428112449656">Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>). fMRI observations of activity in the prefrontal cortex provide, therefore, a direct indication of cognitive processing and the related level of cognitive load or working memory utilization.</p>
<p>Previous studies have used brain imaging techniques in a similar way, assessing the impact of cognitive load on information processing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094428112449656">Jansma, Ramsey, Zwart, Gelderen, and Duyn (2007)</xref>, for example, used fMRI to investigate effortful information processing in a working memory task and demonstrated strong activations in the prefrontal cortex in relation to cognitive effort. Similarly, by including fMRI into their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094428112449656">Marks et al. (2000)</xref> could have measured participants’ cognitive processing capacity curves during communication. If team members of teams with more similar mental models also show more similar activations in the prefrontal cortex during communication (without some members being cognitively over- or underloaded), it can be concluded that they have higher quality communication processes that better balance the team’s limited cognitive resources than other teams communicating under the same conditions. If the former teams also perform better, it can further be concluded that communication processes mediate the relationship between shared mental models and team performance. This would be one way how fMRI could help open the black box between shared mental models and team performance.</p>
<p>Being that we are not aware of previous studies that combined synthetic task environments and fMRI techniques, we believe it is important to think about some of the potential challenges to this combination. First, synthetic task environments are often used to study teams, such as in the example of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094428112449656">Marks et al. (2000)</xref>. In order to study complex team phenomena such as team mental models, it is important to be able to assess cognitive processing of all team members simultaneously. New developments in fMRI techniques allow researchers to assess the cognitive processing of several participants at the same time. Hyperscanning allows the simultaneous fMRI scanning of multiple individuals that are all engaged in the same task. For this, each individual lies in his or her own fMRI tube and the recording of the fMRIs are synchronized. In this way, participants’ brain activation patterns can be recorded simultaneously, while they are all engaged in the same task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094428112449656">Montague et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, several types of synthetic task environments require individuals to move around a lot or to physically interact with their team members. In these situations, fMRI might be impractical as participants have to lay almost motionless inside the MRI tube. In these cases, other more portable neuroscience methods such as wireless EEG systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094428112449656">Berka et al., 2004</xref>) or wearable NIRS systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094428112449656">Hoshi, 2005</xref>) could also be used to measure cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094428112449656">Antonenko, Paas, Grabner, &amp; Van Gog, 2010</xref>). However, many synthetic task environments that are currently used are in fact computer simulations in which participants use a joystick and talk via a headset with their team members. These kinds of tasks could still be relatively easily accommodated by traditional fMRI techniques.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of the current article is to introduce neuroeconomic research methods to organizational researchers and to demonstrate the benefits that a combined experimental/neuroscience approach can have for theory development, testing, pruning, and the development of new research directions. It is important to note that we are not trying to sell this approach as the magic bullet. Rather, we would like to offer it as an approach that can provide one important piece to the puzzle. We believe that research questions should be illuminated using different methodologies and that triangulation of research methods can help researchers develop a more complete picture of the relationships between variables. Using neuroeconomics provides one important angle for researchers to better understand the underlying motivational and cognitive processes behind observable behavior. This in turn can have great benefits for gaining a deeper understanding of our constructs of interest and for building better theories.</p>
<p>The current article tries to demonstrate the advantages of neuroeconomics and the potential insights that can be gained from applying it to organizational research questions. We introduced four common economic game/neuroscience combinations and explored how they could improve current organizational research. We also discussed how neuroscience methods could be applied to synthetic task environments, a more commonly used organizational research method. In the following, we want to discuss the specific strengths inherent in using a combination of experimental design and neuroscience. We then discuss some limitations of this approach and how they might be overcome. We conclude with a discussion of the implications this approach might have for future applications of neuroeconomic techniques to organizational studies.</p>
<sec id="section29-1094428112449656">
<title>Strengths of This Approach</title>
<p>We believe that the core strength of neuroeconomics is that it provides the opportunity to open up the black box of mental processes behind a given observable behavior. The fact that neuroeconomics pairs neuroscience methods with specific, well-developed experimental designs allows researchers to isolate behaviors and to then explore the neural substrates of these behaviors. With the experimental design, researchers can first infer causality between variables and then determine why and how participants chose to respond in a particular way. More importantly, this method can help break down the mental processes that led to a given behavior. This can aid researchers to draw conclusion regarding why participants act in certain ways in a given situation. We believe that answering the why question is the core purpose of organizational research.</p>
<p>In their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094428112449656">2000</xref> work, Kozlowski and Klein argue:<disp-quote>
<p>Many phenomena in organizations have their theoretical foundation in the cognition, affect, behavior, and characteristics of individuals, which—through social interaction, exchange, and amplification—have emergent properties that manifest at higher levels. In other words, many collective constructs represent the aggregate influence of individuals. (p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote>Following this line of thought, it seems even more important to understand the micro-level foundations of behaviors, cognitions, and affect. Individual-level constructs form the basis of higher level constructs and processes that emerge in organizations. These higher-level constructs can only be fully understood, if we can understand the constructs at the micro level.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of understanding the underlying motivational and cognitive processes of individual behaviors is to build better, more accurate theories. The field of organizational research has seen a recent increase in calls for better theory development and testing, bemoaning a lack of real understanding of the processes underlying behaviors and a lack of rigor when it comes to theory testing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094428112449656">Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094428112449656">Leavitt et al., 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094428112449656">Edwards (2010)</xref> put it:<disp-quote>
<p>In the interest of theory development, management and organizational research would make better progress if we devoted more attention to theoretical refinement, conducting research that identifies the boundaries and limitations of theories, stages competitive tests between rival theories, and increases the precision of theories so they yield strong predictions that can be falsified. (p. 615)</p>
</disp-quote>Along these lines, W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al. (2011)</xref> argue that neuroscience techniques can be especially helpful in uncovering underlying processes and aid in developing better theories. It can further assist in testing competing theories against each other by providing an alternative lens for assessing the underlying processes of observed behaviors. We believe that neuroeconomics goes even one step further. Coupling the experimental design with neuroscience techniques, it can offer method triangulation to test theories in multiple ways and test the reliability of our conclusions across multiple methods. We believe that triangulation is currently undervalued and underutilized in organizational research.</p>

<title>Limitations of this Approach</title>
<sec id="section31-1094428112449656">
<title>External validity</title>
<p>Despite the promises of the neuroeconomic research approach, it is also important to recognize and understand its limitations. Neuroeconomics suffers from the general limitations common to all experimental laboratory research. In this context, organizational researchers are typically most concerned that laboratory research may not easily generalize to the “real world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094428112449656">Highhouse, 2009</xref>). While we acknowledge that external validity is not a particular strength of laboratory experiments, we hold that there is convincing empirical evidence suggesting that findings from lab-based studies will generalize to field settings. In several meta-analyses investigating the correspondence between lab-based and field-based effect sizes it was demonstrated that laboratory research achieves a high degree of external validity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094428112449656">Anderson, Lindsay, and Bushman (1999)</xref>, for example, aggregated the results of 38 different meta-analyses and observed a .73 correlation between lab effect sizes and field effect sizes of conceptually similar variables.</p>
<p>Furthermore, generalizability involves an understanding of the processes underlying outcomes. Two quotes demonstrate how this applies to neuroeconomics. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1094428112449656">Shapiro (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094428112449656">Highhouse (2009)</xref> argues that “the ability to generalize from one situation to another requires an understanding of underlying principles and recognizing which principles apply in which situations” (p. 556). W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al. (2011)</xref> point out that “neural mechanisms are largely homogenous across all individuals and are recruited to respond to numerous different organizational situations. That is to say, each neuron operates in the same way, and all brains are organized in a similar fashion” (p. 936). Neuroeconomics provides us with an understanding of the neural principles underlying various economic behaviors that are likely to apply in a similar way across different situations. As such, neuroeconomics fulfills the requirements for generalizability stipulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094428112449656">Highhouse (2009)</xref>. In this context it is also important to reiterate that external validity should be established by method triangulation and, hence, assessed across a range of studies on the same topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094428112449656">Colquitt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094428112449656">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1094428112449656">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>). For a more comprehensive discussion of the external validity of laboratory experiments in organizational research, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094428112449656">Colquitt (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094428112449656">Highhouse (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094428112449656">Moore and Flynn (2008)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1094428112449656">
<title>Reverse inference</title>
<p>Neuroeconomics research using brain imaging techniques such as fMRI also suffers from a problem of reverse inference, a general limitation common to most brain imaging research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094428112449656">Aguirre &amp; D’Esposito, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1094428112449656">Poldrack, 2006</xref>). The reverse inference problem arises when one brain imaging study shows that a mental process such as fear leads to activations in brain region X and a later study that observes activations in brain region X concludes that the subject experiences fear. However, brain regions can support different mental processes. Activations in brain region X can indicate fear but also other mental process associated with this region.</p>
<p>The reverse inference practice becomes increasingly problematic when inferences are drawn about very specific mental processes such as specific emotions. It is a comparatively lesser problem when less specific processes such as emotions in general are considered. Take, for example, the question whether a specific task is related to increased emotional or cognitive processing. Increased activity in the limbic system (the emotional center of the brain) during the performance of the task would suggest that the task involves increased emotional processing. The competing hypothesis, namely, that the task involves increased cognitive processing, is very unlikely related to increased activity in the emotional center of the brain. Reverse inference is therefore relatively unproblematic in this example.</p>
<p>Reverse inference would be more problematic when drawing conclusions about the different emotional processes involved in the task. The relevant processes are likely to activate the same or closely connected structures in the brain’s emotional center, making inferences to a specific process difficult. Thus, in order to correctly apply reverse inference, it is required to have an understanding of the extent to which the source of inference (i.e., the brain activation pattern) could potentially reflect different mental processes and to what degree the different mental processes are relevant for the research question at hand (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094428112449656">Cacioppo et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Like any research method, reverse inference is most valid within the right context. It is best used in the context of a stream of research, as a first step for generating hypotheses and ideas that are then tested in follow-up studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1094428112449656">Poldrack and Wagner (2004)</xref> concluded, therefore, that:<disp-quote>
<p>The reverse-inference approach is strongest when it is used not as an ad hoc means to explain the occurrence of particular activations in a single study, but rather as a tool to drive hypotheses that are then tested in subsequent experiments. (p. 180)</p>
</disp-quote>In conclusion, both with reference to external validity and reverse inference, it is important to recognize that neuroeconomics must be embedded in a broader research stream, complemented by traditional organizational research methods (see also W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094428112449656">Becker &amp; Cropanzano, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1094428112449656">
<title>Costs and practicality</title>
<p>A general drawback of fMRI is the high costs involved in purchasing, maintaining, and using fMRI scanners. In particular, the high costs per hour of use make it difficult to achieve the large sample sizes that are conventional in organizational research. While research has shown that the statistical power of fMRI data is relatively robust with small participant numbers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094428112449656">Friston, Holmes, &amp; Worsley, 1999</xref>), even these small sample studies can be quite expensive (for a discussion of the required number of participants in an fMRI study, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094428112449656">Desmond &amp; Glover, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094428112449656">Murphy &amp; Garavan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another drawback of fMRI is the restrictions of the scanner tube that requires participants to remain almost motionless in a supine position and, hence, constrains the kind of tasks that can be used in combination with fMRI. If costs and practicality of fMRI are of concern, there are a number of alternative brain imaging techniques available. While these techniques are generally inferior to fMRI in terms of spatial resolution, their employment requires less administrative and monetary effort.</p>
<p>One of these alternatives is electroencephalography (EEG). This method uses electrodes placed at specified locations on the scalp to measure electrical activity that results from neurons firing in the brain during brain activity. Given that EEG allows participants to sit upright while being investigated, the method is easier to use, but also less expensive and more portable than fMRI. The most important disadvantage of EEG is a relatively low spatial resolution resulting from a large number of possible configurations of brain sources that can cause the measured electrical activity at the scalp. An exemplary study that used EEG to study topics of relevance to business research comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094428112449656">Hannah, Balthazard, Waldman, and Jennings (2008)</xref>. They used EEG technology to investigate how individual differences in cognition and affect are related to leadership performance and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a complementary method to EEG that also uses sensors arranged on the surface of the head (fixed in a helmet design) to measure brain activity. MEG measures changes in the magnetic field below the scalp that are associated with changes in the electrical field during brain activity. The spatial resolution of MEG and EEG is very similar. Yet, MEG is more sensitive to activity in deeper brain regions than EEG, but also more expensive and less portable. MEG has, for example, been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094428112449656">Ambler, Braeutigam, Stins, Rose, and Swithenby (2004)</xref> to investigate how consumers make buying decisions.</p>
<p>While EEG and MEG analyze electromagnetic activity of the brain, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures changes in cerebral blood oxygenation to examine the activation of different brain areas. Similar to fMRI, NIRS exploits the fact that a local increase in neural activity leads to an increased flow of oxygenated blood to the involved brain region. NIRS uses near-infrared light from light sources placed on the scalp to measure the absorption and scatter of that light by the skull and underlying cortical tissue, which depends on the level of cerebral blood oxygenation. In comparison to fMRI, NIRS measurement devices are smaller, more portable, less obtrusive, and less expensive to purchase and maintain. The spatial resolution of NIRS is, however, relatively poor compared to fMRI. An example of how NIRS can be used in business research comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094428112449656">Lin, Tuan, and Chiu (2010)</xref>, who explored the neural correlates of consumer preferences for product brands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-1094428112449656">
<title>Other limitations</title>
<p>In addition to the previous points, there are a number of other limitations that should be mentioned here. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094428112449656">Powell (2011)</xref> discussed the mereological fallacy problem (M. R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094428112449656">Bennett &amp; Hacker, 2003</xref>), the problem inherent in focusing exclusively on the human brain and ascribing activities such as thinking, feeling, and believing that result from the interactions of different parts of the human body to a single organ. He also pointed to critics lamenting implausibly high correlations resulting from flawed data analysis techniques employed in social neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1094428112449656">Vul, Harris, Winkielman, &amp; Pashler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar critique of the statistical techniques used to interpret fMRI data comes from C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094428112449656">Bennett, Miller, and Wolford (2009)</xref>, who demonstrated that random noise and uncorrected statistical thresholds can lead to ridiculous fMRI results. These researchers scanned the brain of a dead Atlantic salmon while showing it photographs of humans in different social situations. They observed evidence of neural activity in the dead fish’s brain in response to the pictures, a result that is of course a statistical artifact that could have been avoided by using more conservative forms of correction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, related to the previous discussion of external validity, one might question how far brain activity during fMRI scans that require participants to lay almost motionless inside a MRI tube resembles the brain activity of human participants in organizational settings. As one reviewer put it: “I wonder to what extent research using these methods in lab contexts would generate results that could not hold in the field, in which sometimes the decision maker, within the work context, reviews information on the computer, paces the office, gesticulates when thinking about consequences of the possible decisions, choices, etc., etc.” This is an interesting point that applies to all research that attempts to employ neuroscience techniques to address questions in business research, including neuromarketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094428112449656">Ariely &amp; Berns, 2010</xref>), neurostrategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094428112449656">Powell, 2011</xref>), and organizational neuroscience (W. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). This critique could be addressed in the future by comparing fMRI results to findings from more portable brain imaging techniques that allow participants to move around such as wearable NIRS systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094428112449656">Hoshi, 2005</xref>) or wireless EEG systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094428112449656">Berka et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, as with any research method, there are limitations associated with neuroscience and neuroeconomics. Some of these, including those related to data analysis techniques, will certainly be resolved in the future. Others, such as general concerns about external validity, will remain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094428112449656">Powell (2011)</xref>, therefore, concluded that “in the short run, neuroscience will continue to ride a steep growth curve in the social sciences, and its long run contributions will be assessed on a timescale of decades” (p. 1491). Overall, given the evidence regarding the utility of this approach, we believe that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>How can neuroeconomics be effectively integrated into organizational research? As a first step, organizational researchers can build on the large number of existing neuroeconomics studies and apply their findings to topics of relevance to organizational research. Take, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094428112449656">Solnick and Schweitzer’s (1999)</xref> study of the beauty premium. The controversy surrounding the two most prominent explanations for the beauty premium, namely, the physical attractiveness stereotype and taste-based discrimination, could have been illuminated with existing neuroscience evidence indicating that the brain’s reward system is active while people look at attractive persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094428112449656">Aharon et al., 2001</xref>). This approach mirrors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094428112449656">W. J. Becker et al.’s (2011)</xref> recommendation “that everyone keep abreast of the findings and themes emerging from basic neuroscience research and consider how these might influence and inform their own research” (p. 951). Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094428112449656">Powell (2011)</xref> argued from a strategic management point of view that “behavioral neuroscience has left a large trove of neural evidence to be mined for insights in strategic management, and neuroeconomics in particular has acted as a silent benefactor to behavioral strategy” (p. 1491). He also warned that “researchers who do not keep informed of developments in behavioral neuroscience will find themselves facing theoretical claims and empirical data they do not understand” (p. 1491).</p>
<p>As a next step, organizational researchers should consider applying neuroeconomics methods in their own research. Some organizational scholars have already employed economic games to study their topic of interest, as the previous examples demonstrate. The next challenge will be to combine economic games with neuroscience methods for more rigorous theory testing and the development of new theories. The technical sophistication of many neuroscience methods can best be overcome by collaborations with experienced neuroscientists and neuroeconomists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094428112449656">Powell (2011)</xref> recommends building relationships with researchers from these disciplines to develop joint research agendas. He suggests that “these relationships will lead to arrangements such as collaboratively funded research projects, joint research seminars, and joint doctoral scholarships” (p. 1495). Ultimately, organizational researchers face the same challenges as economists did when they began to incorporate neuroscience into their research. Economists have met this challenge remarkably well and benefited greatly from this new research perspective. This article concludes, therefore, by encouraging organizational researchers to venture into this novel field of research. The potential gains of such efforts promise to be substantial.</p>
