<abstract>
<p>This study aims to integrate self-leadership into a more comprehensive leadership model. Therefore, it examines the relationship between self-leadership, transformational leadership, and work motivation (i.e., self-efficacy and instrumentality) relative to job performance and affective commitment. In addition, the influence of the work environment is of interest for a more comprehensive leadership model. Thus, the moderating role of virtuality was examined. Three competing models of self-leadership, which are theoretically plausible, are compared in this study: self-leadership acting (a) as a process factor mediating the relation between transformational leadership and employee motivation; (b) as an input factor, simultaneously with transformational leadership; and (c) as a process factor mediating the relation between work motivation and job performance/affective commitment. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that self-leadership is a process factor that mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and employee motivation. Results further suggest that self-leadership has a higher influence on motivation in virtual work structures compared with colocated work structures. Limitations, implications for management, and suggestions for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051811425047">Manz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Neck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>) is defined as a process by which individuals control their own behavior, influencing and leading themselves by using specific sets of behavioral and cognitive strategies. First emerging in the mid-1980’s, the concept of self-leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051811425047">Manz, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051811425047">1986</xref>) began as an expansion of self-management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 1980</xref>), which was grounded in clinical self-control theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051811425047">Cautela, 1969</xref>) and inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051811425047">Kerr and Jermier’s (1978)</xref> concept of substitutes for leadership. Over the past 20+ years, the self-leadership construct has enjoyed considerable popularity, as evidenced by the large number of practitioner-oriented self-leadership books and articles on the subject (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051811425047">Manz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Manz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1548051811425047">Sims &amp; Manz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1548051811425047">Waitley, 1995</xref>). The credibility of self-leadership as a distinct topic of study is greatly supported by the <italic>Journal of Management’s</italic> recent review of the self-leadership field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1548051811425047">Stewart, Courtright, &amp; Manz, 2011</xref>). Further evidence of self-leadership’s respect among many academics is reﬂected by a plethora of theoretical and empirical self-leadership journal publications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051811425047">Anderson &amp; Prussia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051811425047">Houghton, Neck, &amp; Manz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt, Andressen, &amp; Ellwart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051811425047">Markham &amp; Markham, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1548051811425047">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Manz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051811425047">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia, Anderson, &amp; Manz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1548051811425047">Stewart, Carson, &amp; Cardy, 1996</xref>) and by coverage in a number of management and leadership textbooks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1548051811425047">McShane &amp; Von Glinow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1548051811425047">Nahavandi, 2006</xref>). Industry executives have also embraced self-leadership concepts through training programs designed to increase self-leadership skills and behaviors in the workplace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Manz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1548051811425047">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it has enjoyed an enduring and expanding popularity based on a strong intuitive appeal, self-leadership has not been without developmental problems and criticisms. Perhaps the most common criticism of self-leadership is that it is not differentiated strongly enough from classic theories of motivation such as self-regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck and Houghton (2006)</xref> addressed these criticisms by providing a theoretical and conceptual explanation of the self-leadership concept relative to several related theories of motivation.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that the majority of self-leadership research has been conceptual, with relatively few empirical studies examining self-leadership in organizational settings. This article attempts to fill this particular void in the literature. Specifically, this article will describe an empirically based study examining self-leadership within the context of traditional leadership.</p>
<p>Traditional leadership describes forms of leadership where a leader exerts social influence on the employees to accomplish a common task. Self-leadership indicates autonomous work organization but does not exclude the controlling influence of a supervisor. Different self-leadership strategies are close to the processes that are proposed by traditional leadership forms and may be cultivated by external leaders. For example, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051811425047">Bandura’s (1991)</xref> social cognitive theory of self-regulation, self-leadership includes a process of (self-) goal setting and motivation, which is also an essential part of traditional leadership. Transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051811425047">Bass, 1985</xref>), which is a prominent type of traditional leadership, seems to be an adequate instrument for fostering employees’ self-leadership, by encouraging them to think independently, to develop their own ideas, and to critically question their results. The clarification of the combined influence of these two leadership forms should add to the understanding of how leadership works.</p>
<p>Generally, leadership research has emphasized success factors, such as communication styles, personality, and behaviors that positively relate to and predict positive outcomes such as job performance and affective commitment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1548051811425047">Yukl, 2002</xref>). However, beside prediction, it is important to understand the processes that explain these relations. Thus, the first aim of this study is to examine transformational leadership and self-leadership as they relate to team members’ motivation and outcomes. Self-leadership is examined as a part of a more comprehensive traditional leadership model, and the aim is to integrate self-leadership into this model by identifying its contribution to the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, work environments have to be considered, as they may have an important influence on the leadership processes. Work environments are increasingly characterized by spatial and temporal distribution of employees and the use of electronic communication devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051811425047">Kozlowski &amp; Bell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1548051811425047">Pauleen, 2003</xref>). The influence of a virtual work environment (where leaders are more separated from team members) on the leadership process has been considered (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel, Geister, &amp; Konradt, 2005</xref>). Also, the role of self-leadership within virtual teams has been discussed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051811425047">Zigurs, 2003</xref>). In this context, self-leadership warrants more investigation since it provides a possibility to overcome the decreased influence of a leader because of the lack of face-to-face interaction and the increase in asynchronous communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, increased autonomy and personal responsibility associated with self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051811425047">Zigurs, 2003</xref>) are important factors for successful virtual work structures. Thus, the second aim of this study is to examine the moderating role of virtuality on the relations between transformational leadership, self-leadership, and motivation.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811425047">Avolio’s (2007)</xref> call for more integrative strategies in leadership theory building, our leadership model includes the interaction of leaders, followers, and context. Self-leadership and (to some extent) motivation of followers can be interpreted as cognitive elements of the theory. Individual leader–follower behavior is described by the link between transformational leadership, self-leadership, and motivation. Finally, context is represented by the team context and virtual work structures.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section2-1548051811425047">
<title>Input–Mediator–Output Models</title>
<p>Success in teams can be described by input–mediator–output (IMO) models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051811425047">Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051811425047">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>). These provide an opportunity to explain the influence of leadership as an input factor on outcomes in a comprehensive model. Several scholars have pointed out that team structure and intrateam processes have a substantial influence on the behavioral and affective outcomes of individuals and teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811425047">Hackman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1548051811425047">Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001</xref>) and have considered different mediating processes that explain the relationship between certain input factors with team effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051811425047">Ilgen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051811425047">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>). Despite their theoretical and practical relevance, previous research has hardly addressed individual self-leadership in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811425047">Hauschildt &amp; Konradt, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1548051811425047">Uhl-Bien &amp; Graen, 1998</xref>). Since teamwork is a popular work form and self-leadership may be useful to overcome problems in virtual teams, we intend to examine the role of individual self-leadership as a part of the team process, based on an IMO model. We posit transformational leadership as an input factor and team members’ motivation as a mediator. Outcome factors in our IMO model are job performance and affective commitment to include both behavioral and affective outcomes. Job performance is often associated with the success of a team and has been discussed and examined in the context of self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, we intend to focus on affective commitment, as it is an important outcome variable in self-leadership literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>). Self-leading individuals may show high levels of commitment to their tasks, goals, teams, or organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>) because they often develop a sense of ownership of their tasks and work processes. However, no empirical examinations to date have attempted to substantiate these claims.</p>

<title>Self-Leadership</title>
<p>Self-leadership is defined as a process that is used to improve self-motivation and to influence self-direction; both are important for effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051811425047">Manz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Neck, 2004</xref>). The concept of self-leadership is based on the assumptions of social-cognition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811425047">Bandura, 1986</xref>), as well as theories of self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051811425047">Mahoney &amp; Arnkoff, 1979</xref>), self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811425047">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051811425047">Kanfer, 1970</xref>), and self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 1980</xref>), the latter focusing predominately on behavioral strategies. Self-leadership strategies, which include behavioral and mental techniques, are designed to influence personal effectiveness positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>) and are grouped into behavior-focused strategies, natural reward strategies, and cognitive thought pattern strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Neck, 2004</xref>). Behavior-focused strategies are intended to increase an individual’s self-awareness and are aimed at fostering behavioral management, particularly when it comes to necessary but unpleasant tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Neck, 2004</xref>). Natural reward strategies focus on the inherently enjoyable aspects of a given task or activity. These create feelings of competence, self-control, and purpose by enhancing intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051811425047">Manz, 1986</xref>). Finally, constructive thought pattern strategies facilitate the generation of habitual ways of thinking that positively influence performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Manz, 1992</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz and Neck (2004)</xref>, these strategies enable individuals to identify dysfunctional beliefs and create new thought patterns or change existing thoughts into more positive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As stated above, self-leadership’s most prominent criticism is that it is conceptually indistinct from and redundant with classic theories of motivation such as self-regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck and Houghton (2006)</xref> addressed these criticisms by providing a theoretical and conceptual explanation of the relationship between self-leadership concept and theories of motivation. To summarize, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck and Houghton (2006)</xref> argue that when critics suggest that self-leadership overlaps with other classic theories of motivation, they are failing to understand that self-leadership is a normative model rather than a descriptive or deductive theory. Normative theories, which are common in applied fields such as business, are prescriptive and emphasize how something should be done. In contrast, deductive or descriptive theories seek to explain the basic operation of various phenomena but generally stop short of providing specific normative advice for managing a particular process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051811425047">Hilton (1980)</xref> has suggested, normative and descriptive theories often take differing perspectives in examining the same phenomenon. Indeed, descriptive theories can often help explain how and why the prescriptions of normative theories operate. In summary, self-leadership is a normative concept that provides certain behavioral and cognitive prescriptions while operating within and through the theoretical contexts provided by self-regulation, social cognitive, self-control, and intrinsic motivation theories.</p>
<p>Field studies and experimental studies both suggest a positive relationship between self-leadership and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>) and individuals’ performance in teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811425047">Hauschildt &amp; Konradt, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, self-efficacy has been found to mediate the relationship between self-leadership, performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>), and the perceived impact of personal effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that commitment is another outcome variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>). Empirical evidence, however, is missing. Based on these considerations, this study intends to shed light on the relationship between self-leadership and commitment.</p>

<title>Transformational Leadership and Motivation in Teams</title>
<p>Several researchers have discussed followers’ self-leadership in the context of transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1548051811425047">Yun, Cox, &amp; Sims, 2006</xref>). Transformational leadership is described as a process of inspiring subordinates to share and pursue the leader’s vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051811425047">Bass, 1985</xref>) and of motivating others to move beyond their own self-interests and work for the aims of the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811425047">Bass, 1999</xref>). As a multidimensional construct, transformational leadership is defined by four dimensions: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized considerations. By playing the part of a role model and encouraging subordinates to create new, constructive thought patterns, as well as to develop new ideas and think independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811425047">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990</xref>), a transformational leader may positively influence individuals’ self-leadership.</p>
<p>To examine the impact of leadership on outcomes, it is important to focus on the dynamics underlying the relationship between self-leadership by followers, transformational leadership by supervisors, and outcomes. Motivation is often discussed as a mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051811425047">Ambrose &amp; Kulik, 1999</xref>). Expectancy value theories are a prominent class of theories describing processes of employee motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1548051811425047">Vroom, 1964</xref>). Since motivational processes are not only crucial for individuals but also for the performance of teams, the collective effort model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051811425047">Karau &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>) extends traditional expectancy value models by combining them with self-evaluation theory to explain individual motivation in groups. Based on this model, we consider two important predictors of individuals’ motivation in teams: instrumentality, the perceived indispensability of personal effort for the team outcome, and self-efficacy, the perceived capability to perform the required activities for the team.</p>
<p>Derived from the diverse theoretical background, different relations between self-leadership, transformational leadership, motivation, and outcomes become possible. In the first model, self-leadership is influenced by transformational leadership and acts as a mediator variable. As stated above, a primary goal of transformational leadership is the encouragement of self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811425047">Avolio &amp; Gibbons, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811425047">Bass and Avolio (1990)</xref> argue that transformational leadership facilitates followers’ abilities to think independently and creatively. Empirical evidence of the relationship between transformational leadership and employee empowerment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811425047">Dvir, Eden, Avolio, &amp; Shamir, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051811425047">Jung, Chow, &amp; Wu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051811425047">Jung &amp; Sosik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051811425047">Kark, Shamir, &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>) supports consideration of transformational leadership as an input factor for self-leadership. The role of self-leadership as a motivation-determining component becomes apparent in the definition as self-leadership is supposed to improve self-motivation. The goal-setting function of self-leadership further clarifies the motivating character of self-leadership. Moreover, the motivational variable of self-efficacy is the most widely used outcome variable in the context of self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>). Therefore, self-leadership can be conceived as a process that determines work motivation. Thus, in Model 1, self-leadership is initiated by transformational leadership and acts as a process factor that subsequently increases employee motivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051811425047">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548051811425047-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Besides this model, other relationships are theoretically possible. In a second model, self-leadership can be understood as an input factor and acts parallel to transformational leadership. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051811425047">Manz and Sims (1980)</xref>, self-management is conceived as a substitute for leadership. The authors argue that self-management amplifies employee’s behavioral modification in addition to a leader’s action. Based on these theoretical considerations, it can be assumed that self-leadership and transformational leadership operate as simultaneous input factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548051811425047">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-1548051811425047" position="float">

<caption><p>Self-leadership as an input factor (Model 2)</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548051811425047-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally, in a plausible third model, self-leadership might act as a process variable that is subsequent to motivation. As the concept of self-leadership is derived from self-regulation theory and self-control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>), it can be conceptualized as a volitional process that is needed to finalize an initiated task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548051811425047">Figure 3</xref>). These assumptions are based on the Rubicon model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811425047">Heckhausen &amp; Gollwitzer, 1987</xref>), which is built on the consideration that once a decision is made, the predecision process of motivation is finished and the volitional state of implementation is needed to complete the activity. When applied to self-leadership, this means that if an individual decides to engage in a certain action (i.e., motivation), self-leadership in terms of self-regulation and self-control is subsequently required to successfully achieve the intended goals (i.e., volition). Following this view, self-leadership can be classified as a volitional component.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1548051811425047" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>Self-leadership as a process factor in a volitional component function (Model 3)</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548051811425047-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Based on these considerations, three different roles of self-leadership are conceivable. As theoretical assumptions are different and empirical evidence is contradictory, this leads to different predictions. The first is that the construct of self-leadership is related to a series of motivational theories, such as social-cognition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811425047">Bandura, 1986</xref>) or self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811425047">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>), which propose self-leadership as a process factor. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1548051811425047">Stewart et al. (2011)</xref> posit that self-leadership represents a process that is facilitated by external leaders through coaching and providing support. Initial empirical evidence indicates that traditional leadership is positively associated with self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1548051811425047">Yun et al., 2006</xref>). Third, as suggested by Avolio and Gibbons (1998) as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811425047">Bass and Avolio (1990)</xref>, transformational leadership initiates self-leadership and thus self-leadership acts as a process factor, as opposed to an input factor.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been argued that self-leadership has a beneficial influence on self-motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051811425047">Manz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Neck, 2004</xref>) and therefore appears to be an antecedent to motivation. Furthermore, a critical debate regarding the construct of self-leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>) confirms the assumption that self-leadership operates through different motivational processes. Moreover, empirical findings show that self-leadership has a positive impact on the motivational variable of self-efficacy and that the relation between self-leadership and performance is mediated by motivational aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, even if self-leadership is related to the concept of volition, implying a volitional function of self-leadership in the entire leadership process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck and Houghton (2006)</xref> argue that the construct of self-leadership is a unique constellation of strategies that are founded on, related to, but still nonredundant with other motivational and volitional constructs. Following this reasoning, we favor Model 1, which represents self-leadership as a process factor that determines motivation.</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Virtuality</title>
<p>Virtual work involves distributed work that is predominantly based on electronic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). Generally, it is assumed that virtual work structures require leadership approaches similar to colocated work structures, which primarily have face-to-face interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811425047">Davis &amp; Bryant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051811425047">Kayworth &amp; Leidner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051811425047">Zigurs, 2003</xref>). Transformational leadership has been found to exert a positive influence on the effectiveness and the commitment of global virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811425047">Davis &amp; Bryant, 2003</xref>). However, because of the reduced face-to-face interaction and asynchronous communication, it is assumed that traditional leadership forms pose a particular challenge for leaders of virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the location of the team leader has an important impact on the interaction and processes within the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1548051811425047">O’Leary &amp; Cummings, 2007</xref>). Spatial distance between the leader and the team reduces direct influence, which, in turn, affects the efficiency of the relationship between the leader and their subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811425047">Bass, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051811425047">Liden, Sparrowe, &amp; Wayne, 1997</xref>). Regarding transformational leadership, physical proximity may be an important precondition for its efficiency as it offers greater opportunities for supervisors to demonstrate attention, consideration, and interest to employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811425047">Dubinsky, Yammarino, Jolson, &amp; Spangler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051811425047">Howell, Neufeld, &amp; Avolio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811425047">Humphreys, 2002</xref>). These assumptions suggest that transformational leadership may have a positive influence on virtual team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811425047">Davis &amp; Bryant, 2003</xref>), but it may be more difficult to realize than in a more conventional, colocated team setting. Thus, the relationship between transformational leadership and self-leadership should decrease as virtuality increases.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: In relation to self-leadership, motivation, and outcomes (job performance and affective commitment): The supervisors’ transformational leadership has a lower impact on self-leadership among followers in virtual work structures (regarding the leader) than it does in colocated work structures.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the supposition is that transformational leadership plays a comparatively small role in virtual work structures, self-leadership might be quite important for those work structures. Control theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811425047">Bandura, 1986</xref>) assumes that individuals perform an ongoing comparison of goals and standards with the results of their current behavior. If discrepancies are detected, goal-directed behavior is displayed to overcome differences. In virtual environments that are characterized by empowerment and extended decision latitudes, employees are assumed to show more control behavior. Consequently, self-leadership becomes more important for the success of the team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811425047">Davis &amp; Bryant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051811425047">Zigurs, 2003</xref>). As in the favored model, Model 1, which indicates that self-leadership influences motivational processes, we assume that this relationship is stronger in virtual work structures than in colocated work structures. In this hypothesis, the virtuality of the team is supposed to have a higher impact in this relationship, since self-leadership is especially required if team members are not only isolated from the team leader but also isolated from the other team members.</p>

<p>Data were gathered in a large survey study on a comprehensive team diagnosis, which included both cross-sectional and longitudinal components.

<title>Self-leadership</title>
<p>Self-leadership was measured with a condensed 27-item version of the revised self-leadership questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Neck, 2002</xref>) and the corresponding German version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051811425047">Andressen &amp; Konradt, 2007</xref>). The nine self-leadership techniques belong to the three second-factor self-leadership strategies: (a) behavior-focused strategies (α = .84): self-goal setting (3 items, e.g., “I establish specific goals for my own job performance”; α = .81), self-reward (3 items, e.g., “When I have successfully completed a task, I often reward myself with something I like”; α = .91), self-punishment (3 items, e.g., “I tend to be tough on myself in my thinking when I have not done well on a task”; α = .82), self-observation and evaluation (3 items, e.g., “I make a point to keep track of how well I’m doing at work”; α = .77), and self-cueing (3 items, e.g., “I use written notes to remind myself of what I need to accomplish”; α = .87); (b) constructive thought patterns strategies (α = .87): visualizing successful performance (3 items, e.g., “I use my imagination to picture myself performing well on important tasks”; α = .86), self-talk (3 items, e.g., “Sometimes I talk to myself to work through difficult situations”; α = .87), and evaluating beliefs and assumptions (3 items, e.g., “I try to mentally evaluate the accuracy of my own beliefs about situations I am having problems with”; α = .85); and (c) natural reward strategies (3 items, e.g., “I focus my thinking on the pleasant rather than the unpleasant aspects of my job activities” α = .67). The fact that the reliability is under traditional cutoff limits (i.e., .70) presents a possible limitation to the study.</p>
<p>A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provided evidence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051811425047">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>) for the nine-factor model of self-leadership (χ<sup>2</sup> = 853.17, degrees of freedom [<italic>df</italic>] = 288, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, comparative fit index [CFI] = .94, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .05, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .06) and the best fit compared with a three-factor model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5793.55, <italic>df</italic> = 322, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .43, RMSEA = .16, SRMR = .23) and a single-factor model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6281.73, <italic>df</italic> = 324, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .38, RMSEA = .16, SRMR = .12).</p>

<title>Transformational leadership</title>
<p>Transformational leadership items were drawn from the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5x short version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811425047">Avolio &amp; Bass, 2004</xref>) and the corresponding German version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1548051811425047">Rowold, 2004</xref>). The MLQ was used to measure transformational leadership with five subscales: (a) Idealized influence attributed (4 items, e.g., “My team leader goes beyond self-interest for the good of the group”; α = .74); (b) Idealized influence behavior (4 items, e.g., “My team leader talks about their most important values and beliefs”; α = .70); (c) Inspirational motivation (4 items, e.g., “My team leader articulates a compelling vision of the future”; α = .83); (d) Intellectual stimulation (4 items, e.g., “My team leader gets me to look at problems from many different angles”; α = .76); and (e) Individualized consideration (4 items, e.g., “My team leader helps me to develop my strengths”; α = .75).</p>
<p>Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051811425047">Judge and Piccolo (2004)</xref> reported inconsistencies in the factorial structure of the transformational leadership scales, CFAs were used to compare the five-factor model with a single-factor model.

<title>Virtuality</title>

We combined two central aspects of virtuality, namely, the frequency of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and physical distance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811425047">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051811425047">Martins, Gilson, &amp; Maynard, 2004</xref>), into one overall index. CMC was measured by the use of different electronic media (i.e., e-mail, telephone, telephone conference, videoconference, and chat) in relation to the overall communication frequency between team members and their team leader, as well as among team members themselves. For physical distance, we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1548051811425047">O’Leary and Cummings’s (2007)</xref> index composed of five different indices that measure the geographic dispersion of a team. We selected four of the five proposed indices: the site index, isolation index, spatial distance, and time zone index. The site index is the total number of sites (i.e., buildings) used by the team. The isolation index is defined as the percentage of team members with no other team members at their site. Spatial distance describes the degree of spatial dispersion of the team. Finally, the time zone index is based on how many work hours the team members have during which they could communicate synchronously.</p>
<p>We differentiated between two forms of virtuality. First, to identify virtuality in terms of the team leader (team leader virtuality), we integrated the CMC index for the team leader and the geographical distance between the team leader and team members (<italic>M</italic> = 0.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.74). Second, virtuality of the whole team (team virtuality) was determined by combining both CMC indices and the four indices of geographic dispersion (<italic>M</italic> = 0.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.95).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Because employee data are nested in teams, a multilevel covariance structure modeling approach (MSEM) to estimate Level 1 mediation models may have been appropriate for this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051811425047">Goldstein &amp; McDonald, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051811425047">Muthén, 1994</xref>). This procedure allows questions to be addressed about relations between total and indirect effects between variables of interest, while accounting for the hierarchical data structure. However, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051811425047">Hox and Maas (2001)</xref>, unbalanced sample sizes at Level 2 may deteriorate stable MSEM parameter estimations. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1548051811425047">Raykov and Mels (2007)</xref> recommend very large samples for mediation models in MSEM. Thus, we decided to analyze the data at the individual level. Hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051811425047">Arbuckle, 1999</xref>). To examine the goodness of fit, the χ<sup>2</sup>, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic>, CFI, RSMEA, and SRMR were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051811425047">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). To compare the three models, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used, which allows the comparison of nonnested models and evaluation of the “best fitting” model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051811425047">Kline, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1548051811425047">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moderation effects in SEM can be tested by two different methods. The indicant product approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051811425047">Kenny and Judd (1984)</xref> allows testing for moderation effects with a continuous variable; however, if the constructs have many measures, it can quickly lead to convergence problems because of the complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051811425047">Rigdon, Schumacker, &amp; Wothke, 1998</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051811425047">Rigdon et al. (1998)</xref>, we thus decided to use the multisample approach, as it is still the most useful procedure for modeling latent variable effects. Since the multisample approach can only be used if the interacting variable is discrete, we categorized the two variables: team leader virtuality and team member virtuality. Using a median split (median = −0.27), the sample was divided into a group with a high level of team leader virtuality (<italic>N</italic> = 331) and a second group with a low level of team leader virtuality (<italic>N</italic> = 350) to test Hypothesis 2a. <italic>t</italic> Tests on the central aspects of physical distance and the CMC Index indicated that the two groups significantly differed from each other. To examine Hypothesis 2b, the moderating variable, team member virtuality, was categorized using a median split (median = −2.05), forming a group with high team member virtuality (<italic>N</italic> = 337) and a group with low team member virtuality (<italic>N</italic> = 344). Again, we found significant differences for the physical distance and the CMC Index between the two groups.</p>

<p>To analyze the role of self-leadership (specified in Hypotheses 1), each of the three competing models was tested using SEM. Before testing the path models, we examined the measurement models. All three models showed a good fit to the data and thus met the conditions for inspecting the path models. All paths were significant and had standardized factor loadings above .40. The standardized factor loadings of manifest variables only marginally varied between the three competing models. This indicates that the measurement model was adequate. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051811425047">Table 2</xref>, Model 1 has a good model fit (χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> = 379.52, <italic>df</italic> = 98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, χ<italic><sup>2</sup>/df</italic> = 3.87, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .08). The fit indices suggest that Model 1 fits the data better than the two alternatives. The AIC Index, which can be used to compare nonnested models, showed the smallest values for Model 1 (AIC = 455.52). Thus, in support of Hypothesis 1, these results suggest that self-leadership acts as a process factor determining motivational components.</p>

<p>To test Hypothesis 2a, which states that transformational leadership has a lower impact on self-leadership in a situation with high team leader virtuality than in a situation with a colocated team leader, we used the multisample approach. The first step of the moderation analysis included examining the fit of the unconstrained model. The model meets the required criteria for a good model fit (χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> = 515.15, <italic>df</italic> = 197, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, χ<sup>2</sup><italic>/df</italic> = 2.62, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .08).</p>
<p>In the second step, factor loadings were examined and the chi-square difference test was applied. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1548051811425047">Table 3</xref> shows slight differences between the nonstandardized factor loadings in the unconstrained model (fl<sub>high</sub> = 0.16, fl<sub>low</sub> = 0.17). Moreover, the chi-square test shows that the two models (unconstrained vs. constrained) significantly differ, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>diff</italic>)<italic>=</italic>4.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05. Thus, Hypothesis 2a is supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first aim of this study was to examine the role of self-leadership in a more comprehensive leadership model, represented by its relationship to transformational leadership, motivation, and outcomes. Three competing models were examined, each of which focused on different roles of self-leadership within the context of transformational leadership, motivation, and different outcomes (job performance and affective commitment). Results suggest that self-leadership acts as a process factor that determines motivation (Model 1).</p>
<p>The second aim was to examine the moderating role of virtuality within this leadership model. Therefore, we conducted a comparison between virtual and colocated work structures. Results show that team leader virtuality has a moderating effect on the relation between transformational leadership and self-leadership. This indicates that transformational leadership has a lower influence on self-leadership in virtual team settings, where the team leader works physically distant from the team members. The second hypothesis on the moderating influence of team member virtuality, which assumes that self-leadership has a higher influence on motivation in virtual work structures than in colocated work structures, was supported.</p>
<sec id="section19-1548051811425047">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>The fact that the model comparison is in favor of Model 1 could open a new avenue of research to clarify the role of self-leadership in relation to traditional leadership forms. Furthermore, these results provide evidence for the differentiation between the self-leadership concept and other related motivational constructs. In addition, these results confirm the postulation that other motivational variables, such as self-efficacy and instrumentality, explain why self-leadership has a positive relationship with different outcome variables. These findings are consistent with previous research that has shown that motivational variables have a mediating influence on the relationship between self-leadership and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051811425047">Konradt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051811425047">Prussia et al., 1998</xref>). Expanding on these studies, our results draw a more comprehensive picture of self-leadership within a traditional leadership model and demonstrate the advantage of this structure of variables over a model in which self-leadership is a volitional variable mediating the relation between motivational variables and outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, this study provides the first empirical evidence for a positive relationship between transformational leadership and self-leadership. The findings concur with theoretical considerations that transformational leadership encourages self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811425047">Avolio &amp; Gibbons, 1988</xref>) and also confirms previous studies that demonstrate a positive relationship between transformational leadership and employee empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811425047">Dvir et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051811425047">Jung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051811425047">Jung &amp; Sosik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051811425047">Kark et al., 2003</xref>). Although previous empirical findings have shown performance as an outcome variable in a positive relationship with all other model components, commitment as an outcome variable has only been examined in relation to transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051811425047">Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, &amp; Topolnytsky, 2002</xref>). This study has extended that research by indicating a positive relationship between self-leadership and affective commitment. Nevertheless, the proposed relationship between self-leadership and affective commitment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>) could not be confirmed, as we did not examine this relation separately.</p>
<p>The results concerning the moderating role of virtuality strengthen the assumption that traditional leadership forms pose a particular challenge for leaders in virtual team settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811425047">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). Empirical findings of this study indicate that the influence of transformational leadership on self-leadership seems to be less in a virtual environment than in colocated team structures. These results are consistent with other findings that show a lesser relation between transformational leadership and performance when working with physical distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811425047">Dubinsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051811425047">Howell &amp; Hall-Merenda, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, it supports the suggestions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051811425047">Howell et al. (2005)</xref> that physical proximity is an important precondition for the efficacy of transformational leadership.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between self-leadership and motivational variables, this study provides initial empirical evidence for a moderating influence of team member virtuality. Thus, self-leadership might provide a way of reducing the problems of motivating virtual team members. These results correspond with assumptions made by several authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811425047">Davis &amp; Bryant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051811425047">Zigurs, 2003</xref>) who argue that self-leadership becomes more important for the success of the team members in virtual work structures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1548051811425047">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>The results of this study also have managerial implications. Organizations should implement both forms of leadership to enhance employee motivation and job performance. The findings of this study also suggest critical implications in terms of both selecting and training employees. In short, as organizations migrate their workforce to become more mobile and distributed, human resources can apply the findings of this study by including the qualities of transformational leadership when selecting managers of virtual teams. This focus on selecting virtual team managers who possess transformational leadership qualities could potentially positively affect virtual team engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Our study would also suggest that organizations that apply these new selection criteria (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811425047">Hertel, Konradt, &amp; Voss, 2006</xref>) should consider implementing self-leadership selection standards and training programs to develop these skills and capacities among their virtual team members (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Manz, 2010</xref>, for an extensive discussion of self-leadership strategies). This would suggest a shift in the focus of traditional leadership training programs within organizations. Although a plethora of organizational training only focuses on traditional top-down leadership, the findings from this study suggest that organizational training approaches need to include self-leadership as well.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>There are, admittedly, some limitations to the current study. One limitation is its cross-sectional nature, which does not allow for causal interpretations. Future research efforts should examine the relationships in a longitudinal research design. A second limitation is the ambiguous factorial structure of the MLQ, which is comparable to the inconsistencies in the factorial structure of the transformational leadership scales that were reported in the meta-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051811425047">Judge and Piccolo (2004)</xref>. To handle this problem, we combined all items for transformational leadership into one overall factor, which showed a better solution than the five-factor structure. Results indicate that further research on the factorial validity of the MLQ is necessary. In addition, following suggestions by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811425047">Houghton &amp; Yoho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051811425047">Manz &amp; Sims, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051811425047">Neck &amp; Houghton, 2006</xref>), we used affective commitment as an outcome variable, though it might also be conceived as a process variable where commitment is allowed to causally affect other mediators and outcomes. Additional research is needed to further develop multiple-step multiple-mediator models.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are potential methodological limitations. A potential limitation is the use of a single-item scale measure for job performance. Though research has demonstrated good reliability and validity of single-item measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1548051811425047">Wanous et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1548051811425047">Wanous &amp; Hudy, 2001</xref>), a multiple-item measurement would increase the internal validity. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811425047">Hauschildt and Konradt (in press)</xref> further extended results by showing positive effects of self-leadership on individual team members’ proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity in teams. Future research should continue to explore self-leadership by extending distinct output variables. Additionally, the method that we used for moderation analysis may be a limitation. It is considered the easiest and most useful method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811425047">Jöreskog, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051811425047">Rigdon et al., 1998</xref>), but dichotomizing continuous variables involves a loss of information on individual values and is susceptible to producing ambiguity regarding the estimation of parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051811425047">MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, &amp; Rucker, 2002</xref>). However, given the caveat of loss of information, we found evidence for a moderation effect indicating the robustness of the effect. Finally, common method bias may be a potential limitation, as most of the variables derive from the same online questioning and the same source. Although we used a common approach for collecting data, we cannot exclude the possibility of an inflation of the relationships. This concern is reduced by findings, which show that common methods bias does not automatically invalidate theoretical interpretations and substantive conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811425047">Doty &amp; Glick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1548051811425047">Spector, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, results of this study indicate that self-leadership mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and employee motivation. The results further suggest that transformational leadership has a lower influence on self-leadership in virtual work structures, whereas self-leadership has a higher influence on individuals’ motivation in virtual work structures compared with colocated work structures.</p>

<p>To avoid loss of power, we focused on two aspects: missing data and data transformation. First, missing data (average of 2.4%) were handled by a regression-based multiple-imputation technique, as this technique has been shown to be an appropriate and robust method for estimating missing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1548051811425047">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>). Second, data inspection revealed that affective commitment and job performance scores were moderately negatively skewed. After square root transformation, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1548051811425047">Tabachnick and Fidell (2005)</xref>, scores were normally distributed with skewness and kurtosis statistics within the acceptable range (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1548051811425047">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2005</xref>).</p>

Therefore, because of the potentially large number of parameters being estimated in our model (51 items), the 27 self-leadership items were combined and averaged to the three second-order factors (behavioral, constructive thought pattern, and natural reward strategies) instead of the nine single-order factors, and the 20 transformational leadership items were combined into three equivalent parcels based on factor loadings following the procedure suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051811425047">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, and Widaman (2002)</xref>.</p>
