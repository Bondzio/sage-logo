<abstract>
<p>We explore how the domestic political institutions of states in the neighborhood of international disputants affect the incentives for third-party conflict management. Existing scholarship has argued that as the number of democracies in the international system increases, disputants are more likely to want and find third-party conflict management. We propose two alternative explanations for the connection between democratization and changing patterns of conflict management that consider more localized mechanisms. We posit that neighboring democratic leaders, with stronger incentives to deliver public benefits, will be more willing to push for their involvement as third parties, particularly when the disputes are sufficiently salient to affect regional security dynamics yet not so difficult that protracted engagement is likely. We also posit that, since international organizations (IOs) tend to be more engaged in democratic communities, IOs will be more active peacemakers in disputes, especially intractable and violent ones, that occur in heavily democratic regions. Using event history analysis of the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) data, we find support for these arguments. Disputants with many democratic neighbors are more likely to experience third-party conflict management by democracies—this effect is increasing in the salience and decreasing in the intractability of the dispute—and IOs—this effect is increasing in the intractability of the dispute. Counter to expectations based on a logic of norm diffusion, third-party conflict management is not more likely among democracies that are in dispute with each other nor when the proportion of democracies in the international system increases.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Shared expectations of behavior, or norms, are often used in explanations of state behavior. Extant scholarship has considered how norms may link the regime types of external actors to incidences of third-party conflict management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0738894212456954">1</xref></sup> In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894212456954">Mitchell (2002)</xref>, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894212456954">Dixon (1993)</xref>, argues that actors will adopt the democratic norm of pursuing third-party conflict management as the international community becomes more democratic and finds that as the proportion of democracies in the international system increases, the proclivity for third-party conflict management in non-democratic dyads also increases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0738894212456954">2</xref></sup> In this normative-based view, democratization writ large has reverberating effects on the way that actors manage their conflicts.</p>
<p>The evidence that there is a link between democratization and greater normative preferences for third-party conflict management, however, is mixed. The norms-adoption argument implies that democracies should find third-party involvement a preferable form of conflict management for normative reasons. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894212456954">Allee and Huth (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0738894212456954">Greig (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894212456954">Dixon (1993)</xref> find some evidence that democratic states in conflict are more likely to experience outside involvement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0738894212456954">Hensel (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894212456954">Mitchell (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0738894212456954">Ellis et al. (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0738894212456954">Gent and Shannon (2011)</xref> do not find that democratic disputants are actually more likely to participate in third-party conflict management. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894212456954">Allee and Huth (2006)</xref> do not find evidence that states which have been democratic for a long period of time are more likely to prefer legalized dispute resolution over bilateral concessions. How can democracies spread norms of conflict management but not consistently practice the very norms they spread? If democracies have a normative preference for third-party conflict management, then it is odd that we do not observe a strong reliance on it among consolidated democratic states where the norm should be the strongest. We are thus left with a puzzle when confronted with the competing findings that third-party conflict management trends with the number of democracies in the international system but the regime type of the disputants themselves is not strongly associated with the practice of third-party conflict management.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894212456954">Crescenzi et al. (2011)</xref> provide a separate link between conflict management and the global spread of democracy by considering the availability of credible mediators. They present multiple arguments—some based on an understanding of democratic norms and some based on an understanding of institutional constraints that rational democratic leaders face—for the expectation that there will be a better supply of credible mediators as the number of democracies in the international system increases. While not discounting the importance of such supply-side availability, we contend that the effect of democratization should have an even stronger manifestation at the local level. To hone in on the importance of democratic neighborhoods specifically, we propose two alternative explanations for how democratization shapes the propensity for third-party conflict management and generate novel expectations.</p>
<p>To start, we note that domestic institutions that increase government accountability increase the importance of public-goods provisions to regimes. Democratic leaders will thus be more likely to pursue the state’s interests abroad by becoming more involved in shaping the outcomes of other disputes in the international system, especially those that deal with relatively important issues close to home and are not likely to require protracted involvement. We also contend that international organizations (IOs) are more active in democratic communities and will be more eager to respond to those disputes that could threaten regional stability.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894212456954">Mitchell (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894212456954">Crescenzi et al. (2011)</xref>, we contend that community matters, but our focus is on how institutional mechanisms in local democratic communities increase the number of willing third parties. When disputes occur in the midst of many democratic neighbors, particularly when the disputes are sufficiently salient and not intractable, the disputants are more likely to encounter democratic neighbors that would like to become involved. IOs will also be more eager and available to serve as conflict managers in strongly democratic communities. The specific observable implications of our explanations are tested using event history analysis of the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) data.</p>

<title>2. The Supply of Third-Party Conflict Management</title>
<p>How do the domestic politics of external actors shape the propensity of permissive third-party conflict management such as mediation, arbitration, and adjudication in international disputes? The permissive nature of mediation, arbitration, and adjudication means that both disputants must consent to it and third parties must be willing to supply it for it to occur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0738894212456954">3</xref></sup> Variation in the amount of permissive third-party involvement across disputes suggests that actors face tradeoffs when determining whether to request outside involvement or when determining whether to offer it as a third party.</p>
<p>We focus on the costs and benefits of involvement in conflict management from the perspective of the third parties. Not only is third-party willingness a necessary condition for assisted conflict management, but encouragement and inducements from potential intermediaries can alter disputants’ costs and aid in getting the disputants to the bargaining table. To anticipate when third parties will be eager to offer their services, it is helpful to consider the provision of assisted conflict management as similar to the provision of other impure public goods, which provide both global and individual-specific benefits to the producers and are costly to produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0738894212456954">Bobrow and Boyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894212456954">Sandler, 1977</xref>). The costs of providing third-party conflict management can be considerable, as a third party’s diplomatic resources are often quite limited in terms of staffing, and high-level negotiations often require substantial attention. While prenegotiation and actual participation in the peace process can be resource-consuming in terms of person-hours, many peacemaking attempts also involve paying the physical costs of material incentives and inducements. By initiating a peace process, the third party additionally risks its reputation since it will look incompetent if situations do not improve or even get worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0738894212456954">Bercovitch and Schneider, 2000</xref>). To the extent that a third party is concerned about how others at home or in the international system perceive its leadership abilities, it will sometimes prefer inaction over mediation in order to escape the attribution of blame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0738894212456954">4</xref></sup> Since the primary beneficiaries of external conflict management are the disputants, such outside assistance faces a free rider problem—third parties will hesitate to contribute to an optimal level of assistance while hoping to reap the benefits that are produced by the efforts of others.</p>
<p>There will be a greater supply of third-party conflict management when there are more private benefits to the third parties that motivate them to pay the costs of involvement. Third parties can receive a variety of private benefits that affect their decisions to become involved. First, third-party states directly benefit from mediating and contributing to conflict resolution when they are able to reduce the negative externalities—e.g. refugee concerns, trade disruptions—that they pay for armed conflict in their neighborhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0738894212456954">Simmons (1999)</xref>, for example, finds that one of the key motivations driving the involvement of the “Guarantor” states of the Rio Protocol (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the US, with Brazil taking the lead role) in the arbitration of the Ecuador–Peru border dispute in 1998 was their concern that the conflict would continue to disrupt regional economic integration. Second, some actors value the humanitarian benefits of peacemaking. IOs as well as NGOs are especially likely to value peace and stability as ends in themselves because it is often in their charters to promote these ends and they are typically staffed by international civil servants who have chosen a line of work in which they can be advocates for peace. Third, actors of all types benefit from their involvement in conflicts where they have a lot at stake. Conflicts present opportunities for rules and norms to be restructured, and affected third parties will want to be part of the resolution process so that they can shape the international and regional orders in their favor. Related, third parties biased toward one of the sides will benefit from increasing the potential for outcomes to be decided in their protégé’s favor.</p>
<sec id="section3-0738894212456954">
<title>2.1 The Importance of Local Democratic Communities</title>
<p>In light of this discussion, we identify two ways in which the strength of the democratic community affects the supply of third-party conflict management. Our approach, while focusing on the preferences of the third parties to become involved, certainly does not ignore the demand side. We posit that democratic communities have a relative abundance of third parties who are eager to serve as conflict managers, and the heightened interest in involvement can induce the combatants to accept the third-parties’ offers of conflict management assistance. Such inducements, while possibly in the forms of tangible carrots and sticks, are more likely to be intangible offers of closer relations or threats of poorer relations by individual states or a collective of states.</p>
<p>Conflicts located in democratic communities tend to elicit greater third-party interest in assisting with conflict management for at least two reasons. First, leaders in neighboring states with institutions of accountability—particularly regularized elections, inclusive suffrage, and competitive political parties—have greater incentives to provide public goods at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0738894212456954">Baum and Lake, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0738894212456954">5</xref></sup> Without strong institutions of accountability, leaders can provide fewer public goods while using the production of private goods such as patronage and bribes to buy off the necessary support from military, economic, and social elites. As the set of individuals that matter to leadership selection, or the selectorate, expands and a leader becomes more accountable to the greater public, it becomes more advantageous to produce public goods as opposed to private goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0738894212456954">Bueno de Mesquita et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0738894212456954">2003</xref>). Since the provision of security is one of the most important public goods that citizens will demand from their government, we should expect leaders beholden to institutions of accountability to be particularly concerned with pursuing state interests abroad. Foreign policy goals typically include attempting to structure the international and regional orders such that national security is enhanced and such that domestic groups such as businesses and consumers can thrive. As such, foreign policy success is something that broad swaths of constituents can appreciate and informs those constituents’ preferences in the next election cycle.</p>
<p>Nearby international disputes provide opportunities for leaders to become involved and deliver benefits to their constituents in a few ways. Foremost, when leaders serve as conflict managers, they can help prevent conflicts from diffusing or otherwise generating negative externalities that directly threaten their own state’s security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0738894212456954">6</xref></sup> Along these lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0738894212456954">Kathman (2010)</xref> has found that states are more likely to intervene in civil wars when those conflicts have a greater propensity to spread and disrupt domestic security. Additionally, by serving as a peacemaker and facilitator in peace talks that have regional implications, leaders can help foster regional stability that can be conducive to investment opportunities and trade flows. Domestic audiences that are in any way affected by the flows of capital or goods in or out of a country thus benefit from their leader’s involvement as a third-party conflict manager in nearby disputes. Domestic audiences also will have more humanitarian concerns for conflicts in the near abroad because media coverage will be more extensive and there is greater potential for ethnic or historical ties to exist between the third party and the disputants. Such audiences will reward leaders who can minimize bloodshed and devastation nearby.</p>
<p>For these reasons, leaders that are accountable to broader domestic audiences will have greater incentives to deliver benefits from successful foreign policy actions, including third-party conflict management in nearby disputes. The incentive for democratically accountable leaders to constantly provide such public goods thus provides the first piece of the explanation for why democratic communities will be filled with leaders who are eager to become involved as conflict managers. For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s bold diplomacy in both military and economic crises won him acclaim at home early in his presidency even while his domestic agenda proved unpopular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0738894212456954">7</xref></sup> Non-democratic leaders have less need to intervene in nearby disputes since many of the benefits of doing so—namely the reduction of negative externalities, the promotion of economic interests, and the prevention of humanitarian disasters—are unlikely to have much appeal to the narrow group of elites whose support is necessary for authoritarian governance.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that within densely democratic communities, peacemaking might be one of the only available outlets to demonstrate foreign policy competence and generate public benefits through foreign policy. Democratic communities tend to be peaceful because democracies rarely fight each other and democratic communities will also tend to have other qualities such as interdependent economies and active IOs that have a pacifying effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894212456954">Gleditsch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0738894212456954">Oneal and Russett, 2001</xref>). This means that democratic leaders in such areas will have fewer opportunities to use coercive diplomacy to deliver foreign policy benefits. Engaging in more traditional diplomacy, especially in nearby conflicts that could endanger security at home, could be one of the only ways for some leaders to deliver benefits related to security interests.</p> <p>We must not, however, overstate the importance of diplomatic achievements to leader popularity. Certainly, a leader who becomes engaged as a peacemaker will not be able to demonstrate her foreign policy acumen as well as a leader who leads her troops to victory. But when opportunities to make policy decisions that have direct security implications do not exist because of stable regional peace—or because any military engagements are channeled through multilateral organizations such as NATO or the EU and hence do not easily affect a leader’s reputation for security provision—leaders will have a greater incentive to seek other means to yield foreign policy benefits.The influence of democratic communities on the propensity for outside involvement is likely to be conditional on factors that make conflicts more important to leaders or more difficult to resolve. The potential political benefits to democratic leaders for helping to resolve nearby conflicts will be greatest when the nearby conflicts are relatively salient—having distributional consequences that could affect regional security dynamics. High salience is important, since success as a peacemaker does not easily translate to success as a defender of national interests unless the peacemaking activities are somehow related to broader foreign policy concerns, such as when the dispute is nearby and involving important issues. Audiences will be less prone to reward leaders who intervene in minor disputes that simply do not matter to the third parties’ foreign policy goals.</p>
<p>Note also that domestic audiences of third parties not only can reward successful peacemaking ventures, but they also can punish failed or otherwise unpopular attempts. Jimmy Carter, for example, felt that his involvement in the Middle East peace process actually hurt him politically because of opposition to how strongly he pushed Israel and because the implementation of the Camp David Accords was more difficult and incomplete than originally hoped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0738894212456954">Carter, 1982</xref>). This creates a tradeoff between saliency and intractability where leaders will want to become involved in important disputes but not particularly nasty ones that have a high risk of diplomatic failure and thus the loss of public resources and constituent approval. Since democratic leaders have a greater incentive to provide public goods, they will tend to avoid engagements that are likely to yield a net loss in foreign policy resources—cases that are quite protracted or that have few potential security benefits at home. This is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0738894212456954">Reiter and Stam’s (2003)</xref> argument that democratic leaders will tend to cherry-pick their foreign policy ventures in such a way that the leaders will maximize the probability of success and minimize the probability of failure. One expectation then is that democratic neighbors will be especially more likely to become involved as conflict managers as salience increases and the possibility for settlement remains feasible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0738894212456954">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second way by which the domestic politics of nearby third parties can affect the preference for third-party conflict management in democratic neighborhoods is more indirect. If democratic leaders have stronger incentives to work through IOs, then densely democratic regions should have a greater abundance of active IOs that will be eager to serve as conflict managers. Indeed, existing work has found that democracies are more likely to participate in IOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0738894212456954">Jacobson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0738894212456954">Mansfield and Pevehouse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0738894212456954">Russett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0738894212456954">Russett and Oneal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894212456954">Shanks et al., 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0738894212456954">9</xref></sup> This might result from the political cover that IOs provide democratizing states as they make difficult policy adjustments before consolidating democratic institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0738894212456954">Mansfield and Pevehouse, 2006</xref>). Existing scholarship has also provided normative reasons for democratic states to be more likely to participate in multilateral forms of international governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0738894212456954">Russett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0738894212456954">Russett and Oneal, 2001</xref>). Recent research provides another reason to expect IOs to be more prevalent in democratic communities. Building on the logic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0738894212456954">Chapman (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0738894212456954">Chapman and Reiter (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894212456954">Fang (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0738894212456954">Grieco et al. (2011)</xref>, IOs might be more prevalent and active in democratic communities because of the greater needs for democratic leaders to have institutional mechanisms by which they can inform their domestic audiences of their sound decision-making. That is, the incentive for democracies to participate in IOs is an extension of the leaders’ greater accountability to the broader public. Since democratic governance depends on leader accountability, domestic audiences will appreciate the input from multilateral institutions which can provide signals about the merits of the leadership’s foreign policy decisions.</p>
<p>With IOs more active in democratic communities, the spread of democracy within a region should increase the abundance of IOs pushing for third-party conflict management, especially because those IOs that are active in democratic communities will tend to be most interested in and potentially threatened by conflicts involving democracies, the most likely members of the organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0738894212456954">10</xref></sup> For example, the conflict in Cyprus, also involving Greece and Turkey, has attracted repeated mediator involvement by NATO, member states of NATO, and the UN even though the prospects of successful resolution have remained bleak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0738894212456954">Fisher, 2001</xref>). More active IOs eager to serve as conflict managers should translate into higher likelihoods of disputants ultimately availing themselves of third-party conflict management.</p>
<p>In addition, the degree of intractability should condition the relationship between democratic community strength and IO involvement differently than it does the relationship with democratic-state involvement. In the above discussion we argued that IOs are primarily worried about the potential for disputes in democratic communities to disrupt relations among their memberships. Particularly difficult conflicts should thus be of most interest to the IOs because such conflicts present the greatest threat to IO survival and functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0738894212456954">11</xref></sup> When disputes are likely to be militarized and continue to mar relations well into the future, IOs will have extra motivation to serve as a peacemaker. In addition, IOs will tend to be interveners of last resort in democratic communities if the individual democratic states tend to take a pass on the most difficult conflicts to resolve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this logic of IO involvement does not generate clear expectations of how salience shapes the eagerness of IOs to intervene. On the one hand, salient disputes tend to be those that have the most important external implications and are most threatening to regional harmony when they escalate. On the other hand, the type of consensus among member states that is needed to spur IO action can be difficult to reach when there are strong distributional implications. Member states with vested interests in the dispute might keep IOs on the sideline for fear of allowing competing states a chance to meddle via organizational proxies. Moreover, the expected strong tendency for democratic states in democratic neighborhoods to become involved as conflict managers in the most salient disputes would leave less room for IOs to become involved.</p>
<p>The above arguments yield specific testable implications. The first one relates to the overall relationship between democratic-community strength and third-party conflict management.</p>
<list id="list1-0738894212456954" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H1: Democratic Community Hypothesis</italic>: As the proportion of democracies in the disputants’ neighborhood grows larger, the likelihood of third-party conflict management increases.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Note that this first hypothesis would also be consistent with a logic of norm diffusion, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894212456954">Mitchell (2002)</xref>, and a logic of the availability of credible mediators, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894212456954">Crescenzi et al. (2011)</xref>. To more directly test our theory, we can refine the first hypothesis to be more specific to involvement by democratic states and IOs. These expectations do not readily arise from such alternative explanations about the importance of democratic community.</p>

<sec id="section4-0738894212456954">
<title>3. Research Design</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses, we use version 1.1 of the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) data, created by Paul Hensel and Sara Mitchell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0738894212456954">Hensel et al., 2008</xref>). The data contain information on territorial claims in the Western Hemisphere and in Western Europe from 1816 to 2001; river claims in the Western Hemisphere, Western Europe, and Middle East from 1900 to 2001; and maritime claims in the Western Hemisphere and in Western and Eastern Europe from 1900 to 2001. An ICOW claim is any instance in which there is explicit evidence of contention between official representatives of two or more states. A beneficial feature of the data is that the identification of the claims is independent of their militarization. Since third-party conflict management can affect the potential for militarization, including cases in which there is no militarization is more inclusive of all possible cases of outside involvement and also avoids selection bias. Another important feature is that it is possible to assess variations in behavior throughout a particular dispute. The data contain information about claims for each year they are active as well as specific instances of conflict management within each claim.</p>
<p>The incidence of third-party conflict management is our outcome of interest. We use an event history approach to model not only whether third-party conflict management occurs but also when it occurs. The factors expected to have a positive impact on conflict management incidence should also decrease the time until conflict management occurs. We structure the data such that a dyad enters the data on the first day of a claim and exits after the claim has been resolved or on 31 December 2001. Observations are taken at the beginning of each dyad-year and at each settlement-attempt event, whether it involves a third party or not. In this way, the models can employ time-varying covariates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0738894212456954">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since many claims involve multiple conflict management attempts, the dependent variable is the time until <italic>each</italic> third-party conflict management attempt. Elapsed-time models are used, such that the “clock” starts at the beginning of the claim and does not reset after a third-party attempt. We chose an elapsed time-specification because conflict management attempts are likely to develop simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0738894212456954">Box-Steffensmeier and Jones, 2004</xref>)—multiple third parties can become involved at the same time in separate events and separate types of third-party conflict management. Since the occurrence of previous third-party conflict management events can influence the occurrence of subsequent ones, we stratify—allowing the baseline hazard rate to vary according to how many previous events have occurred—on an indicator of the number of previous events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0738894212456954">13</xref></sup> In this way, new attempts that follow previous attempts in very long disputes can be separated from initial attempts at the end of very long conflicts—the former indicate much more of a proclivity for outside involvement than the latter. We also generate robust standard errors clustered on each claim dyad to account for the potential for correlated errors across repeated events. Cox semi-parametric models are used to avoid making assumptions regarding the shape of the hazard function. In models that look at the time until a specific type of third party becomes involved, competing-risk models based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0738894212456954">Fine and Gray (1999)</xref> are run since the disputes are simultaneously at risk for involvement by multiple types of third parties.</p>
<p>The primary independent variable in the analyses is the ratio between the sum number of democratic states that border each combatant and the sum number of all neighboring states. Following convention, democracies are coded as those states with at least a six on the Polity democracy-autocracy index. Neighbors are defined as those countries with borders less than 500 miles from each other at their nearest point, calculated using the CShapes data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0738894212456954">Weidmann et al., 2010</xref>). This provides a proportion of neighbors to the dispute that are democratic.</p>
<p>To test H2 and H3, we also include a number of interactions with the democratic neighborhood variable. We need to test how different levels of salience and intractability condition the incentives of democratic states and IOs in democratic neighborhoods to provide third-party conflict management. Toward this end, we interact the democratic community variable with measures of salience and intractability. To see if democratic neighbors favor more high-profile interventions that might win them political support at home, we use ICOW’s dyadic measure of salience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0738894212456954">14</xref></sup> To see if democratic neighbors favor disputes in which there is a higher probability of success, we use two measures of intractability. One is a measure of the number of previous conflict management attempts within the disputing dyad in the past ten years that did not produce an agreement and the other measures whether or not there was a previous militarized interstate dispute (MID) related to the dispute in the past ten years. The former is a direct accounting of previous conflict management frustrations and the latter captures the general propensity for bargaining to completely collapse into violence. They both capture the overall potential of a dispute to continue unresolved. Since they are separate measures of the same underlying concept, we alternate using them in the models with the interactions of democratic neighborhood strength, salience, and intractability.</p>
<p>In terms of control variables, we make sure to account for the number of total neighbors bordering the disputants because having, for example, 75% neighboring democracies is likely to have a different effect depending on whether there are four neighbors or twelve neighbors. We also include the proportion of democracies in the international system to begin distinguishing our argument from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894212456954">Mitchell (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894212456954">Crescenzi et al. (2011)</xref>. In some models, we also similarly interact this global democracy variable with the measures of salience and intractability to confirm that the neighborhood democracy strength variable is indeed picking up on local and not global mechanisms at play. Since the domestic institutions of the disputants are likely to be correlated with the extent of democratization in the region, we include a measure of joint democracy from the Polity data as another control variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0738894212456954">15</xref></sup> This also allows us to verify that democracies do not actually have an inherent preference to bring their own disputes to third-party conflict management. In addition to stratifying by up to eight previous third-party conflict management attempts, we also directly control for the unbounded number of previous attempts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0738894212456954">16</xref></sup> Also, we control for the latent military capabilities of both the disputants and the neighboring states, since democracy and development—related to coercive capacity—often go together. Using the National Military Capabilities data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0738894212456954">Singer et al., 1972</xref>), we control for the CINC index of both sides in the dispute and the proportion of neighbors that have higher CINC scores than either of the combatants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0738894212456954">17</xref></sup> Finally, we include dummy variables for issue type since the ICOW data coverage currently varies depending on the issue.</p>

<title>4. Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The results are consistent with the theoretical expectations that disputes in stronger democratic communities have a greater propensity for conflict management, especially by democratic states in salient, non-protracted conflicts and IOs in the most difficult conflicts. Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0738894212456954">Table 1</xref> presents a base model of time until third-party conflict management without any interacted variables. The findings from this model support H1, as higher proportions of democratic neighbors have a positive and statistically significant effect on the likelihood of third-party conflict management. Substantively, an increase from having no democratic neighbors to having one-quarter democratic neighbors increases the risk of third-party conflict management—calculated as the hazard ratio minus 1—by 28%. An increase to half democratic neighbors increases the risk by 64%, three-quarters by 110%, and all democratic neighbors by 169%. These substantive effects can be seen in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894212456954">Figure 1</xref>, which presents the relative risks associated with increases in the proportion of democratic neighbors as indicated. Values greater than 0 indicate a positive relationship.</p>

<p>We also see in Model 1 that the proportion of democracies in the international system has a statistically significant and negatively-signed effect, and having two democracies in dispute against each other also has a negatively-signed, though statistically insignificant, effect. These latter findings are counter to what we would expect if democratization promoted norms of multilateral dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Models 2 and 3 modify Model 1 by adding interactions of democratic community strength with both salience and intractability. Model 2 uses the number of previous conflict management failures as the measure of intractability, and Model 3 uses the indicator of a previous MID. To get a sense for how the marginal effect of having a stronger democratic community changes with both salience and intractability, we need to plot the substantive effects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0738894212456954">Figure 2</xref> provides the relative risks associated with a shift from no democratic neighbors to half democratic neighbors at various combinations of the salience and intractability measures. The left-hand side of the plot shows the relationships from Model 2 and the right-hand side shows the relationships from Model 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0738894212456954">18</xref></sup> We see here that increasing the proportion of democratic neighbors has a positive and statistically significant effect on the propensity for third-party conflict management only when there is high salience and low levels of intractability, however measured. This confirms that some minimal level of salience is needed to make intervention politically beneficial to democratic neighbors, and it also shows the hesitancy for such neighbors to attempt conflict management in particularly difficult conflicts with very little hope for resolution.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that these relationships are picking up local, and not global, mechanisms, Models 4 and 5 use the proportion of democratic states in the international system in the interactions instead of the proportion of democratic neighbors.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0738894212456954">Figure 4</xref>, we see that increasing the number of democratic neighbors increases the propensity for democratic third-party conflict managers only when salience is medium or high. Moreover, there is a general tendency to have less democratic third-party involvement when there is a greater potential for intractability. In fact, the likelihood of democratic-state conflict management is significantly lower when salience is low and there is a history of either previous conflict management failure or militarization. That democratic states in more concentrated democratic neighborhoods are more likely to become involved when salience is high and the indicators of intractability are low supports the argument that democratic leaders will often seek to become involved for potential political benefits. Democratic leaders appear to be cherry-picking the disputes that have some importance to regional affairs and that have a higher likelihood of actually realizing resolution while avoiding those that do not have major implications and that are more difficult to resolve. That is, democratic leaders offer diplomatic assistance on the cheap.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0738894212456954">Figure 5</xref>, we see that different incentives appear to shape the propensity for IO involvement in democratic communities. At higher rates of previous conflict management failure and militarization, stronger democratic communities make IO involvement much more likely. Salience has a less notable effect and perhaps even negatively conditions the effect of having a stronger democratic community. The overall patterns are consistent with a view that IOs have an incentive to try to reduce high levels of hostility among member states, lest disputes begin to fracture the IO. These results are also likely driven by a substitution effect. If neighboring democratic states become hesitant to become involved in intractable conflicts, then disputants in democratic communities that would like outside assistance in their most difficult contentious relationships might need to turn to an IO because many of the neighboring states are so concerned with their domestic political calculations. IOs thus will have an accentuated role as interveners of last resort in democratic communities. Similarly, IOs may be less needed in the disputes that are the most salient in democratic neighborhoods because democratic state actors become more likely to take the lead in pushing for a diplomatic solution in such cases.</p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>The empirical results provide strong evidence confirming that disputes in democratic communities are more likely to experience third-party conflict management. It does not appear that a global diffusion of a normative preference for assisted non-violent dispute resolution among democracies is driving this behavior because democratic dyads are not more likely to experience third-party conflict management and the global proportion of democratic states does not positively affect the propensity for outside involvement. While the findings should not be interpreted as ruling out additional mechanisms at work at the regional level, including both normative explanations and explanations regarding the availability of credible intermediaries, the specific findings about the ways that the proportion of democratic neighbors interacts with salience and intractability confirm our central arguments about the incentives for neighboring democratic leaders to play to domestic audiences and for IOs to address the disputes that are most likely to disrupt regional harmony.</p>
<p>That is, we find specific evidence for the argument that democratic leaders have greater needs to provide public goods tied to effective foreign policy and consequently are more likely to offer their services as third-party conflict managers in nearby conflicts that might have residual security and economic implications at home. Neighboring democratic leaders are thereby more eager to become involved as conflict managers in conflicts that are salient yet not intractable. In such cases, the outcomes are likely to matter at home and the leaders can expect a positive return on their efforts. Indeed, the results confirm that democratic leaders appear quite eager to become involved in nearby disputes that have important implications but also quite hesitant to become involved in relatively difficult disputes. This indicates that the political capital that democratic leaders reap for helping to manage important conflicts is limited in many cases and that the embarrassment from failure can be substantial.</p>
<p>In addition, the results confirm that international organizations, which tend to be highly active in democratic communities, strive to become involved in disputes that threaten regional stability. Consistent with this argument, we observe that IOs are more likely to serve as interveners in disputes surrounded by a high proportion of democracies. IOs are especially more likely to become involved in disputes within democratic communities when there is a history of previous conflict-management failure or militarization. This indicates that IOs are interveners of last resort amidst such communities, presumably because the neighboring democratic states are hesitant to get involved in such messy disputes and because the IOs have even greater incentives to preserve the peace amongst their members.</p>
<p>That third parties would use their involvements for political gain should not be surprising but we should not jump to the conclusion that self-interested interveners are somehow an impediment to conflict resolution. When a democratic leader intervenes to build a reputation for being engaged in foreign policy, she has an incentive to succeed, as failure would be politically costly rather than advantageous. One potential complication of involving opportunist third parties is that their interests are likely to be quite myopic because the third party can only benefit politically from immediate success—it will not benefit much from long-term consequences of the intervention and could find the intervention to be a liability if immediate success is not made. This means that such third parties are likely to push for quick fixes that might actually prove unstable in the long run, when the third party’s involvement is no longer affecting the bargaining dynamics. Disputants that care about lasting peace must be especially wary of third parties that use leverage to push for an agreement that will win the intervener political benefits at home. The disputants would do well to limit such a third party’s involvement and to make sure that any agreements that are reached in such circumstances include rather strong enforcement provisions.</p>

<p>While the concepts of salience and protractedness are correlated, they can still be separated conceptually. Salience relates to the overall implications of the settlement, while protractedness relates to the likelihood of settlement and the potential for violence. Indeed, the ICOW data discussed below confirm that, while there are few cases with low salience but strong indicators of conflict difficulty and high levels of hostility, there are many cases of high salience amidst minimal prior violence and conflict-management failures.</p></fn>
