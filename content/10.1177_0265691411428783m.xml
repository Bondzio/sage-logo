<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783m"><title>António Costa Pinto, ed., <italic>Ruling Elites and Decision-Making in Fascist-Era Dictatorships</italic>, Columbia University Press: New York, 2010; xiii + 266 pp.; 9780880336567, £34.50 (hbk)</title>
<p>The themes of this edited collection of research essays are certainly important ones. The aim is to delineate the ‘structures of power’ in the fascist and right-wing personal dictatorships of Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germany, Salazar in Portugal and Franco in Spain, by unravelling the complex and shifting relationships between the dictators themselves, the single party of each of their regimes, the government ministers, and top civil servants. The essays attempt to show where decision-making power in these regimes actually, rather than formally, resided, which would tell us a great deal about how personal rule operated on the ground, their nature as political systems (whether authoritarian or totalitarian, charismatic or bureaucratic), and the continuities and discontinuities with the systems which preceded and followed them. The research effort involved the creation of new databases on ruling elites in these countries. But one has to say that the contributions written by the historians are rather better than those of the political and social scientists using the databases, partly, I suspect, because historians are more adept at making the most of what patchy material, statistical or not, is available.</p>
<p>The contribution on decision making in the monstrous hydra-like wartime Nazi propaganda apparatus, written in an intense and geeky style entirely appropriate to its subject matter, is hardly original. Yet in its depiction of competing ‘mini-charismatic communities’, it provides us with an excellent historical analysis and a conceptually grounded case study. The essays on Mussolini’s regime are, by contrast, rather disappointing, and seem to give up in face of the little we actually know about the workings of Mussolini’s own brand of charismatic leadership and how the Fascist regime operated. The knowledge gap is not filled by some imaginative use of what evidence might be there (diaries, for example), but by the rat-tat-tat of social and political science jargon and terminology. The most interesting questions are left unanswered. How did Mussolini’s style of personal rule work, or not work, in the ministries under his nominal control? How do you explain (say, in terms of charismatic leadership) Mussolini’s constant unpredictable ‘changes of the guard’ among his ministers? How come Mussolini’s regime marked a ‘transition to authoritarianism’, rather than ‘totalitarianism’, a term, after all, especially coined by Mussolini to characterize his new regime? To say that Mussolini had ‘no prior objective outlined at the beginning’ might fit the stereotype of the Fascist dictator somehow muddling through, but it scarcely takes on board Mussolini’s and the Fascist Party’s differing concepts of ‘totalitarianism’, nor the work of Aquarone, Gentile and others on the ‘New State’. One wonders, also, in the contribution on Nazi ‘polycracy’, why it focuses so much on the background and profile of Nazi government ministers, when it has already been made clear that ministers and the ministerial bureaucracies were no longer the actual ruling elites of the Nazi system.</p>
<p>The essays on Salazar and Franco go rather more smoothly, and there is an interesting survey of Salazar’s day-to-day personal and political networking, taken from his hand-written diaries, which must at first sight have been a heavy and unprepossessing source. I do not think that you can better the description of Salazar as ‘a strong dictator, a non-charismatic leader, a face-to-face reduced-inner circle ruler’. The editor does a good job in concluding the collection with a clear and plausible comparison of the dictatorial systems, which explains the differences in dictatorial practice by the presence or absence of a strong free-standing fascist party in the period before the dictators came to power. This led, in the cases of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, to decision-making power flowing more from the relationship between dictator and single party than from that between the dictator and his ministers, and in the opposite direction for Salazar’s Portugal and Franco’s Spain. Again, this is hardly new ground – the book is best seen, and used, as a decent summary of the current state of play on the dictatorial regimes of twentieth-century Europe.</p>
