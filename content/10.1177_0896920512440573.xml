<p>Although Brazilian trade data shows positive trends in terms of value and volume, a number of setbacks in trade negotiations and failure to address long-standing structural issues hamper further development of trade with greater value-added and higher technology content. Thus, the challenge facing President Rousseff is resolving issues related to boosting Brazil’s business competitiveness, improving export financing, containing currency appreciation and understanding the implications of Brazil’s evolving export profile. How the government deals with them will impact on Brazil’s further socio-economic development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When President Dilma Rousseff took office on 1 January 2011, the big question was whether Brazil would sustain its positive socio-economic trajectory as well as maintain its high profile as a new influence on the global stage. Under her predecessor, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003–10), Brazil’s rise had come to the attention of academics, analysts and commentators both at home and abroad. It seemed as if Brazil’s time to assume an important global role had finally come. The more cautious also warned that Brazil had failed to address a number of long-standing structural issues that hampered further development. This mixed legacy of achievements and failures was strongly evident in the area of trade, the focus of this article. Bearing these expectations and assessments in mind, the article examines trade performance and trade policy issues that are likely to occupy the government in the next four years.</p>
<p>Brazilian trade data for the first three months of 2011 recorded, for the first time ever, 12-month accumulated trade flows of over US$400b (US$213.9b in exports; US$191.4b in imports). By August 2011, the 12-month rolling figure was over US$450b (US$242.5b exports; US$214b imports). However, this record trade performance (value and volume) is not sufficient to hide what have been a number of setbacks for Brazil in trade negotiations and other trade policy areas in recent months and years. To better understand these conflicting signs of success and setbacks, the article examines</p>

<list-item><p>some key trade policy issues on the government agenda, including business competitiveness, export financing, currency appreciation and evolving export profile.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Much is at stake, since how the government deals with these issues will have an impact on the evolution of Brazil’s industrial sector as well as its future socio-economic development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0896920512440573">
<title>The Trade Context</title>
<p>Historically, Brazilian trade policy was based on the perception that the key risks facing Brazil related to its economic vulnerability and not to its external security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512440573">Motta Veiga, 2009</xref>: 116). Thus, protecting the economy from potential vulnerabilities related to trade was at the heart of Brazilian foreign policy objectives (usually summarized as a search for ‘autonomy’ and ‘development’). From the 1950s to the 1980s, trade protectionism was the norm in Brazil under its import substitution industrialization (ISI) policies and inwardly oriented developmentalist model. The 1980s debt crisis accentuated the decline of the ISI model and eventually convinced policy-makers to embark on an intensive unilateral trade liberalization process in the early 1990s. Average nominal tariffs dropped from 57.5 percent in 1987 to 13 percent in 1993. By the late 1990s, Brazil was seen as a genuinely global trader with diversified trade – geographically as well as with respect to range of products. Yet its share in total world trade remained under 1 percent. However, market liberalization did not remove state intervention in favour of import competing sectors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512440573">Motta Veiga (2009)</xref> noted that import competing industries maintained a high level of policy influence ensuring high effective tariff protection and tailor-made investment incentives. The automotive industry was the best example of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512440573">Doctor, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a closed economy for decades, perhaps rather surprisingly, Brazilian trade policy had a strong engagement with the multilateral process at its core. Brazil considered it very important to actively participate in shaping the emerging rules of the game, which would later be embedded in international regimes. Hence, it was an original member of the still-born International Trade Organization (proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It was acknowledged as one of the key players in the launch of the Doha Development Round in 2001. At the Cancún Ministerial in 2003, Brazil took a lead in organizing the G20 (trade) in opposition to further liberalization in manufactured goods trade without concomitant progress on agricultural goods. In fact, Brazil’s overall aspiration to become ‘rule-maker’ and not a mere ‘rule-taker’ in the international arena was first evident in international trade. However, it should not be forgotten that this process evolved slowly. It was only some ten years after the initiation of Brazil’s trade liberalization process that it noticeably shifted from mainly defensive positions to that of a <italic>demandeur</italic> in the international trade arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512440573">WTO, 2009</xref>). These new offensive stances came with the increased importance given to agri-business in Brazil’s trade negotiating position.</p>
<p>Brazil’s mantle as an emerging power with a determined, but constructive and pro-active voice in global trade politics was well represented by President Lula and his Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim (who had served as Brazilian Ambassador to the WTO in the 1990s). Although diversifying trade partners remains a strategic objective, under Lula trade policy made a qualitative shift favouring South-South trade (at least at the rhetorical level). He decided to abandon negotiations with the USA for a hemispheric free trade agreement and resisted WTO+ disciplines (e.g. investment issues, intellectual property, government procurement, labour and environment standards) in trade negotiations. However, he did not actively retreat to protectionism. In early 2008, the average applied tariff was 11.5 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512440573">WTO, 2009</xref>). All the same, as in the case of most large economies with rich resource endowments, trade remained a small share of Brazilian GDP (about 26% at its height in 2008).</p>
<p>Although it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss Brazil’s rising influence in the WTO, it is worth noting how it was rated in the WTO’s latest trade policy review. In 2009, the WTO published the <italic>Fifth Trade Policy Review</italic> for Brazil noting the economy’s improving trade performance and its growing role in global trade negotiations. During the review period (2003–7) exports increased at an average annual rate of 22 percent (in terms of US dollars) and imports grew faster at an average annual rate of 26 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512440573">WTO, 2009</xref>). The <italic>Review</italic> also noted Brazil’s active use of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Between January 1995 and August 2011, the WTO registered 426 cases for dispute settlement. Brazil was a complainant in 25 cases, a respondent in 14 cases (the last in 2006) and a third party in 64 cases (see the WTO website). Moreover, it won many of its cases and was even authorized to take retaliatory measures in two (aircraft export subsidies against Canada and cotton production subsidies against the USA). Most recently, in March 2011, the WTO ruled the USA was illegally charging anti-dumping duties on US$2b worth of imports of Brazilian frozen orange juice.</p>
<p>Finally, trends pre-dating the Rousseff government suggest that Brazilian trade performance and policy are already undergoing changes with longer term consequences for the economy. In terms of trade performance, recent years have shown a growing share of commodity exports, alongside a falling share as well as a growing deficit in manufactured goods trade. The growing priority given to South-South trade diversified its range of trade partners, but also introduced a heavy political component into trade relations. While smaller businesses were often happy to accommodate this preference,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512440573">1</xref></sup> big business pushed for more explicit economic criteria in trade negotiations and choice of trade promotion efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512440573">CNI, 2006</xref>). Business has also requested anti-dumping investigations with increasing frequency. Of the approximately 140 investigations launched in the past decade, some 37 new cases were taken up for investigation in 2010 alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920512440573">2</xref></sup> Other important policy trends include a growing willingness to extend tax exemptions to consumer goods exports in addition to the already available support for capital goods. The government has demonstrated a greater preference for domestic products in public procurement contracts (e.g. by specifying local content requirements, notably in the oil industry supply chain) to support domestic industrial production and to reduce the import bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512440573">CINDES, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Trade in the Early Months of the Rousseff Government</title>
<p>According to the Secretariat of Foreign Trade data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512440573">SECEX, 2011</xref>), the first three months of 2011 saw record first quarter results for exports (US$51.2b) and imports (US$48.1b) with an average daily trade flow of US$1.6b. Exports were growing at a faster rate than imports (quarter-on-quarter at 28% and 23% respectively). Early in the year, partly due to seasonal factors, manufactured goods rose to about half of all exports, but by mid-year, basic and intermediate goods were well over 60 percent. Noteworthy was that the overall export performance managed to compensate for the general economic slowdown in the advanced economies as well as event-driven downturns in demand from Japan (due to the earthquake and its aftermath) and the Middle East (due to the economic slowdown brought on by the street protests, political turmoil and work stoppages of the ‘Arab Spring’). By August 2011, Brazil had exported US$166.7b (32% more than in January-August 2010) and imported US$146.8b (up 28%). Brazil seems headed to increase its share of world trade above 1.36 percent (as it was in 2010).</p>

<p>A number of policy arenas (multilateral, inter-regional and regional) and specific trade partners (the USA and China) received much attention in the first eight months of the new government. On the multilateral front, Brazilian negotiators showed increasing frustration with stagnation in the Doha Round. They felt that they had put forward various constructive initiatives, but had them rejected with no alternative forthcoming. Already in February 2011, Brazilian officials indicated that cuts in agricultural subsidies as put forward in the ‘Lamy package’ in July 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512440573">ICTSD, 2008</xref>) were no longer sufficient, and that tariff cuts and increased market access were necessary for Brazil to move forward. According to media reports, Brazilian ambassador to the WTO, Roberto Azevedo, is reported to have said that ‘the situation is serious, we must reflect on it, and conduct internal consultations to decide how to proceed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512440573"><italic>Valor Econômico</italic>, 2011</xref>). Brazil’s frustration was growing with the increasing difficulty of turning around the intransigent positions of some of the key players (i.e. USA, China and India). Moreover, policy statements suggest that the Rousseff government is getting tougher in its demands for more access to the agricultural markets of the advanced economies as well as becoming more cautious about market opening for manufactures in the context of a highly overvalued currency.</p>
<p>Brazil, alongside its Mercosur partners, is involved in negotiating an inter-regional association agreement with the European Union (EU). It has participated in four rounds of negotiations since the re-launch of talks in May 2010. In February, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said, rather optimistically, that he expected to sign a trade agreement ‘by the summer holidays’. Rousseff also appeared interested in an early conclusion to negotiations and supported Mercosur negotiators’ plans to make a verbal exchange of offers early in 2011. However, by the March 2011 round of talks in Brussels, the situation had become much more complicated. Fearing an inter-regional preferential trade agreement was nearly ready to be signed, the EU agricultural lobby managed to create such a fuss in opposition to it that the EU Parliament felt obliged to issue statements that warned trade negotiators in the European Commission to go forward more cautiously. By the end of March, Irish Agriculture Minister, Simon Coveney, could confidently inform the press that he did not expect an agreement before the end of the year (if at all). Moreover, Brazil and Argentina became markedly more reluctant to liberalize trade in non-agricultural sectors. In 2012, presidential elections are scheduled in France (notoriously protectionist in its positions on agriculture) as are the start of talks for a reform of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It was increasingly evident that a key moment favouring an agreement had been missed.</p>
<p>Early in 2011, President Dilma Rousseff participated in two important state visits, both with a clear trade agenda: US President Obama’s visit to Brazil in March and Rousseff’s visit to China in April. These two economies were Brazil’s two single largest trade partners (as well as being important sources of foreign investment). It spoke volumes that they were the targets of high-level exchanges in the very early days of the new government. The American president’s visit was focused on a clear economic agenda (specifically on increasing US exports to Brazil to support jobs at home as well as a technical cooperation agreement in the energy sector). However, Rousseff hoped (in vain) that Obama would voice backing for Brazil’s bid for a permanent seat on a reformed UN Security Council. In her no-nonsense style, she also insisted that Brazil-USA exchanges needed to go beyond mere good will statements. She pointedly noted the need for them to discuss US trade barriers to Brazilian exports as well as the negative impact of the depreciating American dollar on Brazilian export competitiveness. She found that the American president had come empty-handed, since he was unable to reassure Brazil on its bilateral trade concerns.</p>
<p>Rousseff’s China trip was also focused on economic issues, specifically trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) and the ‘currency war’. In 2009, China became Brazil’s main trading partner (for the first time displacing the USA from top position) and Brazil enjoyed a US$5b surplus in bilateral trade. Even more surprisingly given historical precedent, China was also the main source of FDI in Brazil in 2010. Although the relation was a mutually beneficial and cordial one on the face of things, it was also an extremely complex one from the viewpoint of Brazil’s many neo-developmentalist policy-makers. Brazil had to tread a delicate balance between competition and cooperation in its relations with China. Thus, notwithstanding the trade surplus in Brazil’s favour, the government was increasingly concerned about the composition of bilateral trade – over 80 percent of Brazilian exports to China were commodities (mainly iron ore and soya) and over 90 percent of Brazilian imports from China were manufactured goods. In 2005 only six out of 19 industrial sectors saw China with a share of over 10 percent of imports, but by 2009, already 12 sectors had market shares of over 10 percent of imports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512440573">Puga and Nascimento, 2010</xref>). In 2005, two industrial sectors gave China more than a 5 percent share in domestic consumption (electronics and electronic materials), but by 2010 another two sectors could be added (textiles and diversified manufactures such as toys). Media reports suggest that Rousseff was decidedly outraged when she learnt that over 80 percent of carnival costumes and summer bikinis sold in Brazil in the 2010–11 season were ‘made in China’. Brazil faced growing competition from Chinese manufactures not only at home, but also abroad. It was losing market share to China mainly in Latin America, including among its Mercosur partners. Thus, the Brazil-China trade relation more than any other brought to the fore fears of de-industrialization and the dangers of growing dependency on a trade partner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920512440573">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since early 2011, Brazil has taken a number of more protectionist stances in dealing with trade issues, although also taken care not to diverge from the letter of WTO agreements. It has resorted to measures such as the removal of tariff discounts to compensate for currency appreciation (impacting for example on vehicle assemblers’ choice to import or locally source auto parts) and the re-introduction of non-automatic import licensing to calm import demand (again mainly affecting vehicle imports). The Minister of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC), Fernando Pimentel, admitted that the government was being stricter about the implementation of ‘commercial defence mechanisms’. In addition, in September 2011, Brazil submitted proposals to its Mercosur partners to allow a temporary increase in national tariffs above the Mercosur common external tariff to defend local producers from extra-regional imports of a specified list of consumer goods.</p>

<title>Key Trade Policy and Export Performance Concerns</title>
<p>This article does not directly examine on-going regional, inter-regional or multilateral trade negotiations, although many of them are stalled or experiencing difficulties. These negotiations by definition involve other parties and therefore are outside the predominant control of the government. Instead, the article focuses on issues more unequivocally in the hands of the government and business in Brazil. These relate to augmenting business competitiveness, providing better export financing, dealing with the currency issue (to the extent possible), and considering the implications of Brazil’s evolving export profile for overall development. Of course, progress in the external negotiations also have an impact on the government’s growing concerns related to export and import performance and shifting trade profile. Needless to say, many of the above mentioned issues do not fall into the remit of trade policy per se, but overlap with various dimensions of industrial policy.</p>
<p>Ever since the trade liberalization and market reforms of the 1990s, it became fashionable in business circles to grumble about the ‘<italic>Custo Brasil</italic>’, i.e. reduced systemic competitiveness due to the high cost of doing business in Brazil. International competitiveness rankings usually show Brazil in a poor light. The World Bank’s <italic>Doing Business Report 2011</italic> ranked Brazil 127 out of a total of 183 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512440573">World Bank, 2010</xref>). The World Economic Forum’s <italic>World Competitiveness Report 2010-11</italic> ranked Brazil in the upper mid-range of economies surveyed (in 58th place out of 139). The detailed breakdown and comparisons with previous years provided a discouraging picture of the prospects for improving competitiveness in the short to medium term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512440573">Doctor, 2010</xref>). Given the trade emphasis of this article, it was considered useful to list the disaggregated details of the ‘trading across borders’ aspect of the World Bank <italic>Doing Business</italic> ranking (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0896920512440573">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Brazilian industry was especially concerned with the impact of government regulations, taxes and infrastructure bottlenecks on international competitiveness. During the 2010 election campaign, the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) presented each presidential candidate with an industry wish-list in a report with the title: <italic>Industry in Brazil: An Agenda to Grow More and Better</italic>. The report detailed proposals for the adoption of a ‘competitiveness agenda’. It pinpointed 12 areas for action that industry believed would address the ‘<italic>Custo Brasil</italic>’ problem, stimulate sustained growth and help consolidate Brazil’s presence in global markets and economic governance forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512440573">CNI, 2010</xref>). During the campaign, Rousseff came across as open to taking these proposals on board, but once in office she has been more preoccupied with managing macro-economic issues related to inflation, interest rates, capital inflows and currency appreciation.</p>
<p>Another key concern for business was access to export financing. This issue came to the fore in the early days of the 2008 crash. Domestic entrepreneurs’ access to credit was relatively limited and difficult (Brazil ranked 89th in this category of the World Bank’s <italic>Doing Business</italic> report), but the crisis exacerbated the situation. It was quickly evident that the big fall in exports in the last quarter of 2008 was not only due to cancellations of orders or drops in new ones, but also because of the drying up of export credit. For this reason, the Lula government announced it would prioritize better access to export financing, both increasing supply of export credit and reducing the costs of export financing. The government took measures to</p>
<list id="list2-0896920512440573" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>extend PROEX (the export promotion financing programme administered by the National Development Bank, BNDES) and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>set up a new Foreign Trade Guarantee Fund. Once the immediate impacts of the crisis wore off, export financing returned to more normal levels, and the current government has put greater emphasis on supporting competitiveness so as to offset currency appreciation.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The post-crisis conjuncture rekindled the debate on the relation between trade and exchange rate policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512440573">CINDES, 2010</xref>). The Brazilian <italic>real</italic> appreciated over 40 percent against the dollar in the three years after the September 2008 global crisis, which affected the competitiveness of exports and imports. Although the currency appreciation was not directly linked to trade, but rather to capital flows, the brunt of its impact was felt by Brazilian manufacturers (they lost shares in both foreign and domestic markets). The situation raised complaints in policy and business circles about the way Brazil’s trade partners (especially its two largest ones, China and the USA) were using exchange rate manipulation to boost their own competitiveness (and by implication undermine Brazilian competitiveness). In 2010, the Economy Minister, Guido Mantega, went so far as to dub the situation a ‘currency war’. Given rising inflation and the use of monetary policy to contain it (i.e. raising interest rates) only served to increase demand for the local currency via the carry trade, and has led to further currency appreciation. Declining trade surpluses also revived debates about the extent to which the Central Bank should get involved in currency markets to support a ‘desirable’ exchange rate. However, given its commitment to a floating exchange rate, the government was obliged to use other approaches to stem the tide of imports. For example, the more rigorous application of trade defence mechanisms as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The issues discussed so far relate to the more immediate concerns of business and policy-makers. However, at the heart of policy debates lay the long-run question about the evolution of Brazil’s export profile. This involved two separate but mutually reinforcing trends:</p>
<list id="list3-0896920512440573" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the issue of a falling share of manufactured goods in GDP as well as exports, so-called ‘de-industrialization’, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the meagre participation of knowledge intensive products in total exports.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In 2009, the manufacturing share of GDP fell to 25 percent, the lowest share since 1947. To make matters worse, also in 2009, the export share of manufactured goods fell below 50 percent for the first time since 1978. Explanations for this ranged from structural changes in the economy that were a natural progression of the modernization process (good) to a growing reliance on commodity and natural resource intensive exports (bad).</p>
<p>Brazil’s agri-business and mineral exports are in high demand (especially in fast growing China and India). Elevated commodity prices favour increasing surpluses and a greater share in the value of exports. In addition, Brazil is no longer a net energy importer and is likely to experience an improving trade balance for the energy sector in the coming years. Thus, the crux of the debate is focused on encouraging absolute increases in manufactured exports as well as a greater relative share in world markets for these types of exports. Given the developmentalist sensitivities of Brazilian policy-makers and industry’s growing concern with ‘de-industrialization’, the government will be under pressure to reverse the apparent trend moving Brazil back to being a primary goods’ exporter focused on price and quantity rather than value-added. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512440573">Gallagher (2010)</xref> pointed out, an important aspect of China’s growing share of trade in Latin America was the threat it posed to the region’s opportunities to boost the technology content of production and to diversify exports into industrial and modern sectors. The growing importance of commodity trade enhances the risks associated with ‘Dutch disease’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920512440573">4</xref></sup> and the ‘resource curse’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920512440573">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512440573">Karl, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The second aspect related to the export profile issue was the share of high-tech exports relative to low- and medium-tech exports. Business and the more developmentalist-oriented policy-makers argue that the government should devote much of its attention to value-added and the technology content of exports. Moreover, addressing this issue, alongside infrastructure investments and tax reform, was crucial to improving overall trade performance. Most Brazilian exports had low technology content. There were a few exceptions such as aircraft (EMBRAER), energy (Petrobrás) and, less noticeably, certain agriculture goods (benefiting from agriculture research company EMBRAPA’s innovations and technological developments, even though agricultural goods are not listed as high-tech).</p>
<p>Low levels of high-tech exports are partly the result of weaknesses in the economy’s science and technology profile. About 1.1 percent of GDP is spent on research and development, a low 11 percent of the working age population have university degrees, and only 1.6 percent of world scientific articles came from Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512440573">OECD, 2010</xref>: 160). In 2005, only about half of the 12,000 firms surveyed for the Industrial Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC) were classified as innovative firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512440573">Avellar and Kupfer, 2011</xref>: 37), and there were only 1.5 researchers per thousand employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512440573">OECD, 2010</xref>: 160). Brazil is still an efficiency-driven rather than an innovation-driven economy, although the government has shown growing awareness of the need to boost innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512440573">Rodriguez et al., 2008</xref>). In July 2011, the government announced the <italic>Plano Brasil Maior</italic> (‘Bigger Brazil Plan’) giving priority to supporting technological development and innovation among firms as well as boosting competitiveness and exports. For example, government banks and technology centres have committed to play a major role in reducing the growing trade deficit in the information and communication technology sector (its deficit was US$18.9m in 2010).</p>
<p>To summarize, Rousseff’s Brazil faces a number of challenges on the trade front in the coming years. While maintaining its current trajectory may seem to point to further achievements, a longer view indicates the need to urgently address the issues related to systemic competitiveness, export financing, currency appreciation, and ‘de-industrialization’. Finally, if the future belongs to those with an advantage in the knowledge economy, then Brazil’s biggest trade and industrial policy tests lie in supporting the growth and competitiveness of technology intensive and innovation-driven firms. Getting Brazil onto this path is the biggest opportunity and challenge for the Rousseff government.</p>

<p>To encourage small firms to export, the government excluded export revenues from the calculation to allow firms to work within the SIMPLES tax regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512440573">CINDES, 2010</xref>). The latter was a simplified version that allowed small firms to ease the burden of administering the normal byzantine tax regulations and form-filling imposed by the inefficient and onerous Brazilian tax system.</p></fn>

<p>A brief definition of ‘Dutch disease’: it refers to ‘the negative impact on an economy of anything that gives rise to a sharp inflow of foreign currency, such as the discovery of large oil reserves. The currency inflows lead to currency appreciation, making the country’s other products less price competitive on the export market. It also leads to higher levels of cheap imports and can lead to de-industrialization as industries apart from resource exploitation are moved to cheaper locations.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440573">Financial Times Lexicon, 2011</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>The ‘resource curse’ relates to the paradox that countries that have abundant natural resources often find that they have poor economic growth, insufficient development and inadequate governance, often performing worse than those with less wealth.</p></fn>
