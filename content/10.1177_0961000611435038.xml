<abstract>
<p>The decision by public libraries in New Zealand to implement Facebook has been uneven. Using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory, a survey of nine public libraries investigated the process of its adoption or non-adoption. The motivating factors for the adoption of Facebook were identified. The surveyed libraries all met the four prior conditions for its adoption. In the innovation-decision process libraries fulfilled the knowledge stage to differing degrees. In the persuasion stage the attributes of relative advantage, compatibility and complexity were the most important factors to explain adoption. Other factors favouring adoption, such as the importance of change agents, were also discovered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Librarians are becoming interested in the potential benefits of using social networking software to communicate, collaborate and converse with their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611435038">Macaskill and Owen, 2006</xref>). One of the most successful online social networking tools is Facebook. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard University, Facebook had 500 million members worldwide in July 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611435038">Wauters, 2010</xref>). The original concept of Facebook as an online student directory for college students has become a global resource for locating and linking with people.</p>
<p>Businesses have recognised the benefits of Facebook and have used it as an innovative marketing tool for building relationships with their customers. Given the maturity of Facebook in the business environment, it seems timely for public libraries to consider adopting it, yet familiarity with public libraries will soon reveal that there is little consistency among library professionals in adopting social networking tools. While some libraries will adopt a new technology such as Facebook quickly, others will implement it after some time has elapsed, with the remainder only willing to adopt it once it is very well established. Little is understood as to how and why public librarians make the choice to adopt or not to adopt Facebook, and what factors might affect their readiness to accept new technologies. This research investigates aspects of Facebook adoption among public libraries in New Zealand and examines how they evaluate Facebook as a potential networking tool. The results of this research will lead to a better understanding of the motivation for the adoption and non-adoption of new technologies by public libraries.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework used in this research draws on Everett M. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory. This theory is useful because it leads to a deeper understanding of the process of adoption of technological innovations such as Facebook by public libraries. DOI theory posits that the characteristics of innovations, as perceived by individuals, will help to explain the different rates at which they are adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>:15). Rogers’ theory is relevant to this research because it explains not only the rates of adoption but the whole decision-making process pertaining to the adoption of Facebook among public libraries.</p>
<p>Few public libraries in New Zealand use the potential of social networking tools to support their services. The questions asked by this research were:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611435038" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How have New Zealand public librarians assessed and evaluated Facebook?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the motivating factors that cause New Zealand public libraries to adopt or not to adopt Facebook?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The potential benefits of this project are that public librarians can consider how they and their libraries match the profiles of the nine public libraries reported on here, with a view to gaining a better understanding of how innovations are adopted or rejected by organisations.</p>

<sec id="section2-0961000611435038">
<title>Facebook and libraries</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611435038">Aleman and Wartman (2009)</xref>, Facebook was originally an online social networking site for university students, but its use has spread to businesses and various other demographic groups. Facebook’s growth rate was 181% among users aged 25 to 34, whereas it was only 149% among university students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611435038">Heussner (2009)</xref> reported that Facebook’s fastest growing demographic are users around 35 years old and that people who are 55 years or older are adopting Facebook at a faster rate than younger users (often attributed to their desire to keep in touch with family). Given the current demographic of Facebook users, libraries need to decide whether they wish to adopt Facebook, and if so, to identify their intended audience for it and determine appropriate content for this audience.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611435038">Holzner (2009)</xref> conducted a survey of Facebook users and examined how marketers use social marketing to advertise their products. Some library literature has looked at the potential of Facebook for library marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611435038">Jia and Nesta, 2006</xref>). One study found that Facebook activity in two American research universities is conducive to library marketing and can be used to publicise library services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611435038">Xia, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Librarians need to understand their customers before they can cater to their needs. For example, the ‘Net Generation’ (those born after the early 1980s) grew up with technology and therefore Facebook can be a marketing tool to reach out to them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611435038">Maxymuk (2007)</xref> expressed concern about a potential disconnection between libraries and the Net-Gen. It is crucial for libraries to investigate using social networking tools to reach out to this generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611435038">Abram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611435038">Maxymuk, 2010</xref>), for this way librarians can ensure customer focused services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611435038">Abram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611435038">Jia and Nesta, 2006</xref>). Marketing, after all, is not simply promotion; it has to reflect a service improvement and it has to add value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611435038">Kotler, 1979</xref>: 38).</p>
<p>Facebook is a valuable tool for teaching, communicating with customers and building community. Empirical studies in the Pennsylvania State University Library demonstrated that Facebook is a very popular and effective communication tool because it allows librarians to interact with students. After this experience with Facebook some librarians agreed that it encouraged social and group work and is an excellent teaching tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611435038">Mack et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611435038">Charnigo and Barnett-Ellis (2007)</xref> interviewed 126 academic librarians at the Houston Cole Academic Library and found the majority thought Facebook falls outside the scope of professional librarianship. Thus, there seems to be some inconsistency among librarians as to the benefits or otherwise of Facebook. A significant report found college students and the general public have little interest in participating in the social networking sites of libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611435038">OCLC, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611435038">Connell (2009)</xref> surveyed 366 Valparaiso University freshmen and although the majority responded that they would accept library contact through Facebook, a minority reacted negatively due to a perceived personal privacy issue.</p>
<p>Some overseas public libraries have implemented Facebook. Examples are Cacak Public Library, Serbia; Yarra Plenty Regional Library Service, Melbourne; Manchester Library and Information Service; and Toronto Public Library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611435038">Sokoloff, 2009</xref>). They use Facebook for promoting their events and programmes, to respond to enquiries, and to provide access to their catalogue. The Edmonton Public Library in Canada claims ‘our users are on Facebook; therefore we want to be on Facebook’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611435038">Hall, 2007</xref>). These libraries found that using Facebook was a progressive move and its implementation was timely.</p>

<sec id="section3-0961000611435038">
<title>Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory</title>
<p>Rogers’ DOI theory has often been used as a theoretical framework to analyse the adoption of information and communication technologies in the library environment (for example, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611435038">Minishi-Majanja and Kiplang’at, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611435038">Rutherford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611435038">White, 2001</xref>). This research has used DOI theory primarily to explore the factors that influence public librarians when considering whether to adopt Facebook.</p>
<p>The following key concepts from this theory have been selected to suit the purpose of this research: innovation, technology cluster, diffusion and the rate of adoption. ‘Innovation’ is defined as ‘an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 12). In this study, ‘innovation’ refers to Facebook. The definition of ‘technology cluster’ includes social software which is ‘one or more distinguishable elements of technology that are perceived as being interrelated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 14). ‘Diffusion’ is defined as ‘the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 11). The ‘rate of adoption’ is defined as ‘the relative speed with which an innovation is adopted by members of a social system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 15). The social system in this research is the public library. This research focuses on the evaluation process that leads to a decision whether to adopt or not adopt Facebook, which is used here as an example of an innovation.</p>
<p>A relevant aspect of DOI theory is the ‘innovation-decision process’. It is defined as:
<disp-quote>
<p>the process through which an individual (or decision-making unit) passes from gaining initial knowledge of an innovation, to forming an attitude toward the innovation, to making a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 168)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This concept was used to understand the process through which public librarians evaluate Facebook. There are four prior conditions in DOI theory that can help predict the rate of adoption of an innovation: previous practice, felt needs/problems, innovativeness and the norms of the social systems. Within the evaluation process itself, DOI theory has five stages of information seeking and gathering, though here the research looks only at the first two: the knowledge stage and the persuasion stage. The later stages of decision, implementation and confirmation, have not been used in this research because of their individualistic nature. Though important to every organisation considering the adoption of an innovation, these stages lack generalisability and so were omitted. Within the persuasion stage DOI theory identifies five attributes of innovations that affect the rate of adoption of an innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 15–16). These five major attributes are:</p>
<list id="list2-0961000611435038" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>relative advantage, ‘the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>compatibility, ‘the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>complexity, ‘the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>trialability, ‘the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis’; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>observability, ‘the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others’.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref> also stated that members of a social system could be categorised on the basis of innovativeness, and his five adopter categories, i.e. innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards, were used to help understand the relative speed of adoption of Facebook by New Zealand public libraries.</p>

<title>Methodologies and procedures</title>
<p>Interviews were used to gather data because they are suitable for exploring participants’ beliefs, experiences, opinions or knowledge structures. The interview is also useful when exploring a new topic not previously researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611435038">Beck and Manuel, 2008</xref>). Though Facebook is a mature Web technology, it is a relatively new concept in many public libraries and no research has been conducted into its use in New Zealand.</p>
<p>To ensure a variety of perspectives, a range of small to large libraries was chosen. Five of the libraries had adopted Facebook to support their library services, and four of the libraries had not adopted Facebook. The participants in this research were key staff responsible for implementing and maintaining the social media used by their libraries. The positions of these nine participants were library manager, digital access manager, digital library services manager, information services team leader, electronic services coordinator, head of information services, information services librarian, technical services librarian and service delivery manager. The population sample has been coded as PL1 to PL9. When direct quotes are used for presenting findings, participants are assigned the number of the library they represented.</p>
<p>The interview schedule consisted of three sections. Section A collected organisational profiles of the surveyed libraries. Section B included seven questions on the overall use and adoption of social networking software. Section C had two parts containing questions about the process of adoption decision and attributes and factors associated with the adoption or non-adoption of Facebook (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0961000611435038">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The content analysis consisted of two main parts. The first part involved dividing the interview data collected into different conceptual categories, for this helps develop patterns that assist in the explanation of the phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611435038">Corbin and Strauss, 2008</xref>). The data analysis procedure used in this research was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611435038">Tesch’s (1990)</xref> framework, a clear process for organising unstructured data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611435038">Beck and Manuel, 2008</xref>). The transcribed data was divided and analysed, question by question, to highlight trends and patterns in the different answers to the same question according to the theoretical framework. Finally, all the analysed information was used to help with understanding the factors influencing public librarians’ decision to adopt Facebook in New Zealand public libraries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0961000611435038">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>This section summarises the research findings. The first section provides general information on the use of social networking tools in the surveyed libraries. The second and third sections answer the first research question of this project while the fourth and fifth sections are aimed at answering the second research question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0961000611435038">
<title>Overall use and adoption of social networking tools</title>
<p>The surveyed public libraries have websites and use various social networking tools for communicating with customers and for marketing and promotion. Of the nine libraries studied, only three libraries, PL1, PL6 and PL7, have implemented a Facebook profile with a link on their websites. Meanwhile, PL2 and PL3 at the time of data gathering had placed Facebook on trial to test whether it was suitable for their libraries. PL4 rejected Facebook, saying it was not suitable for its needs. The other libraries, PL5, PL8 and PL9, have other social networking tools such as Twitter, Blogs, Flick’r, YouTube, MySpace and Delicious on their websites.</p>
<p>Participants from all the libraries were aware of Facebook, mainly through friends and family members, and have used Facebook personally. Six out of the nine participants agreed that Facebook was a new innovation within the library sector. They had, however, different perspectives of the notion ‘new innovation’. For example, PL6 and PL7 mentioned that Facebook is a fairly new concept used in New Zealand organisations but not for overseas organisations, whereas PL9 said that Facebook is not new in terms of individual personal use in New Zealand but it is a new social networking tool in New Zealand organisations. PL1 and PL8 both disagreed that Facebook is a new innovation as they were aware that Facebook has been around since 2004.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0961000611435038">
<title>Evaluation process overview</title>
<p>Only PL1 applied a formal process for assessing and evaluating Facebook prior to its implementation. The library formed a project group to assess and evaluate Facebook; staff from different business units (including an expert in information technology) were involved in the project. The group conducted a literature review on general social media, followed by a focused environmental scan, a customer survey on social media and an evaluation of Facebook. The team then presented its recommendation to senior management.</p>
<p>PL2 undertook a similar process to PL1 but involved all staff in the evaluation of Facebook through a general staff wiki and staff meetings. The library staff of PL6 and PL7, both which adopted Facebook, recommended to senior management that Facebook be implemented without going through a formal process. PL4 simply looked at what other libraries were doing and, after a short trial period, decided not to adopt Facebook, believing it did not provide any added value.</p>
<p>PL3 adopted Facebook in some branch libraries, but only on the recommendation of individual branch staff. PL5 is still considering whether it wants to explore Facebook as a social networking tool. PL9 is more interested in Kete, a customised library intranet which is quite similar to Facebook in terms of interaction and participation for customers. PL8 did not have an evaluation process for Facebook as its Facebook ‘I love [PL8]’ was driven by their customers instead of PL8 staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0961000611435038">
<title>Decision-making process</title>
<p>For eight public libraries, the exception being PL8, the decision whether or not to use Facebook was dealt with internally by staff with the consent of senior management. Their councils (the local government authorities that fund public libraries) provided them a free rein to make a decision to use Facebook. PL8, however, reported that its council did not allow any use of social networking tools due to concerns about them affecting the security of their intranet.</p>
<p>Importantly, all the interviewees appear to enjoy trying out new technologies and have used Facebook and other Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and Weblogs. When asked about whether their library often adopts new technologies, the staff from PL1, PL3, PL4 and PL9 responded that their libraries would not blindly follow others in adopting technologies. The libraries that only occasionally adopt new technology seem to be partially restricted by their councils. The others reported that they understand the importance of social media. PL7 said that they ‘try to encourage and keep up to new technologies’.</p>
<p>All surveyed public libraries said Facebook is a communication tool that enables them to understand their customers’ needs through feedback and comments. PL2 stated that a ‘website is essential to give basic information but what you also need is Facebook which is about the conversation and engaging with your customers’. PL2 also felt Facebook provided an alternative way for them to communicate with existing customers and to build an online community: ‘I don’t think we serve our online community very well or discover/build our online community yet’. For PL6, Facebook has opened up another channel of communication for the library. All the nine public libraries felt that most library services only focus on primary library functions and that Facebook is an extra function on top of the normal library functions whose potential to perform has not been tested.</p>

<title>Motivation for Facebook adoption and non-adoption</title>
<sec id="section10-0961000611435038">
<title>Adoption</title>
<p>In terms of DOI labels, PL6 classified itself as an innovator, PL4 classified itself as an early adopter, whereas PL1 and PL2 considered themselves to be early majority and PL7 and PL3 identified themselves as late majority. None of the libraries identified themselves as laggards. PL5, PL8 and PL9 are non-adopters and therefore do not easily fall into any of the adopter categories as determined by Rogers’ 2003 model, but could be considered to be laggards.</p>
<p>Staff in PL1, PL2, PL3, PL5, PL6 and PL7 agreed that Facebook is a good marketing and promotional vehicle for library events and activities. PL1 and PL6 said that Facebook enables the library to reach a market segment not well serviced by traditional channels, so it could reach potential new customers in the wider community.</p>
<p>PL1, PL2, PL3, PL6 and PL9 felt that Facebook is compatible with the traditional library culture and values of open information sharing, provision of good customer service without end-user charges if possible, and empowering customers with knowledge. Most public librarians around the world would recognise the philosophy and values these New Zealand libraries wish to promote. PL2 added that Facebook reflects their library culture as being casual and personal.</p>
<p>PL6 and PL7 said it is helpful that existing staff are already using Facebook. PL6 and PL9 stated that management and staff support is a crucial factor in the adoption of Facebook. PL2 felt that an important motivating factor was that the library wanted to keep up to date with technologies.</p>
<p>PL1 and PL9 believed that Facebook’s personalised, interactive quality gives the library a friendly, approachable and modern image. Moreover, PL2 felt that Facebook enables the library to engage with customers in a meaningful way as it is not just about the library providing information to customers but providing customers with the opportunity to contribute content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0961000611435038">
<title>Non-adoption</title>
<p>The main issue that hinders the adoption of Facebook is a lack of staff resources to manage and maintain it. To PL5 and PL9 Facebook is another system to manage that requires staff time, and it will be a challenge to add Facebook responsibility on to current staff workload. Among the adopters PL1, PL4 and PL7 said that much time and effort are required to interact with customers and sustain their interest in Facebook once it has been adopted as a networking tool. Further, PL3 said that it is important for staff to embrace the decision to use Facebook, for they would be responsible for keeping the Facebook site active and vibrant.</p>
<p>PL2, PL6 and PL9 are concerned that the time, effort and cost invested in the use of Facebook are greater than its potential value. They mentioned the possibility of losing council support if the Facebook initiative failed. PL3 and PL4 found it hard to choose the right technology as there are many to choose from, especially when existing technologies can be replaced so easily by new ones. PL3 was unsure whether Facebook would attract more people to the library, though it did agree that Facebook has potential for the library to engage with the community and thus reach new audiences.</p>
<p>All except PL4 and PL5 felt that there is the risk of customers posting inappropriate comments that will mar the reputation of their libraries. PL8 said it is difficult to control the type of people joining Facebook and that undesirable members could pose a risk to both public libraries’ and councils’ reputations through the posting of negative remarks. PL8 referred to it as running ‘the risk of getting toxic people on board who can easily mess it up badly’. PL5 felt the risk actually lies in the implementation of Facebook, for if it is not implemented properly it can be a liability and hence affect the reputation of the library. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611435038">Kane et al. (2009)</xref> said that a dedicated social media team is necessary to deal with potential threats such as negative posts.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-0961000611435038">
<title>Prior conditions of evaluation process</title>
<p>Before going into in-depth discussion of Rogers’ innovation-decision process, it is crucial to discuss and analyse the prior conditions of the nine surveyed public libraries. Rogers outlines four prior conditions which could help predict the rate of Facebook adoption.</p>
<sec id="section13-0961000611435038">
<title>Previous practice</title>
<p>All the nine surveyed public libraries already have skills developed from their own websites and have used social media such as blogs, Flick’r and MySpace as customer service tools. Moreover, most library staff personally use Facebook. Most of the staff members responsible for investigating the adoption of Facebook have technological skills. Having library staff who are personal users of Facebook is an advantage for the libraries, as it makes implementation easier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0961000611435038">
<title>Felt needs/problems</title>
<p>Staff surveyed in the public libraries felt that there is a need for a social networking tool which enables communication with customers while marketing and promoting library services and providing good customer service. For example, PL2, PL3 and PL6 agreed that the library website gives basic information but social media is about conversation and engagement with customers. Moreover, these libraries also felt that Facebook enables the library to serve their online customers. For example, PL6 said: ‘I don’t think we have served our online community very well or have discovered or built our online community yet’.</p>

<p>All the library staff enjoyed trying new technologies and have used Facebook and other Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and blogs. Innovation in these libraries depends on staff as well as management’s and the council’s vision for technology use within the organisations. Most of the public libraries want to be seen as adopting the new, but there are still some restrictions on the technology that they can use, because neither library management nor council want to be associated with technology that could negatively impact the library’s or council’s image.</p>
<p>As a consequence, some libraries have to work with tight restrictions on the use of new technology. A case in point is PL8, whose main barrier to the adoption of Facebook was the council restriction on the use of social media on its computers. On the other hand, PL2’s decision to trial Facebook followed ‘the library strategic plan to do more creative technology work’. Another crucial point to emerge from the research is that larger public libraries such as PL1, PL2, PL4 and PL6 have more resources for innovation and they have a tendency to move quickly in adopting new technology, unlike the smaller libraries such as PL7 or PL9.</p>

<title>Norms of the social system</title>
<p>Libraries around the world are using social networking tools to communicate with their customers (for examples see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611435038">Charnigo and Barnett-Ellis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611435038">Farkas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611435038">Kroski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611435038">Spiteri, 2007</xref>). Public libraries want to stay current and engaged with technology. It is clear that customers spend more of their social lives online, so for public libraries, having a presence in some social networking sites is an opportunity to reach these customers. PL1 said, ‘We want to be where our customers are’.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the nine surveyed public libraries meet Rogers’ prior conditions – previous practice, felt needs/problems, innovativeness, norms of the social systems – despite the different library sizes, which means that these libraries have a good chance of adopting Facebook.</p>

<title>Evaluation process</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref> states that the decision to adopt an innovation has to go through five stages. These are, collectively, called the ‘innovation-decision process’. It is ‘essentially an information-seeking and information-processing activity which can lead to either adoption or rejection of the innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 172). The five stages are: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation. Basically the evaluations were done in just two phases, at the knowledge stage and at the persuasion stage. This fits with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref> that evaluation is essential prior to trial or adoption of the innovation.</p>
<p>In general, the majority of the libraries fitted into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers’ (2003)</xref> definition that an ‘individual seeks innovation-evaluation information in order to reduce uncertainty about an innovation, and the uncertainty associated with this newness’. As an example, PL1 commented that: ‘It is no use wasting time on something that is not going to work or it’s not the right place to be’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0961000611435038">
<title>Knowledge stage</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref>, the knowledge stage consists of three types of knowledge: awareness-knowledge, how-to knowledge and principles-knowledge. All the libraries in the study have evaluated Facebook based on one or more of Rogers’ three types of knowledge.</p>
<p>All the participants interviewed have awareness-knowledge of Facebook through friends and families, and have used it personally. Staff involved in the initial evaluation process were mainly technology experts made responsible for bringing the potential value of Facebook to the attention of staff and management. For example, PL6 ‘proposed to senior management to use Facebook as a strategy of engagement and promotion of library activities’. PL7 ‘proposed to the district manager to adopt Facebook after considerations’, and PL4 ‘brought the idea to the notice of the director’.</p>
<p>After obtaining theoretical knowledge, some libraries went one step further to acquire the ‘how-to knowledge’. PL2 gauged ‘what type of information was being posted, level of fan base and level of interactions’. PL7 looked at each Facebook site in order to understand what was involved in implementation. As PL7 pointed out: ‘You see a lot of papers and conferences, journals all saying how great social media is so you get convinced by all these. Then you go and find out the practical side of it whether it suits you’.</p>
<p>However, there is no evidence to show that the libraries have evaluated Facebook up to Stage 3, which involves gaining information in order to ‘deal with the function principles underlying how an innovation works’. PL4 found Facebook was not useful, and rejected it after trialling it for six months. The reason could be that the library evaluated Facebook merely by ‘looking at other library pages’ and therefore did not fully understand the functionality (potential benefits) of the technology enough to be able to make it work for the library.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0961000611435038">
<title>Persuasion stage</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref>, there are five attributes that make up the persuasion stage in his innovation-decision process. They are, namely: relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, observability and complexity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003</xref>: 16) further explains that: ‘innovations that are perceived by individuals as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and observability and less complexity will be adopted more rapidly than other innovations’.</p>
<sec id="section20-0961000611435038">
<title>Relative advantage</title>
<p>Relative advantage is ‘the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 15). Much of the literature emphasises the idea of social software as new technology (Web 2.0) that will replace older technology (Web 1.0). The research found that the concept of Facebook replacing an older library service was not relevant to its use in public libraries. All the surveyed public libraries had come to the conclusion that Facebook serves a different function in comparison to core library services. For instance, PL2 stated that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The OPAC and Website are about giving information to customers whereas Facebook is about a conversation with customers so you get to understand them. Website is essential to give basic information but what you also need is social media which is about the conversation and engaging with your customers and getting content from them rather than throwing content at them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some of the libraries believed Facebook was a good virtual vehicle to promote library services, and also for social interaction. Furthermore, it provides an interactive communication channel that enables them to understand their customers’ needs through feedback and comments. For example, PL5 stated that Facebook ‘adds a read/write component to our Web’. PL2 said that the website needed to be supplemented by social media like Facebook to provide a facility to be interactive with customers, adding: ‘I don’t think we serve our online community very well or discover/build our online community yet’. This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611435038">Kroski’s (2008)</xref> studies that libraries are becoming interested in using social media to communicate with their customers reflecting the increasing use of online information seeking and the building of an online community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0961000611435038">
<title>Compatibility</title>
<p>Compatibility is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003</xref>: 15) as ‘the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters’. Compatibility proved to be a useful concept in understanding the reason why some of the surveyed public libraries chose to adopt Facebook. Some libraries said they found the attributes of Facebook to be highly compatible and consistent with their own mission and objectives. An example is PL5 who stated that: ‘it is compatible in terms of availability of information’. If Facebook allows information to be made available to all, it fits with the library’s role as an information provider. PL4, however, had used Facebook and subsequently removed it, saying that Facebook was incompatible with the library’s culture and values. PL4 said it was ‘not useful after trialling it’. This shows there is a difference in opinion between the surveyed public libraries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0961000611435038">
<title>Trialability</title>
<p>Trialability is ‘the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 16). If an innovation’s user has difficulty trying it out, this individual will be less likely to adopt it. All the nine surveyed public libraries said that it was inexpensive and easy to implement Facebook. The data suggest that this window of opportunity (i.e. to be able to trial Facebook without fuss) will quicken the pace of the decision making process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0961000611435038">
<title>Observability</title>
<p>Observability is ‘the degree to which the result of an innovation is visible to others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 16). A highly visible innovation will drive communication in peer and personal networks and will in turn create either positive or negative reactions. The surveyed public libraries experimenting with Facebook currently have a fairly high level of visibility due to the volume of information exchange through peers, personal networks, and conferences. It is difficult, however, to determine the number of active contributing customers using the Facebook site of other public libraries, so most observations are based solely on the number of people using their own library’s Facebook site. Observability, therefore, was one aspect of the DOI theory that was difficult to apply to this evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0961000611435038">
<title>Complexity</title>
<p>Complexity was a useful concept in the current study. The complexity of an innovation is a significant factor in whether or not it is adopted, for if the innovation is too difficult to be used it is unlikely to be adopted. Most of the surveyed public libraries agreed that Facebook is easy to use as tool to communicate with friends and families. Conversely, these libraries also mentioned that some Facebook functions cannot be used to meet all their specific requirements. A case in point is PL2 who said: ‘It’s difficult to make Facebook do what you want to do. You have to suit the platform’. Similarly, PL7 said Facebook was ‘simple to set up and put things up but not simple to develop and maintain, and create new things onto [it] … that will be working for you’. Despite this, both libraries have been using Facebook.</p>

<sec id="section25-0961000611435038">
<title>Summary of persuasion stage</title>
<p>When applying these categories to the innovation of Facebook adoption in New Zealand public libraries, this research found that all five characteristics were important in explaining the decision to adopt Facebook. This study found that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity were the most important factors to explain adoption. The above attributes have important implications for the rate of adoption as well as being motivating factors in the adoption/non-adoption of Facebook. Trialability and observability were less important factors in the decision to adopt Facebook.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0961000611435038">
<title>Other motivating factors for Facebook adoption or non-adoption</title>
<sec id="section27-0961000611435038">
<title>Relative advantage/disadvantage</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003)</xref> said that ‘relative advantage’ is the ratio of the expected benefits and costs of the adoption of an innovation. PL2, PL3 and PL9 are concerned about the sustainability and value of Facebook if the time, effort and cost invested in its use are high when compared to the value drawn from Facebook. PL2 is also concerned that the council might lose interest in Facebook. These libraries believe Facebook may become a waste of staff time, and it could be difficult to sustain staff interest in Facebook as part of their work responsibilities. Therefore if libraries find Facebook to be of little value compared to the effort needed to sustain it, especially the use of staff resources, they will not be motivated to adopt it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0961000611435038">
<title>Response from customers and staff</title>
<p>Positive feedback from customers and staff is an indicator of the successful trial/adoption of Facebook, and thus can be a motivator. Most of the public libraries agreed that Facebook is about communicating with customers, therefore they used Facebook to survey opinion. PL6 was happy with the positive feedback it received: ‘They are happy … tell us what they like and dislike regarding our library services via posts to Facebook wall and via staff at the counter’. The library is also happy with metrics on the use of its Facebook site. PL3 said it was: ‘really good to see a community presence’. PL2 was delighted to share his evaluation that the ‘customer fan base was growing and feedback from staff was mainly positive … fantastic as they love social media’.</p>
<p>Conversely, poor responses from customers can discourage Facebook adoption. PL7 did not have feedback from either customers or staff but said: ‘I think Facebook is actually difficult to make connections … our people are already on Facebook but are only interested in being in family groups’. In the same light, PL9 mentioned that: ‘Customers use Facebook for social interaction with their friends …. [They] wouldn’t be interested in [social interaction with] the library’. PL4 trialled Facebook for six months and decided to reject it after evaluation due to ‘no customer feedback and staff did not find it useful’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0961000611435038">
<title>Library culture</title>
<p>The library culture, which here is used to describe the combination of a library philosophy valuing open information access and personalised customer service with organisational cultures that favour innovation, plays an important role in the adoption of Facebook. Organisational support is crucial to the successful adoption of an innovation. PL2 said that there was a lot of interest from their council in using technology creatively and that was a motivation in adopting Facebook.</p>
<p>Another motivating factor is the presence of an innovation champion who will contribute to the success of the innovation in the organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>). This is evident in PL4, PL6 and PL7. In each of these libraries the champion/driver was the technology person: the Electronic Services Coordinator, the Technical Services Librarian and the Digital Manager. Because larger public libraries have bigger budgets and more resources than smaller ones, they can be more innovative, so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers’ (2003)</xref> belief that large organisations will be more innovative becomes applicable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0961000611435038">
<title>Level of innovativeness</title>
<p>The surveyed public libraries classified themselves according to the adopter categories, but their self-identified categories are not appropriate for some of them. For example, PL2 classified itself as early majority, but it should be an innovator or early adopter because it implemented Facebook in 2005 before it had become popular. PL6 considered itself as an innovator but it is really an early adopter, because this library adopted Facebook in 2008 by which time it was already well established. This library, however, did such a good job that other public libraries look to it for advice about using Facebook. Therefore PL6 is an opinion leader, a characteristic of early adopters. Moreover, PL6 decreased the uncertainty about a new idea by adopting it. PL6 is also a ‘local missionary’, helping speed up the diffusion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 283).</p>
<p>PL1, PL4, PL3 and PL7 are early majority because they deliberately delayed the adoption of Facebook for some time. The motto of the early adopter is: ‘Be not the first by which the new is tried, nor the last to lay the old aside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers, 2003</xref>: 284). The early majority’s innovation-decision period is relatively longer than that of the innovators and the early adopters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0961000611435038">
<title>Decision, implementation and confirmation</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435038">Rogers (2003</xref>: 117), the decision stage takes place when ‘an individual (or other decision-making unit) engages in activities that lead to a choice to adopt or reject an innovation’. He points out one way to determine the usefulness of an innovation is to trial it. In general, the surveyed libraries trialled Facebook before deciding whether to adopt or reject it. PL1 and PL6 decided to adopt Facebook after trialling it and PL2 was running a Facebook trial when the library staff member was interviewed for this research. However, PL4 decided to reject Facebook after the trial. PL7 adopted Facebook without trialling it as the library found that it was not useful to trial Facebook because ‘it might create a negative impression and people don’t want to contribute [to this]’.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0961000611435038" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The main motivating factors for the adoption of Facebook are that: it displays benefits as a marketing and promotional tool; it is compatible with library culture and values; it is useful for developing staff interest and management support; it aids the upgrade of staff IT skills; and its personalised, interactive quality gives the library a better public image. By contrast, factors for the non-adoption of Facebook are that: it places a strain on staff resources; there has been poor customer response so far; and there are many risks involved.</p>
<p>This study used Rogers’ innovation-decision process theoretical framework to analyse how New Zealand public libraries proceeded through the decision-making process to adopt or reject Facebook. The nine surveyed public libraries meet all of Rogers’ four prior conditions, though only PL1 and PL2 were comprehensive in their search for information on Facebook. As all nine public libraries met the four prior conditions, it is possible that most public libraries in New Zealand, and possibly in similar countries, will also meet them, though not all will meet the ‘innovativeness’ criterion and some may not have the same ‘felt needs’ as the surveyed libraries.</p>
<p>All nine libraries then went through the first two important stages of the decision-making process: knowledge and persuasion. Within the persuasion stage this study found that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity were the most important factors to explain adoption. Public libraries sought information regarding the viability of Facebook adoption to reduce the use of staff time and other resources. In conjunction, innovations must make unique contributions to the library’s culture; experimentation must be easy; librarians want tools that are simple to learn and use, and which make it easy to track customers’ information exchange online. Again, public librarians in New Zealand and similar countries could look at these results to see how well they match them, and use them when evaluating other innovations, especially for relative advantage, compatibility and complexity.</p>
<p>At the third stage of decision making the public libraries had to decide whether or not to trial Facebook before adopting the innovation. Only PL1, PL2, PL3 and PL6 trialled Facebook; in these libraries staff in charge of technological innovation were enthusiastic. The involvement of a change agent within the organisation is critical to smooth progress in the decision stage. This, too, can be useful for public libraries evaluating new technologies for adoption. The DOI theory proved to be a very appropriate method for evaluating the adoption of Facebook by public libraries in New Zealand, with almost all aspects matching the process used by the library and council staff. Only the later stages of the evaluation process are not so useful because they are very individual in their application.</p>
<p>The study was exploratory in nature, and discussion is limited to the innovation-decision process. Therefore, further research is required into:</p>
<list id="list3-0961000611435038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>customers’ perceptions of Facebook as a communication tool for public libraries;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether or not Facebook actually meets public libraries’ goals and objectives.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All the surveyed public libraries used one or more social networking tools to communicate with their customers to promote library services and events. They all used a form of evaluation before making a decision to adopt Facebook or reject it. They matched the innovation-decision process closely and other librarians might discover that this can be informative in the evaluation of any new innovations, including Facebook.</p>
