<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of phenol and its derivatives in aerobic and anaerobic landfills. Phenolic compounds were extracted from leachate samples using the solid phase micro-extraction method. In this study, analysis of the 24 phenolic compounds included in the standard mixture and the change in the concentrations over time of 23 of the 24 compounds found in the calibration mix standard were determined in both aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors. It can be concluded that faster and complete removal of phenol, chlorophenol, dichlorophenols, and trichlorophenol were achieved in the aerobic landfill while aerobic treatment was less effective on tetrachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. In the anaerobic landfill, anaerobic reductive dechlorination probably occurred from all the highly chlorinated phenols and resulted in the accumulation of phenol and chlorophenol. The phenol could not be further degraded because the anaerobic methanogenic phase did not start during the 150 days of operation in an anaerobic landfill reactor. Nitrophenols can be degraded rapidly under aerobic conditions. These compounds are degraded to amino groups in the first step and then these amino groups are degraded to methane and CO<sub>2</sub> under anaerobic conditions. Although the degradation could not reach the methanogenic phase in anaerobic landfill reactor during the operational period, it is indicated that nitrophenol concentrations decreased in the anaerobic reactor. This is revealed as a result of the formation of the amino groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Landfill leachate constitutes of very complex mixture including phthalate compounds, phenolics, pesticides, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, fatty acids and carboxylic acids, volatile compounds (e.g. benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene), polyaromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X11411232">Swati and Joseph, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X11411232">Yiping et al., 2008</xref>). The sources of these compounds have been reported to be hazardous components of household waste deposited into the municipal landfill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11411232">Slack et al., 2005</xref>). Phenolic compounds are the common hazardous organic compounds reported to occur in highly organic and heterogeneous municipal solid waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X11411232">Swati et al., 2007</xref>). The existence of phenols in waste materials from industrial processes such as oil refineries, coking plants, wastewater treatment plants, petroleum-based processing, and phenol resin industry manufacturing plants has been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11411232">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). These organic micropollutants may create a potential risk to the quality of receiving water bodies and become a new pollution source of groundwater or surface waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11411232">Alkalay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11411232">Baun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X11411232">Yiping et al., 2008</xref>). Generally, the information available on organic compounds in leachate studies is in terms of collective parameters such as total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), or biological oxygen demand (BOD). Although, these parameters are relatively easy to measure and give some valuable information about the oxygen consuming potential in the recipient, they do not give any information about the toxicity, bioaccumulation, or persistence of organic micro pollutants in leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11411232">Baun et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The determination of chlorophenol in liquid samples has been traditionally done by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (ECD) or flame ionization detector (FID) detectors after liquid–liquid extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11411232">EPA, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11411232">b</xref>), or by high-performance liquid chromatography after solid phase extraction (SPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11411232">Rodriguez et al., 2000</xref>). The matrix that constitutes landfill leachate is more complex than the other effluents. Thus, specific extraction procedure such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME) which is a fast and solvent-free methodology that is used for the extraction of phenolic compounds in complex matrices such as landfill leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11411232">Ribeiro et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The degradation of phenolic compounds under anaerobic landfill conditions has been established in a few reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11411232">Christenssen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11411232">Ejlertsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11411232">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11411232">Nielsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11411232">Sanin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11411232">Slack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X11411232">Swati and Joseph, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X11411232">Yiping et al., 2008</xref>). One of the major controlling parameters for the degradation of phenolic compounds is the redox condition. Oxygen affects the natural attenuation of these compounds strongly and a positive correlation between oxygen concentration and enhanced degradation has also been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734242X11411232">Tuxen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there have been a number of studies that have documented the potential for anaerobic biodegradation of organic contaminants in leachate, the literature on contaminant biodegradation in aerobic landfills is considerably more limited. In the present study, the fate and degradation of phenolic compounds found in landfill leachate in aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors were determined during the 150 days of operation. Analysis of 24 phenolic compounds was realized by SPME and the change of their concentrations over time was evaluated in both aerobic and anaerobic landfills.</p>

<title>Landfill reactors</title>
<p>In this study leachate was collected from six landfill reactors with a diameter of 40 cm and height of 100 cm, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11411232">Sekman (2009)</xref>, in order to determine the optimum aeration rate for aerobic landfills in a laboratory-scale study. A schematic view of laboratory-scale landfill bioreactors used in this study is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11411232">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The lower part of the reactors consisted of 10–15 cm gravel drainage with a perforated pipe, 2.5 cm in diameter, inserted to collect and discharge the generated leachate. Leachate collection was achieved by opening the discharge valve on a daily basis at the beginning of the experiment, and at 1- or 2-week intervals for the following period. Leachate recirculation was carried out using T-shaped pipes located at the top of the reactors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11411232">Sekman (2009)</xref> conducted a study in order to determine the effect of aeration rate on leachate and solid waste characteristics in aerobic landfills. In that study, six landfill reactors with different aeration rates were used. In the present study, leachate samples from the reactor in which the optimum aeration rate was applied (R2, 0.1 L min<sup>−1 </sup>kg<sup>−1</sup> waste) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11411232">Sekman (2009)</xref> and from the control reactor (anaerobic, R1) were used. Aeration rate is the rate limiting step in the operation of an aerobic landfill. A wide range of aeration rates for solid waste has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11411232">Bilgili et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11411232">Borglin et al., 2004</xref>). Aeration was provided by using an aquarium pump (110 L min<sup>−1</sup>) and perforated aeration pipes with diameter 1 cm and height 40 cm.</p>
<p>The solid waste added to the landfill reactors was obtained from the Odayeri Sanitary Landfill, Istanbul, Turkey. The average composition of solid waste materials removed at Odayeri landfill was 44% organic, 8% paper, 6% glass, 6% metals, 5% plastic, 5% textile, 9% nylon, 8% diaper, and 9% ash and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11411232">Demir et al., 2004</xref>). The amount of solid waste disposed of in each of the reactors was approximately 20 kg.</p>

<p>The SPME procedure was the same as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11411232">Ribeiro et al., (2002)</xref>. An 85 µm polyacrylate fibre (Supelco, PN 57304) and a SPME fibre holder (Supelco, PN 57330-U) were used. The fibre was conditioned in the gas chromatograph injector for 1 hour at 250 °C. Whenever needed this procedure was repeated for fibre clean-up. Previous to the sample extraction, blank runs were performed to look for fibre contamination. The vial capacity was 4 mL, handling 2 mL of sample. The temperature and stirring velocity (750 rpm) were controlled during extraction. Optimized extraction conditions were: immersion sampling at 40 °C for 60 min, with an 85 µm PA-coated fibre, saturated salt conditions and sample pH &lt; 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11411232">Ribeiro et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0734242X11411232">
<title>Instrument conditions</title>
<p>Analysis were performed with a gas chromatograph (Varian GC 3900) with an FID detector and split/splitless injection port. The column was FactorFour VF 5 ms (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) from Varian. Carrier gas was Helium at 10 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 225 and 340 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was initially set at 40 °C, thereafter it was increased by 8 °C min<sup>−1</sup> to 300 °C. After the extraction, the fibre was introduced in the injector at 225 °C for 3 min. Phenols were quantified by the peak area using external standard method. The same extraction procedures were applied to the standard calibration mix and the calibration chromatogram of the standard mix is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11411232">Figure 2</xref>. In order to determine whether the concentrations were valid or not, the standard solution was analysed as a sample before each run.</p>

<title>Phenol</title>
<p>According to the reduction of other phenolic compounds, the dissolution phenol concentration in anaerobic reactor increased to 5960 µg L<sup>−1</sup> after 78 days of operation. High values of phenol were determined during the operation period in R1 reactor as a result of the acidogenic phase. The degradation could not reach the methanogenic phase and thus the degradation of phenol could not be achieved completely during the study. As a result of the rapid degradation in the aerobic landfill reactor, after reaching to its maximum value of 3480 µg L<sup>−1</sup> phenol concentrations decreased rapidly and reached undetectable values at the end of the study. According to these results it can be concluded that phenol can be degraded more rapidly in aerobic landfills than anaerobic landfills and reaches to low concentrations that will not threaten the surface and underground water resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11411232">Gonzolo et al., (2007)</xref>, concluded that phenol can be degraded under anaerobic conditions. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X11411232">Shibata et al., (2006)</xref> determined that the removal of phenol under aerobic conditions occurs more rapidly than under anaerobic conditions.</p>

<sec id="section12-0734242X11411232">
<title>2-Chlorophenol</title>
<p>The 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) concentrations in anaerobic landfill leachate samples were found to be around 1000 µg L<sup>−1</sup> during the study except during the initial period of the landfilling. This situation can be explained by the acidogenic phase that continues in the R1 reactor during the operational period. The maximum 2-CP concentration (539.66 µg L<sup>−1</sup>) was measured in the R2 reactor after 15 days of operation. The concentrations of 2-CP decreased rapidly after this time and reached undetectable values at the end of the study.</p>
<p>When there is another carbon source that can be used, micro-organisms use these rapidly degradable compounds. Thus, the degradation of chlorophenol compounds releases slowly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11411232">Armenante et al., (1999)</xref> reported that anaerobic conditions lead to the dechlorination of highly chlorinated compounds, but after the chlorination of the chlorophenols the chlorination slows down. On the other hand, aerobic micro-organisms can metabolize mono- and di-chlorophenols but this aerobic attack becomes less effective with more highly chlorinated compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11411232">Fava et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11411232">Koballo et al., 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11411232">Patel and Sumathi (2009)</xref> also reported that 2-CP could be removed completely in an aerobic environment.</p>

<title>2- 3- and 4-Methylphenol (o- m- and p-cresol)</title>
<p>Aerobic and anaerobic degradation of toluene and its intermediate products is possible. According to the literature on the biological degradation of toluene, it can be concluded that the degradation occurs in different pathways for aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11411232">Shinoda et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2-methylphenol (2-MP) concentration in the leachate samples of the R1 reactor was at low concentrations during the study and the concentrations were below 1 µg L<sup>−1</sup> in most samples. As a result of rapid degradation in the R2 reactor, 2-MP was found in only one sample and the concentration was below 1 µg L<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>The detection times of 3- and 4-methylphenol (3- and 4-MP) were the same in the calibration chromatogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11411232">Figure 2</xref>). The same situation was seen from the calibration chromatogram of the producer. Thus, separate determination of these compounds was impossible in the present study. The behaviour of 3- and 4-MP was similar in both aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors, except that the concentrations were lower in the aerobic landfill reactor than those in the anaerobic reactor. However, the concentrations showed a decreasing tendency in both reactors during the study.</p>

<title>Nitrophenols (2-NP, 4-NP, 2,4-DNP)</title>
<p>The main source of 4-NP is the hydrolysis of methyl parathion and parathion pesticides. Furthermore, 4-NP is used in the production of explosives, dyes, plastics and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11411232">Tremp et al., 1993</xref>). Nitrophenols are in the list of primary pollutants published by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11411232">Uberoi and Bhattacharya (1997)</xref> revealed that nitrophenols could not be easily degraded under anaerobic conditions and 4-NP has a toxic effect on methane bacteria. Furthermore, some researchers have indicated that nitrophenols can be degraded in 7–10 days under anaerobic conditions. It is indicated that a lag phase is needed for aerobic degradation of nitrophenols and after this phase, the degradation of nitrophenols can be completely achieved. Furthermore, the existence of another substrate increases the degradation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11411232">Uberoi &amp; Bhattacharya, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Maximum concentrations of 2-NP in both aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors were determined after 15 days of operation as 296 and 172 µg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The concentrations of 2-NP after this date were below the detection limits in the R2 reactor. Similarly, 2-NP concentration in the R1 reactor decreased rapidly and was found to be below 1 µg L<sup>−1</sup> after this date.</p>
<p>The 4-NP and 2,4-DNP concentrations showed the same trend as 2-NP in the aerobic reactor after a short lag phase, and the nitrophenol compounds were completely oxidized. Under anaerobic conditions, 2,4-DNP and 4-NP were first transformed to 2-amino,4-NP and 4-aminophenol, respectively, and then these compounds were transformed to CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, 4-NP was found in the leachate for a long period of time. The decrease in the nitrophenol concentrations in the leachate samples of the anaerobic reactor despite the beginning of the methanogenic phase can be explained by the transformation of these compounds to intermediate products according to the literature.</p>

<title>2,4-Dichlorophenol</title>
<p>During the biological degradation, 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) is transformed to 4-chlorophenol and then to end products according to the exposed biological activity (Haggblom and Young, 1990).</p>
<p>The 2,4-DCP concentration in the R2 reactor was determined as 2700 µg L<sup>−1</sup> after 15 days of operation and decreased rapidly to below detection limits after 100 days. The concentration of 2,4-DCP in the R1 reactor was above 1000 µg L<sup>−1</sup> after 100 days of operation and then partially decreased and subjected to the transformation of 2,4-DCP to 4-CP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11411232">Häggblom and Young (1990)</xref> indicated that 2,4-DCP has the lowest degradation rate among the chlorophenol compounds under anaerobic conditions.</p>

<title>2,6-Dichlorophenol</title>
<p>2,6-dichlorophenol (2,6-DCP) is an isomer of 2,4-DCP and 3,4-DCP. In contrast to 2,4-DCP, 2,6-DCP transforms to 2-CP and then phenol under anaerobic conditions (Haggblom and Young, 1990).</p>
<p>2,6-dichlorophenol was observed in three of six samples from the aerobic landfill reactor. The maximum concentration was 14.32 µg L<sup>−1</sup>. It can be concluded that 2,6-DCP was completely degraded under aerobic conditions. The concentration of 2,6-DCP increased up to the 57th day of operation and reached to its maximum value of 6 µg L<sup>−1</sup>. After that, the concentration of 2,6-DCP decreased and was determined as 1.9 µg L<sup>−1</sup> at the end of the study. The removal of 2,6-DCP under anaerobic conditions is realized by the transformation to 2-CP and then to phenol. This situation can be observed from the increase in the concentrations of 2-CP and phenol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11411232">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Trichlorophenols</title>
<p>Of the six isomers of trichlorophenols, (2,3,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, 2,4,5-TCP, 2,3,4-TCP, 2,3,6-TCP, and 3,4,5-TCP) the 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-isomers have been placed on the US EPA's priority pollutants list. The latter has been included in directive 76/464/EEC (European Economic Community) as a dangerous substance discharged into the aquatic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11411232">Kharoune et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In anaerobic conditions, multichlorophenols are usually degraded by reductive dehalogenation and transformed into mono- or dichlorophenols which remain in the environment because of their low degradation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11411232">Gardin et al., 2001</xref>). This situation can be observed in the results of the R1 reactor in which the complete mineralization of trichlorophenol compounds could not be achieved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11411232">Table 1</xref>). The 2,4,5-TCP concentrations were determined to be below detection limits during the study in this reactor. This is because the closeness of the detection times of 2,4,6- and 2,4,5-TCP in the calibration chromatogram. The higher concentrations determined for 2,4,6-TCP (46.16 to 223.35 µg L<sup>−1</sup>) in comparison with the concentrations of the other trichlorophenol compounds (1.08 to 26.31 µg L<sup>−1</sup>) is also proof of this situation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11411232">Atuanya et al. (2000)</xref> reported that 2,4,6-TCP is transformed to 2,4-DCP under anaerobic conditions. As discussed previously, the reason of the increase in the concentration of 2,4-DCP can be explained by this situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these mono- and dichlorophenols can successfully be degraded by aerobic catabolism through the oxidation of the aromatic ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11411232">Clement et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11411232">Gardin et al., 2001</xref>). This can be seen clearly from the results of the aerobic landfill reactor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11411232">Table 2</xref>). In general, the concentrations of TCP compounds were found to be below 5 µg L<sup>−1</sup> in the R2 reactor. Thus, it can be concluded that the complete oxidation of TCPs is achieved after 100 days of landfilling in a landfill environment.</p>

<title>Tetrachlorophenol</title>
<p>Banerjee et al. reported that chlorophenols are less readily biodegradable than phenol. The rate of chlorophenol biodegradation decreases due to increasing number of chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11411232">Banerjee et al., 1984</xref>). Mono- and, to a less extent, dichlorophenols can be metabolized by aerobic micro-organisms, but aerobic attack becomes less effective with more highly chlorinated compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11411232">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). Tetrachlorophenols (TeCP) compounds are the intermediate products of the anaerobic degradation of PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11411232">Chen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The detected TeCP compounds in leachate samples of aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors were 2,3,5,6-TeCP, 2,3,4,5-TeCP and 2,3,4,6-TeCP. The detection times for 2,3,5,6-TeCP and 2,3,4,5-TeCP were very close in the calibration chromatogram and so separate detection of these compounds could not be achieved. However, it was observed that these two compounds could not be degraded under aerobic or anaerobic conditions during the operational period. Similarly, 2,3,4,6-TeCP was not degraded under the aerobic or anaerobic landfill environment during the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11411232">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11411232">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Pentachlorophenol</title>
<p>It has been indicated that the removal of pentachlorophenol (PCP) under aerobic conditions is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11411232">Moreira et al., 2006</xref>), but the degradation under anaerobic conditions can be achieved by the dechlorination of PCP.

<p>The dechlorination of PCP was achieved after 57 days of operation in the anaerobic (R1) reactor. PCP concentration was measured as 13.13 µg L<sup>−1</sup> on day 57 and as a result of the dechlorination the concentrations reached undetectable values after this time. PCP concentrations were determined to be between 2 and 17 µg L<sup>−1</sup> during the study in the aerobic reactor. These results showed that the aerobic biodegradation of PCP could not be achieved in the aerobic landfill environment; a finding which is in agreement with the literature.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present study, the concentrations of phenolic compounds in aerobic and anaerobic landfills were determined using the SPME method and the fate of these compounds in landfills was investigated. The change in the concentrations over time of 23 of the 24 compounds found in the calibration mix standard were determined in both aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors, and the following results were obtained.</p>
<p>Twenty-three of the 24 compounds analysed were detected in both aerobic and anaerobic landfill reactors. As a result of the banned usage of dinoseb for a long time, this compound was not detected in leachate samples from either reactor.</p>
<p>The removal of mono- and di-chlorinated phenols under aerobic conditions occurs rapidly. However, aerobic degradation becomes less effective for more highly chlorinated compounds such as TeCP and PCP.</p>
<p>The removal of phenolic compounds under anaerobic conditions is achieved with dechlorination as a result of the transformation to less chlorinated compounds. All phenolic compounds are transformed to phenol as a result of the dechlorination.</p>
<p>The product of the dechlorination, phenol, can be degraded to CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> under anaerobic conditions. In the present study, during the operational period of 150 days, the degradation of solid waste could not reach the methanogenic phase. Thus, the degradation of phenol could not be achieved.</p>
<p>Transformation of nitrophenols was very fast under aerobic conditions. These compounds are transformed to amino groups first and then degraded to to CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> under anaerobic conditions. Although the degradation could not reach the methanogenic phase, the decrease of the concentrations of nitrophenols in the anaerobic reactor can be explained by the transformation of these compounds to amino groups.</p>
<p>Land disposal of solid waste is widely used for solid waste removal in Turkey. This situation increases the risk of surface and groundwater contamination with landfill leachate. Therefore, aerobic treatment of landfills not only increases the degradation of solid waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11411232">Sekman et al., 2011</xref>), it also facilitates the degradation of toxic compounds such as phenols produced during the degradation process. Increased degradation rates would assist in reducing the transfer of pollutants to groundwater and would be applicable to both active landfills and in the rehabilitation of historical landfills.</p>
