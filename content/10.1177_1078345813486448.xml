<abstract>
<p>The antidepressant bupropion plays an important role in the treatment of mental health disorders. It is well known that incarcerated individuals are at increased risk of experimenting with psychiatric medications and it is imperative for prescribers and clinicians to understand the misuse potential of these medications, including bupropion. The mechanism of reinforcement of misuse of bupropion is related to the effect on dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems. When bupropion is crushed and ingested via nasal insufflation, a faster and higher affinity for neurotransmitters occurs, heightening the misuse potential. A literature search and illustrative case studies are presented demonstrating the misuse potential, along with a review of the clinical implications. This article concludes that in the incarcerated population, bupropion is a medication with significant misuse and diversion potential.</p>

<body>
<p>Bupropion, an antidepressant with a dual effect on norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems, was introduced in the United States in 1989. The proposed mechanism of action of bupropion, when used as prescribed, has resulted in an effective medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation. The medication has been used off-label for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and for bipolar depression due to clinical benefit in treating these conditions. A 2004 report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that drug diversion and misuse in the incarcerated population occurred at a rate of 69% of inmates at the state level and 64% at the federal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345813486448">Mumola &amp; Karberg, 2004</xref>). Addressing medication diversion is an important issue when caring for incarcerated individuals. An estimated one in seven prisoners has a treatable mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345813486448">Fazel &amp; Baillargeon, 2011</xref>), and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment estimates that up to 65% of these inmates with a mental illness have a co-occurring substance abuse problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345813486448">Cropsey, Wexler, Melnick, Taxman, &amp; Young, 2007</xref>). Bupropion has been documented as a drug of low abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345813486448">Stahl, 2008</xref>); however, there is evidence that it is a highly abused medication in correctional facilities. When bupropion is crushed and ingested via nasal insufflation or snorting, a faster and higher affinity for neurotransmitters occurs, heightening the potential for abuse. Nasal inhalation versus oral administration results in a “high” for the individual. This results in increased arousal and euphoria, which reinforces the abuse potential. The purpose of the literature review and illustrative cases that follow is to alert health care providers of the misuse potential of bupropion in the incarcerated population.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078345813486448">
<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>The incarcerated population has a high incidence rate of substance abuse disorders and often develops creative methods of abusing prescribed medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345813486448">Jiang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345813486448">Simpler &amp; Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2005</xref>). <italic>Substance abuse</italic> is defined in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Fourth edition (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345813486448">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) as a maladaptive pattern of substance use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress, meeting specific criteria within a 12-month period (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>). <italic>Abuse</italic> and <italic>misuse</italic> are terms often used interchangeably and, for the purposes of this article, are defined as inappropriate use of prescription medication often for intended effects such as intoxicating and/or euphoric effects. <italic>Diversion</italic> is defined as the unlawful channeling of medication for use or distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345813486448">Inciardi, Surratt, Kurtz, &amp; Burke, 2006</xref>). Methods of diversion may include “cheeking” by hiding medication in the mouth when it appears that it has been swallowed or coughing partially swallowed medication out of the esophagus when unobserved.</p>
<p>Although bupropion has not typically been considered a highly abused medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345813486448">Stahl, 2008</xref>), a small number of case reports of abuse are available in the literature. A search conducted using computer-based literature indexes (OVID, PubMed, Medline, and PsychInfo) using key words “bupropion and correctional facilities AND (misuse, abuse, snorting, nasal insufflation)” yielded neither published reports nor case studies of bupropion misuse in the correctional setting. A search using the Google Scholar search engine and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews also yielded no results. Due to the limited evidence on bupropion misuse in the correctional facilities, noncorrectional cases and reports will be referenced to support the potential misuse of bupropion in the correctional setting.</p>
<p>Six case reports of bupropion misuse or abuse were found in the literature. These published cases and reports identify the common method of bupropion abuse being nasal insufflation or snorting. Five cases focused on reports of bupropion abuse through nasal insufflations and one case reported a 13-year-old female taking 600 mg of the medication orally in an attempt to obtain a “high” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345813486448">McCormick, 2002</xref>). One nasal insufflation case focused on a 38-year-old man who presented to the emergency room with seizures induced by nasal insufflation of bupropion. The patient stated he learned this method while incarcerated. This case illustrated three main points for consideration: the potential for abuse due to the molecular structure of a compound, the difference in oral versus nasal administration of the medication, and the epidemiology of drug-induced seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345813486448">Del Paggio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345813486448">Kim &amp; Steinhard, 2010</xref>). A second nasal insufflation case reported a 50-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, probable schizoaffective disorder, and prior seizure activity due to nasal insufflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345813486448">Hill, Sikand, &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). The third and fourth case reports were of 15- and 16-year-old adolescents who insufflated bupropion to obtain the effects of an amphetamine high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345813486448">Khurshid &amp; Decker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345813486448">Welsh &amp; Doyon, 2002</xref>). Another case reported a 23-year-old female misusing bupropion through nasal insufflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345813486448">Langguth, Hajak, Landgrebe, &amp; Unglaub, 2009</xref>). Five of the cases of bupropion abuse resulted in unexpected seizures that prompted reporting. One reported case of bupropion involved an overdose of the medication.</p>
<p>Several research studies on bupropion have found abuse liability with the medication. One research study conducted on smoking cessation found an increase in arousal, euphoria, and overall mood, per patient self-reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345813486448">Cousins, Stamat, &amp; de Wit, 2001</xref>). Another research study on smoking cessation concluded that bupropion has some abuse potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345813486448">Zernig et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Risk of Misuse in the Correctional Setting</title>
<p>The misuse and diversion of a wide range of psychotropic medications including amphetamines, antipsychotics such as quetiapine, and anticholinergics in correctional facilities has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345813486448">Fazel, Bains, &amp; Doll, 2006</xref>). Inmates with prior history of alcohol or substance abuse are at higher risk of medication diversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345813486448">Cropsey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345813486448">Fazel et al., 2006</xref>). The decreased availability of stimulants and benzodiazepines in the correctional setting has led to inmates seeking alternative replacements for these medications. Bupropion is an alternative replacement for some inmates, and clinicians may be unfamiliar with its potential for abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345813486448">Kim &amp; Steinhard, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Diversion in prisons occurs by the diverting prisoner for the physiologic effect, to prevent harm to self due to threats or assaults by other prisoners who extort medication, or to be bartered or sold to others for something of value. Such items or services of value include cash, sexual favors, food, cell phones, commissary items, application of tattoos, illicit substances, or protection from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345813486448">Burns, 2009</xref>). Commissary items are goods and supplies, such as food items, soap, or writing materials, sold in a store available to prisoners. Diversion may be related to gang activities such as obtaining psychotropic medications of value. Tactics to divert medications can be extreme, such as taking a crushed medication and placing a cotton ball or other absorbent product into the mouth to absorb the crushed medication. Once dried, the cotton ball (and saliva) can be sold to other inmates, which presents a risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Inmates who are prescribed medications with high abuse potential may be subject to intimidation and threats as well as actual physical danger from other inmates who attempt to coerce them to divert medication for others or for failure to divert. Inmates who are coerced into exchanging medications for favors or items are deprived of the medication that they need. These factors contribute to an exacerbation of symptoms in those with serious mental illness. Consequences exist for both parties involved in the misuse of medications in the correctional system, and serious clinical implications exist. Inmates may go to some effort to have desirable medications prescribed and often fake psychiatric histories and feign symptoms or malinger in order to obtain these medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345813486448">Fazel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345813486448">Mumola &amp; Karberg, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanism of Misuse</title>
<p>Bupropion is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345813486448">Fava et al., 2005</xref>). It is a noradrenergic/dopaminergic antidepressant available in three oral formulations. The first one is the immediate release (IR) and is prescribed 3 times a day. The second formulation is the sustained release (SR), which is prescribed 2 times a day. The final formulation is the extended release (XL), prescribed daily. All have the same active ingredient with differences in the formulations being related to the pharmacokinetics and dosing of each formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345813486448">Stahl, 2008</xref>). Understanding the pharmacokinetic properties and formulations of bupropion helps clinicians to understand the potential for misuse in the correctional setting. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. It blocks both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This action allows for increased levels of both the neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. The prefrontal cortex is known as the executive function mechanism of the brain and is the most evolved part of the brain. It allows us to express emotions, control impulses, make complex decisions, maintain attention and concentration, and think critically. The striatum serves as the relay center for the basal ganglia system, responsible for the voluntary motor control function of the brain, emotional and cognitive functions, and procedural learning. The nucleus accumbens has been well studied due to its role in addictions. This area of the brain plays a major role in pleasure, reward, addiction, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345813486448">Fava et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Bupropion has been found to be potent since it is metabolized to active metabolites that act as a precursor for other active drugs. The medication antagonizes postsynaptic nicotinic receptors and has a chemical structure similar to amphetamine as well as the diet drug diethylpropion, which is a schedule III medication. Methylphenidate and cocaine block the DAT in the same manner as bupropion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345813486448">Fava et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The “euphoria” associated with bupropion abuse is attributed to the route of administration and occurs with nasal insufflation or smoking of bupropion. The euphoria does not occur when bupropion is administered orally. In the prison environment, the nasal route is the putative preferred route for abuse. The nasopharynx is a highly vascularized area that results in higher plasma concentrations than through the oral route of administration. Nasal insufflation, as in inhalation through the lungs, bypasses the drug’s first pass hepatic metabolism. When bupropion is crushed and ingested intranasally rather than orally, the onset of action at DAT occupancy changes from slow to rapid. When 50% or more of DATs are rapidly occupied, euphoria and reward reinforcement conditioning occur. Inhalation of bupropion allows for rapid onset of action with a high degree of DAT transporter occupancy, which results in euphoria and thus leads to abuse or misuse of the medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345813486448">Kim &amp; Steinhard, 2010</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that bupropion may be useful in the treatment of cocaine and stimulant dependence due to the molecular structure of the medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345813486448">Kampman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345813486448">Rounsaville, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Illustrative case studies from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Galveston, Correctional Managed Care, are presented to highlight characteristics of an incarcerated adult and adolescent with potential for abusing bupropion. These cases are presented to educate others of the high risk potential for diversion and misuse of bupropion in this high-risk, vulnerable population.</p>

<title>Illustrated Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section5-1078345813486448">
<title>Adolescent Case</title>
<p>J. is a 15-year-old youth recently incarcerated for aggravated assault. He is being evaluated for depression due to problems with initial and middle insomnia, irritability, problems concentrating, and disruptive behavior in school. He has a prior history of cannabis abuse. He is treatment naive. The psychiatrist prescribes Prozac and at the follow-up visit, J. states that he thinks he is more depressed and his sleep is not improved. The psychiatrist then prescribes Celexa and J. asks what they will try if this medicine does not work. After 2 weeks, J. refuses the Celexa and tells the nurse that it is giving him headaches. At the following visit, bupropion XL 150 mg once daily is prescribed. Two weeks later, a bupropion tablet is found in J.’s shoe during a routine room search. J. explains that it was not his bupropion and someone must have put it in his shoe. Besides, he claims he does not even know how to “cheek” his medicine. The bupropion is discontinued due to suspected diversion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345813486448">
<title>Adult Case</title>
<p>M. is a 43-year-old man diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and antisocial personality disorder. He is 5 years into a 20-year sentence for sexual assault. The psychiatric nurse practitioner (NP) who has worked with M. for the past 2 years has prescribed Haldol and Depakote. M. has been stable for a number of months. Recently, he is more lethargic, has low motivation and poor concentration, and he states that he thinks he might need an antidepressant. The NP asks M. about his past experiences with antidepressants and M. replies that he has had trials of many antidepressants and none of them seemed to help. However, there was one medicine that was very helpful. He cannot recall the name but it started with a “W.” He took it for several months when he was in the free world but stopped taking it when he could not afford it any longer. Previous outpatient records are not available. The provider elects to prescribe bupropion SR 200 mg oral twice daily. The following month, M. is observed snorting a white powdery substance in his cell. M. claims that he found a pill on the floor during recreation. A urinary dipstick comes back positive for amphetamines, and M. is suspected of crushing and snorting his bupropion.</p>

<sec id="section7-1078345813486448">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Clinicians must consider the appropriateness, effectiveness, and safety of medications prescribed to incarcerated patients. In the prison environment, clinicians must be mindful of the increased potential for misuse of medications. Bupropion misuse can lead to serious side effects and complications. Bupropion IR and XL both have an increased risk of seizures with doses greater than 450 mg per day. Bupropion SR has a seizure risk with doses greater than 400 mg per day. Documented cases of seizures are associated with overdose or abuse of the medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345813486448">Fava et al., 2005</xref>). Although rare, acute psychosis has been reported in an otherwise healthy patient using bupropion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345813486448">Bailey &amp; Waters, 2008</xref>). Several risk factors predispose a patient to seizure risk: a history of seizures, epilepsy, alcohol use, benzodiazepine withdrawal, organic brain disease, eating disorders, and head trauma. In these cases, the medication should not be used. Patients may become hypoxic and be at risk of cardiac arrest with seizures due to misuse. Misuse of bupropion can also lead to sinus tachycardia, lethargy, tremors, cognitive loss, and treatment-resistant depression. Due to the preferred method of use of insufflation, nasal passages and cavities should be assessed as part of the physical exam. Internet websites such as Erowid Experience Vaults provide detailed instructions on how to misuse medications to obtain a “high” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345813486448">Erowid, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345813486448">Table 1</xref> is a list of possible warning signs of medication diversion in the correctional facility. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345813486448">Table 2</xref> refers to various names used by inmates signalizing the abuse of bupropion.</p>

<title>Policies Regarding Use of Bupropion in the Correctional Population</title>
<p>The Santa Rita Jail is a large county jail located in Alameda County, California, which occupies most of the east San Francisco Bay area. It is the third largest jail in California, housing up to 4,000 inmates. A task force was formed in 2004 to review potential medications of misuse. It found that over a 3-month period, prescriptions for five medications, including bupropion, were very high. The task force conducted a formal review of medication misuse, case studies, and interviews with prescribers. The study led to the removal of bupropion and four other medications from Santa Rita Jail’s formulary, resulting in a net reduction of drug diversion and abuse, along with financial savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345813486448">Del Paggio, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>TDCJ is responsible for the management of correction facilities in the State of Texas. TDCJ has contracted with the UTMB Department of Mental Health, Correctional Managed Care, to manage the outpatient and inpatient psychiatric and mental health care for the majority of the inmates in the state. Approximately 17 facilities are managed by another agency, but formulary and nonformulary prescriptions are included in the number of bupropion prescriptions dispensed. Because reports of bupropion misuse were increasing during 2006, provider education was conducted in August 2006, which resulted in a decrease in prescriptions. In November 2007, bupropion was changed to a prior authorization medication; and in December 2010, it was officially removed from the formulary. Prior to the formulary change, bupropion prescriptions in February 2005 totaled 1,966. Since the medication is now nonformulary, the number of prescriptions written has decreased dramatically to fewer than 100 annually. The largest reduction in number of prescriptions occurred in the outpatient mental health units. This change has resulted in a reduction of misuse and diversion within the State of Texas correctional system, per the monitoring system provided by the pharmacists at UTMB, Correctional Managed Care.</p>
<p>Removing a medication from a formulary can have negative implications. When a medication is removed from a formulary, a process exists for requesting nonformulary medications from the pharmacy. This increases the work of both the health care provider and the pharmacy due to the time involved with initiating a request for a nonformulary medication. Health care providers spend additional time and effort working with the patient to review alternative medications while retaining the liability for clinical outcomes. At this time, no clinical data exist supporting negative or positive clinical effects from removing bupropion from a pharmacy formulary. Alternative antidepressants are available for the treatment of clinical depression and behavioral interventions are a valid alternative. A limitation of this review is the absence of outcome data, thus pointing to an area of needed research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Data to support the abuse potential of bupropion in the correctional facility are limited. Bupropion has been regarded as a low-abuse medication. Case reports and clinical experience suggest that bupropion is being abused in the correctional setting. Clinicians must realize that while bupropion is an effective medication when properly used, a black market exists for medication inhibiting dopamine reuptake, and they must be alert for drug-seeking behaviors in the incarcerated population. Health care providers in correctional systems need to weigh the risks versus the benefit of prescribing bupropion in this high-risk population and to take precautions to minimize the potential for abuse.</p>
