<abstract>
<p>An experimental–numerical investigation of the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds is carried out. Two cylindrical shell specimens with different pattern of welds are made according to manufacturing process used in engineering. Their initial geometric imperfections, axial and circumferential strain, buckling load, etc., are experimentally obtained. Inherent strain method used for simulating welding residual stress field is presented. Two different numerical modeling methods for the purpose of evaluating the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling are illustrated and the validity is verified by experiment. It is found that, load–displacement curve before buckling is altered, plastic buckling critical load is decreased to some extent, and the buckling deformation such as the number and the uniformity of waveforms of circumferential welds are changed when welding residual stress exists. For the above phenomena, the reason why welding residual stress has an influence on plastic buckling is also quantitatively analyzed from the point of stress variation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211433976" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research of plastic buckling of axially compressed welded steel cylindrical shells has a wide application in engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211433976">1</xref></sup> such as plastic buckling failure of silos, and elephant’s foot buckling failure of oil tanks. However, there is a great discrepancy between measured axial plastic buckling critical load and theoretical axial plastic buckling critical load. It is found that initial geometric imperfections are the main reason for this discrepancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211433976">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211433976">3</xref></sup> Welded steel cylindrical shells in engineering are usually constructed by many curved steel panels. Welds between these curved panels are regarded as one of the worst initial geometric imperfections to axial plastic buckling of cylindrical shells with patterned welds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211433976">4</xref></sup> In the past few decades, researchers have done a lot of work on initial geometric imperfections in the form of welds and some progress has been made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211433976">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211433976"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211433976"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211433976"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211433976"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211433976">10</xref></sup> While, research of the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of cylindrical shells is going on slowly.</p>
<p>Previous researchers who learned the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells were Shao et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211433976">11</xref></sup> Ravn-Jensen and Tvergaard,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211433976">12</xref></sup> etc. They adopted experimental and theoretical method to explore the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with only one longitudinal weld, respectively. Shao manufactured two cylindrical shell specimens with similar sizes (one was annealed while the other was not) and obtained some qualitative conclusions by comparing experimental results only. Although the two specimens do have different amplitude of welding residual stress, it is debatable to get these conclusions because the initial geometric imperfections of the two specimens are not the same actually. Jensen only learned the effect of longitudinal weld-induced welding residual stress on the plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells, considering the fact that it is impossible to construct a compatible welding residual stress field for circumferential welds analytically. In particular, it is circumferential welds rather than longitudinal welds that are more harmful to plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells.</p>
<p>In this case, numerical simulation method is an ideal way to overcome the drawbacks of experimental and theoretical methods. Unfortunately, few papers could be retrieved in this field. Instead, many papers focused on the effect of welding residual stress on elastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells, for example, Bornscheuer and Hafner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211433976">13</xref></sup> Rotter and Teng,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211433976">14</xref></sup> Holst et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211433976">15</xref></sup> Pircher and Russell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211433976">16</xref></sup> Hübner et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211433976">17</xref></sup> Lin and Li,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211433976">18</xref></sup> Aiman et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211433976">19</xref></sup> etc. Bornscheuer and Rotter adopted two different methods for constructing welding residual stress field, which were methods of inputting welding residual stress and method of inputting welding residual plastic strain, respectively. Holst, Pircher, Hübner, and Lin explored the effect of welding residual stress on elastic buckling behavior of silos, tanks, etc. using the same method of constructing welding stress field as Rotter. However, on the one hand, they simplify circumferential weld-induced deformation to be an axisymmetric form and do not pay attention to verification with test results;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211433976">20</xref></sup> on the other hand, as plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds involves not only geometric nonlinearity but also material nonlinearity, research of effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds is much more complicated.</p>
<p>In this article, both experimental and numerical simulation methods are adopted to investigate the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds. The detailed work done in this article is as follows: an axial buckling experimental platform with automatic scanning function of geometric imperfections is designed. Two cylindrical shell specimens with patterned welds are manufactured according to manufacturing process used in engineering; initial geometric imperfections, axial and circumferential strains, and axial plastic buckling critical load of specimens are experimentally obtained. Inherent strain method used for constructing welding residual stress field is presented; two different numerical modeling methods for the purpose of evaluating the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling are illustrated and the validity is verified by experiment. The reason why welding residual stress has an influence on plastic buckling is also quantitatively analyzed from the point of stress variation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211433976"><title>Axial buckling experimental platform set-up</title>
<p>Arbocz and Hol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211433976">21</xref></sup> first carried out some research on equipment with automatic scanning function of initial geometric imperfections of cylindrical shells. Later, Berry et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211433976">22</xref></sup> Teng and Lin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211433976">23</xref></sup> etc., also developed similar equipment. The working principle of the equipment mentioned above is as follows: overall initial geometric imperfections of cylindrical shell specimen are obtained by scanning radial, axial, and circumferential coordinates. Usually, the cylindrical shell specimen stays stationary taking account of its large rotating mass. Laser displacement sensor is fixed on a screw which can change its rotary motion to linear motion of the laser displacement sensor. The screw is fixed on a rotating frame which can rotate around the axis of cylindrical shell specimen. Using above-mentioned measures, laser displacement sensor can not only rotate around the specimen but also move up and down along the axial direction of the specimen. Thus, radial, axial, and circumferential coordinates of outer surface of the cylindrical shell specimen can be obtained.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned principle, an axial buckling experimental platform with automatic scanning function of initial geometric imperfections is designed. Its typical characteristics are as follows: (a) initial geometric imperfection scanning function and axial loading function are integrated together; the specimen only needs to position once during the whole test process; (b) high-precision laser displacement and axial load sensors are used. Appearance of the experimental platform is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211433976">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211433976" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Axial buckling experimental platform with automatic scanning function of initial geometric imperfections.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211433976-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to obtain accurate and reliable initial geometric imperfections, the repeatability test of laser displacement sensor under linear motion and rotational motion is carried out. It is found that the measured maximum radius errors in both cases are 0.13 and 0.18 mm, respectively, which shows that there is a good repeatability for the experimental platform. It is worth noting that there may be some misalignment error between central axis of cylindrical shell specimen and central axis of rotating frame. However, this error can convert to rigid displacement of finite element model (FEM); so, FEM result will not be significantly affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211433976">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211433976"><title>Manufacturing method and strain gage set-up</title>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211433976"><title>Manufacturing method</title>
<p>There were two classic manufacturing methods of cylindrical shell specimen with patterned welds in previous research. Representative of the first manufacturing method was Schmidt and Swadlo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211433976">25</xref></sup> He cut a single large flat plate into several pieces of small flat plates at first, then welded these small flat plates together to form a new large flat plate with patterned welds and finally rolled this new large flat plate into a cylindrical shell specimen. Representative of the second manufacturing method was Teng and Lin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211433976">23</xref></sup> He rolled two large flat plates into two semi-cylindrical shells at first, then combined these two semi-cylindrical shells to form a whole cylindrical shell specimen by welding two longitudinal welds and finally welded additional pattered welds at given locations using argon arc welding machine.</p>
<p>For Schmidt’s method, it is unrealistic to perform welding before rolling, because the different responses of the shell to circumferential welding and meridional welding cannot be properly reﬂected. For Teng’s method, it is also unrealistic because there are two longitudinal welds across the whole height of the shell specimens. In this article, a new manufacturing method is used to make the cylindrical shell specimens. Its novel aspects lie in that the manufacturing process of the shell specimens is similar with the cylindrical shells with patterned welds in engineering. The detailed manufacturing process is as follows: pieces of small flat panels are rolled into curved shells first, and then these curved shells are welded together in a sequence to form a whole cylindrical shell specimen with longitudinal welds separated with each other. By this way, the real characteristics of welding-induced geometric imperfections and residual stress of the shells with patterned welds in engineering can be reflected in laboratory. Two specimens named C1L2 and C2L3 are made in this article, C and L represent circumferential and longitudinal welds, respectively, and the number after C and L represents the number of circumferential and longitudinal welds, respectively. These two specimens have the same geometric sizes: radius <italic>R</italic> = 400 mm, height <italic>H</italic> = 420 mm, and thickness <italic>t</italic> = 1.46 mm. Difference between these two specimens is as follows: C1L2 consists of two curved panels; C2L3 consists of three curved panels. Both ends of the specimens are mounted with rigid rings with a groove to avoid pre-buckling deformation. Considering the depth of the groove, actual effective height of the specimens is 390 mm.</p>
<p>To achieve large welding residual stress amplitude, argon arc welding machine is used to weld cylindrical shell specimen with large thermal input and high welding speed. To be special, no heat treatment is taken after welding. Photos of C1L2 and C2L3 assembled with rigid end rings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211433976">Figure 2</xref>(a) and (b), respectively.

<sec id="sec5-0954406211433976"><title>Strain gage set-up</title>
<p>It is difficult to get accurate strain changes before and after buckling using traditional static strain measurement instrument. So, high-speed dynamic strain measurement instrument with 20 kHz sampling frequency is adopted. Bidirectional strain gages in orthogonal direction are pasted on the outer surface of cylindrical shell specimen.

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211433976">Table 1</xref> that mechanical properties of the three tensile specimens are almost the same, but the data of tensile specimen 1 are lower than the other two.

<sec id="sec8-0954406211433976"><title>Numerical procedures</title>
<sec id="sec9-0954406211433976"><title>Modeling methods</title>
<p>It is difficult to explore the effect of welding residual stress on axial plastic buckling only by experiment. This is doubtless partly due to the difficulty of separating welding residual stress and geometric imperfections. So, in this article, two different FEM modeling methods are adopted to explore the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds: (a) measured geometric imperfections (MGI) modeling method, it only includes the measured initial geometric imperfections; (b) measured geometric imperfections with large residual stress (MGILRS) modeling method, it includes both the measured initial geometric imperfections and a large amplitude of initial welding residual stress which equals to lower yield stress of the specimens in order to simplify the analysis. By comparing the results obtained by MGI and MGILRS methods with those of the experiment, it can be found that not only numerical method is more close to the real condition, but also the effect of welding residual stress on axial plastic buckling can be obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406211433976"><title>Numerical simulation method of welding</title>
<p>So far, thermal elastic plastic finite element and inherent strain finite element (ISFE) methods are two main methods of welding simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211433976">26</xref></sup> Thermal elastic plastic finite element method can be easily used to learn generating process of welding residual stress and deformation. However, some problems still need to be addressed such as lacking of real stress–strain relationship, difficulty in choosing a proper heat model, and long calculating time for large structure. For the present purpose of evaluating the effect of welding residual stress on the plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds, the use of overly elaborate approaches to simulate welding process is unnecessary as the computational cost needs to be kept reasonably low and the buckling behavior is believed to be not sensitive to highly localized stress changes. In practical, there have been many successful applications in calculating welding residual stress and deformation of cylindrical shells using ISFE method already. Therefore, ISFE method is adopted to construct initial welding residual stress field in this article.</p>
<p>It is proved that longitudinal inherent strain and transverse inherent strain are two main strain components that affect welding residual stress and deformation. Welding residual stress and deformation can be obtained accurately if longitudinal inherent strain and transverse inherent strain are given precisely. Distribution characteristics of welding residual stress of cylindrical shell specimens which are obtained using ISFE method will be analyzed later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0954406211433976"><title>Finite element procedures</title>
<p>ABAQUS is used for numerical simulations. Both geometric and material nonlinearities are included. Material constitutive law is true stress–strain relationship which is based on tensile test data. Mises yield criteria are used. Element type is S4R with seven integration points along thickness direction. Arc-length method is adopted during the whole numerical simulation.</p>
<p>Three factors need to be taken into consideration when the number of elements is decided, which are convergence of numerical simulation result, clear expression of initial geometric imperfections, and time cost of scanning initial geometric imperfections. In this article, 254 and 109 nodes are given in circumferential and axial directions, respectively, for C1L2; 261 and 105 nodes are given in circumferential and axial directions, respectively, for C2L3. In sum, there are 27,432 elements for C1L2 and 27,144 elements for C2L3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954406211433976"><title>Boundary conditions</title>
<p>Boundary conditions are as follows: (a) at the welding calculation step, fix all degrees of nodes at lower and upper ends of cylindrical shells except the degrees in axial direction; at the same time, fix axial degree of a node to insure no rigid displacement; (b) at the axial buckling step, fix all degrees of nodes at lower end and fix all degrees of nodes at upper end except the degrees in axial direction. A rigid plate is defined to simulate the pressure head of experimental platform. A contact pair is established to simulate interaction between pressure head and the upper end of cylindrical shell specimen. Then, the axial load can be obtained easily through the force and reaction force relationship.</p>

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211433976">Figures 4</xref>(b) and (c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211433976">5</xref>(b) and (c) that, for most of the curves, a suddenly change which can be called snap back phenomenon can be found during the loading process. This is partly because local buckling occurs before the overall buckling of the shell specimens. Furthermore, axial and circumferential stresses mainly consist of compressive stress; they increase with the increase of axial load, and very large compressive strain can be observed when the overall plastic buckling occurs. This phenomena show that axial plastic buckling is directly related to axial compressive and circumferential compressive stresses. However, it is worth noting that not all axial and circumferential strain gages display compressive value. This is mostly because that the buckling mode of the shell specimens with circumferential weld is very complicated. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211433976">Figures 4</xref>(a) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211433976">5</xref>(a) that many concave and convex zones are presented when the buckling occurs. As a result, the strain gage located at the concave zone may display compressive value, while the strain gage located at the convex zone may display tensile value.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0954406211433976"><title>Distribution characteristics of welding residual stress field of circumferential weld</title>
<p>As the real welding residual stress field of the shell specimen is not known, a hypothetical welding residual stress field constructed using ISFE method is used. Therefore, the hypothetical welding residual stress field is required to have the same stress distribution characteristics with the real welding residual stress field, although the magnitude may be different. By this way, the effect of welding residual stress on axial plastic buckling can be learned to some extent. Here, C1L2 is taken as the basic case to explore the distribution characteristics of welding residual stress field of circumferential weld. When MGILRS method is used, the distribution of welding residual stress of nodes on path 1 on the inner and outer surfaces is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211433976">Figure 11</xref>.

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211433976">Figure 11</xref> that, (a) both the axial and the circumferential stresses have significant symmetric distribution with respect to the circumferential weld centerline; (b) on the inner surface around the circumferential weld centerline, relatively large circumferential tensile stress can be observed. On the outer surface around the circumferential weld centerline, the circumferential tensile stress is not large enough, which is smaller than the yield strength of the base metal at room temperature. Balancing the circumferential tensile stress, two zones with circumferential compressive stress are also generated, which nearly symmetrically distribute with respect to the circumferential weld centerline; (c) axial stress distribution on the outer and inner surfaces are nearly symmetrically distributed with respect to the middle surface of the cylindrical shell. On the inner surface around the circumferential weld centerline, relative large tensile axial stress existed at the center of the circumferential weld. On the outer surface around the circumferential weld centerline, relative large axial compressive stress exists at the center of the circumferential weld. The above stress distribution characteristics obtained by ISFE method agree well with those obtained by thermal elastic plastic finite element method and test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211433976">27</xref></sup></p>

<list-item><p>An experimental–numerical investigation of the effect of welding residual stress on plastic buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells with patterned welds is carried out. An axial buckling experimental platform with automatic scanning function of initial geometric imperfections is made. Two cylindrical shell specimens with different patterns of welds are made according to manufacturing process used in engineering. Their initial geometric imperfections, axial and circumferential strain, buckling load, etc., are experimentally obtained. Two different numerical modeling methods (one includes welding residual stress while the other not) are adopted and the validity is verified by experiment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When welding residual stress exists, it is found that, load–displacement curve before buckling is altered, axial plastic buckling critical load is decreased to some extent, and the buckling deformation such as the number and the uniformity of waveforms of circumferential welds are changed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The reason why welding residual stress has an influence on plastic buckling was quantitatively analyzed from the point of stress variation. It is found that, the existence of welding residual stress made the buckling zone of the specimen in a “bending” stress state, which is similar with that induced by axial load; so, “bending” stress state of the buckling zone caused by axial load is magnified when the specimen is under the combined action of axial load and welding residual stress.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effect of welding residual stress on axial plastic buckling of cylindrical shells was explored by constructing a hypothetical welding residual stress field. If the welding residual stress of the shell specimen can be obtained by experiment (for example, using X-ray diffraction residual stress test method), how the welds and welding residual stress affect buckling performance can be explored more precisely. Furthermore, much effort is still needed to explore how to predict the effect of welding residual stress for more general loadings and weld patterns.</p></list-item>
