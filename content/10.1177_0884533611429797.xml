<disp-quote><p>Parenteral Nutrition Down Under (PNDU) is the Australasian support group for home parenteral nutrition (PN) consumers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://parenteral-nutrition-down-under.webs.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://parenteral-nutrition-down-under.webs.com/</ext-link>). Gillian Anderson won PNDU’s competition, commenting about life on PN in 50 words. The prize was a copy of <italic>Lifeliner—The Judy Taylor Story</italic> signed by the author, Shireen Jeejeebhoy, and her father, Dr Jeejeebhoy. She was then asked by PNDU to write a review of the book for the members, which follows.</p>

<p><italic>Lifeliner—The Judy Taylor Story</italic> is the story of a remarkable woman determined to live and her dedicated doctor, equally determined to keep her alive. Judy Taylor was the first person in Canada to receive long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN). This is the story of how, over the next 21 years of her life, Judy was a willing “guinea pig” as she and her dedicated physician, Kursheed Jeejeebhoy, blazed the trail for the rest of us to follow.</p>
<p>In September 1970, after 3 years of pain with no specific diagnosis, Judy ended up in Toronto General Hospital, where surgeons found that her large and small intestines and gallbladder were necrotic. In those days, this meant that she would starve to death. Although short-term PN was available, long-term PN was only a dream. She was referred to Dr Jeejeebhoy, a newcomer to the hospital, as a hopeless case, yet she was desperate to live. He determined to do all that he could to save her and spent much time reading the available research from around the world, including animal studies, to decide what and how to feed her.</p>
<p>Several questions had to be answered, including which nutrients were essential in order to live and in what amounts; in what medium to deliver them—fat or no fat; and how to deliver them intravenously. At that time, intravenous catheters had to be changed every couple of days, so a new one had to be developed, especially for her circumstances. In addition, no pump existed to deliver PN at an overnight rate fast enough to allow Judy to unhook and have her days free to walk around. The team also had to develop a way of keeping the line open when she was unhooked. Although it is now possible for providers to obtain vital information from routine blood tests, Judy had to return to the hospital regularly for biopsies.</p>
<p>Although Judy suffered constant pain, she always had a good sense of humor and could usually joke even when in pain. Over the years, she suffered from infections, skin breakdown, and hair loss, sometimes due to a lack of specific micronutrients in her PN, which presented great challenges to her healthcare team. During her worst times, her emotions would alternate between anger, fear, and acceptance, but she always bounced back.</p>
<p><italic>Lifeliner</italic> highlights stories of other heroes besides Judy and Dr Jeejeebhoy. Judy could not keep going without the love, support, and assistance of her husband as carer and the others in her family. Also, she had a large support group of friends, including the new friends that she made as she mentored new HPN patients, as well as the nurses who became close to her. Dr Jeejeebhoy relied on information from many other researchers and doctors whose ideas he tried, adapted, or sometimes rejected. Their research supplied answers or possible directions to solve many problems that occurred over the years and ultimately kept Judy alive. In turn, his experiments led to papers and presentations that could be applied by other doctors around the world and the further development of HPN, ultimately keeping <italic>us</italic> alive.</p>
<p>Throughout all this, Judy had a strong faith in God and thanked him for every day she lived. She had a great attitude about life, filling her time with much volunteer work over the years. She once told a friend, “Stop and take time to look around . . . don’t take anything for granted . . . take time to work in your garden and take the beauty out of the flowers . . . most people are in the fast lane and go, go, go and they miss 90% of their lives.”</p>
<p>Healthcare providers often use HPN much as they would antibiotics, as a cure for a medical problem, without any thought to the human side of its development. Dr Jeejeebhoy and his staff faced and overcame many difficulties in developing HPN and the related equipment. But the largest impact of <italic>Lifeliner</italic> was from gaining a bit of insight into the struggles and joys of Judy Taylor as she made the most of the 21 extra years that HPN gave her. Her determination to live meant that many medical breakthroughs were possible. She could easily have given up, not able to face more tests, hospitalizations, or pain, but she kept going, trusting in her medical team. This provided valuable insight into the long-term impact of HPN on the body and how to make adjustments as new information was discovered. Her strength, determination, and sheer joy of life were an inspiration to the many people who came to know her and continue to be an example for us today.</p>
<p>Many thanks should also be given to the author, Shireen Jeejeebhoy (Dr Jeejeebhoy’s daughter), who undertook writing this much-needed text despite many challenges. Thankfully, she didn’t give up, giving us a chance to learn about our HPN roots.</p>
<p>Anyone requiring HPN who has returned home from the hospital and begun to get on with life could enjoy reading this book. In addition, healthcare providers who work with PN patients will find this book provides a window into the human, day-to-day aspects of living with HPN. It’s an easy book to read, with short chapters, but have a box of tissues handy for the occasional weep.</p>
