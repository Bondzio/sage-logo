<body>
<p>The biomedical model of American psychiatry is a house of cards on the verge of collapse, a casualty of a pharmaceutical industry that has consolidated its power through paying psychiatrists to promote its drugs, colluding in expanding the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM</italic>), using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to deceive the public, and financing advocacy organizations for the mentally ill. Social work, a prominent provider of mental health services, should be skeptical about the claims of the “psychiatric-industrial complex” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511419372">Diller, 2006</xref>, p. 105) to serve the mental health needs of disturbed Americans through psychoactive medication.</p>
<p>By the turn of the millennium, American psychiatry was split between two camps: psychoanalysts and those advocating a biomedical model to mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511419372">Luhrmann, 2000</xref>). Pioneered by Sigmund Freud at the turn of the 20th century, psychoanalysis gained the allegiance of professionals who were seduced by European sophistication, the idea of the unconscious, and the suggestion that suppressed sexuality explained many mental disorders. During 1950s, psychoanalysis was challenged by the emerging field of biomedical psychiatry, which based its authority on the new tranquilizers that, for the first time, provided physicians with reliable means for stabilizing patients who were actively psychotic. Prior to the advent of medications such as Thorazine, Stelazine, and Haldol, psychiatrists could do little but employ restraints on such patients or lock them in padded cells. The prevalence of significant side effects—shuffling gait, facial tics, and hyperextension of fingers—led critics to claim that the major tranquilizers caused tardive dyskinesia, permanent damage to the central nervous system, yet this seemed a reasonable price to pay compared to the physical restraints of the past.</p>
<p>In solving the problem of patient management of the seriously mentally ill, which had eluded psychoanalysts, the major tranquilizers also introduced psychoactive medication as a way to deal with less severe disorders, resulting in a psychopharmacological revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511419372">Angell, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511419372">2011b</xref>). Psychopharmacologists viewed the brain as the focus of their work, discerning those chemicals that altered mood and temperament, testing dosages of new preparations, and evaluating their effects on a larger array of disorders. During the 1980s, biomedical psychiatry ascended with the popularization of medications, such as Prozac, and the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) publication of the <italic>DSM</italic> which complemented a biomedical approach to emotional disorders. The FDA validated the biomedical model by approving psychoactive medications through randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that had been conducted by the drug companies.</p>
<p>By the end of the 20th Century, biomedical psychiatry might have been wedded to the talk therapy favored by psychoanalysts had not managed care intruded into American health care. Health care inflation, increasing by double digits prompted reformers to advocate for greater efficiencies at the same time focusing on prevention of illness, virtues that were evident in health maintenance organizations which spread across the nation subscribing tens of millions of members. The possibility of a psychiatric ideal, wedding psychopharmacology with psychoanalysis, was precluded as health insurance companies pared reimbursements to hospitals and clinics, cutting the number of patient sessions that would be paid for as well as their value, in process reducing the revenue of mental health providers. Research challenging the effectiveness of psychotherapy further eroded the credibility of psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511419372">Epstein, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A harsh regime of accountability quickly advantaged biomedical psychiatrists who could demonstrate relatively quick patient improvements compared to psychoanalysts whose method was more protracted. As cost considerations came to dominate American health care, biomedical psychiatrists were encouraged to abbreviate their sessions further, effectively minimizing talking therapy in favor of dispensing medication. The reorganization of psychiatry by managed care instructed mental health professionals that the real money was in short-term psychopharmacology. “Doing psychotherapy doesn’t pay well enough. I can see three or four patients per hour if I focus on medications,” admitted Carlat, “but only one patient in that time period if I do therapy. The income differential is a powerful incentive to drop therapy from our repertoire of skills, and psychiatrists have generally followed the money” (p. 5). This, of course, did not prohibit patients from seeking care from psychoanalysts, but they would have to pay out of pocket. Since only a small slice of mental patients had such resources, mainstream psychiatry became biomedical almost exclusively, the 15-min medication session defining the profession.</p>
<p>The ascendance of the biomedical model was facilitated by the publication of the <italic>DSM-III</italic> in 1980, which replaced the ambiguous Freudian descriptions of 83 mental disorders of the previous edition with a behavioral classification system of 265 diagnoses. Each diagnosis listed behaviors which, if added in sufficient numbers, justified a specific psychiatric label. As critics would contend, this is medicine determined not by etiology but by committee. “Not only did the <italic>DSM</italic> become the bible of psychiatry, but like the real Bible, it depended a lot on something akin to revelation,” observed Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, “There are no citations of scientific studies to support its decisions” (2011b, p. 20). By 1994, the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> had expanded to 297 disorders; at 886 pages the “manual” was so large that the APA and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) convened a group assigned to simplify the planned <italic>DSM-V</italic> through a numerical system that also included new evidence from neurobiology and genetics, a “paradigm shift.” When it was learned that the drafting group had been sworn to secrecy about its work, a complaint by Dr. Robert Spitzer, who had been largely responsible for earlier versions of the <italic>DSM</italic>, resulted in the termination of the venture. Spitzer’s critique of a broadening of categories in the <italic>DSM-V</italic> was sharp: The consequence “would be a wholesale imperial medicalization of normality that will trivialize mental disorder and lead to a deluge of unneeded medication treatment—a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry but at a huge cost to the new false positive “patients” caught in the excessively wide DSM-V net” (quoted by Carlat, 2010, p. 65). Chastened but unfazed, the APA published the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (text revised) in 2000, including 365 diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511419372">Angell, 2011b</xref>, p. 20).</p>
<p>By then, American psychiatry had already become a subsidiary of the drug companies, Big Pharma. In 1987, Eli Lilly introduced the first blockbuster psychoactive drug, Prozac, and received approval by the FDA in 1994 to market the drug for depression and bulimia in 1996, resulting in annual sales of $2.6 billion, one fourth of the firm’s revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511419372">Angell, 2005</xref>, p. 82). A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), Prozac proved so successful that similar antidepressants, such as Paxil, Zoloft, and Celexa, were soon introduced. In approving new drugs, the FDA only requires two clinical trials demonstrating a drug’s efficacy; however, the approval process is fraught with deceit. Upon discovering that 40% of the clinical trials for SSRIs had been withheld from public view, Kirsch used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the results of all of the clinical trials for antidepressants. An evaluation of <italic>all</italic> of the clinical trials revealed that “82 percent of the response to medication had also been produced by a simple inert placebo,” an almost insignificant difference of 2 points on the 51-point Hamilton depression scale, insignificant for clinical purposes (p. 28). A psychologist, Kirsch takes the analysis one step further by examining the effects of <italic>active</italic> placebos in research. Since patients and researchers can “break blind” when they suspect a pill is the test medication because it causes side effects, Kirsch summarizes the effects of active placebos, contending that they would be a better basis of comparison than inert placebos; however, this is unlikely since doing so would likely subvert the RCTs conducted by drug companies, which are intended to demonstrate a drug’s efficacy. The possibility that active placebos would have been comparable to SSRIs is yet to be studied.</p>
<p>Pharmacological research had become big business to the point that over a thousand contract research organizations (CROs) were operating globally, conducting RCTs on various drugs. In 2001, over 80,000 RCTs were ongoing subscribing the participation of 2.3 million Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511419372">Angell, 2005</xref>, p. 29). Unlike universities that mounted RCTs earlier, CROs aggressively recruited subjects because their performance was dictated, in part, by the bottom line. Thus, when Peter Kramer, author of the best seller, <italic>Listening to Prozac</italic> (1993), criticizes those debunking antidepressants, including Kirsch, he targets the FDA for failing to discriminate between subjects who suffered from severe depression from the milder variety, arguing that SSRIs are justified for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511419372">Kramer, 2011</xref>, p. 6). Because the FDA is the repository and referee of RCTs which are actually submitted by drug companies contracting with CROs, the blame is more diffuse; unless specified, variations in the severity of depression are unlikely to be of concern to CROs whose objective is to simply complete the RCT.</p>
<p>Even more alarming is the failure of the psychopharmacological industry to demonstrate the chemical process by which SSRIs actually work. The “chemical imbalance” theory, a simplification holding that deficiencies of chemicals in the brain cause diagnosable disorders, is fundamental to antidepressants. Specifically, at transmission, the SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin during the synapse, the accumulation allegedly diminishing depression. Other selective reuptake inhibitors have also been attributed to cause other psychiatric disorders. Yet, “low levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine do not cause depression,” concludes Kirsch, “after a half century of research, the chemical imbalance hypothesis as promulgated by the drug companies that manufacture SSRIs and other antidepressants is not only without clear and consistent support, but has been disproved by experimental evidence” (p. 92). Absent the causal process, the SSRIs enjoy the same status of aspirin, a means of symptom management, as opposed to disease prevention. As behavioral pediatrician Lawrence Diller observes, “Aspirin fixes headaches, yet no one claims that headache sufferers have an ‘aspirin deficiency’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511419372">Diller, 2006</xref>, pp. 9–10).</p>
<p>All this would be an exercise in psychopharmacological frivolity, except for the quite real side effects attributed to SSRIs. “Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include restlessness, hallucinations, loss of coordination, a racing heart, rapid changes in blood pressure, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea,” noted Kirsch, “SSRIs can provoke an agitated restless state called akathisia, which some people describe as feeling like jumping out of their skin. It is often in this state that people on SSRIs become violent and aggressive towards themselves and others” (pp. 152–153). Indeed, the adverse effects of SSRIs when prescribed off-label to children was associated with suicidal behavior at twice the rate of the control group resulting in “a black box” warning for Celexa, an SSRI produced by Forest Pharmaceuticals, a drug company that was fined $313 million by the Justice Department in 2010 for irresponsible off-label marketing to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511419372">Singer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of confirmatory research, the biomedical model of psychiatry was sold to the public by Big Pharma in collaboration with the APA. In order to expedite marketing, drug companies went beyond the usual method, relying on detail reps, by hiring psychiatrists to promote their products. Carlat, for example, was hired by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals to speak to local doctors about the benefits of Effexor, an antidepressant. A Wyeth rep “offered $750 to give brief talks to primary care doctors in the area. I was making about $130/hour seeing patients in my private practice. Giving a single lunchtime talk would be the financial equivalent of most of a day’s work, without the hassles of dealing with managed care companies” (p. 122). Eventually, Carlat gave up the gig, mindful that lackluster performance, evident in before- and after-presentation prescription behavior of physicians attending his talks, would have been the death knell of his work for Wyeth.</p>
<p>The employment of “hired guns” by drug companies became systematized through “key opinion leaders,” KOLs, many from prestigious academic centers (Whitaker, pp. 322–325). Among the most celebrated was Dr. Joseph Biederman at Massachusetts General Hospital who, along with Timothy Wilens and Thomas Spencer, raked-in $4.2 million over 7 years from drug companies but reported only a fraction of that to their universities. It was Biederman who would enter the pantheon of psychiatric hubris. During a deposition, “after he described his academic rank at Harvard as a full professor, one of the attorneys asked, ‘What’s after that?’ ‘God,’ the doctor replied. ‘Did you say God?’ asked the attorney apparently stunned, ‘Yeah,’ responded Biederman” (Carlat, pp. 133, 141). On July 1, 2011, Biederman, Wilens, and Spencer agreed to sanctions imposed by Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School for failing to report earnings from drug companies, the sanctions prohibiting payments from pharmaceutical firms for a year with approval required for such income the year following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511419372">Kowalczyk, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The self-serving circle between psychiatry and the psychopharmacological industry was closed in more pedestrian ways: 56% of the drafters of the <italic>DSM-V</italic> reported significant income from drug companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511419372">Angell, 2011b</xref>, p. 22). Some critics of the psychiatric sell out were less charitable: Dr. E. Fuller Torrey suggested that “the present system is approaching a high-class form of prostitution” (quoted in Whitaker, p. 278).</p>
<p>Psychiatrists failing to get the message directly from colleagues shilling for Big Pharma would likely find the evidence of drug efficacy in research studies published in professional journals. A 1999 lawsuit against Pfizer revealed that the company had hired Current Medical Directions (CMD) to write articles favorable to its blockbuster drug, Zoloft. CMD paid ghostwriters to draft articles, located psychiatrists to sign them, then published the pieces in prestigious journals, such as the <italic>American Journal of Psychiatry</italic> and the <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association.</italic> Eventually, the CMD articles comprised a majority of all research on Zoloft published between 1998 and 2000. As Carlat observed, “for at least one antidepressant, the bulk of medical literature was literally written by the drug company that manufactured the drug” (p. 115).</p>
<p>Covering all of the bases, the psychopharmacological industry also made substantial contributions to organizations advocating for the mentally ill. Organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), not only appreciated philanthropy from drug companies because it addressed their chronic budget shortfalls but also because the biomedical model promised to destigmatize mental disorders. With the biomedical model ascendant early in the 1990s, NAMI joined with NIMH to educate the public about how chemical imbalances caused mental disorders. Whitaker reports that between 1993 and 1996, 18 drug companies contributed $11.7 million to NAMI (p. 280). In 2009 alone, one company, Eli Lilly, contributed $551,000 to NAMI, $465,000 to the National Mental Health Association, $130,000 to an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder advocacy organization, and $69,250 to a suicide prevention organization (p. 327). In exchange for corporate beneficence, mental health advocacy organizations validated the notion that mental disorders, like other diseases, could be corrected by medication, in the process providing moral support to the psychopharmacological industry.</p>
<p>A prime indicator of the manufacture of mental disorder is the skyrocketing number of disability claims by young adults due to mental illness. Mentally ill children comprised 50% of those on Supplemental Security Income in 2007; in 2008, the Government Accountability Office reported that 1 in 16 young adults suffered from serious mental illness. Whitaker extrapolates that each disabled young adult could receive $1 million in benefits over a lifetime; if disability eligibility due to mental disorders continues to grow at recent rates, the ultimate costs would be untenable (p. 10).</p>
<p>If American psychiatry has become captive of the biomedical model, other countries have flirted with the idea only to reject it. Whitaker cites a region of Finland, Western Lapland, which has adopted an alternative to psychopharmacology in caring for the seriously mentally ill. Five years after receiving “open dialogue therapy,” 73% of 75 patients (30 schizophrenics) were working or in school, while only 20% were on disability. Whitaker reports that “Only two or three new cases of schizophrenia appear each year in western Lapland, a 90 percent drop since the early 1990s” (pp. 336–343).</p>
<p>The implications for social work of the aggressive marketing of psychopharmacology extend well beyond clinical judgment about treatment. During the past 4 years “five firms have admitted to federal charges of illegally marketing psychoactive drugs,” a practice that, while illegal for drug companies, is legal for psychiatrists who write “off-label” prescriptions. Angell contends that “off-label” prescriptions of psychoactive medication should also be illegal (2011b, p. 22), and it may be just a matter of time until class action litigation limits the practice. Meanwhile, social workers who indiscriminately follow the prescriptions of psychiatrists may invite liability when psychoactive medications contribute to physiological damage and death of their patients.</p>
