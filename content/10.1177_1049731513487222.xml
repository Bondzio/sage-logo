<abstract>
<p>In their critique of differential response (DR), Hughes and colleagues raise a number of important issues that are central to broader efforts at the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF) including the need for greater reliance on evidence-based practice in child welfare, more rigorous evaluation methodologies, and a robust set of measures and instruments to guide practice and evaluation. ACYF is pursuing these goals with projects to increase focus on child well-being, improve associated measures, promote the use of evidence-based programs, and expand the evidence base. We believe that DR is a promising practice and expect forthcoming results from an ACYF-sponsored multisite evaluation of DR to significantly enhance the evidence base. Future efforts can build on these results by focusing on social and emotional well-being in addition to safety and permanency, using demonstrated assessments to monitor outcomes, and offering families in both alternative and investigative pathways evidence-based services.</p>

<body>
<p>The growing influence of differential response (DR) in child welfare practice over the last decade is undeniable. Some 33 states, tribal communities, and the District of Columbia have adopted DR at some level or plan to implement it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731513487222">Brown, Merkel-Holguin, &amp; Rohm, 2012</xref>). A growing body of evaluation research, including three studies with rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, has consistently found the following: children in the alternative response track are as safe as or safer than similar children receiving traditional investigation; and families are more satisfied with alternative response and receive more services. The handful of cost evaluations that have been done indicate that alternative response may be less costly as well, due primarily to lower rates of recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731513487222">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731513487222">National Quality Improvement Center on Differential Response in Child Protective Services, 2011</xref>). In 2008, the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF), the Federal agency that oversees child welfare in the United States, recognized the need to strengthen the evidence base on DR and launched a 5-year, multisite RCT evaluation, with final results due in the fall of 2013.</p>
<p>Hughes and colleagues offer an impassioned and wide-ranging critique of the existing DR evaluation literature, arguing that there are ample scientific and philosophical grounds to doubt the findings summarized above, particularly those related to child safety. While they recognize and applaud the success of DR advocates in helping child welfare systems to adopt the family-focused and strengths-based approaches that define best practice, they worry that these advances may have come at the price of increased threats to child safety and the demonization of certain traditional investigative practices. They urge the field to exercise caution until a more solid evidence base is developed using more comparable and testable models, better and more consistent measures of safety and other key constructs, and more rigorous evaluation design.</p>
<p>While we do not agree with some of their conclusions, Hughes and colleagues raise a number of important issues that are central to current ACYF efforts including the need for greater reliance on evidence-based practice in child welfare; the need for rigorous evaluation methodologies consistently applied to build that evidence base; and the need for a robust set of measures and instruments to guide practice and evaluation. These issues are as important for DR as they are for every aspect of child welfare practice. ACYF is pursuing these goals with an integrated array of projects, which we briefly describe below.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049731513487222">
<title>Expanding Outcomes and Improving Measures</title>
<p>While children’s “safety, permanency, and well-being” have long been the goals for child welfare, well-being has routinely been underemphasized. In a recent Information Memorandum, we argue that promoting the social and emotional well-being of children should receive more systematic attention in child welfare practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731513487222">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2012a</xref>). The social and emotional domains of well-being are most affected by chronic trauma, including maltreatment, and there are evidence-based and evidence-informed practices available to improve outcomes in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513487222">USDHHS, 2012b</xref>). Child welfare systems should use screening and functional assessment tools that are valid, reliable, and normed against the general population, covering safety, trauma, social and emotional well-being, and other dimensions of well-being. Examples include the Child Behavior Checklist, the Social Skills Rating scale, and the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513487222">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731513487222">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731513487222">Lyons, 2009</xref>). They should be administered to all children within the child welfare system, both in home and out of home, on a regular basis to assess needs and to monitor progress. Strong screening and assessment tools allow for better identification of challenges and targeting of limited resources, and they enable systems to monitor and elevate performance over time through quality improvement efforts.</p>
<p>Hughes and colleagues argue that evaluations of DR need better and more complete measures of child safety. We would go further and encourage the use of a broader set of valid and reliable measures encompassing social and emotional well-being. Such measures are indispensable tools for both service and evaluation. Too little attention has been paid to well-being for in-home populations, in or out of DR. With the greater emphasis in child welfare on keeping children in their homes whenever it is safe to do so, more attention must be given to monitoring and promoting their well-being.</p>

<title>Promoting the Use of Evidence-Based Programs and Expanding the Evidence Base</title>
<p>ACYF strongly encourages the use of evidence-based and evidence-informed practices in the programs it supports. We are working with grantees to identify better methods for implementing and scaling up such practices, as well as better ways to combine evidence-based practices for maximum impact while pinpointing and scaling down ineffective practices. Recent efforts have focused particularly on the identification and treatment of trauma in children and youth, and on expanding the availability of evidence-based practices to improve social and emotional well-being. Screening and assessment with valid and reliable tools are being encouraged in order to better identify needs, track progress, and determine service effectiveness. Examples of such efforts include most of the Title IV-E Child Welfare Demonstration Projects, funded in 2012, and a new initiative to improve access to evidence-based and evidence-informed mental and behavioral health services in child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513487222">USDHHS, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>To address longer term concerns, ACYF has also funded a study by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513487222">Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (2012</xref>) to review the existing research literature on child maltreatment and develop research priorities for the coming decade to address anticipated policy and practice needs. The resulting report will be wide ranging, but is expected to include chapters on well-being; intervention and evidence-based practices; implementation; strategies for producing community and system-level practice changes; and methods and measurement.</p>

<title>Differential Response</title>
<p>Several years ago, the Children’s Bureau within ACYF recognized DR as a promising practice that was in need of greater conceptual clarity as well as a broader and more robust evidence base. At that time, there had been only one completed RCT evaluation of DR, with a second underway in the field, and a handful of quasi-experimental evaluations. In 2008, it funded the Quality Improvement Center on Differential Response in Child Welfare (QIC-DR) to contribute to the knowledge base for DR. The first year of this 5-year effort was spent conducting a needs assessment that included a comprehensive literature review of the field (including evaluation research), a national survey of the states, national information summits with experts in the field, and listening sessions with families. The results of these efforts, which are reported on the project website (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/pediatrics/subs/can/DR/qicdr/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/pediatrics/subs/can/DR/qicdr/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>), informed the design of a 4-year, RCT evaluation of DR that includes implementation, outcomes, and cost components. The three sites, Colorado, Ohio, and Illinois, share core criteria for the intervention, but are quite diverse in terms of target population, services provided, and scale. Each site is producing its own evaluation, though there has been substantial coordination relating to research questions, sampling, and a common core of instrumentation. A cross-site evaluation, closely coordinated with the individual site evaluations, is being conducted by the QIC-DR to identify common lessons that may help carry the field forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731513487222">National Quality Improvement Center on Differential Response in Child Protective Services, 2012</xref>). Final results will be available in late 2013.</p>
<p>Hughes and colleagues’ critique of existing DR literature can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) DR is currently not a clearly articulated, testable, and replicable model, preventing anything like an accumulation of knowledge in the field; (2) existing evaluations of individual models of DR, even the RCT-based designs, have been too poorly designed and executed to yield trustworthy results; (3) measures of child safety used in these evaluations are too weak and incomplete to conclude that DR is no threat to child safety; and (4) many of the service approaches identified with DR are in fact not unique to DR, but are considered caseworker best practices under both alternative and investigation approaches.</p>
<p>We take a more favorable view of the more recent and rigorously designed evaluations of DR, which, while certainly not perfect—as no field-based research can be—are overall of good quality and establish DR as a promising practice. Additionally, the safety measures used in these analyses, while far from perfect or complete, do represent the sorts of measures used everyday in social work practice and in performance monitoring systems such as the Child and Family Service Reviews (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/monitoring/child-family-services-reviews/overview">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/monitoring/child-family-services-reviews/overview</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The QIC-DR was established with the specific goal of advancing DR along the continuum from “promising” toward “evidence-based” practice (or failed practice). We are hopeful that the substantial effort and expertise expended by the QIC-DR and local evaluators in sample design, measurement development, and coordination across sites will move the field toward that goal.</p>
<p>We agree that there is no single, clearly articulated and testable model of DR, but are less troubled by this fact than Hughes and colleagues. We are comfortable with treating DR as an approach capable of producing a variety of testable and replicable models that share a minimum core set of characteristics but vary in ways (target population, service approach, scale, state vs. county-run) that may be more applicable to and more easily adopted by certain types of child welfare systems. The QIC-DR effort is designed with this in mind, including a replication manual being produced by the sites, which is expected to be made available to the public in the summer of 2013.</p>
<p>Finally, Hughes and colleagues make the important point that many of the family-focused, strengths-based caseworker practices associated with DR are in fact recognized as best practice in general, not limited to the alternative pathway within DR, and this is a point too often obscured in the DR literature. Few DR advocates would argue that such approaches are exclusive to an alternative response approach. Rather, we believe the argument is that, for lower risk cases, they will be more successful under an alternative approach than with traditional investigation. They will be more effective due to the absence of a formal investigation which, no matter how expertly delivered, has an irreducibly adversarial component. To date, few DR evaluations have sought to make caseworker training and available services similar across alternative and investigative tracks, though several have documented alternative track practices being adopted into traditional investigative practice over time (National Quality Improvement Center on Differential Response in Child Protective Services, 2012). A more deliberate design that promotes family-focused, strengths-based practices in both tracks, similar levels of caseworker training, and so on, would help to tease apart practice effects from irreducible alternative pathway effects in future evaluations. More broadly, DR must focus on offering evidence-based interventions to families if it is to take full advantage of the enhanced opportunities that the alternative response is intended to create. It does little good to open the door wider if there is nothing of proven worth on the other side.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that DR is a promising practice, and we expect that results from the QIC-DR evaluation, when they become available, will significantly enhance the evidence base. Future efforts can build on these results by focusing on social and emotional well-being in addition to safety and permanency, using demonstrated assessments to monitor those outcomes, and by offering evidence-based services to families in both the alternative and investigative pathways.</p>
