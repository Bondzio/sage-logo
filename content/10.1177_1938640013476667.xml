<p>The primary audiences for <bold>FAS</bold> are podiatrists and orthopaedists specializing in foot and ankle care. Authors should focus on the needs and interests of these individuals with particular emphasis on clinical relevance to any data cited or recommendations made. The Journal welcomes review and research articles in addition to technical articles, case reports, practice-based, treatment dilemmas, advancements in foot and ankle specialization care, and equipment usage. There are also monthly department columns, such as:</p>
<list id="list1-1938640013476667" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Technology column: <italic>an approximate 1,500-word first-person column about technological developments or what is going on in an MD’s practice;</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Master Surgeon: <italic>an approximate 1,500-word first-person column on a new surgical technique you use or are familiar with.</italic></p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The technique must be abiding by standard of care and within scope of practice of author</p></list-item>
