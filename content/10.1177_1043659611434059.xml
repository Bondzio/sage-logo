<p>The average life span of Koreans has been increasing, and the generation born in 2009 can expect to live to at least 80 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611434059">Korea National Statistic Association, 2010</xref>). As people age, they tend to suffer from multiple chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. Management of chronic diseases generally requires active and committed participation in medically recommended protocols. Chronic disease self-management is the cornerstone in preventing and reducing the severity of disease-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-efficacy is a key element of self-management education for people with chronic diseases and comprises their perceptions of their ability to carry out various actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>). Self-efficacy in dealing with chronic disease is not simply a matter of knowing what to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434059">Fisher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611434059">Rashiq, Schopflocher, Taenzeer, &amp; Jonssen, 2008</xref>). According to self-efficacy theory, the strength of belief in one’s capability to do a specific task or achieve a certain result is a good predictor of motivation and behavior. An individual’s self-efficacy belief can be enhanced through performance mastery, modeling, reinterpretation of symptoms, and social persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434059">Bandura, 1986</xref>). Enhanced self-efficacy leads to improved behavior, motivation, thinking patterns, and emotional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434059">Fisher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611434059">Rashiq et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al. (1996)</xref> developed the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) on the basis of the needs assessment, prior experience, literature review, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434059">Bandura’s (1986)</xref> self-efficacy model. Self-efficacy is one of the main concepts in the CDSMP, with emphasis on efficacy, enhancing self-efficacy strategies such as skills mastery, modeling, and social persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611434059">Lorig, Laurent, &amp; Gonzalez, 1994</xref>). The effect of the CDSMP is commonly evaluated using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSES), which measures the self-efficacy to perform behaviors and to achieve outcomes among those with chronic diseases. The CDSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>) includes 10 subscales with 33 items.</p>
<p>The CDSES was originally developed for both English- and Spanish-speaking populations and has been widely used in these linguistic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611434059">Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, &amp; Grumbach, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434059">Jerant, Moore, Lorig, &amp; Franks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611434059">Marks, Allegrante, &amp; Lorig, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434059">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434059">Tucker, Olson, &amp; Frusti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611434059">Xu, Savage, Toobert, Pan, &amp; Whitmer, 2008</xref>). However, its use has been limited in other cultures including Korea. The first step in extending the use of the CDSES is the use of valid and reliable instruments that measure self-efficacy. Thus, this study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of CDSES–Korean version (CDSES-K) in Korean adults with three chronic diseases: arthritis, diabetes, and/or hypertension.</p>

<sec id="section2-1043659611434059">
<title>Design and Participants</title>
<p>A methodological research design was used for testing of validity and reliability of the CDSES-K.</p>
<p>A convenience sample of 380 adults with one or more of three chronic diseases, arthritis (<italic>n</italic> = 129), diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 130), and hypertension (<italic>n</italic> = 121), was recruited from the outpatient department of one university hospital in Korea. The inclusion criteria were age (≥20 years) and diagnosis with arthritis, diabetes, or hypertension by a medical doctor. The sample size was calculated using a previous suggestion that the moderate correct factor structure ratio between participant and variable was 10:1 for exploratory factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611434059">Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611434059">Floyd &amp; Widaman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434059">Kim, Kim, &amp; Chae, 2008</xref>). With 33 items, a minimum of 330 participants was needed for this study. A total of 400 adults were initially contacted, with 380 adults (response rate of 95.0%) completing the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043659611434059">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Initial contents of the original CDSES were developed by integrating the information from prior experience, literature review, and theoretical self-efficacy framework. A survey (<italic>n</italic> = 1,130) including a broad age range (mean age = 64.4 years) was conducted to validate the original CDSES using multitrait scaling analyses. Many of the initial self-efficacy measures correspond to particular types of behavior/health status and were scored on a Likert-type scale, scores ranging from 1 to 5, and represented no detection of change. Hence, the final version was revised to a 1- to 10-point rating scale with labeled end points on the basis of the findings from focus groups and pretest scaling analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>). The 33-item CDSES consisted of three key concepts: self-efficacy to perform self-management behaviors, self-efficacy to manage disease in general, and self-efficacy to achieve outcomes. Self-efficacy to perform self-management behaviors consisted of four subscales: Exercise Regularly (three items); Get Information About Disease (one item); Obtain Help from Community, Family, and Friends (four items); and Communicate With Physician (three items). Self-efficacy to manage disease in general has one subscale: Manage Disease in General (five items). Self-efficacy to achieve outcomes included five subscales: Do Chores (three items), Participate in Social/Recreational Activities (two items), Manage Symptoms (four items), Manage Shortness of Breath (one item), and Control/Manage Depression (six items). It is a 10-point rating scale with anchors labeled from 1 (<italic>not at all confident</italic>) to 10 (<italic>totally confident</italic>). Each subscale was scored from 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating increased confidence. A summary average score was derived. A score ≥7 indicates a good chance that the action plan would be accomplished, whereas a score &lt;7 suggests that a reassessment of strategy and problem solving are beneficial to avoid failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434059">Lorig &amp; Holman, 2003</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from .77 to .91 for the subscales, indicating acceptable internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043659611434059">
<title>Translation Process</title>
<p>The CDSES was translated from English into a Korean version (CDSES-K) guided by a revised version of the translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611434059">Brislin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434059">Jones, Lee, Phillips, Zhang, &amp; Jaceldo, 2001</xref>). Psychometric testing of the CDSES-K was then conducted. Two bilingual nursing professors were involved in the translation process. One of the professors who translated the original tool to Korean had a PhD from a university in the United States and was certified as a CDSMP trainer including CDSES from the Patient Education Research Center in the United States. The other translator, who had been educated and taught in the United States, translated the CDSES in Korean back to English without any discussion with the first translator. To translate the items in a culturally appropriate manner during the forward translation, some of the items in the original version were reworded within the Korean context to enhance accurate cultural meanings of the items within the Korean context. For example, the item asking about the confidence level on obtaining help with the daily tasks in the original presents “meals” as one of the examples; meals in Korean reflect just the behavior of eating food, not as a daily task as meal preparation. Hence, the Korean version proposes “cooking meals” as an example to specify the item and deliver the contextually equivalent content. The original and back-translated English versions did not differ appreciably as judged by the translators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043659611434059">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>Before the data collection for psychometric testing, a pilot study was conducted at one of the data collection sites to examine the comprehension of CDSES-K by Korean individuals. Ten consenting Korean adults with chronic disease, who were literate in Korean, completed the questionnaire. All were able to answer the items and indicated verbally that they understood all questions and had no difficulty answering any of the items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043659611434059">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Approval was obtained from the institutional review board at the authors’ institution (AJIRB-MED-SUR-09-174). Each participant accepted the explanation of the study purpose and voluntarily signed an informed consent form. The confidentiality and anonymity of participants were guaranteed. They were told that they could withdraw from the study whenever they wanted. Nonresponse was allowed if they were not willing to provide personal information such as level of monthly income or education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611434059">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The survey took about 20 minutes to complete. To recruit participants at three outpatient clinics of a university-affiliated hospital, three trained research nurses were employed at each clinic and they asked adult patients with arthritis, diabetes, and/or hypertension if they were willing to participate in the survey while they were waiting to see the physician. If interest was expressed, each research nurse introduced herself, explained the study, and obtained participants’ informed consent. Participants completed the questionnaire at a quiet location in the clinic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043659611434059">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The distribution of scores of the 33 items of the CDSES-K was examined by mean, standard deviation, and floor and ceiling effects (large proportion of the sample scoring at the highest of lowest end of the measure). Floor or ceiling effect was examined using the frequency of highest or lowest score, and its frequency less than 30% was considered acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611434059">Everett, Salamonson, &amp; Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434059">Kane, 2006</xref>). Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to examine the construct validity of the CDSES-K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611434059">Ledesma &amp; Valero-Mora, 2007</xref>). To determine the appropriateness of factor analysis, the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was used. The obtained Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of .896 supported the adequacy of the data for factor analysis. Bartlett’s test of sphericity, a test for overall significance of correlations within a matrix, was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), thus supporting the use of factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611434059">Munro, 2005</xref>). Principal component analysis was used to create factors with an orthogonal varimax rotation. Generally, factor loadings &gt;.30 are considered to meet the minimal level, loadings of .40 are considered more important, and loadings ≥.50 are considered statistically significant. The cut-off criterion of eigenvalue &gt;1.0 was used to select the number of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611434059">Hair, Tatham, Anderson, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>). Cattell’s scree test was conducted to verify the number of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611434059">Raiche, Riopel, &amp; Blais, 2006</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were calculated for each subscale and the total scale of the CDSES-K to determine the internal consistency reliability. The Statistical Package Social Science (SPSS) Version 12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for data analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>General characteristics of participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611434059">Table 1</xref>. The 380 adults with chronic disease comprised 165 men (43.4%) and 215 women (56.6%), with a mean age of 49.5 ± 12.2 years, and education of 10.1 ± 4.7 years. The level of monthly family income was more than $1,800 for 72.5% of the respondents. Participants with high level of education (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .000) or younger age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .000) were more likely to have higher score of overall self-efficacy than the other groups.

<p>Factor analysis was used to test the construct validity of the CDSES-K. Using 30% as cut-off for floor and ceiling effects, none of the 33 items demonstrated any floor or ceiling effects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659611434059">Table 3</xref>. A principal component extraction method was applied and the obtained factors were rotated orthogonally using the varimax method. The factor loading criterion was set at more than .37, and all 33 items were included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659611434059">Table 3</xref>). Eight factors with eigenvalues &gt;1.0 were extracted, accounting for 72.5% of the variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043659611434059">Table 4</xref>). The number of factors was verified by using the scree test: the steep line related to the first eight factors represented the highest proportions of the variance (72.5%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659611434059">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043659611434059">4</xref> show the results of the factor analysis. Eight factors were identified among the 10 original subscales in this study. Two subscales of Participate in Social/Recreational Activities and Manage Shortness of Breath in the original CDSES were condensed into other factors in this study. Among the eight factors, two factors kept the same items as in the original Control/Manage Depression and Get Information on Disease, although some changes were found in the other six factors.</p>

<p>CDSES-K Factor 1, Management of Symptoms, accounted for 15.4% of the variance. The number of items in this factor increased from 5 to 7 (one from Participate in Social/Recreational Activities and one from Manage Shortness of Breath) compared with the original CDSES. CDSES-K Factor 2, Control/Manage of Depression, accounted for 13.3% of the variance. No change was made in its items. CDSES-K Factor 3, Do Chores, accounted for 10.0% of the variance. The item numbers of this factor increased from 3 to 4 items (one from Participate in Social/Recreational Activities). CDSES-K Factor 4, Exercise Regularly, explained 8.9% of the variance. This factor included one more item to the original 4 items (one from Manage Disease in General). CDSES-K Factor 5, Communicate with Physician, accounted for 8.9%. The number of this factor increased from 3 to 5 items (two from Obtain Help from Community, Family, and Friends). CDSES-K Factor 6, Obtain Help from Community, Family, and Friends, explained 6.4% of the variance. The number of this factor was decreased from 4 to 2 (two to CDSES-K Factor 5). CDSES-K Factor 7, Manage Disease in General, accounted for 5.7% of the variance. The number of this factor was also decreased from 5 to 4 (one to CDSES-K Factor 4). CDSES-K Factor 8, Get Information on Disease, explained 3.8% of the variance and no change was made in its item.</p>
<p>Internal consistency reliability for the total CDSES-K was .93. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for each subscale of the CDSES-K were .91 for Self-Efficacy to Manage Symptoms, .94 for Self-Efficacy to Control/Manage Depression, .91 for Self-Efficacy to Do Chores, .85 for Self-Efficacy to Exercise Regularly, .87 for Self-Efficacy to Communicate with Physician, .79 for Self-Efficacy to Obtain Help from Others, and .68 for Self-Efficacy to Manage Disease in General.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the validity and reliability of CDSES-K in Korean adults with chronic diseases. This study demonstrated the validity and reliability of the CDSES-K to measure Korean patients’ self-efficacy to manage their chronic disease in general. However, several issues require consideration in additional investigations.</p>
<sec id="section11-1043659611434059">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Study limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting these findings. First, the study sample was relatively small when compared with the sample size of another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>). A larger sample size is recommended for the next study. Second, as the study participants were drawn from a single hospital, the study findings cannot be generalized. Studies with various types of institutions and multiple sites such as community-based health centers are recommended. Further study with patients with other chronic diseases is also recommended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043659611434059">
<title>Translation Process</title>
<p>The two translators of the CDSES-K intended to shorten the sentence length and maintain a uniformed sentence style of all the items, thereby making the questionnaire short, simple, and easy to read in a proper length of time. Unlike our expectation, participants who were not familiar with hobbies or recreational activities may not have fully understood the intention of the short sentence. Elaboration such as providing culturally appropriate examples for the question could have been helpful in providing the participants with a clear understanding of the question. In addition, presenting a subheading for each subscale in the CDSES may be needed in the CDSES-K to increase readers’ comprehension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043659611434059">
<title>Psychometrics Test</title>
<p>All 33 items in the CDSES were successfully identified in the CDSES-K in our study. Two subscales among the original 10 subscales CDSES were condensed into eight factors/subscales in our study: Manage Shortness of Breath and Participate in Social/Recreational Activities. These findings suggest the need for future studies to define cultural differences for deploying the CDSES-K. The overall Cronbach’s alpha was .93 and internal consistency coefficients ranged from .68 to .94 in this study. The results from this methodological study are consistent with internal consistency coefficients from the original CDSES, .77 to .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>) or the overall alpha coefficient of .96 in Western population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434059">Jerant, Moore, Lorig, &amp; Franks, 2008</xref>). This result is supported by the similarity of the self-efficacy level to manage chronic disease to that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al. (1996)</xref>. The psychometric properties provide evidence that the overall CDSES-K has an adequate internal consistency in the Korean adult population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043659611434059">
<title>Culture-Specific Findings</title>
<p>A culture-related finding was found in the item questioning the subscale of Manage Shortness of Breath. “How confident are you that you can keep your shortness of breath from interfering with what you want to do?”(Item 27) was moved to the subscale of Manage Symptom. The study participants may have perceived the shortness of breath as just one of their chronic symptoms, but not a major task. This result was expected because the study patients were diagnosed with hypertension, arthritis, or diabetes. Patients with respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not invited in this study. This result could be changed in a study with chronic respiratory disease patients.</p>
<p>The subscale of Participate in Social/Recreational Activities was an interesting, culture-specific finding. The item in the subscale, “How confident are you that you can continue to do your hobbies and recreation?” (Item 20), was merged into the subscale of Do Chores, and the other item of the subscale, “How confident are you that you can continue to do the things you like to do with friends and family?” (Item 21), was moved to the subscale Manage symptoms. Actually, in Korean culture, social or recreational activities are not likely to be as popular as in Western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434059">Jerant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>). It seems that social or recreational activities are more likely to be a special event such as summer vacation or represent the everyday life of rich people in Korean culture. Many Korean patients may not have or recognize hobbies or recreational activities in their everyday life; rather, they may assume that doing their everyday house chores is their hobby or recreational activity. Additional studies are recommended to determine whether this finding was unique to this study or may reflect a cultural difference. The other question used to measure the Participate in Social/Recreational Activities, that is—“How confident are you that you can continue to do the things you like to do with friends and family?”—was absorbed into the subscale of Manage symptoms. This phenomenon could be explained in the context of the translation process. Most Korean participants in this study may be unfamiliar with short sentence of hobbies or recreational activities.</p>
<p>Another culture-related finding was observed in the subscale of Obtain Help from Community, Family, and Friends. Although two questions asking emotional support or getting help from friends or family remained in the original subscale (Items 5 and 6), the other two items asking emotional support or help from other than friends or family (Items 7 and 8) were moved to the subscale of Communicate with Physician. Unlike Western culture, where help from significant others and nonsignificant others are perceived as one subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434059">Jerant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434059">Lorig et al., 1996</xref>), Korean patients were likely to distinguish between those two different sources of help. Under family-oriented Korean culture, managing any family members’ chronic disease seems to be a family matter rather than a patient-only matter. It is also relatively easy to get help from family or friends in terms of finding right caregivers, times, or cost than from nonsignificant others such as community centers or physicians to which accessibility seems to be limited. Again, additional work is needed to determine whether the finding is unique to this study or may reflect a cultural difference.</p>
<p>Last, the question “How confident are you that you can do things other than just taking medication to reduce the extent to which your illness affects your everyday life?” (Item 16) in the subscale of Manage Disease in General was moved to the subscale of Exercise Regularly. This observation may reflect that doing the regular exercise might be the major self-management behavior of Korean chronic disease patients to date. Additional work is recommended after a CDSMP workshop wherein patients can learn new self-management skills such as cognitive symptom management techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043659611434059">
<title>Recommendations for Future Study</title>
<p>Future studies using focus groups or qualitative methods are recommended to discover the unique perspectives of Korean population with chronic disease regarding the limited knowledge of social/recreation activities for their chronic disease management. The finding of our Korean participants’ different views on family-focused and community-focused social support should be fully explored for the development of culture-specific social support interventions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition is an important factor in improving self-management capability and enhancing health status. This study provides clinical evidence on validity and reliability of CDSES-K in assessing self-efficacy among Korean with chronic conditions. It supports the cross-cultural applicability of the concepts underlying the CDSES-K and self-efficacy transcends across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434059">Bandura, 1986</xref>). It can provide guidance for not only assessing self-efficacy in Koreans with chronic diseases in a variety of clinical settings by health care providers but also examining potential function of self-efficacy in improvement of self-management behaviors and enhancing health status of Korean people with chronic disease. Cultural modifications in this study such as limited knowledge of social/recreational activities for chronic disease management and different views on family and community social support need to be considered when using the CDSES-K, and further empirical investigation in those aspects is recommended when using Western-based instruments.</p>
