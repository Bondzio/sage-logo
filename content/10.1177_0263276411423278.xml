<abstract>
<p>Further to the recent handover of the Naval School of Mechanics (ESMA), Argentina’s most notorious centre for the clandestine torture and assassination of leftist militants under the dictatorship of 1976–83, to the city of Buenos Aires, in order to create on the premises a ‘Space for Memory’, debates on the proper commemoration of the recent past have gained momentum. In the course of these, it has become clear that there is currently no consensus among the human rights organizations, let alone Argentine society at large, on how the former sites of state terrorism can be adequately ‘recovered’, or what the purpose and function of such a recovery might be. Rather than as a shortcoming, however, this impossibility of closure, and of the monumentalization of a social consensus about the past in museal forms, might be taken as an opportunity to problematize some of the politics and material poetics underpinning the contemporary ‘memorial museum’. The article therefore analyses the principal arguments and positions voiced in the debate about ESMA with a view to their attitudes (explicit or implicit) towards the museum-form as such, and the conclusions that might be derived from these in the context of contemporary debates about ‘postmemory’, ‘secondary witnessing’ and the politics of empathy at the museum.</p>

<p>Sabe – me dice –, éste es el mapa del infierno. En la tierra, como un mapa, lo que yo les cuento, que le doy la certidumbre, era un mapa – quiero decir – de tumbas desconocidas, con una parte escarchada como una losa y después tierra o pasto. No se puede tapar y tapar porque a la larga la escarcha, la tierra removida, se ve, claro que el mal ya está hecho. (Ricardo Piglia, <italic>La ciudad ausente</italic>)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>You know – he tells me – this is the map of Hell. In the ground, like a map, just as I’m telling you, as I can assure you; I mean, it was a map of nameless graves, with one part frozen over like a gravestone, and the rest soil or grass. It can’t be covered up again and again, because at some point the frost, the moved soil will show through, but of course, the damage has already been done.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276411423278">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘THE NATURE of the place is ambiguous’, says Daniel Schiavi, a guide at the Officers’ Casino of the former Naval Academy of Mechanics (ESMA), the largest clandestine centre for torturing, assassinating and ‘disappearing’ prisoners under the Argentine dictatorship of 1976–83: ‘The joy of having conquered a site you are beginning to populate runs parallel with the sensation that you’re keeping company with the souls that have passed through here’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276411423278">Ginzberg, 2008</xref>). ESMA remains ambiguous, and troubling, in more than one sense: following its handover in 2004 from the Armed Forces to the City of Buenos Aires, to be given into the custody of a rainbow coalition of human rights organizations, the 17-acre site has become at once a memorial (a lieu de mémoire) and an experimental space for working through the aporias of commemorating the victims of the past while also re-activating their legacy of struggle for a politics in and of the present. As such, ESMA – now comprising, apart from the casino, which has been left unaltered and can only be visited in the presence of guides, a number of cultural centres, archives and educational institutions – is also the flagship of a wider network of former sites of repression that have been reclaimed for commemorative and educational purposes. Among these are site-specific memorials such as the former concentration camps Automotores Orletti, Club Atlético or El Olimpo, all in the city of Buenos Aires, or the Pasaje Santa Catalina memorial at Córdoba, incorporating the Provincial Archive of Memory, museums such as the Museo de la Memoria at Rosario, opened in 2010, and non-site-specific memorial spaces such as the Parque de la Memoria in Buenos Aires, on the shores of the River Plate. Yet the sheer scale of ESMA as well as its emblematic character as probably the largest of the dictatorship’s concentration camps and its location in one of the priciest quarters of Buenos Aires, together with the controversial process of its transfer and re-functionalization, single it out as a stage where the politics of memory in contemporary Argentina are being played out like nowhere else.</p>
<p>Among the processes of ‘post-transitional justice’ in Latin America and indeed worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276411423278">2</xref></sup> the case of Argentina stands out for the centrality the prosecution of human rights violations and the institutionalization of survivors’ and relatives’ forms of public commemoration as state memory have occupied over the last decade. After years of hesitant and contradictory progress, or even blatant obstruction on behalf of the judiciary and the executive, of the investigation, prosecution and documentation of the assassination and ‘disappearance’ of up to 30,000 people under the dictatorship, the administrations of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner (2003–2007, 2007–2011) have made the cause of ‘memory and justice’ one of their principal banners. The not always easy relationship between the left-Peronist government and human rights activists, including its impact on public practices, sites and institutions of commemoration and triggering similar processes in other Latin American countries, has since received considerable critical attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276411423278">Jelin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423278">Levy, 2010</xref>). However, while the memorialization of dictatorial terror and of leftist militancy has undeniably occupied centre stage in Argentine politics, the fault lines of debates on how to remember and commemorate the past – whether to preserve or even reconstruct the topographies of terror or to transform these into spaces for artistic and political engagement with present-day struggles for social, indigenous or sexual rights – do not necessarily coincide with activists’ greater or lesser proximity to the government. Rather, they are also inscribed within contemporary re-assessments of the museum-form on a global scale, which at the same time as it has come under siege from feminist and postcolonial critiques for its disciplinary nature, as an ideological apparatus in the business of fashioning docile subjects of nation, empire and patriarchy, has also been promoted in the name of curatorial discourses of inclusiveness and community empowerment as ‘a site from which to redress social inequalities’, which ‘instead of transmitting knowledge to an essentialized mass audience ... listens and responds sensitively as it encourages diverse groups to become active participants in museum discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411423278">Marstine, 2006</xref>: 19). This essay attempts to read the – still ongoing – debate on how ESMA should be reclaimed as a ‘space for memory’ [<italic>espacio para la memoria</italic>] in the light of the contemporary boom of the memory museum and the way its engagement with past ‘atrocities’, approached through the tropes of ‘post’ or ‘prosthetic memory’ and ‘secondary witnessing’, purports to forge an empathetic and dialogical space of encounter, mourning and community. The way in which this global curatorial arsenal of memory, at ESMA, is both applied to and resisted by the politics of the site and its various reclaimings on behalf of survivors, relatives and human rights organizations, I argue, also points to the limits of the museum as a cultural form to which the political work of mourning can be entrusted.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276411423278"><title>Facing the Past</title>
<p>Photographs have played a key part in reclaiming ESMA. One of the iconic images of the site’s handover on 24 March 2004 – the anniversary of the military coup of 1976 – shows the head of the armed forces, General Roberto Bendini, taking down the framed images of former leaders of the military junta, Jorge Videla and Reynaldo Bignone, watched by the late President Néstor Kirchner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276411423278">3</xref></sup> Other kinds of portraits have since taken their place: at the Espacio Cultural Nuestros Hijos (Our Children’s Cultural Space, ECUNHI), the centre organized by the Asociación Madres de Plaza de Mayo, visitors are greeted by a multitude of faces, photographs that gently rotate as they hang from the ceiling in groups of three or four like children’s mobiles, invoking the presence of (as the caption informs) ‘revolutionary faces’ forever detained in their youthful candour. At the neighbouring Centro Cultural Haroldo Conti, part of the Archivo Nacional de la Memoria and named after the writer and activist disappeared by the military, similar images are on display but often intervened and reconfigured in temporary exhibitions and workshops that ‘invite the singularity of looks that discover and bring us face to face with different lives, sometimes unknown, sometimes forgotten or ignored’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411423278">Fraire, 2011</xref>). However, it is the mugshots of recently abducted women and men, taken at ESMA by Víctor Melchor Basterra between 1980 and 1983 and now on display at the former cadets’ dormitory that also served as headquarters of the ‘Special Tasks Groups’ in charge of kidnappings, which in their literal <italic>return to their own site of production</italic> bring to the fore the enormity and the risk of the wager of reclaiming ESMA.</p>
<p>As Vikki Bell has argued, drawing on the challenge W.J.T. Mitchell put to art historians in a notorious article – what do pictures want? – returning the gaze of these images from ESMA irrevocably entangles us in several of the aporias that have occupied studies of photography and memory for the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276411423278">Bell, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276411423278">4</xref></sup> Still wearing the same clothes as when they were kidnapped from their homes and workplaces, the individuals captured by Basterra face the camera with a sometimes bewildered, sometimes composed or resigned expression. Or so it seems to us, for, in fact, we cannot really ‘interpret their expression’ at what for most of them was certainly the last time they would ever face a camera, if not as an interpellation of our own irredeemable belatedness with respect to what was about to befall these – mostly young – women and men. In these images from ESMA, just as in the Judenpass photographs from Nazi Germany that Marianne Hirsch has analysed, ‘identity is identification, visibility, and surveillance, not for life but for the death machine that had already condemned all of those thus marked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276411423278">Hirsch, 2001</xref>: 27). Here, too, the visual composition of full frontal exposure, of bodies marked out to be tortured, destroyed, de-humanized and disappeared, draws us into the position of the perpetrator’s own gaze, turning those subjected to it (in the way violence always subjects its target, as Simone Weil has written) into a thing, ‘something that can be possessed’. Indeed, this very <italic>claim for possession</italic> seems to have been the sole and exclusive function of these pictures, since the kind of systematic violence exerted at ESMA was directed precisely at <italic>unmaking</italic> the identity thus registered. This destruction of individuals <italic>as subjects</italic> through the production of <italic>indifference</italic> at ESMA proceeded according to a sinister methodology, from replacing prisoners’ names by numbers and perpetually hiding their faces under hoods to the immobilization of their bodies and the inhibition of speech, and the final, or rather <italic>infinite</italic>, violation of the ‘disappearance’ of mortal remains, in an attempt to pre-empt even the possibility of a posthumous reconstruction of subjectivity through mourning and remembrance. We are, then, not only drawn into complicity with a <italic>gaze</italic> that claims these bodies as bodies-for-death, but also with a <italic>knowledge</italic> of the systematic, bureaucratized machinery of sadism that pervades these images, turning the visual pleasure elicited by physical beauty into the morbid form of voyeurism Susan Sontag decries: ‘All images that display the violation of an attractive body are, to a certain degree, pornographic’ (2003: 85).</p>
<p>But, complicating this by now well-rehearsed critical vocabulary, these are pictures taken <italic>from</italic> as well as <italic>at</italic> ESMA [in Spanish, <italic>sacar fotos</italic> literally means ‘to take out/away photographs’]. For Basterra, who had been abducted in 1979, himself only survived ESMA due to his having been among a group of prisoners forced to work in a clandestine print unit entrusted with tasks such as the fabrication of fake IDs for the ‘Special Tasks Groups’ carrying out the routine of kidnapping, torture and murder, as well as ownership certificates for cars and other items stolen during abductions, and of photographing the freshly arrived victims. During the final months of the dictatorship, on conditional release while the clandestine camp was being quietly dismantled to cover up all traces of its existence, Basterra managed to smuggle around a hundred negatives out of the premises, which later became part of the evidence assembled by the CONADEP truth commission and were used in the 1985 trials against members of the junta. Apart from identifying some of the perpetrators and helping to trace the fate, or even recover the remains of, <italic>desaparecidos</italic> who had passed through ESMA, Basterra’s images have since also been exhibited in museums and galleries, and have served to back up testimonial evidence from survivors about the spatial set-up and organization of the death camp, subsequently disappeared by its very authors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276411423278">5</xref></sup> But then, as Bell suggests, what these images ‘want’ from their viewers becomes contingent on the successive sites of their ‘re-appearance’, framed through the legal archive, the historical or artistic exhibition that returns them into the visual space of the present. In the realm of legal procedure, ‘the photograph asserts itself as evidence, as an exposure not of the one captured but of the regime that captured <italic>him</italic> in the camp ... As an image in an art exhibition, however, what the photograph wants is not framed by legal procedure’. But the question remains, Bell suggests, whether this photograph can, ‘in this different assemblage, assert itself against the force of becoming-History or becoming-archive, which, while preserving, can also threaten the potential vitality of its collected elements. Can the art context shield that vitality?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276411423278">Bell, 2010</xref>: 82).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276411423278"><title>Postmemory and Its Discontents</title>
<p>This, I would suggest, is also a question that obtains for the ‘reclaiming’ of ESMA in the name of memory more widely. Basterra’s photographs, in their complex multi-layeredness as documentary evidence <italic>and</italic> as iconic monuments, as perpetrator images <italic>and</italic> as tokens of resistance, also allow us to reflect on how the aim of maintaining a politicized memory in and for the present sit uneasily alongside certain critical and museological languages forged in response to the new, self-avowedly global concern with commemorating ‘atrocities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276411423278">6</xref></sup> Marianne Hirsch’s concept of postmemory has been an influential contribution to recent global debates on memorialization and the museum, beyond its original aim of addressing the complex reactions prompted by the exposure to images of the Holocaust, principally of Jewish beholders born after the event and thus with no direct, personal recollections of it. Despite – or because – some of these images have long established themselves through mass-media and indeed monumental reproduction as a kind of photographic repertoire or visual shorthand, notwithstanding the impossibility of visually or otherwise synthesizing the Holocaust, their effect on second-generation viewers, according to Hirsch, is not a ‘de-sensitizing’ one that would require a constant escalation of shock aesthetics in order to reinstate their initial impact. Rather, the iconization of memory may call forth a process of ‘re-traumatizing’ that makes spatio-temporally distant beholders graft these pictures ‘into their own images and memories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276411423278">Hirsch, 2001</xref>: 8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276411423278">7</xref></sup> Rather than being fully given by the image (or indeed the event it recalls, however irrepresentable), postmemory thus refers to the intersubjective, transgenerational <italic>work</italic> that deliberately re-activates traumatic repetition. Postmemory is then the witnessing, and empathic adoption of, the trauma of the first generation by subsequent ones. It is only in the <italic>Nachträglichkeit</italic> (belatedness or ‘afterwardsness’, in the translation of Freud’s term proposed by Jean Laplanche)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276411423278">8</xref></sup> of its temporality, inexorably disjointed from that of the victims, that the trauma which the latter could only reinstate as compulsive repetition can now be <italic>worked through</italic> and become the memorial and ethical foundation of community. This, says Hirsch, is the political challenge facing us at the specific ‘historical, generational moment’ we find ourselves in today.</p>
<p>I would argue that Hirsch’s focus on intrafamilial and transgenerational inheritance keeps her from fully unpacking the spatial as well as temporal dimension of the traumatic deferral she calls postmemory. The visual canonization of the Holocaust has become a cultural repertoire not only of the mass assassination of European Jews on behalf of the German Reich’s industrial apparatus of genocide but also, moreover, of our contemporary notion of ‘atrocity’ per se. Images of Auschwitz and Buchenwald have almost routinely been called upon in recent years to make the case for ‘humanitarian intervention’ in Bosnia, Rwanda, or Iraq (often, as in Blair’s now-infamous 45-minute-scenario of imminent Iraqi WMD attacks on Westminster, also invoking a ‘Munich moment’ to lend a sense of urgency to calls for armed action). But apart from such rather instrumental manipulations, this cultural repertoire and the sophisticated critical and philosophical vocabulary that has been generated around it have also become the horizon against which moments of national or hemispheric catastrophe, such as the wave of dictatorial repression ravaging Latin America between the 1960s and 1980s, have been reflected on in a sincere attempt to make commensurable the unbearable and, thus, reinstate commonality through the work of mourning. Across continental divides, as Paul Williams has shown, the attempt to restore the ethical foundations of society by reinvesting the spaces and emblems of atrocity as sites of commemoration has produced new kinds of material environments located midway between the monument and the museum, where ‘minimalist and abstract design [prevails] over that which is grandiose and authoritative; decentered and incommodious space over that which is central and iconic; bodily visitor experiences that are sensory and emotional rather than visual and impassive; interpretative strategies that utilize private, subjective testimony over official historical narrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276411423278">Williams, 2007</xref>: 3). A new relation between object, image and place (site), then, comes into being here that encourages visitors to turn into active participants of a memory performance akin to what Hirsch calls the work of postmemory: museum-going is turned into an act of secondary witnessing through careful deployment of an iconography both sufficiently familiar to trigger traumatic repetition and at the same time sufficiently open to allow the second-generation viewer and even the accidental tourist to introduce her or his own experience and subjectivity. Concepts forged in the context of the photographic image and archive, then, have been redeployed as curatorial strategies for forging empathy and ‘dialogical’ inclusiveness in the memory museum. Yet if such reconfigurations of the museum form – many of them drawing lessons and inspiration from one another through the International Coalition of Historic Site Monuments of Conscience<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276411423278">9</xref></sup> – have certainly reinvigorated museums’ claims to act as purveyors of historical reflection and experience, the now global reach of this ‘postmemorial’ aesthethics of mourning also begs a critical re-assessment of Hirsch’s claim that the latter ‘produces rather than shields’ the effect of trauma. For could it not be the case, after all, that postmemory, posited as a global form of remembrance, produces generic traumatic effects at the same time as it shields the specific, historical origin of the trauma? And could it, in this sense, not also in fact amount to a sublimation of such localized, historical specificity, precisely as it inscribes the latter in a generic <italic>post-Auschwitz</italic> sublime (problematically inheriting Nazism’s own ‘negative sublime’, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276411423278">Dominick La Capra’s (1994</xref>: 14) expression) – or is, on the contrary, ‘the atrocious’ necessarily inscribed in generic forms that reach out beyond specific spaces and temporalities to touch instead on a core of values that define or unmake the human as such? I shall now return to the ESMA debate in order to pursue these questions further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276411423278"><title>The ESMA Controversy</title>
<p>Constructed in 1924–26, the Naval School of Mechanics, during the period of 1976–83 then euphemistically known as the ‘Process of National Reorganization’, was one of around 340 clandestine centres for the torture and assassination of leftwing militants, trade union and human rights activists or their relatives, as well as individuals who had happened to witness kidnappings or stood in the way of business and other interests related to military personnel. Probably the largest of them all, ESMA, according to former inmates’ estimates, held around 5000 prisoners between 1976 and 1983, around 90 per cent of whom were assassinated. Women prisoners pregnant at the time of their abduction were routinely left alive until giving birth, their babies being subsequently given over to military staff and their relatives for adoption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0263276411423278">10</xref></sup> The clandestine prison operated in the cellar, first and upper floor of the Officers’ Casino, in installations that were modified in 1979 prior to a visit from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, inmates being temporarily transferred to an island in the Paraná delta called ‘The Retreat’ (<italic>El Descanso</italic>). When the camp was in operation, prisoners were kept, handcuffed, chained and hooded, in narrow bunks on the third floor – nicknamed <italic>la Capucha</italic> [the Hood] – which also held various cells (one for pregnant inmates), bathrooms, storage facilities for objects ransacked from prisoners’ homes, and two torture chambers. From 1977 onward, there was also an office area where some inmates, while chained to their desks, were entrusted with translation and archiving tasks. On the ground floor were the offices of military personnel; in the cellar, further torture rooms, a medical practice, and the photo laboratory. Initially, the sports fields adjacent to the building were used for incinerating corpses; subsequently, assassinations (euphemistically referred to as <italic>traslados</italic>; transfers) were carried out by numbing prisoners and throwing them into the river from airplanes. Following defeat in the Malvinas war, during the de-facto presidency of General Reynaldo Bignone between 1982 and 1983, most remaining prisoners were gradually released while being kept under surveillance and intimidation to prevent them from speaking out, while the camp was quietly dismantled and covered up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411423278">Martyniuk, 2004</xref>: 14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276411423278">11</xref></sup> Legal proceedings against some of the principal repressors active at the camp, cut short in 1987 by Raúl Alfonsín’s ‘compulsory obedience’ presidential decree, re-commenced only in December 2009, following the decree’s revocation by the Supreme Court in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276411423278">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>ESMA was handed over to the City of Buenos Aires in the same year, entrusting the latter with the task of creating on the premises a ‘Space for Memory’ – marking a radical turning-point in state policy from the Menem government’s attempt, in 1998, to demolish ESMA in order to create on the site a park of ‘national re-unification’ or the centre-right Alianza coalition’s project of a joint ‘educational nucleus’ for the armed forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411423278">Abrevaya, 2008a</xref>). After several years of sometimes ferocious debates on how – and whether – the premises should be reclaimed and transformed, the consensus reached around 2007 (although some groups such as the association of former political prisoners [Asociación de Ex-Detenidos Desaparecidos, AEDD] remain in disagreement) singles out the buildings directly used in the clandestine repression, including medical wards, mechanical and photographic workshops and buildings occupied by the ‘Special Tasks Groups’. Whereas these have been left unchanged, except for elementary signage indicating these spaces’ former functions and the alterations made by the military during the dismantling of the camp, and can only be accessed on guided visits, the remainder of the site has been divided up between state and international human rights agencies and the 14 NGOs participating in the governing body, which also includes a representative of the national and municipal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276411423278">Abrevaya, 2008b</xref>). Following the already mentioned Espacio Cultural ‘Nuestros Hijos’ (ECUNHI) and Centro Cultural Haroldo Conti, both including exhibition and workshop spaces for the visual arts, film, literature and dance as well as a library and film collection focusing on human rights topics, more recently the organization of daughters and sons of ‘disappeared’ parents, H.I.J.O.S. (<italic>hijos</italic>, generic for sons and daughters, or children, stands for Hijos por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio [Children for Identity and Justice against Oblivion and Silence]), inaugurated their Casa de la Militancia (Activists’ House) in a former military gym, providing assembly and workshop spaces for political and social activists (Casa de la Militancia, 2011). Adjacent buildings have become the Archivo Nacional de la Memoria (National Archive of Memory), a government institution holding the archives of the CONADEP commission, the National Office of Human Rights, and the Presidential Press Office, among others; the cultural TV channel Canal Encuentro, a music school operated by the association Madres de Plaza de Mayo – Línea Fundadora, and a UNESCO postgraduate programme in Human Rights Studies. Rather than a single monumental project, then, a process of partial and fragmentary ‘reclaimings’ on behalf of cultural and political initiatives is now under way, both on behalf of nongovernmental and state bodies, that do not necessarily coincide in their politics and poetics of spatio-temporal reclaiming and re-inscription of the former site of horror into the public space of the city. This somewhat contradictory conviviance of monumental and counter-monumenal strategies and projects (as well as the <italic>kirchnerista</italic> government’s disinclination to impose one particular project over others) will be the subject of these reflections: rather than a single, univocal ‘site of memory’, what I am discussing here are the different (and to an extent antagonistic) claims to such a site, some of which have had a concrete, material bearing on space and place while others have not (at least not in a tangible sense – abstention from material intervention being, as we shall see below, one of the very strategies of engaging with the site’s peculiar spatio-temporality).</p>
<p>In the months following the transferral of ESMA in 2004, the city government of Buenos Aires invited proposals from human rights organizations and the general public. Just as the creation of a memorial park, decreed by the previous federal administration in 1998, which had been opposed by some activist organizations for its abstract monumental language as well as, more generally, as an attempt to draw a memorialistic closure under a political and juridical struggle they insisted was still ongoing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276411423278">13</xref></sup> the call for projects to re-occupy ESMA was met with responses ranging from flat-out dismissals to detailed suggestions for the future use of the premises. These were in turn debated by artists and intellectuals in newspapers and journals, and also triggered a series of international symposia sponsored by organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Goethe Institut. Some of the principal points of contention were about whether the whole of ESMA or merely the space of the former clandestine camp should be included in the memorial project; whether other state or military installations should be allowed to function alongside it; and whether the focus should remain exclusively on the camp or also include wider questions such as the social and political context of the dictatorship and of revolutionary struggle, and their complex legacies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276411423278">14</xref></sup> Very schematically, three main positions can be distinguished, most submissions juxtaposing or combining more than one of these. At one end, there is the <italic>testimonial</italic> option which takes the entire site as unalterable heritage; at the opposite end, the <italic>performative</italic> option maintains that only by handing it over to future-oriented artistic and political activities can this space be wrested from death and its executioners. In between the two, the <italic>museal</italic> option argues for the need of contextualizing and arranging the site’s material evidence in ways that allow it to serve certain pedagogical functions, such as the inculcation of democratic values.</p>
<p>Of all the respondents to the city government’s call, only the Asociación Madres de la Plaza de Mayo took the radically anti-museal stand of asking for the transformation of the entire space of ESMA into a multifunctional centre for youth culture and popular arts (as was eventually created at the Espacio Cultural Nuestros Hijos). In an interview, the Association’s leader, Hebe de Bonafini, explained this posture, associating it to the group’s insistent claim for <italic>aparición con vida</italic> – the ‘re-appearance’ of their lost children – refusing to accept (in political rather than merely personal terms) the fact of their violent deaths: ‘We don’t share the idea of a museum of horror ... I’m not interested in it, we are not victims. Neither them, nor us ... Museums are associated with death, when all has finished. And here, nothing at all has finished. ... Death is for the executioners, not for us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 219). In similarly dismissive terms, the organization H.I.J.O.S. insisted on the need to convert ‘recovered’ death camps into ‘space[s] for memory, in counter-position to an idea of the museum, in order to escape a static and non-participant use of time and space’. Against an ‘abstract, comforting memory’, which would induce ‘an unquestionable past, incapable of establishing links with the present ... a cadaverized, dried-up past’, they favoured ‘a memory in action, ... a permanent <italic>escrache</italic> of all the genocidal killers, accomplices, ideologues and beneficiaries of the military dictatorship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 220) – <italic>escraches</italic> being the organization’s own peculiar form of ‘outing’ accomplices of the regime through carefully planned neighbourhood actions culminating in street parades with carnival and rave elements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0263276411423278">15</xref></sup> However, before the recovered camps can be given over to such a ‘memory in action’ (also implying, H.I.J.O.S. insisted, their administration through an autonomous body independent from city and national governments), tasks of forensic anthropology and partial reconstruction would need to take place to advance prosecution of crimes against humanity. Although, then, H.I.J.O.S. (unlike the Madres) recognized the necessity for museal and testimonial forms of object- and space-making (such as the forensic recovery of objects and body parts, and their re-arrangement in reconstructed environments), they insisted that their use must be restricted to the fashioning of a juridical body of evidence. As a public apparatus, on the contrary, the museum is denounced here as a device of immobilization and inscription of univocal meanings, that is, as intrinsically complicit with the disciplinary nature of the prison, the genocidal pedagogy of confinement, invisibility and physical aggression of which it uncannily repeats in a delusively ‘benign’ fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0263276411423278">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not difficult to recognize in these responses a tradition of critique and denunciation of the museum-form ranging from the avant-gardes’ iconoclastic attacks, via critical theory, to more recent Althusserian and Foucaultian readings of the museum as optical apparatus and as part of the institutional archipelago of disciplinary society — the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276411423278">Douglas Crimp (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276411423278">Tony Bennett (1995)</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276411423278">Donald Preziosi (2003)</xref> comes to mind here. It is interesting to note, however, that in the debate on ESMA the former has clearly been the minority position not just among human rights organizations but also in the interventions of academics, both of whom have been placing their trust, to different degrees, in either the <italic>testimonial</italic> power of the site itself or the capacity on behalf of <italic>museal</italic> forms of staging and intervening in the latter to elicit empathic visitor responses. In an article published in the newspaper <italic>Página/12</italic> under the intriguing title ‘Museo del Nunca Más’ [Never-Again Museum], the philosopher Alejandro Kaufman suggests that merely to turn ESMA into an exhibition equals an acknowledgement of the facticity of terror as that which must not re-occur, thus reinstating the national bond on condition of this minimal common denominator (‘<italic>nunca más</italic>’): ‘This museum does not need to polemicize nor to sustain a debate. It has only to show and demonstrate the nature of the dispositive ... This exhibition transforms it into a symbol, a point of departure for conviviance in this – our – territory, by which we all continue to be damaged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 79). Kaufman’s concern, as he has subsequently pointed out, is foremost with the <italic>exceptional</italic> nature of ESMA and other spaces of clandestine detention, dehumanization and murder which, as a hiatus in the spatio-temporal continuum of the city and of national society, can and must not be re-introduced into any kind of symbolic order, either through its ‘recovery’ for cultural activities or through inscription in the register of national monuments (a status that was effectively conferred on the Officers’ Casino, site of the former clandestine torture unit, in August 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0263276411423278">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Kaufman’s radical testimonialism ultimately insists on the irrecoverability of ESMA for anything but a cathartic pointing-back to itself on behalf of the mute remnants of a design intended to radically destroy meaning as such, other partisans of non-intervention into the spatial texture of the site stake a very different claim in its monumentality. Largely, this is the position taken by the associations of the ex-Desaparecidos and their relatives,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0263276411423278">18</xref></sup> most emphatically by the association of former political prisoners (Asociación de Ex-Detenidos-Desaparecidos, AEDD). Although all of the above insist that the entire space of ESMA must be completely abandoned by the Navy and only then opened to the public, it is only the latter who resist any kind of institutional activity anywhere on the premises (such as the reservation of certain areas for archival, educational or exhibitionary tasks), demanding instead its preservation ‘as the material testimony of genocide’ and, therefore, an essential part of the ‘historical and cultural heritage’ of the Argentine nation (the association also suggests applying to UNESCO for ESMA to be declared a world heritage site). In a polemic inversion of nationalism’s sacralizing<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0263276411423278">19</xref></sup> rhetoric of historical monumentalism, then, AEDD argues that the materiality of the site of horror holds in itself a truth-value that must not be tampered with: ‘The entire area of ESMA, its buildings with their contents and surroundings, including the sports fields, represents a PLACE that functioned as a clandestine centre of disappearance and extermination, and all of its materiality constitutes the HISTORICAL TEXTURE of this place’. Therefore, ‘conservation has to be based on the respect for the site’s historical texture’ and ‘must not permit any demolition or change that would have an adverse effect on the cultural value of the site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 215). An exception is made, however, for the former Officers’ Casino, where the association favours a reconstruction, on the basis of testimonies from surviving prisoners, of the dismantled death camp’s installations, as long as it is made explicit to visitors that they are in the presence of a reconstruction rather than the original.</p>
<p>With the rather significant exception of the death camp as such, the proposal invokes – albeit in a self-consciously, and provocatively, ironic twist – a conservationist discourse of heritage that looks back to Romanticism’s fascination with ruins. In the writings of Byron, Chateaubriand or Goethe, the ruin represents the thing which, precisely because it demands empathic supplementation from the beholder’s imagination, must be maintained in its fragmentary and disjointed state, exhibiting the wounds of time rather than allowing for the (false) suture of posterior reconstructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0263276411423278">20</xref></sup> Yet rather than being the work of ‘organic’ decay which, in the Romantic tradition, re-unites the beholder and the (otherwise irrecoverable) monument in the medium of a shared transience, at ESMA the site’s ruinous state, as the AEDD’s proposal fully acknowledges, has been deliberately inflicted in order to deny what is the very reason for its recovery and preservation, thus also complicating the proposal’s rhetoric of authenticity and approaching it to a more critical, modernist notion of ruins and ephemera as dialectical images revealing the unsaid, disavowed underpinnings of history. Moreover, one could ask, would not a radical testimonialism also have to insist on <italic>preserving erasure,</italic> as a key element of the crimes perpetrated at ESMA, and thus partaking both of the evidence-value and the sacrality of the rest of the site? Conversely, if the ‘reconstructed’ areas have to explicate their artificial nature, both because of the impossibility of fully reconstructing the site of horror and in order to avoid <italic>repeating the work of the assassins</italic> by self-consciously <italic>creating exhibits</italic> rather than <italic>re-creating the machinery of torture</italic> itself, it may well be asked why an aesthetics of realism should be the one most suitable to accomplish the desired effect. What does ‘the nature of the dispositive demonstrate’, to paraphrase Kaufman, other than how such a dispositive works? Can – and should – the testimonial display of the machinery of terror give shelter to the memory of its victims?</p>
<p>‘It is not by re-creating the horror that events can be transmitted’, the Asociación Buena Memoria (Association Good Memory), a group of ex-detainees, relatives and activists, asserts in its proposal: ‘The reconstruction of the scenario of torture is paralyzing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 216). In an essay first published in the journal <italic>Puentes</italic>, Lila Pastoriza, herself a former ESMA inmate and a member of Buena Memoria, emphasizes the need for a display open to a plurality of visitor responses, in order to avoid the spectral repetition of the monolithic, Manichean spatiality of the death camp: ‘The reconstruction of horror risks leaving visitors outside, numbed and speechless, whereas open representations that combine information with elements of a strong symbolic value seek to include them and stimulate their participation’. Rather than the ‘pedagogy of consternation which predominated until the 1990s’ in the museal commemoration of atrocities, she favours a display that ‘promotes active participation’ from visitors, in particular those born after the events – one that invites secondary witnessing and re-traumatizing effects along the lines indicated by Hirsch and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 90–91). The Buena Memoria proposals, as Mario di Paolantonio has put it, are concerned with forging ‘a complex living relation – a constellation, not consternation – with the remnants of an oppressed past that is decaying, leaving, and revealing itself in the traces and ruins of its passing ... it is through the art of arrangement (and not through the direct presentation or negative encirclement of horror) that a constellation takes shape, illuminating a dialectical relationship between the past and present where different <italic>tenses</italic> confront rather than overwhelm each other’ (2008: 40).</p>
<p>Once again, to varying degrees, positions such as these stake their hopes on the capacity of contemporary curatorial and museographic devices to generate ‘open representations’ in an inclusive space that accommodates the multiplicity of visitor responses. Heavily influenced by recent debates and proposals for an ‘inclusive museum’, the political implications of this position come to the fore perhaps most clearly in the submission of the Centre for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), an NGO affiliated with Human Rights Watch and other cognate organizations. Just like AEDD (but arguably with a much less polemic undertone), CELS asserts that ESMA <disp-quote>
<p>is part of our cultural heritage. The recognition, construction and preservation of that heritage is and continues to be one of the foundations of our society. ... However, the challenge is for it not to be converted into a museum of horror. The architectural, testimonial and historical recovery of a clandestine detention camp is a fundamental means to show some of the methods used by the dictatorship to impose terror. Yet this reconstruction must privilege the perspective of reflection and transmission, on the subject of what happened, how it happened, and why it could happen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 217–18)</p></disp-quote>Rather than on the concrete forms such an open transmission might take, as opposed to the musealization of horror, however, the CELS proposal focuses largely on the institutional frame in which it should be embedded, combining tasks of preservation and exhibition with others such as the hosting and development of programmes in human rights education, the fostering and documentation of academic debate, and so forth – the work, in fact, that CELS itself is already involved in. The CCD becomes in this way an extension of the NGOs which, from the time of the dictatorship and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, have worked tirelessly to expose and document the extent of dictatorial repression, preparing the ground for legal cases against the perpetrators and helping to unmake the dictatorship’s systematic attempt to erase the physical and symbolic memory of its victims.</p>
<p>The ‘recovery’ of the very sites of horror, for CELS, is above all an opportunity for the state itself to take on what should always have been its task, and what the NGOs only carried out in the absence of the state’s legal and archival institutions fulfilling their duties. Consequently, unlike all other human rights organizations, CELS explicitly welcomes the permanence of the Navy on the site, as a means of incorporating the armed forces into the construction of a democratic society, as well as of widening the ‘social legitimacy’ of the museum, which, the association insists, ‘must extend beyond the memory of the victims, their relatives and the human rights organizations, and be sustained by the whole of society. It is imperative that dialogue reaches out towards all perspectives, so as to achieve a shared sense of the past that is fruitful for the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423278">Brodsky, 2005</xref>: 218).</p>
<p>In the journal <italic>Punto de Vista</italic>, until its recent demise an influential organ of the liberal centre-left, the renowned psychoanalyst and historian Hugo Vezzetti embraced the CELS proposal, accusing the government and the other human rights groups of thwarting, with their ‘clientelist’ claims to the site, the occasion for constructing a democratic consensus. The ‘marginalization’ of the armed forces from ESMA, Vezzetti claims, in recreating separate, mutually exclusive ghettos for the military and the human-rights militants, forecloses the possibility for a democratic re-encounter, which has to <italic>take place</italic> precisely on the former site of horror; and to ensure the latter (against or over the short-sighted self-interest of victims’ relatives) is the very responsibility of the state: ‘Certainly a State decision must include objectives, which do not emerge from, nor are among the responsibilities of, the groups representing the victims; for example, it must incorporate the new security and armed forces among the addressees of this space.’ The testimonial preservation of ESMA, therefore, must be avoided not just because it excludes or limits the openness of visitor experiences but also, and more importantly, because it reinforces the exclusivity of the victims’ and their relatives’ claim to this space (since it is <italic>their</italic> testimony that is inscribed as uncontestable truth), a space which must instead be ‘recovered’ by the whole of society: ‘The more the idea of the site is affirmed, that is, of the clandestine centre, and of the testimonial function, the more it supports the dominance of those who are in a position of compulsory witnesses: the survivors and, more generally, the victims.’ In contrast, ‘there are many examples in the world of museums and memorials which have revised or amplified their displays’ – one of them being, according to Vezzetti, Berlin’s Wannsee-Villa, where members of the German police, armed forces and prison service are today receiving lectures on human-rights topics. This, he concludes, is an example of ‘changes introduced, which incorporate into the material density of the site and the victims’ viewpoint, the perspectives of what needs to be edified in society and its institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276411423278">Vezzetti, 2006</xref>: 37–42).</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the supposed exemplarity of (West) German museum aesthetics – forged in the context of a society from which, unlike in Argentina, the victims and their viewpoints have remained physically absent almost completely to this day – Vezzetti’s diatribe reveals, first and foremost, the political investedness of every act of memory (something he himself, to be sure, only perceives in those of the opposite faction). If I have referenced his intervention at some length, it is because in its very bluntness it brings to the fore a series of problems that are only implicit in the more cautious proposals submitted by CELS or Buena Memoria. The first of these concerns the so-called ‘inclusiveness’ of a museum designed in order to remain open to multiple kinds of visitor responses: however, as Vezzetti’s very language of ‘imperatives’ and ‘State decisions’ makes only too clear, this inclusiveness only comes about, and is subsequently warranted by, an institutional mandate granted by the State on behalf of a ‘social consensus’ that pre-establishes the limits of this very multiplicity: to join the party, one must first of all accept that others may have contrary opinions and feelings, just as legitimate as my own. Thus, however, we find ourselves once again in the well-trodden space of the museum as civic educator – as a miniature of, as well as a rehearsal space for, the modern rituals of citizenship as simultaneous subjectification/subjection of the self vis-à-vis the at once autonomous and emplotted object. Indeed, the only major difference with respect to the high-modernist museum is the fact that, instead of the <italic>Erbauung</italic>, or ‘edification’, of the citizen in the face of the virtuous artwork or instructive cultural sample, subject-production now proceeds in a guided sequence of traumatization and debriefing. Secondly, and more importantly, in defining values such as democracy and tolerance as the goal towards which visitor performance, however open and multiple, must nonetheless strive, the museum encounter turns here into a pedagogy of de-identification with the victims’ historical struggles (those of the militant left of the 1960s and 1970s).</p>
<p>In this particular civics lesson, the <italic>Nunca más</italic> (never again), rather than being a promise or desired effect of visitor experience, morphs into its very precondition: we all have to renounce violence as a political means to an end, in order to appreciate ESMA’s object lesson. But thus, an irrecoverable distance becomes the precondition of the museum encounter as, indeed, there cannot be any ‘repetition’ when what is remembered in the memorial museum is an ‘atrocity’ that occurred in an irretrievable <italic>before</italic> of the consensus allowing for its commemoration. For it to be commemorable, the violence of the past has to take on the form of the ‘atrocious’, of a misguided and ultimately incomprehensible outburst of evil rooted in mysterious antagonisms and passions that have now fortunately gone for good. Because commemoration – that is, the ritual revisiting of the site of horror within the rules laid down by the ‘democratic consensus’ – already pre-assumes the pastness of the atrocious, laid to rest in the very narrative that commemorates it. What, in this view, must be evicted from the site of horror, precisely in order to preclude it from claiming this site for itself alone, is however not the memory of the assassins (which have recently re-grouped into an NGO of ‘relatives of members of the armed forces’ and created a routine of interrupting legal processes by pot-banging, offending and menacing witnesses and judges). Rather, the principal target of Vezzetti’s attacks is the ‘partisan’ memory of victims and their relatives, one that refuses to acknowledge the pastness of the traumatic events as a precondition for their commemoration, holding fast instead to an old-fashioned, outdated notion of memory which, by over-identifying and failing to allow for the distance required for ‘reflexive’ museum-going, re-incarnates in the present the struggles of the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276411423278"><title>Towards a Geography of the Atrocious?</title>
<p>Of course, the opposite option of a militant memory, either in the form of a testimonial sacralization tied to notions of evidence and authenticity endowed with ontological status, or as performative re-stagings of a political legacy that must not be ‘museumized’ in order to uphold its ongoing validity (thus also turning a blind eye to, and forsaking the opportunity for critical reflection on, the revolutionary Left’s historical defeat), is at least as problematic as the ‘memorial museum’ option. Yet the difficulty remains that, although not necessarily in the form of a state-enforced consensus (the definition of which, according to Vezzetti, would have to be entrusted to academic experts conversant with international debates on memory and trauma, rather than to those still too much immersed in its after-effects), the museal option too readily presupposes ESMA’s inscription in a post-traumatic temporality supposedly shared today by vastly different localities across the globe. Indeed, the aforementioned International Coalition of Historic Site Museums – including, apart from Argentina’s Memoria Abierta coalition, sites such as South Africa’s District Six Museum, the Terezin Memorial in the Czech Republic, the Gulag Museum at Perm-36, Russia, or the Maison des Esclaves, Senegal – represents a clear attempt on behalf of museums themselves to claim a generic commonality of purpose beyond the diversity of political and historical experiences commemorated at these sites. In Latin America itself, a regional Network of Sites of Conscience (Red Latinoamericana de Sitios de Conciencia), now including more than 20 organizations and site museums from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay, has been organizing seminars, encounters and training workshops since 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0263276411423278">21</xref></sup> Yet, while aimed at perforating neoliberal globalization’s geography of amnesia, the Coalition and the notions of ‘atrocity’ or ‘crimes of lese humanity’ that constitute its common ground are at the same time profoundly, and perhaps inescapably, bound up with the former. As Andreas Huyssen has argued, contemporary obsession with the museum as a host of memory responds to an anxiety of spatio-temporal dislocation against which, paradoxically, trauma’s temporality of compulsory returns becomes a kind of cure, of ‘temporal anchoring when in the wake of the information revolution, the relationship between past, present, and future is being transformed’ (1995: 7).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Huyssen has a point here; yet the opposite may also, and simultaneously, be true. In other words, all the while promising to preserve our bonds with a past that appears to be retreating from us at a dangerous pace, the memorial museum also reassures us of its irretrievable pastness, of its belonging to an ‘age of atrocity’ that is now safely locked away in the temporality of the object or of the site (a place marked out and set apart in our own space in order to contain and ward off this ‘other time’). Rather tellingly, Williams in his study of memorial museums (published in 2007) speculates on the relation between the ‘rise of memorialization’ and its ‘backdrop of <italic>decreasing</italic> international conflict’, indeed of a planetary ‘transition to democracy’ (2007: 164). This implication of a morally and politically secure vantage point, it seems to me, is in fact one of the memorial museum’s most problematic ideological effects, deliberate or not: the way in which certain values of tolerance, inclusiveness and democracy are associated with the global present of market globalization as the precondition and horizon of memorial representation dismisses (as intolerant and non-inclusive) those memory practices that continue to identify with the victims’ very different political agendas, re-asserting these precisely at the site of their projected erasure and seeking to turn this imaginative and performatic identification into a practice of ongoing struggle against capitalism and its effects. As a matter of fact, I would argue, the excludent character the discourse of inclusiveness can take on at the memorial museum points to a certain dilemma inherent in the museum form itself, its historical legacy and function as a disciplinary apparatus historically associated with the enforcement of the present status quo as the indisputable vantage point and destination of the history-lesson unfolding in its walkway through time. It may be, therefore, that the difficulty to agree on (at ESMA and other ‘places of trauma’) an adequate form of display, museal or otherwise, indicates, on the one hand, that we are not at all at bay from an ‘atrociousness’ safely confined to the opposite end of the museal viewing relation. On the other hand, this difficulty might entail that only as a form of its own critique (its critique as a device of exposure and excision) does the museum today have a role to play in the ‘recovery’ of modernity’s places of terror as systematic, state-induced mass murder. In this sense, at least, the provisional and contradictory state of ESMA today might constitute a chance as much as a challenge.</p>

<fn id="fn15-0263276411423278"><p>The term <italic>escrache</italic>, which H.I.J.O.S. use to describe these performances that also involve the signposting of perpetrators’ homes and of sites of terror in the neighbourhood, as well as consciousness-raising interaction with residents prior to the central parade, comes from the underworld argot of the early 20th-century <italic>lunfardo</italic>, meaning ‘police mugshot’ (<italic>escrachar</italic>, by implication, meaning to be portrayed, identified, pinned down). Following its adoption by mainstream and rightwing media for all kinds of ‘spontaneous’ manifestations of discontent – including those by neighbourhood vigilante associations against street prostitution or by relatives of collaborators of the dictatorship accused of crimes of lese humanity – H.I.J.O.S. has recently decided to abandon the practice.

<fn id="fn16-0263276411423278"><p>I lack the space here to expound on the specifically <italic>pedagogical</italic> character of state terrorism in the Argentine Proceso de Reorganización Nacional (as well as cognate processes in neighbouring countries such as Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil), and the ways in which the very methodology of its infliction was intrinsically linked to a messianic project of <italic>remaking national society at the level of the subject</italic>, so as to terminally foreclose any form of resistance to the neoliberal socio-economic redistribution that was simultaneously implemented.

<fn id="fn17-0263276411423278"><p>In response to a previous version of this paper, Kaufman writes: ‘That article on ESMA for <italic>Página</italic> isn’t something I would fully agree with from a philosophical point of view but rather something which needed to be said HERE, because of what was going to happen, and is happening now, at ESMA. ... Nowadays, if you haven’t got anything to do one afternoon, you can go to ESMA for some kind of “cultural activity”. It’s unbelievable that this is happening, and that all these people with whom one had supposedly been engaging in debate (although this may have been an illusion) can’t see what they’re doing. ... The other day I was at a meeting, where the director [of the Centro Cultural Haroldo Conti] and Eduardo Luis Duhalde [the Federal Secretary for Human Rights] were present as well. It was a meeting at the university about creating a curriculum in human rights (which seemed a very good idea to me for various reasons). Suddenly Duhalde said that the officer’s casino at ESMA would become a National Historic Monument. I was so struck that I couldn’t help asking him to repeat what he had just said, whereupon he asked me if I had any problems with that. And I said, emphatically, YES, it seemed VERY problematic to me to include ESMA in the catalogue of national historic monuments alongside the Casa de Tucumán [site of the first constitutional congress after independence from Spain]. In the same series. He just shrugged. A path of absolute danger opens up here’ (personal correspondence with the author).</p></fn>
