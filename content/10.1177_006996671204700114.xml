<p><italic>Whistling in the Dark</italic> comes as a refreshing book with a refreshing look at the queer community the world over, with particular reference to India. The book is a product of the engagement with an academic reading group with a queer community. The lives that are captured in the book cover a whole cross-section of people ranging from university professors, school teachers to working class men. The voices that speak out focus on a range of issues, such as, marriage, sexual identity, gay marriage and heteronormativity.</p>
<p>This review focuses on three issues—firstly, the style of the book itself, the content and formulation; secondly, the relationship between the social-cultural-structural environment of the interviewees with the interviewee; and lastly, its reflection of and its interconnection with the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgendered (LGBT) movement in India.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, the book brings together a set of interviews with people from the queer community. The book is both bold and powerful, in the way in which it captures people’s lives, their understanding of gender and sexuality, and of the law and identity. Its publication brings out in the open the private lives, ideas, perceptions, phobias, joys and sorrows of ordinary people, making the community in different parts of the world. Although the interviews are in-depth and insightful, they tend to leave the reader wanting to know just a bit more. Nevertheless, that these interviews were done prior to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India in 2010 makes them all the more brave.</p>
<p>The use of the word ‘Queer’ in the title is rather curious for the book focuses primarily on interviews with gay men from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds with the exception of one lesbian woman from Spain and a complete absence of the transgendered community. Interestingly, it reflects the larger societal representation wherein gay men present the face of the queer community.</p>
<p>Secondly, the book brings out the voices of these individuals in their understanding of notions of masculinity, manhood, desire, politics, phobias, reflecting on the larger socio-cultural-structural environment to which they belong. In doing this, the book demystifies a certain image of the community, making ordinary faceless people real. The interviews highlight the expectations of gender performance resounding in patriarchal ideas of procreation, control over women’s sexuality, marriage with a woman, infidelity and religion.</p>
<p>The book is valuable for it shifts the gaze and voice to within the marginalised community, to the faceless masses that make the large number of LGBTIKQH (Lesbians-Gays-Bisexuals-Transgender-Intersex-Kothi-Queer-Hijara) people of the country and the world.</p>
