<p>When was the last time you assessed creativity’s place in your music curriculum? When was the last time you wondered how new music technologies might help your students be more creative with music? In <italic>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity</italic> (Oxford University Press, 2011), Scott Watson encourages readers to consider these questions. His book is brimming with information, pedagogical approaches, overviews of music software and hardware, and ready-to-implement lesson plans demonstrating how to make the connections between music technology and musical creativity. In this issue’s music technology column, I will summarize the book’s approach and content under the following two headings: (a) Clarity to Complexities and (b) Current, Annotated Content.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311434639">
<title>Clarity to Complexities</title>
<p>Perhaps the single greatest barrier to using music technology is the complexity of selecting, installing, connecting, and gaining sufficient proficiency in using a particular technology as a classroom tool. Teaching music is different than teaching music technology, and music educators, rightly, want to use music technology as a tool to teach music. In <italic>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity (UTUMC)</italic>, Watson brings clarity to many of these complexities and, moreover, he offers a pedagogical approach to empowering students to be musically creative with technology. The volume is divided into two sections. Part I presents the philosophical and pedagogical underpinnings that inform Watson’s approach whereas Part II provides 29 detailed, ready-to-use lesson plans.</p>
<sec id="section2-1048371311434639">
<title>Part I: Theory</title>
<p>Following the two introductory chapters—in Chapter 1 Watson puts forward his “Eight Principles for Unlocking Musical Creativity” and relates these eight principles to the <italic>MENC National Standards for Music Education</italic>; in Chapter 2 Watson defines “creativity” and argues convincingly for the value of “Creativity-Based Learning”—the remaining eight chapters in Part I discuss Watson’s eight principles. The eight principles are</p>
<list id="list1-1048371311434639" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Allow students to share themselves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Offer compelling examples to imitate and inspire.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employ parameters and limitations that remove distractions and help students focus.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Foster opportunities for feedback and critique.</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci wrote, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Watson’s eight principles, although simple, are pregnant with pedagogical potential, and “. . . constitute the heart of this book” (p. 6).</p>
<p>Principles 1 and 2 encapsulate what sensitive and experienced music educators know: (a) students enjoy sharing about themselves and (b) quality music intrinsically inspires and teaches. Watson, a composer himself, recognizes the importance of Principle 1—“Allow students to share themselves” —to student motivation. He provides two projects accessible to students of any musical skill level that emphasize this principle. Principle 2—“Offer compelling examples to imitate and inspire”—is the subject of Chapter 4. Recalling his experiences as a band director, Watson believes that listening to others’ examples “. . . helps prepare students for what they will need to do in a project. More important, though, it charges up their imagination” (p. 36). Again, Watson generously shares activities he uses in his own classes.</p>
<p>Principles 3 to 5—the subjects of Chapters 5 to 7, respectively—offer especially germane insights into using music technology to foster creativity. Principle 3—“Employ parameters and limitations that remove distractions and help students focus”—is a crucial concept when working with increasingly sophisticated music software and hardware. “Well-crafted parameters define the task ahead, create a comfort level that helps break the creative ice, and provide the forward momentum many kids need to be productive and creative” (pp. 45-46).</p>
<p>Principle 4—“Remove parameters and limitations that stifle creativity and lead to contrived expression”—is the complement to Principle 3. “It is [with this principle] that technology shines most brightly, particularly for those with little conventional music training, sometimes called ‘nontraditional music students’” (p. 47). Watson fills this chapter with music technology examples and descriptions, well-founded suggestions for avoiding stifling project parameters, as well as a brief but helpful section on implications for learners with special needs.</p>
<p>Principle 5—“Facilitate improvisation”—is examined in Chapter 7. As many educators have discovered, music technology can be a great catalyst for musical improvisation. Watson believes “the attractiveness of the technology itself encourages kids to be creative” (p. 64). Watson addresses the importance of improvisation as a valuable activity and an integral component of the compositional process and offers ideas for using music technology for rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic improvisation. He also notes advantages to using “unconventional instruments” such as Korg’s Kaossilator, the Theremin, and even the QWERTY computer keyboard as means for student improvisation.</p>
<p>Principles 6 to 8 are examined in Chapters 8 to 10, respectively, and constitute the balance of <italic>UTUMC</italic>’s Part I. Chapter 8 illustrates Principle 6: “Engage in coaching interaction.“ Watson considers coaching the most significant “key” to unlocking students’ creativity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The topic of coaching with regard to creative projects is huge. I employ coaching because I really enjoy this particular aspect of creative music teaching. But more important, I find that coaching makes a big difference in the level of student understanding and (as should come as no surprise) the quality of creative output. (p. 71)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Grounded in Watson’s conviction that coaching students is critical to unlocking creativity, Chapter 8 overflows with a variety of coaching approaches, tips for successful coaching, and affirmations of coaching’s importance.</p>
<p>Principle 7—“Foster opportunities for feedback and critique”—is the subject of Chapter 9. Whereas Chapter 8 examined primarily the teacher’s role in providing feedback to students, Chapter 9 focuses on the teacher’s role in assisting other students to offer feedback and criticism to other students. The chapter includes an abundance of insights into creating a safe environment for students’ critique of a project, model questions to prompt discussion, and ways to incorporate technology into the feedback and critique process.</p>
<p>Principle 8—“Employ performance and recital”—concludes the book’s Part I. The recital or performance of student projects is the final experience in the creativity cycle, and one Watson believes is crucial.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are many benefits to employing a recital or performance at the close of a creative activity or project. These include an increase in student motivation and quality of work, receiving acknowledgment, facilitating creator-audience interaction, documenting the work more completely, and artistic closure. (p. 103)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Suggestions for setting the stage for various types of performances and information noting appropriate parameters for use of protected content conclude the chapter.</p>

<title>Part II: Curricular Materials</title>
<p>Having put forward and expounded on his eight principles, Watson offers 29 detailed, classroom-tested lesson plans. Even more helpful, he distributes the lesson plans under five headings:</p>
<list id="list2-1048371311434639" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Creativity With Keyboards</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creativity With Sound Recording Applications</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creativity With Multitrack Music Production Applications</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creativity With Computer Music Notation Applications</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creativity With Instructional Software and Other Music Applications.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the spirit of making this GMT column a “book preview,” and with the kind permission of Scott Watson and Oxford University Press, I am reproducing one lesson plan to offer <italic>General Music Today</italic> readers an example of these quality resources (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371311434639">Figure 1</xref>). I have omitted some instructions from the lesson plan that, absent illustrations in the book or access to the book’s companion website, would be confusing here.</p>

<p>In addition to the 29 lessons plans, Part II of <italic>UTUMC</italic> contains a wealth of commentaries and insights into music software and hardware that will help music educators adapt the lessons to various circumstances. Additional material includes a discussion of three approaches to integrating creative music activities into a music curriculum, an outline for a semester-long class in music production, and a plan for a “meta-project” creating and distributing a Holiday CD.</p>

<title>Current, Annotated Content</title>
<p>The rapid and sometimes radical changes in music technology tend to outdate published materials within a few years. Mindful of this, Watson is careful to note throughout the book that similarly featured software programs can fulfill similar educational functions. At the same time, Watson does not shy away from naming specific music technology resources he has used. These resources include software programs, Internet sites, and other published books. Watson has created a companion website to <italic>UTUMC</italic>, hosted by Oxford, that is free with the purchase of the book. The website includes examples from the book (noted throughout the text with an icon), sound files, and samples of his students’ work.</p>
<p>The three carefully considered appendixes are concise yet encompass the essentials, and are written in a straightforward manner. Appendix 1 defines a Computer Work Station, and offers accurate directions about how to “make the connections.” Appendix 2 describes how digital audio works in general but clear terms. Appendix 3 is a Music Education Technology Glossary and, once again, provides the basics with clear, mostly non-technical definitions. The Selected References lists quality resources for further reading.</p>

<title>Connections Made</title>
<p><italic>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity</italic> is a book of extraordinary value and usefulness to music educators. Dr. Watson—a seasoned music educator who has spent years reflecting on and refining music technology’s use in the classroom to unlock students’ creativity with music—shares with his readers the vital connections between music technology and musical creativity. Best of all, in <italic>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity</italic> Watson teaches us to make those same connections.</p>
