<abstract>
<p>When examining microscopically lymph nodes removed as part of the surgical therapy for thyroid carcinoma, one should be aware of the fact that high endothelial venules, when dilated and near the capsule, can lead to a wrong diagnosis of metastasis. We present a case in which such a situation arose.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 12-year-old girl with a 0.7-cm thyroid nodule underwent a right hemithyroidectomy. The histological sections showed a well-circumscribed but not encapsulated tumor, 0.7 cm in its largest dimension, composed of compact nests of medium-sized cells, with overlapping nuclei with occasional pseudo-inclusions. Psammoma bodies were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912471855">Figure 1</xref>). A diagnosis of the solid variant of papillary carcinoma was made. Three laterocervical lymph nodes were removed and interpreted as negative for metastasis.</p>

<p>Nuclei displayed the features of papillary carcinoma (arrow: pseudo-inclusion). Diameter was &lt;1 cm, placing this tumor into the microcarcinoma category.</p>

<p>A few months later, the case was reviewed in another institute. The primary diagnosis of papillary carcinoma, solid variant, was confirmed. In addition, 1 of the 3 laterocervical lymph nodes was interpreted as containing a micrometastasis. Because of the diagnostic disagreement, the case was sent to a consultant. Review of the 3 lymph nodes showed in one of them a few tubular structures with an appearance highly reminiscent of thyroid follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912471855">Figure 2</xref>). They were lined by a cuboidal epithelium and had a dilated lumen with a proteinaceous content exhibiting a scalloped border, thus reinforcing the morphologic similarity to thyroid follicles.</p>

<p>Tubular structures in the subcapsular area of a lymph node</p>
<p>The lumen is dilated, the lining is cuboidal, and the content is proteinaceous, with a scalloped border (A). Immunohistochemically, thyroglobulin (B) and TTF-1 (C) were negative, whereas CD31 was positive (D).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1066896912471855-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>Immunohistochemically, the cells lining these structures were negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin but positive for CD31. Thus, we identified them as postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEV).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The structures of concern present in this lymph node and prompting a diagnosis of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma by one observer were in fact a small group of dilated HEV, a normal vascular component of the lymph nodes. HEV are usually located in the deep-cortical and para-cortical zone of the node and are present in all secondary lymphoid organs except the spleen. Their highly specialized endothelium participates in recruiting naïve lymphocytes from the circulating blood, through a series of steps of induced molecular expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912471855">1</xref></sup> The subcapsular location, typical of lymph node metastases, together with the proteinaceous content that simulated thyroid colloid contributed to the misinterpretation.</p>
