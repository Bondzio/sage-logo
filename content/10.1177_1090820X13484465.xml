<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 856 consecutive patients who underwent primary augmentation mammaplasty between 1999 and 2009.

<p>The safety of augmentation mammaplasty has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. Specific advancements that have led to lower complication rates include the inframammary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484465">1</xref></sup> and submuscular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484465">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484465">3</xref></sup> approaches and the use of antibiotic irrigation of the breast pocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484465">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484465">5</xref></sup> Capsular contracture (CC) is the most commonly reported complication of augmentation mammaplasty. High rates of CC have been reported in the literature, but these could be due to the wide variety of surgical techniques used and the variability of the inclusion criteria for the patients in these studies (eg, primary augmentation patients combined with breast reconstruction patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13484465">7</xref></sup> Few reports have detailed CC rates in a population composed of purely primary augmentation patients, and those that have are mostly anecdotal. In this study, we report the incidence of and risk factors for CC in a low-risk patient population after primary augmentation.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the charts of 856 patients from a single, 6-surgeon practice in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The study protocol was approved by the Spectrum Health Institutional Review Board. All patients who underwent primary augmentation mammaplasty between January 1999 and January 2009 were reviewed. We collected data only for those patients who underwent primary augmentation mammaplasty with no associated reconstructive, revision, or adjunct rejuvenative procedures.</p>
<p>Data points for this study included demographics, functional outcomes, complications, and revision rate and type. Our discussion of “contracture” within this article refers only to grade III or IV CC as established by the Baker classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13484465">8</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1090820X13484465">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Surgical incisions were made using both inframammary and transaxillary approaches. When applied, the antibiotic rinse was a triple antibiotic (bacitracin, cefazolin, and gentamicin in normal saline), a bacitracin, or a Betadine solution. Incision type was based on both surgeon and patient preference based on preoperative interviews. Irrigation used was based on surgeon preference. Triple antibiotic solution consisted of 500 mL of saline with 50 000 units of bacitracin, 1 g of cefazolin, and 80 mg of gentamicin. Bacitracin solution consisted of 500 mL of saline with 50 000 units of bacitracin. Betadine irrigation consisted of equal parts 10% Betadine and saline. All irrigants were used to rinse the pocket before suctioning and subsequent introduction of the implant.</p>
<p>The surgeon (D.R.A.) utilizing the inframammary incision method was consistent in his technique; the submuscular pocket was dissected under direct vision with a lighted retractor, and monopolar cautery was applied to coagulate perforators and minimize blood loss. The transaxillary approach was utilized by 2 surgeons in the practice, and it consisted of blind technique and blunt dissection with no endoscopic assistance.</p>
<p>A “no-touch” technique was employed when handling all implants. Care was taken to minimize the time period between opening implant packages and insertion. On opening, the implant was immediately rinsed with antibiotic solution (when utilized) to limit exposure to particulate matter. The operating surgeon was the only person to handle the implant. Gloves and instruments were rinsed prior to implant handling. No barrier drapes or nipple-areolar dressings were utilized.</p>

<p>The average age of the patients in our study was 33.5 years (range, 17-68 years). Patient demographics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13484465">Table 1</xref>. One hundred forty-six (18.9%) patients were smokers. None had a history of radiation. Only 5 (0.6%) had their implants placed subglandularly; all other implants (99.4%) were placed submuscularly. Four hundred fifty-seven patients (53%) received silicone gel implants, and 399 patients (47%) received saline implants.</p>

<p>Antibiotic irrigation was used in 42.9% of silicone gel patients and 16% of saline patients. Due to this large disparity, both antibiotic irrigant and implant type were included in multivariate regression analyses. Bacitracin rinse was used to irrigate the breast pocket in 18.5% of patients, triple antibiotic (bacitracin, cefazolin, and gentamicin in normal saline) was used in 11.7% of patients, and Betadine was used in 0.6% of patients. The remainder of patients did not receive antibiotic irrigation of the breast pocket.</p>
<p>The mean follow-up period for all patients was 14.9 months (14.5 months for the silicone gel cohort and 15.1 months for the saline cohort). Complication rates are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13484465">Table 2</xref>. Twenty-four patients (2.8%) had grade III or IV CC. The most common complication was malposition, which occurred in 63 patients (7.4%).</p>

<p>Capsular contracture and reoperation rate comparisons are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13484465">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13484465">2</xref>, respectively. Capsular contracture was significantly associated with antibiotic irrigation use, implant type, and tobacco use. Reoperation rates were significantly associated with antibiotic irrigation use, implant type, and incision choice. We did not find a significant association between CC rate and shell type (textured vs smooth implants; 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .815). We did, however, see a significantly lower rate of reoperation in textured versus smooth devices (8.2% and 13.8%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .032).</p>

<p>Our data were also analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Capsular contracture was the dependent variable, while the independent variables tested included age at time of the operation, body mass index, tobacco use, implant type (silicone gel or saline), shell type (smooth or textured), placement of implant (subglandular or submuscular), incision (transaxillary or inframmamary), and use of antibiotic irrigation. Only 1 of the variables tested in the equation achieved statistical significance, and this was implant type. Saline implants were 7.89 times more likely to lead to grade III to IV CC than silicone gel (<italic>P</italic> = .027; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-49.00). Furthermore, grade III to IV CC was 6.98 times more likely if no antibiotic irrigant was used, but this only approached statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .066; 95% CI, 0.88-55.30). A temporal relationship was found regarding CC and operative date. Eleven of our 24 CC occurred in the first 12 months postoperatively, 3 CC occurred in months 13 to 24, and 3 or fewer per year occurred in subsequent years of follow-up.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its report on complications resulting from the placement of silicone gel breast prostheses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13484465">9</xref></sup> Its findings included a CC rate ranging from 8% to 41%. These data are provided in educational materials given to patients as part of their preoperative augmentation consults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13484465">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13484465">11</xref></sup> The studies used by the IOM for this report were mixed with regard to types of surgical procedures and patients included. Among those studies cited by the IOM was the Inamed Core Study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484465">6</xref></sup> a Food and Drug Administration–sponsored report on the safety and efficacy of Inamed silicone gel implants. Six-year data have been published by Spear et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484465">6</xref></sup> They reported a CC rate of 14.8% in their primary augmentation cohort. Interestingly, this was similar to a 15.9% CC rate for primary reconstruction patients. The investigators postulated that this was due to a higher proportion of patients receiving textured implants and submuscular implant placement in the reconstruction group. Furthermore, in these trials, periareolar incision was utilized much more frequently among the primary augmentation and revision augmentation cohorts than among the reconstruction groups. This could have led to lower rates of CC in the reconstruction group and a potentiation of CC in the augmentation group.</p>
<p>The Mentor Core Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13484465">7</xref></sup> had similar aims of proving silicone gel implants safe and efficacious. The authors quoted similarly high but more differentiated CC rates for primary augmentation and primary reconstruction (9.8% and 13.7%, respectively). The study did not stratify results by implant type, implant position, surgical approach, or use of antibiotic irrigant.</p>
<p>A large sample of augmentation patients was studied by Handel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13484465">12</xref></sup> They found significant (grade III-IV) CC in 7.4% of augmentation and augmentation-mastopexy patients at a mean follow-up of 29.1 months. The investigators found no long-term benefit of a textured implant surface in preventing CC, as opposed to other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13484465">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13484465"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13484465">15</xref></sup> Also, Handel et al found no difference in subpectoral implant placement, while many other authors reported the opposite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484465">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484465">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13484465">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13484465"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13484465"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13484465">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Handel study included a significant proportion of patients who received polyurethane-coated implants, which have since fallen out of favor due to toluenediamine breakdown products.</p>
<p>The wide variability in CC occurrence found in previously published studies does not necessarily reflect the complication profile of primary augmentation patients within a single cosmetic surgery practice. In the past decade, antibiotic irrigation of the breast pocket as well as the breast prosthesis has emerged as a way to decrease CC complications. In 2007, Wiener<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484465">4</xref></sup> described his use of intraoperative Betadine irrigation in primary breast augmentation patients. He reported a grade II to IV CC rate of 2.2% over a 14-month mean follow-up period. Adams et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484465">5</xref></sup> performed a prospective study of CC rates in 335 patients using triple antibiotic irrigation. They achieved a CC rate of 1.8% in primary augmentation patients, also over a 14-month mean follow-up period. In addition, they noted that most cases of CC occurred within 1 year.</p>
<p>In an effort to further minimize CC, Wiener<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484465">1</xref></sup> studied the effect of inframammary incision. Theoretically, this method prevents bacterial seeding by the breast ducts that may occur with the periareolar approach. In a cohort of 338 patients who underwent augmentation with an inframammary incision and Betadine irrigation, he attained a CC rate of 0.59% over an 8.1-month mean follow-up period. Furthermore, Wiener demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the CC rate in patients who underwent periareolar augmentation (9.5%).</p>
<p>Submuscular placement has also been proposed to lower CC rates, theoretically due to the enhanced blood supply of the surrounding pectoralis major preventing infection, as well as the flexibility of the pocket preventing a scarred down capsule. Vazquez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484465">3</xref></sup> presented 89 patients who underwent augmentation with either submuscular or subglandular implant placement. They reported a CC rate of 9.4% with submuscular and 58.0% with subglandular placement. Henriksen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484465">2</xref></sup> also documented improved CC rates with the submuscular approach over a 19.5-month mean follow-up period, with data showing an increased risk of CC when not using the inframammary approach. Many other authors have reported similar findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13484465">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13484465"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13484465"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13484465"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13484465">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fewer investigators have studied the rates of CC after transaxillary augmentation. Huang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13484465">21</xref></sup> reported a per-patient CC rate of 1.9%, with 0.6% in saline augmentation and 2.9% in silicone gel augmentation. Jacobson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13484465">22</xref></sup> reported a “clinically significant” CC rate of 6.4% with the transaxillary approach, 2.4% with the periareolar approach, and 0.5% with the inframammary approach. Some of these cases were Baker grade II contractures. Our overall rate of grade III to IV CC with the transaxillary approach was 3.5%.</p>
<p>We did not observe an increase in CC as duration of follow-up increased. In fact, we saw 11 of our 24 cases of CC in the first 12 months postoperatively and 3 in months 13 to 24, but just 3 or fewer diagnoses of CC per year in subsequent years of follow-up. Our data compare favorably with recent literature reporting improved rates of CC in primary augmentation patients, who now have a lower rate of CC than reported in the original implant core studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13484465">7</xref></sup> Our overall CC rate was 2.8% over a mean follow-up of 14.9 months, pointing to the benefits of submuscular implant placement and an inframammary incision, which were the most common techniques in our retrospective series. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Wiener<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484465">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484465">4</xref></sup> and Adams et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484465">5</xref></sup> antibiotic irrigation decreases the rate of CC, which was confirmed in our cohort by a decrease from 3.9% to 0.4%.</p>
<p>Possible limitations to our study include its retrospective nature, as well as the length of our follow-up period, which, ideally, would have been a mean of 2 years. We recognize that patients are commonly lost prior to follow-up and that, consequently, they may have presented to surgeons outside of this practice for evaluation and treatment of their CC. In addition, data were not available regarding volume of saline implants or their status regarding overfill. These data would have been helpful in determining potential causes of the higher CC rate in the saline group.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on our findings, it is apparent that the early CC rate in primary augmentation can be less than 1%. Furthermore, our findings suggest that use of an inframmamary approach, submuscular implant placement, and antibiotic irrigation of the breast pocket can reduce CC rates. We believe that the results of our study allow us to more accurately educate our patients on the risks of their primary augmentation procedures.</p>
