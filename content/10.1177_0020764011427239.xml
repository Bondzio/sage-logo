          <title>Method:</title>
          <p>Patients and their informal caregivers were recruited from nine Swedish psychiatric
            outpatient centres. Subjective burden was assessed at inclusion using the CarerQoL and
            COPE index scales. The objective burden (time and money spent) was assessed by the
            caregivers daily using diaries over four weeks and by recall at the end of weeks 1 and
            2.</p>

          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>One-hundred and seven patients (53% females; mean age 43 ± 11) and 118 informal
            caregivers (67%; 58 ± 15 years) were recruited. Informal caregivers spent 22.5
            hours/week and about 14% of their gross income on care-related activities. The time
            spent was underestimated by two to 20 hours when assessed by recall than by daily diary
            records. The most prominent aspects of the subjective burden were mental problems.</p>

          <title>Conclusion:</title>
          <p>Despite a substantial amount of time and money spent on care giving, the informal
            caregivers perceived the mental aspects of burden as the most troublesome. The informal
            caregiver burden is considerable and should be taken into account when evaluating
            effects of health care provided to patients with psychoses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In many western countries, psychiatric asylums have closed down and the number of hospital
        beds has gradually been reduced with the intention of integrating patients with psychoses
        into society. In Stockholm, Sweden, for example, there has been a 35% decrease in the number
        of hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia between 1993 and 1999 and the
        number of treatment days per patient has been reduced by 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011427239">Dalman &amp; Wicks, 2000</xref>). This deinstitutionalization
        has led to an increased burden for the patients’ closest relatives in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011427239">Honkonen, Saarinen, &amp; Salokangas,
          1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011427239">Nordentoft et al.,
          2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764011427239">Rantanen et al.,
          2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011427239">Ryu et al.,
        2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Following the in- to outpatient shift, the importance of family psychosocial interventions
        has been evidenced worldwide, indicating that informal care is important for the overall
        outcome of patients with psychosis. There is, however, a lack of studies of the size of
        burden associated with informal care giving in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011427239">Dixon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011427239">Pharoah, Mari, Rathbone, &amp; Wong, 2010</xref>).
        Functional and social impairment, together with unpredictable and sometimes risky or hostile
        behaviour, goes beyond that of most chronic disorders and strains the families of the
        patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427239">Ochoa et al., 2008</xref>).
        Yet the family burden of schizophrenia, its social and mental consequences and its specific
        features are still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad
          &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In most cases, informal care giving is based on a pre-existing personal relationship
        between the caregiver and the patient and no payment is offered for the time and money spent
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011427239">van den Berg, Brouwer, &amp;
          Koopmanschap, 2004</xref>). Informal care giving can be split up into two components: the
        subjective and the objective burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011427239">Hoenig &amp; Hamilton, 1966</xref>). The objective burden includes the effects of care on
        the caregiver’s health status, finances and the time devoted to care, whereas the subjective
        burden deals with how the informal caregiver perceives the burden of care. The latter may be
        further split into positive and negative experiences of care giving. Both these aspects are
        important to assess to get a broad picture of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011427239">Andren &amp; Elmstahl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011427239">Balducci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011427239">Schwartz &amp; Gidron, 2002</xref>). The subjective burden
        of informal care giving has been documented in many papers but there is a lack of studies of
        the objective burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp;
          Voruganti, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The methods for exploring informal care giving in psychotic disorders vary widely between
        studies, rendering comparisons difficult. As for the subjective burden, there is a lack of
        consistency between studies in the choice of scales. In a review of scales used to measure
        the subjective burden of informal care in mental illness it was found that 26 had acceptable
        psychometric properties but greater consistency between studies was warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011427239">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>). Scales
        measuring salutogenic factors such as stress-coping abilities may be used to measure the
        effects of interventions that promote informal caregivers’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011427239">Szmukler et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>As for the objective burden, it is often merged into the category ‘indirect costs’,
        reducing the possibility for further exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>). The money spent on
        informal care giving is relatively unproblematic to accurately assess. The time spent,
        however, is most often based on recall, which may yield unstable results as indicated by the
        wide variation between studies; in a European study it was estimated that family members
        spent six to nine hours per day on informal care giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011427239">Magliano et al., 1998</xref>), whereas in an American study
        the corresponding figure was about two to three hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011427239">Franks, Muennig, Lubetkin, &amp; Jia, 2006</xref>). This
        disparity is probably attributable to methodological differences. A diary method with a
        prospective assessment of time and money spent for care giving has been found to provide
        more reliable results compared to a retrospective recall method in a heterogeneous sample of
        disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764011427239">van den Berg &amp; Spauwen,
          2006</xref>). Yet, the objective care-giving burden assessed with a retrospective recall
        method compared to a prospective daily diary method has so far not been methodologically
        evaluated in patients with psychoses.</p>
      <p>The main aims of the study were to describe and quantify both the objective and subjective
        burden of the informal care giving to patients with psychotic disorders. A secondary aim was
        to compare a recall method with a diary method for the assessment of the objective
        burden.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>Patients above the age of 18, suffering or having suffered from a psychotic episode and
          being in need of continuous long-term antipsychotic medication for functional sychoses
          were considered for the study. Patients having the following diagnoses/symptoms could be
          included: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, brief
          psychotic disorder, delusional disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified.
          The diagnoses were assessed from the medical records and confirmed by the psychiatrist
          responsible for the patient. To be considered for inclusion the patient also had to have
          at least one informal caregiver. Major exclusion criteria for both patients and informal
          caregivers were a diagnosis of dementia or significant cognitive impairment making the
          self-assessments unreliable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section9-0020764011427239">
        <title>Recruitment procedures</title>
        <p>After the recruitment of around a third of the patients, the procedure was changed from
          consecutive recruitment when patients had an appointment at the respective clinic to a
          screening method of listed patients in the respective outpatient clinic. This change was
          motivated by a low recruitment rate and by the aim of including a wider range of patients,
          both the frequent visitors and those who visited the clinics less often. As soon as the
          patient consented to participate and agreed that his/her closest informal caregiver(s)
          could be contacted, a letter was sent by post or contact was made by phone or in person.
          The most relevant informal caregiver(s), up to two, was/were then invited together with
          the patient to the psychiatric clinic for further study information by the study
          coordinator and psychiatrist involved in the study. The original study, as well as the
          change in recruitment procedure, was approved by the ethics committee at Karolinska
          Institutet, Stockholm (Diary number: 2007/1623-31).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section10-0020764011427239">
        <title>Study design and study assessments</title>
        <p>At the first study visit, assessments were made of the subjective burden,
          socio-demographic data and patient characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011427239">Table 1</xref>). The informal caregivers were then given a
          computer (or paper) diary for daily assessments of the objective burden during the
          following four-week period. The time spent was assessed during the first two weeks and
          expenses were measured during the whole period. At the end each of the weeks (1–4) the
          informal caregiver was asked to estimate the time spent during the previous week in care
          giving. The informal caregivers were instructed to account only for time and money spent
          as a result of the care recipient’s illness. At the end of the follow-up period the
          informal caregivers were asked to recall any major expenses during the preceding 11 months
          before the study started. The treatment given to the patients was unchanged throughout the
          study.</p>

        <title>Instruments used in the study</title>
        <p>The subjective burden was assessed by the CarerQoL and the COPE index. Both these
          instruments measure the positive and the negative dimensions of the care giving, whereas
          only the CarerQoL provides a measure of the overall situation: the CarerQoL-VAS. The COPE
          index provides, in addition, an assessment of how the informal caregiver perceives the
          support received. The Work Productivity and Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) assesses the
          effect on the informal caregivers’ work, productivity and regular daily activities.
          Functional and symptomatic characteristics of the patients were assessed with the
          eight-item PANSS remission scale using the Structured Clinical Interview for Symptoms of
          Remission (SCI-SR). Global functioning was assessed by the Global Assessment of
          Functioning Scale (GAF). Health status of the informal caregivers was assessed by the
          EQ-5D (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011427239">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>One-hundred and seven patients (53% females; mean age 43 ± 11 years) and 118 informal
        caregivers (67%; 58 ± 15 years) were recruited from nine psychiatric outpatient care centres
        in Sweden covering both urban and rural areas. Eighty-one patients had a diagnosis of
        schizophrenia (76%) and the rest had other forms of psychotic disorders (<italic>n</italic>
        = 26; 24%).</p>

        <title>Caregiver and patient general and socioeconomic characteristics</title>
        <p>More than two-thirds of the patients lived either together with the informal caregivers
          in the same household (25%) or so close that they were within a travelling time of 30
          minutes by bus, car or train (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764011427239">Table
            2</xref>). For the patients, the majority of their income came mainly from a pension or
          other public transfers, whereas 53% ofthe caregivers relied on paid jobs and 38% on
          pension as their main income. Income from all sources were added, giving a mean of €2153
          for the caregivers and €1205 for the patients. The medians were €1797 and €1282,
          respectively.</p>

        <p>When using the CarerQoL-7D, around 54% of the informal caregivers reported some or a lot
          of problems with their own mental health and over 50% reported relational problems with
          the care recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020764011427239">Figure 2</xref>).
          Around a third of caregivers felt that they did not receive any support in their roles.
          More than 90% reported that they, to some extent, felt fulfilment in their care tasks.</p>

        <p>CarerQoL-VAS, a summary measure of the subjective burden encompassing both the positive
          and negative aspects, resulted, on the 1–10 VAS, in a mean score of 6.8 (SD = 1.95).
          Females experienced a higher subjective burden than men (<italic>M</italic>: 6.5 ± 2.0 vs.
          7.3 ± 1.8). Results from the different subscales of the COPE index show that 8.6% of the
          informal caregivers had a score of 16 or more on the negative impact subscale, and on the
          positive impact subscale 9.5% had a score of 11 or less. About half of the informal
          caregivers reported at least moderate health problems measured by the EQ-5D for the
          domains pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. There was a significant gender difference
          in perceived mental problems. Female informal caregivers experienced more
          anxiety/depression than men (<italic>p</italic> = .0008) and also more problems concerning
          their economic situation (<italic>p</italic> = .02036).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Informal caregivers spent about one half of a full-time working week (40 hours in Sweden)
        in care-related activities as a consequence of the care recipient’s disorder. Around half of
        these were used to assist the patient with practical tasks like household work. The other
        half was reported as ‘stand-by time’ – a care-giving situation that may be specific to
        psychotic disorders compared to, for instance, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011427239">Max, Webber, &amp; Fox, 1995</xref>). In
        addition to the actual time spent on care giving, the informal caregivers experienced
        reduced productivity when at work corresponding to a fifth of a full-time working week.</p>
      <p>The expenses for informal care giving amounted to an average of €293 per month per informal
        caregiver, corresponding to 14% of their gross total income. To put this figure into
        perspective the informal caregivers’ and the care recipients’ mean income was €2153 and
        €1205, respectively, which is below the mean 2008 gross income of an average Swedish working
        citizen – €2228 per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011427239">Statistics
          Sweden, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The rate of remission (36%) and mean GAF scores (about 50) corresponds with previous
        findings of remission rates and GAF values in chronic psychosis. Furthermore, the share of
        patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in outpatient wards for patients with psychotic
        disorders is similar to that of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011427239">Gaite et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011427239">Placentino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764011427239">van Os et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the present sample seems
        to be representative of the population investigated.</p>
      <p>The formal care differed substantially from the above-described amount of informal care; a
        meeting twice a month with a nurse or a contact person, or seeing a doctor four times per
        year is probably insufficient to meet the needs of the patients and their families.
        Antipsychotic medication has enabled discharge of patients from mental hospitals but
        negative and cognitive symptoms, mainly responsible for the functional decline, often remain
        largely unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011427239">Leucht et al.,
          2009</xref>). In most countries, the implementation of evidence-based psychosocial
        interventions has not accompanied the shift from in- to outpatient care, probably resulting
        in increased family burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011427239">Dixon et
          al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011427239">Lehman &amp;
          Steinwachs, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>There was a great difference in the valuation of time spent between the recall and the
        diary method, especially regarding the ‘stand-by time’. The informal caregivers
        underestimated the time when it was recalled compared to the daily diary method. This
        underestimation may be attributable to an adjustment to these long-term conditions as a
        normal routine. The fact that informal caregivers above the age of 64 underestimated the
        time to a significantly greater extent than those under 64 lends some credence to that
        interpretation. In a Swedish study of informal care giving to patients with reduced health,
        it was found that informal caregivers who were retired spent more hours on care giving than
        those who were still working. However, these retired ‘frequent caregivers’ had a
        significantly lower quality of life compared to the non-frequent caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011427239">Borg &amp; Hallberg, 2006</xref>). Thus,
        informal caregivers who have reached the age of retirement may pay less attention to the
        time spent on care giving and they may also have reached an acceptance and adjustment of
        their life situation, but this may be at the expense of their own psychological
        well-being.</p>
      <p>Female informal caregivers underestimated the time spent on care giving to a greater extent
        than men. They also reported higher subjective burden and more anxiety and depressive
        symptoms, a finding in accordance with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>). The results regarding
        both retired and female informal caregivers indicate that underestimating the time spent on
        care giving may constitute a risk factor for reduced psychological well-being. Since
        psychological distress was perceived as more troublesome than the objective burden,
        underestimation of time spent on care giving and its relationships with gender, age and
        psychological well-being should be given more attention in future research.</p>
      <p>There are no previous studies comparing the diary and recall methods in psychoses but the
        diary method has been considered the golden standard in studies of informal care giving of
        other disorders, rendering credibility to the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011427239">Carton, Loos, Pacolet, Versieck, &amp; Vlietinck,
        2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764011427239">van den Berg et al.,
          2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Measurement of the subjective burden of care giving (CarerQol-7D) showed that the
        caregivers suffered from mental health problems and had relational problems. Female
        caregivers experienced higher subjective burden, in accordance with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>). The
        mental problems were perceived as more troublesome than the financial, which is somewhat
        surprising given the considerable amount of time and money spent. This indicates that
        adaptation to the situation may be pronounced, as also discussed above.</p>
      <p>The study did not include a comparison group but, since the COPE index scale has been used
        in another study, a comparison was attempted. The Swedish subgroup (<italic>n</italic> =
        1000) of informal caregivers to older patients in a European multi-centre study, the
        EuroFamCare study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011427239">Lamura et al.,
          2006</xref>), experienced more support from others than the present caregivers.
        Furthermore, when compared to a representative sample (<italic>n</italic> = 4950) from the
        Stockholm County, the present informal caregivers experienced more pain, discomfort, anxiety
        and depression measured by the EQ-5D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011427239">Burstrom, Johannesson, &amp; Diderichsen, 2001</xref>). This indicates that caregivers to
        patients with psychotic disorders have more mental health problems due to their care-giving
        situation and that they receive insufficient support from others.</p>
      <p>A wide range of literature exists of informal caregiver burden in other medical conditions,
        but there are limited reports on psychotic disorders. Few studies of the total cost of
        psychotic disorders have included family costs and, for those that have, there is a lack of
        direct measurement of itemized family costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>). A couple of studies have
        attempted to estimate the costs, the former using questionnaires and the latter a ‘top-down’
        approach, but methodological problems have restricted their accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011427239">Davies &amp; Drummond, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011427239">Guest &amp; Cookson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011427239">Lauber, Keller, Eichenberger, &amp; Rossler, 2005</xref>).
        Thus, although interventions that require time and engagement from the informal caregivers
        are recommended in most guidelines, little is known about the caregivers’ ability to carry
        out such tasks. Political decisions concerning resource allocations to meet the needs of
        these patients should therefore take into account both formal and informal care, especially
        since cooperation with informal caregivers is crucial for a favourable prognosis.</p>
      <p>The results of the present study raise questions about those patients without informal
        caregivers. There is evidence that patients receive more informal than formal care and
        therefore patients without the support of a family are likely to need more formal care
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011427239">Ochoa et al., 2003</xref>).
        Suggestions for future research are therefore differences in health care consumption between
        patients with and without access to informal care. Furthermore, the main determinants of the
        objective and subjective informal care burden and effects of treatment interventions on
        family burden are also suggested areas for research. A Danish study reported positive
        effects on family burden by integrated treatment strategies for first-episode psychoses, but
        there is a lack of studies for those with chronic psychoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011427239">Jeppesen et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>To sum up, the informal care-related costs of psychoses has previously not been accurately
        studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427239">Awad &amp; Voruganti,
          2008</xref>). Thus, there is currently very little reliable knowledge regarding the
        economic and societal consequences of psychotic disorders for families; a surprising fact
        since interventions involving the family are considered prerequisites for a favourable
        outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011427239">Pharoah et al., 2010</xref>).
        The lack of accuracy of previous methods may be one reason that politicians and decision
        makers do not show enough interest in the costs of informal care giving in psychotic
        disorders.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The present study combines a prospective and recall method enabling a comparison that sheds
        light on important methodological issues. With its bottom-up approach with time and money
        spent and all the expenditures itemized by a diary method, our study is unique among
        research on psychotic disorders. The burden of informal care is considerable and its
        contribution to the care and support of patients with psychotic disorders should be taken
        into account in health care planning and allocation of resources. Female informal caregivers
        perceived a higher subjective burden and they also underestimated the time spent on care
        giving, as did retired caregivers. These gender and age-related risk factors for
        psychological distress should be further studied and also addressed in clinical practice.
        The prospective assessment of costs and time spent on informal care giving should be made
        standard in future studies of the objective burden of care.</p>
