<abstract>
<p>I examine the effect of job insecurity and job degradation on the sense of personal control. Analyses of two waves of panel observations from a national survey of American workers reveal that prolonged job insecurity is associated with reduced personal control—and this effect increases with age. I also examine whether insecurity is associated with deteriorating job quality and whether degradation reduces personal control. Recent insecurity is associated with increased job pressures, while prolonged insecurity is associated with decreased decision-making latitude. I find no evidence, however, that changes in job quality explain the relationship between job insecurity and personal control.</p>

<p>The sense of personal control is the generalized belief that one has control over meaningful events and circumstances in their life. It is considered an important psychological disposition that is associated with good psychological and physical well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481031">Wheaton, 1983</xref>). While a subjective appraisal, the sense of control is nevertheless a learned expectation, and one that is shaped by patterned social-structural experiences over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888413481031">Ross &amp; Sastry, 1999</xref>). As such, it is considered a key mediating link through which social conditions influence mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0730888413481031">Seeman, 1959</xref>). In this article I consider how the social organization of work—specifically the organization of insecure work—shapes the sense of control and how this process operates uniquely across age, a key social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0730888413481031">Pearlin, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars have long demonstrated how job conditions, such as autonomous, interesting and self-directed work, influence feelings of mastery and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481031">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0730888413481031">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888413481031">Schieman &amp; Plickert, 2008</xref>). However, with economic and organizational restructuring contributing to the proliferation of insecure and precarious work arrangements in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481031">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>), uncertainty over one’s continuing employment represents a particularly important and contemporary work experience that may influence the sense of control. The proportion of American workers who perceive their jobs as insecure has risen steadily since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0730888413481031">Fullerton &amp; Wallace, 2007</xref>), and with the recent “Great Recession,” job insecurity has become an issue attracting widespread interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0730888413481031">Madrick, 2012</xref>). Since employment serves as a key source of economic livelihood, as well as identity, it seems plausible that the threat of job loss, and the uncertainty surrounding the event, could constitute a chronic stressor that challenges beliefs about personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481031">Sverke &amp; Hellgren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481031">Wheaton, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>While insecure employment may directly influence beliefs about personal control, it may also do so as part of a broader process involving deteriorating job quality. Some researchers have argued that the loss of desirable job conditions represents an overlooked dimension of job insecurity and suggest the importance of distinguishing between <italic>insecurity over the continuity of one’s job</italic> from <italic>insecurity over valued aspects of one’s job</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888413481031">Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481031">Sverke &amp; Hellgren, 2002</xref>). Given that many workers surviving organizational downsizing and restructuring tend to experience not only a decline in job security but also job degradation in the form of increased job pressures and reduced decision-making latitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0730888413481031">Burke &amp; Nelson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0730888413481031">Quinlan &amp; Bohle, 2009</xref>), part of the association between job insecurity and a decreased sense of control may be accounted for by changing access or exposure to these job resources and demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0730888413481031">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). To address this issue, I consider whether a decline in job security is associated with a change in workers’ reports of decision-making latitude and job pressures and whether any changes in these job conditions mediate the potential association between job insecurity and sense of control.</p>
<p>To comprehend these issues, I analyze two waves of panel data drawn from a national study of American workers in 2005 and 2007. As part of these analyses, I consider whether the potential associations between job insecurity, job quality, and the sense of control are contingent on two temporal factors: (a) the duration of job insecurity, and (b) its life course timing. I outline the rationale for examining these contingencies, as well as the links between insecurity and sense of control, in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section1-0730888413481031">
<title>The Social Psychological Costs of Job Insecurity</title>
<p>Decreasing job security in recent decades is one aspect of a broader change in paid work that has been described as the erosion of the post–WWII psychological contract between employers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888413481031">Rousseau, 1995</xref>). The decline of this contract, which specifies the exchange of worker commitment and loyalty for secure employment with advancement opportunities, has been driven by a set of economic and political changes that have led employers to increasingly prioritize flexible labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0730888413481031">Kalleberg, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481031">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0730888413481031">Smith, 1994</xref>). This prioritization is evident in the growing popularity of organizational strategies designed to achieve numerical and functional flexibility, including downsizing and the hiring of short or fixed-term contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888413481031">Hollister, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0730888413481031">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>). Consequently, scholars have become interested in workers’ responses to these changes and, in particular, their reactions to growing uncertainty about their continuing employment with a specific employer (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481031">Sverke &amp; Hellgren, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Perceived job insecurity has been defined in various ways, including “an individual’s expectations about continuity in a job situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888413481031">Davy, Kinicki, &amp; Scheck, 1997</xref>, p. 323), and one’s “powerlessness to maintain desired continuity in a threatened job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888413481031">Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984</xref>, p. 438). A common theme among these definitions is that it represents a subjective appraisal of the threat to one’s immediate employment. Despite its subjective nature, research demonstrates that workers’ perceptions of insecure employment represent a relatively accurate indicator of more objective measures of insecurity, such as organizational downsizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0730888413481031">Elman &amp; O’Rand, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One common finding regarding the personal consequences of job insecurity is its association with psychological distress and physical health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888413481031">Burgard, Brand, &amp; House, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481031">Sverke &amp; Hellgren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0730888413481031">Sweet &amp; Moen, 2012</xref>). However, an individual outcome that has been less studied is the sense of personal control—a key predictor of good mental well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>). Indeed, while stress researchers have speculated that beliefs about personal control may reduce the stress associated with job insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0730888413481031">Pearlin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0730888413481031">Pearlin, Schieman, Fazio, &amp; Meersman, 2005</xref>), few have considered it as an <italic>outcome</italic> of job insecurity. I discuss existing theoretical and empirical work on this possibility in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0730888413481031">
<title>The Sense of Personal Control</title>
<p>The belief that one can effectively control important aspects of his or her life is informed by a variety of constructs, including mastery and self-efficacy at one end of the continuum, and powerlessness, fatalism, and external locus of control on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0730888413481031">Pearlin &amp; Schooler, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0730888413481031">Turner &amp; Roszell, 1994</xref>). Here, I focus on a particular construct that shares considerable conceptual overlap with all of these: the sense of personal control. Those with a high or internal locus of personal control believe that the things that happen in their life are mostly of their doing rather than the result of chance or outside forces. Through socialization and personal experience, individuals learn the extent that their actions result in desirable versus undesired outcomes; experiences that shape confidence about control over future events and circumstances. As such, beliefs about personal agency are an ongoing process that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0730888413481031">Emirbayer and Mische (1998</xref>, p. 963) describe as “an internal conversation between the past, present and future.”</p>
<p>Interest in the sense of control originates in part due to the fact that it represents a useful concept for illuminating the ways in which the self is socially constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888413481031">Ross &amp; Sastry, 1999</xref>). However, it has also drawn interest from stress researchers who have shown it to be a key personal resource for coping with the deleterious consequences of stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0730888413481031">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 1989</xref>). One social domain that has been shown to shape this personal resource is the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481031">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1983</xref>). Beyond the beneficial value of employment itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 1992</xref>), the workplace constitutes an important patterned source of opportunity and constraint that may influence feelings of mastery and personal control. A considerable body of scholarship has examined the relationship between the social organization of work and personal control, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0730888413481031">Marx (1852/1983)</xref>, who saw work activity as a key source of identity and self-actualization, but one that was increasingly estranged under capitalist relations, to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481031">Kohn and Schooler (1983)</xref>, who considered specific occupational sources of powerlessness (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481031">Schieman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888413481031">Schieman &amp; Plickert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0730888413481031">Seeman, 1967</xref>). Collectively, this research highlights how the degree that one is able to exercise self-direction in the pacing, nature, and timing of work are important predictors of high personal control. Despite this, the association between insecure employment conditions and the sense of control has been less examined.</p>
<p>There are various reasons to expect a link between job insecurity and the sense of control. Research documents that instances of job loss and unemployment are associated with reduced personal control, presumably because of the loss of valued material, psychological and social resources attached to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0730888413481031">Avison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0730888413481031">Broman, Hamilton, &amp; Hoffman, 2000</xref>). Thus it is possible that the <italic>threat</italic> and <italic>anticipation</italic> of job loss may have similar consequences, as individuals realize they are not in control of their continuing access to these resources, and generalize this lack of control to their broader life. Fear of losing control over one’s economic future may erode beliefs about personal control, but it may also be the threat to one’s identity that drives this process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888413481031">Thoit (1991)</xref> notes, “identity-relevant” stressors pose a greater threat to the self-concept than stressors tied to less-salient roles. Given that employment is a key source of identity in Western culture, a threat to this status should present a serious challenge to beliefs about personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0730888413481031">Jahoda, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The chronic, nondiscrete nature of job insecurity may also function to reduce perceptions of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481031">Wheaton, 1999</xref>). In contrast to an actual event that an individual can directly observe and respond to—such as job loss—the very ambiguity and uncertainty about the threat of job loss hinders an individual’s ability to resolve or alleviate the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0730888413481031">De Witte, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0730888413481031">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). The lack of options to resolve this threat, coupled with its unpredictability, may therefore result in feelings of powerlessness and low perceptions of control. Finally, the absence of secure, long-term employment may reduce an individual’s tendency to engage in certain actions that require long-term planning, such as starting a family or purchasing a home—behaviors that may otherwise foster positive beliefs about personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888413481031">Hollister, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While research has shown that a variety of work-related stressors are associated with lower perceptions of personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481031">Christie &amp; Barling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888413481031">Schieman &amp; Plickert, 2008</xref>), there is a relative dearth of empirical evidence regarding the effects of job insecurity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888413481031">Waters and Moore (2002)</xref> found that those experiencing frequent layoffs were more likely to believe that outcomes in their life were a result of powerful others; however, the generalizability of the authors’ findings was limited by their small convenience-based sample (<italic>n</italic> = 129). Moreover, larger cross-sectional studies of North American and European workers that have examined the association between insecurity and control report conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888413481031">Lau &amp; Knardahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481031">Schieman, 2002</xref>). There is also a relative absence of research utilizing repeated observations of insecurity and personal control over time—research designs that are better able to establish evidence of causality. One notable exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0730888413481031">Kinnunen, Feldt, and Mauno (2003)</xref> who found a negative association between job insecurity and self-esteem based on a 1-year longitudinal study of a nonrepresentative sample of Finnish workers (<italic>n</italic> = 456).</p>
<p>Despite the absence of consistent quantitative evidence on the subject, qualitative studies of workers facing downsizing and the prospect of job loss are suggestive of a link between job insecurity and the sense of control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0730888413481031">Greenhalgh (1979)</xref> examined the experiences of New York state hospital workers who survived downsizing, for example, and noted how these workers reacted to their situation in a manner similar to a traumatic event. Recurring themes are evident in other studies that discuss the feelings of powerlessness and helplessness that workers facing future job loss experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888413481031">Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0730888413481031">Jick &amp; Greenhalgh, 1989</xref>). Based on existing quantitative and qualitative research, therefore, I pose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0730888413481031" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Perceived job insecurity is associated with lower levels of perceived personal control.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0730888413481031">
<title>Job Degradation as a Mediator</title>
<p>When workers experience job insecurity, it is unlikely to be a work condition that is encountered in isolation. Some research finds that workers who survive organizational downsizing and restructuring not only perceive less job security but also increased job pressures and reduced job control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0730888413481031">Burke &amp; Nelson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0730888413481031">Quinlan &amp; Bohle, 2009</xref>). Exposure to these conditions, if prolonged, may come to further erode one’s sense of control. Indeed, while the majority of research on job insecurity has focused on the antecedents or consequences of perceptions of insecurity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888413481031">Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt’s (1984)</xref> original definition of insecurity considers it a multidimensional construct that is based on the interaction between subjective characteristics and objective job conditions. Using this broader conceptualization of job insecurity, I consider two aspects of job degradation—work intensification and reduced decision-making latitude—that may be relevant to declining job security and that may serve to mediate its effect on the sense of control. That is, I seek to tease out the specific processes through which insecurity influences personal control, through the threat and uncertainty of job loss on one hand, and general job degradation on the other.</p>
<p>Work intensification represents a contemporary work trend that is relevant to a broad section of workers, both in secure and insecure jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0730888413481031">Landipo &amp; Wilkinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0730888413481031">Maume &amp; Purcell, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, it is considered a hallmark experience of workers in firms that downsize or restructure their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481031">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>). These pressures may result from technical or organizational changes that increase the pace of work to levels that exceed an individual’s ability to adequately complete tasks, or due to multiple or conflicting demands from coworkers, managers, or customers. The human consequences of excessive time, task, or relational work demands are well documented. Scholars find that excessive job pressures are associated with higher levels of psychological distress and physical health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481031">Christie &amp; Barling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481031">Schieman, 2002</xref>). At the same time, excessive job pressures signify a degree of powerlessness regarding an individual’s ability to adequately complete work activities or meet job demands. Work intensification and increasing job pressures may therefore reduce feelings of mastery in the work role, and potentially attitudes about personal control in general.</p>
<p>Similarly, organizational restructuring that is often linked to declining job security may also lead to a reduction in the control afforded to workers and the degree that they are able to make decisions at work—job conditions that are consistently shown to be associated with high personal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481031">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1983</xref>). Moreover, the symbolic loss of a valued job feature, such as decision-making latitude, may signify a loss of status and standing in the workplace, which may also serve to reduce feelings of value, self-efficacy, and personal control.</p>
<p>Based on these ideas and existing research, then, I expect that job insecurity should be associated with a decline in job quality, in the form of excessive job pressures and reduced decision-making latitude; and, since these conditions should be associated with a lower sense of control, they should subsequently <italic>explain</italic> part of the overall association between job insecurity and personal control.</p>

<title>Contingencies: Duration and Life Course Timing</title>
<p>Existing research and theory suggest that the link between job insecurity and sense of personal control may be contingent on (a) the duration of exposure to job insecurity, and (b) life course timing. I briefly discuss the theoretical and empirical rationale for these contingencies in turn.</p>
<sec id="section5-0730888413481031">
<title>Duration</title>
<p>If job insecurity does reduce perceptions of personal control, what is the temporal nature of this association? Two scenarios appear plausible. One possibility is that given the relatively stable nature of the sense of control as a feature of the self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>), the effect of job insecurity may only become evident with persistent, long-term exposure. The threat of job loss and the pervading sense of insecurity may reduce beliefs about personal control once they are seen as durable and intractable; this view of the consequences of job insecurity is closest to the traditional conceptualization of it as a chronic role stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481031">Wheaton, 1999</xref>). Alternatively, it may be that the stable presence of insecurity has less or no impact on personal control since individuals often adjust to “environment constants” and come to see them as normative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2001</xref>). From this view, feelings of mastery and personal control may be downwardly malleable only to a certain level and, after which, job insecurity may have no further influence. Indeed, individuals may potentially regain a sense of control as they come to reinterpret or downplay the threat of job loss as unimportant in their lives. The impact of recently experienced job insecurity may therefore exert a stronger influence on personal control than persistent insecurity. I test each of these hypotheses, which I label as the “persistent” and “novelty” effects of job insecurity, respectively.</p>

<title>Life course timing</title>
<p>The effect of job insecurity on the sense of personal control may also vary across age. Population studies of adults document that the sense of control varies across the life course, peaking during middle age, before declining with older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0730888413481031">Mirowsky, 1995</xref>). There is also evidence that the deleterious effects of life stressors on personal control may be greater during later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0730888413481031">Pearlin, Nguyen, Schieman, &amp; Milkie, 2007</xref>). A meta-analysis of the health consequences of job insecurity, for example, found that older workers were more affected than younger workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0730888413481031">Cheng &amp; Chan, 2008</xref>). The disproportionate health effects across age may be because of the greater threat and consequences that older workers associate with the threat of job loss—older workers who are laid off face significant labor market challenges in comparison to younger workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0730888413481031">Hirsch, MacPherson, &amp; Hardy, 2000</xref>). Or, it may be due to a cohort effect in which younger workers who have grown up in an era of high employment instability may be more acclimatized and accepting to precarious work conditions than their older counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888413481031">Farber, 2010</xref>). Similarly, younger workers at the beginning of their careers may be more accepting of the job degradation that often accompanies decreased job security. Older workers, due to their greater experience and job status, may conversely perceive a decline in job autonomy or an increase in work pressures as more unexpected and disagreeable, and subsequently experience a greater decline in personal control. As such, job insecurity may represent a more stressful, debilitating, and unfamiliar experience for older workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481031">Schieman, 2002</xref>). These potentialities suggest the final hypothesis:</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses described above, I analyze panel data from the Work, Stress, and Health study (WSH), which involved telephone interviews with adults in the 50 United States in 2005 and 2007. To obtain the original sample, a list-assisted random digit dialing (RDD) selection was used and drawn proportionally from all 50 states from GENESYS Sampling Systems. Eligible participants are 18 years of age or older and participating in the paid labor force. At Wave 1, 71% of eligible individuals were successfully interviewed yielding a sample of 1,800 adults. At Wave 2 interviews, which occurred approximately 18 to 20 months after the initial interview, 1,286 of the original participants were successfully reinterviewed. Sample characteristics for the WSH study are similar to the population estimates of the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2005 American Community Survey (ACS).</p>
<p>The working sample includes non-self-employed workers, between the ages of 25 and 65, who participated in both waves of the survey, and who did not change or lose their job between interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 780). I briefly explain the rationale for the sample selection. The measure of job insecurity that I use is designed to tap into workers’ perceptions of the strength of the employer–employee psychological contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888413481031">Rousseau, 1995</xref>); as such, even though self-employed workers may face future threats to their continuing employment, this measure of insecurity is not applicable to workers who are not hired by an employer. Additionally, as is the case with most studies of job insecurity, respondents between the ages of 18 and 24 are omitted from the working sample since those in this group are overridingly in contingent jobs due to their disproportionate participation in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0730888413481031">Polivka, 1996</xref>). Finally, I restrict the sample to those who had the same employer between interviews because I am specifically interested in examining how job insecurity is associated with changes in job quality; that is, changes in job quality for a specific, single job. Including in the sample those who changed jobs would not allow for such an examination.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky and Ross’s (2003)</xref> 2 × 2 index of the sense of personal control is used. It asks participants to report their level of agreement or disagreement with the eight statements; there are two statements in each of the four categories. Statements that measure the level that individuals claim control over good outcomes include (a) “I am responsible for my own successes,” and (b) “I can do just about anything I really set my mind to.” Items that measure claims of control over bad outcomes include (c). “My misfortunes are the result of mistakes I have made,” and (d) “I am responsible for my failures.” Items that assess the extent that individuals deny control over good outcomes are (e) “The really good things that happen to me are mostly luck,” and (f) “There’s no sense planning a lot—if something good is going to happen it will.” The last two statements measure the denial of control over bad outcomes: (g) “Most of my problems are due to bad breaks,” and (h) “I have little control over the bad things that happen to me.” Responses to statements 1 through 4 are coded “strongly disagree” (–2), “disagree” (–1), “neutral” (0), “agree” (1), and “strongly agree” (2). Responses to statements 5 through 8 are coded “strongly disagree” (2), “disagree” (1), “neutral” (0), “agree” (–1), and “strongly agree” (–2).

(a) Persistent insecurity is coded 1 if respondents report that they are “somewhat” or “very likely” to lose their jobs at both interviews and coded 0 otherwise, (b) resolved insecurity is coded 1 if respondents reported that they are “somewhat” or “very likely” to lose their job only at Wave 1, and coded 0 otherwise, and (c) new insecurity is coded 1 if respondents reported that they are “somewhat” or “very likely” to lose their job at Wave 2 only, and coded 0 otherwise.

Individuals who reported “no one” are the reference category. Participants were then asked a follow-up question: “How often do the demands of your job exceed those doable in an 8-hr workday?” Response choices are (0) never, (1) rarely, (2) sometimes, and (3) frequently.

<title>Plan of Analyses</title>
<p>My analytical strategy is designed to examine the following: the general association between perceived job insecurity and the sense of personal control (Hypothesis 1), the extent that changes in job quality (excessive job pressures, reduced decision-making latitude) contribute to this association (Hypotheses 2a-2c), and whether the association between insecurity and the sense of control is contingent on duration (Hypotheses 3a and 3b) and age (Hypothesis 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0730888413481031">2</xref></sup> To this end, I first examine whether perceived job insecurity is associated with an increase in job pressures and reduced decision-making latitude between Wave 1 and Wave 2. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0730888413481031">Table 2</xref>, I use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques and regress job pressures (and decision-making latitude) at Wave 2 on episodic and persistent job insecurity, adjusting for baseline (i.e., Wave 1) levels of job pressures (decision-making latitude) and controls.</p>
<p>In Model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0730888413481031">Table 3</xref>, I regress sense of personal control on control measures, adjusting for baseline levels of personal control. In Model 2, I include episodic and persistent job insecurity. I then enter change in job pressures in Model 3, and change in decision-making latitude in Model 4, to examine their respective contribution to any association between job insecurity and sense of personal control revealed in Model 2. I then test age-by-job insecurity interactions in Model 5 to examine whether the association between job insecurity and sense of personal control is contingent on age.</p>
<p>With regard to the choice of longitudinal design, a panel regression model with fixed-effects specification is generally preferred to OLS approaches that rely on the stringent assumption that unmeasured factors are uncorrelated with included covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0730888413481031">Allison, 1999</xref>). However, I use a lagged-outcome method (where a baseline measure of job quality/sense of personal control is included as a predictor) because participants whose exposure does not change over time would be removed from analyses under a fixed effects design. This would therefore lead to the exclusion of those with persistent insecurity from the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888413481031">Burgard et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, a common problem of longitudinal data analysis is that sample attrition can bias the results; this is particularly problematic if baseline measures of the dependent measure predict attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2001</xref>). I therefore adjust for the likelihood of attrition in each of the regression models. This adjustment takes into account the probability that each of the outcomes or independent variables predict attrition. Using probit regression analyses, I regressed “absent from the sample at Wave 2” on all independent variables. I then transformed predictions to obtain the Mills Inverse Ratio and included it in all of the analyses. Although adjustment for the hazard of attrition has little effect on estimates, I decided to retain it in all regression analyses as a precaution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888413481031">Mirwosky &amp; Ross, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>I then regress decision-making latitude at Wave 2 on perceived job insecurity. Persistent job insecurity is associated with lower levels of decision-making latitude at Wave 2—providing support for Hypothesis 2b. No statistically significant association exists between episodic (new or resolved) job insecurity and decision-making latitude. Among the control measures, women and older workers report lower levels of decision-making latitude at Wave 2.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0730888413481031">Table 3</xref>, I regress the sense of personal control on perceived job insecurity and changes in job quality. In Model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0730888413481031">Table 3</xref>, the sense of personal control is regressed on control measures, adjusting for baseline levels of personal control. Among the control measures, only occupation is significantly associated with personal control: professionals report higher levels of personal control than those in labor and service occupations. Model 2 reveals a statistically significant association between persistent job insecurity and personal control at Wave 2—providing support for Hypothesis 1. No significant association exists between personal control and episodic job insecurity—indicating support for persistent Hypothesis 3a. In Model 3, I include excessive job pressures to examine whether changes in job pressures mediates the association between persistent insecurity and personal control revealed in Model 2. The inclusion of job pressures has little impact on the association between persistent insecurity and personal control. Moreover, job pressures are not associated with personal control. In Model 4, with job pressures omitted, I include decision-making latitude and find no evidence that it is associated with personal control or that it mediates the association between persistent job insecurity and control. Hypothesis 2c is therefore not supported.</p>

<p>Finally, in Model 5 I examine whether the association between job insecurity and personal control is contingent on age (Hypothesis 4). The interactions between episodic insecurity and personal control are not significant. However, the statistically significant interaction between persistent insecurity and personal control reveals that the association between persistent job insecurity and personal control is contingent on age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0730888413481031">3</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0730888413481031">Figure 1</xref>, while younger workers with persistent job insecurity have similar levels of personal control as those reporting an absence of job insecurity, the tendency for persistent insecurity to be associated with lower levels of personal control begins around middle age. An incremental <italic>R</italic>-squared test reveals that the improvement in <italic>R</italic>-squared between Models 4 and 5 is significant (<italic>F</italic> = 7.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<p>In addition to testing age contingencies in the association between perceived job insecurity and personal control, a series of two-way and three-way interactions involving job insecurity and several sociodemographic characteristics were tested, including gender, marital, and socioeconomic statuses.

<title>Attrition</title>
<p>The longitudinal design of the study was such that only those in the paid labor force were reinterviewed at Wave 2. It is possible therefore that attrition may account for the association between job insecurity and sense of control, as well as the age contingencies that I find. Individuals reporting job insecurity at Wave 1, for example, may be more likely to experience subsequent job loss, resulting in their absence from Wave 2. All analyses therefore adjust for the hazard of attrition to rule out these possibilities. Additionally, an examination of factors predicting attrition between Wave 1 and Wave 2 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0730888413481031">Appendix</xref>, Model 2) shows that attrition is largely random with respect to the baseline focal measures. One other related possibility concerns the decision to restrict the analytical sample to workers who did not change employers between interviews; it is possible that those with a high sense of control who reported job insecurity at the first interview were more likely to look for and find another more secure job by the second interview, resulting in their absence from the analytical sample. Consequently, the possible omission of these individuals from the analytical sample might create the false appearance of a negative association between job insecurity and sense of control since the number of individuals with job insecurity and low sense of control would be overestimated. However, analyses (not shown) that include workers who changed employers between interviews demonstrated similar findings as those presented here, ruling out this possibility.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on analyses of a national panel data set of workers, these results provide evidence of the detrimental effects of perceived job insecurity on the sense of personal control. I find only limited support for Hypotheses 2a to 2c, however. While perceived job insecurity is associated with increased job pressures and reduced decision-making latitude, changes in job quality do not account for the association between job insecurity and perceived personal control. I find support for the <italic>persistent hypothesis</italic> (Hypothesis 3a): only workers experiencing the prolonged threat of job loss report lower levels of personal control relative to those without job insecurity; there is no evidence that the recent experience of job insecurity is associated with reduced personal control (Hypothesis 3b). Finally, I find that the association between persistent job insecurity and personal control increases with age, such that older workers who report job insecurity experience lower levels of personal than younger workers (Hypothesis 4). I discuss the implications of these findings.</p>
<p>Traditional conceptualizations of job insecurity define it as a perceived powerlessness with regard to control over one’s continuing employment. However, broader conceptualizations of the construct acknowledge that the insecurity or loss of valued job conditions may also be relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481031">Sverke &amp; Hellgren, 2002</xref>). Declining job security and job quality are likely experienced in tandem, as employers place greater demands on surviving workers, or restructure in ways that reduce worker autonomy. My findings demonstrate evidence of this: workers in the sample who reported job insecurity also reported greater job pressures and less autonomy at Wave 2—though these associations depend on the duration of job insecurity. I find that the recent—but not persistent—experience of job insecurity is associated with an increase in excessive job pressures. That excessive job pressures are not associated with persistent job insecurity is somewhat surprising, but it may be that individuals come to adjust to the changes in pressures that result from organizational restructuring or downsizing.</p>
<p>While it is only the recent experience of job insecurity that I find to be associated with increased job pressures, I find the opposite with regard to decision-making latitude; only workers reporting persistent insecurity reported a decline in decision-making latitude at work. Here, it may be that decision-making latitude is a job resource that is eroded more slowly, as organizations engage in work-redesigns that emphasize efficiency at the expense of worker autonomy.</p>
<p>Despite the revealed links between job insecurity and job degradation, I find no evidence that changes in job pressures or decision-making latitude account for the association between insecurity and sense of control. Indeed, I find no evidence that changes in job pressures or job latitude are associated with personal control. One possibility is that personal control is reactive only with longer term exposure to such job conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481031">Kohn and Schooler’s (1983)</xref> longitudinal study of the association between occupational self-direction and sense of control examined changes over a 10-year period; the 2-year gap between interviews in the present study may be inadequate to identify an association. In contrast, the threat of job loss may result in a more immediate and stronger feeling of powerlessness since it challenges an important aspect of identity—employment. Moreover, although I do not directly test this, it may be that in contexts of threat and economic uncertainty that the importance of valued job conditions for the sense of control diminish in importance, as workers become more focused on maintaining employment, rather than the quality of their employment.</p>
<p>My findings relating to duration and age contingencies show that the association between job insecurity and reduced personal control is evident only among middle age and older workers, and only when the experience is persistent (reported across the span of 2 years). These patterns suggest that younger workers may respond differently to prolonged experiences of insecurity than older workers. I do not have access to these younger individuals’ work histories, but workers in their 20s who report job insecurity at both waves of the survey likely have encountered no other type of employment situation in their career. Job insecurity may therefore be a more normative experience for these individuals, and it may be that they do not connect such economic powerlessness to feelings about personal control in the same way that older workers do. This possibility speaks to a potentially important issue regarding the <italic>meaning of stressors</italic> and the ways in which individuals’ prior experiences and beliefs influence reactions to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481031">Wheaton, 1999</xref>). The fact that older workers experience the greatest reduction in personal control in response to the threat of job loss suggests that this threat holds a different set of meanings for these individuals; that is, they may perceive it as either more consequential for their careers or family. Unfortunately, I am unable to determine the specific meanings that older workers attach to job insecurity, or the ways in which they are consequential for personal control. It may be that both worries about the chances of rehire, as well as their stronger expectations about job security, contribute to the disproportionate penalties that they experience with respect to their sense of personal control.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study deserves mention. The lagged-dependent design method utilized does not provide a strict test of temporal ordering between the focal measures of interest. That is, it is possible that individuals with a low sense of control are more likely to perceive that their job is insecure, for example, rather than the reverse association hypothesized in this article. Moreover, it is possible that the relationship between insecurity and the sense of control is actually reciprocal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481031">Christie and Barling (2009)</xref>, for example, find evidence that individuals reporting high level of work stressors subsequently reported lower levels of personal control; but they also find that low levels of personal control subsequently predicted higher levels of work stressors—leading them to the conclusion that the nature of stress and stress recovery is a dynamic process, and one that is better explained in terms of positive or negative control spirals. I am unable to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481031">Christie and Barling’s (2009)</xref> study because of the absence of multi-item measures that are required in the latent curve modeling technique that they use, but in analyses not shown, I find no evidence that changes in sense of control predict perceived job insecurity at Wave 2. A logistic regression with perceived job insecurity at Wave 2 regressed as the independent variable on change in sense of control revealed no evidence that sense of control significantly predicted job insecurity. Thus, while I cannot rule out the possibility that the relationship between the focal measures of interest is dynamic and reciprocal, these additional analyses support a causal argument in which perceptions of job insecurity influence beliefs about personal control, rather than the opposite.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Research on the health consequences of job insecurity has grown in the last decade; however, an issue that has been less examined concerns whether job insecurity also shapes important psychological dispositions that are fundamental to health and individual functioning. We know much about how autonomous and self-directed work conditions are associated with personality dispositions like the sense of personal control, but what of the uncertainty that permeates the daily work experiences of individuals who live under the continual threat of job loss? The findings of this article support the conceptualization of job insecurity as a chronic work stressor that increases feelings of powerlessness—and one that disproportionately impacts older workers.</p>
<p>Is the revealed age contingency in these analyses suggestive that young workers who are now entering a labor market characterized by high instability are unaffected by the threat of job loss since they have experienced nothing else? Perhaps not. With only two waves of interviews, 2 years apart, I have a relatively short snapshot of workers’ lives. A longer view of the life course is necessary—a key tenet of the life course perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0730888413481031">Elder, 2003</xref>)—to fully consider how beliefs about personal control may be influenced by insecure employment experiences. Such an approach would allow for an investigation of how job insecurity influences decisions about family formation, home purchases, and other significant life events that may either serve to foster or undermine the sense of control. Thus an accurate appraisal of the consequences of the recent recession for young workers—a group whose employment opportunities have been hardest hit—would require follow-up interviews with these individuals over the next decade as they transition across important life stages.</p>
<p>In addition to the need for long-term panel studies on the effects of job insecurity, future research should further examine how these consequences are disproportionately experienced across social and demographic statuses that may alter the risks posed by economic precariousness. The age contingencies revealed in this article strongly point to the presence of such contingencies. However, due to sample-size restrictions, I am unable to adequately examine how the association between job insecurity and personal control varies across different groups, such as single versus dual-earner households, parents versus nonparents, or primary versus secondary labor market workers. Larger survey samples with increased statistical power are necessary to probe the potential contingent effects of job insecurity. There is also a lack of knowledge on how these effects may be shaped by other psychological orientations, including work role salience. The threat of job loss may be particularly detrimental among those who strongly identify with the work role. Future research should therefore seek to identify the relevant risk factors that exacerbate the psychological consequences of this increasingly common labor market condition.</p>

<p>I follow a procedure used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888413481031">Mirowsky and Ross (2001)</xref> to correct for potential attrition related bias. If baseline personal control influences attrition, unobserved changes in personal control may also. Controlling for the hazard of attrition corrects for this possibility. The <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0730888413481031">appendix table</xref> below presents probit regression analyses with absent from Wave 2 regressed on personal control, insecurity, and controls at Wave 1 (Model 1). Baseline sense of control does not predict attrition from the sample at Wave 2. The low pseudo <italic>R</italic>-squared of .065 also shows that attrition is largely random with respect to the model’s baseline measures. In Model 2, an age-by-insecurity interaction is added to examine whether older workers with job insecurity are more likely to be absent from the sample at Wave 2. The interaction is nonsignificant, indicating that older workers with job insecurity are equally as likely to be present at Wave 2 as younger workers.</p>

<p>The sense of personal control scale balances statements about control against those denying control, and statements about good outcomes against those about bad outcomes. This balanced 2 × 2 structure is designed to eliminate defense and agreement bias from the measure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481031">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>, for a detailed description of the scale).</p></fn>

<p>To examine whether job degradation amplifies the impact of job insecurity on personal control, a series of interactions were created between insecurity and job pressures/decision-making latitude. Analyses (not shown) revealed no evidence of a significant interaction between either aspect of job quality and job insecurity.</p></fn>

<label>3.</label>
<p>In analyses not shown, I also tested squared and cubic age interactions with perceived job insecurity to examine whether job insecurity was more influential at different stages in working life. However, these analyses revealed no evidence of any nonlinear age patterns involving job insecurity and personal control.</p></fn>
