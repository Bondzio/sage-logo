<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses diasporic versions of <italic>Schuhplattler</italic> (slap dance), a German-Austrian folk dance, as a community activity among German and Austrian émigrés. It offers two case studies: one focusing on the anti-Nazi emigrant youth organization ‘Young Austria’ in the late 1930s, the other on the practice and politics of Schuhplattler dancing by German émigrés to the USA in the late 2000s. Discussions address how the dance has been deployed to serve starkly differing cultural objectives and political ideologies. The paper draws on concepts from nationalism, globalization and multiculturalism to contextualize the dance’s role as a source of national and regional identity.</p>

<p>An article in the weekly German periodical <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> claimed in 2006 that ‘Germany still has no idea how to present itself, because Germans still have no idea who, or what, they are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512453658">Meyer, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512453658">1</xref></sup> This comment, from a piece on German national identity, appeared in the press just a few days after the soccer World Cup’s opening ceremony in Munich, which had featured presentations of Schuhplattler dance as a special highlight. The tournament prompted critical reflection and heated nationwide discussions about Germany’s status within Europe and worldwide, in particular addressing issues of the nation’s representation and the use of symbols to construct its national identity. Ever since the Second World War, Germany has struggled with image problems, internally as well as externally, as it has sought to construct a new sense of itself following the infamous phase of hyper-nationalism during the Third Reich.</p>
<p>As Stuart Hall has noted, ‘national cultures construct identities by producing meaning about “the nation” with which we can <italic>identify</italic>; these are contained in the stories told about it, memories which connect its present with its past, and images which are constructed of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453658">Hall, 1992</xref>: 293). Representational strategies to promote a sense of belonging include an emphasis on tradition and continuity, often grounding national identity upon the idea of a pure, original ‘folk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453658">Hall, 1992</xref>: 292–5) or constructing narratives of nations, for instance in popular culture. The Schuhplattler, an Austro-German folk dance, is frequently mentioned in public discussions of German national culture, and for many foreign observers stands as a potent symbol of German identity.</p>
<p>In countries as geographically removed as Australia and New Zealand, German restaurants entertain customers with commercialized versions of folk art which frequently include forms of Schuhplattler dancing. And during heightened moments of national awareness (such as World Cups and Olympic Games) Schuhplattler often features prominently on the official itinerary as a practice seen to constitute Germanness. Defending his selection of a Schuhplattler performance for the 2006 World Cup opening ceremony, its artistic director, the Viennese artist André Heller, praised the dance’s energy and strength, claiming that ‘in New Zealand and the South Pacific, people would recognise that “we [Germans] are a wild, passionate folk’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512453658">Trachtler-WM, 2006</xref>) – an amusing attempt to persuade other nations of a more emotional aspect to the German character, shedding preconceived notions of excessive discipline and self-control. However, the choice of programme was perceived rather critically by the general public and press. In the aforementioned <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> article, it was sarcastically noted that:<disp-quote>
<p>Foreigners know what German identity is. Being ‘German’ means wearing Lederhosen and slapping your thighs while performing the (Bavarian) Schuhplattler dance. That’s what they saw at the World Cup opening ceremony on Friday. No American or Australian watching the show could have any doubt. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512453658">Meyer, 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I suggest that the reasons for Germany’s dissociation from this image are threefold:</p>
<list id="list1-1749975512453658" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Schuhplattler originated, and is still primarily practised, in the Austrian county of Tyrol and in neighbouring (Upper) Bavaria. Hence, it is a regionally-based dance which has, in particular abroad, become something of a national stereotype. ‘Bavarianness’ is different from ‘Germanness’ and the acceptance of Schuhplattler as an inclusive nationwide folk dance is curtailed by several factors. These include the historic cultural and political rifts between Bavaria and in particular the western German counties that previously formed Prussia; and moreover a religious divide, Bavaria being a Catholic region and many other parts of Germany being predominantly Protestant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Schuhplattler and its social context (e.g. brass bands and beer tents) contradict other dominant contemporary national narratives and cultural tenets. The perception some have of Schuhplattler dancers being primitive hillbillies engaging in a popular pastime may contradict Germany’s preferred, rationalized self-representation as the country of the <italic>Dichter und Denker</italic> (writers and thinkers). Moreover, the construction of hyper-masculinity typical of many modern-day practices of the dance, which emphasize its <italic>plattel</italic> (male thigh-slapping) elements, challenge both modern gender ideologies and Germany’s attempt to project a mellower, less aggressive self-image.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cultural hiatus of the Third Reich led to a problematizing of notions of continuity and tradition that are central to constructions of national identity. The Hitler regime’s close association of folk art (including dances such as the Schuhplattler) and <italic>völkische</italic> values rendered such art suspicious on ideological grounds in post-war Germany, as will be discussed presently.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Dance and sociology scholars in the last 20 years have highlighted how dance can act as a representational practice and identitarian category within contemporary Western society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512453658">Burt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512453658">Thomas, 1995</xref>) and have examined the extent to which folk dance can embody a nationalistic practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512453658">Ramsey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512453658">Shay, 2002</xref>). But it is only relatively recently that the impact of current globalization processes upon dance has attracted scholarly attention (for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512453658">Shapiro, 2008</xref>). Transnational communities raise important and timely issues pertaining to the interactions and transfers between cultures, and the negotiation of cultural identities in a globalized context. No existing study, however, offers research into the migration of Schuhplattler, which is remarkable given Germany’s historically high levels of migration and varied 20th-century history, and the widespread perception and dissemination of this dance as a German national symbol.</p>
<p>This paper thus makes a unique contribution to the sociology of dance and the globalization of (German) culture. Preceded by notes on the form and content of the dance, this article fills a gap in previous literature by examining its diasporic versions as an amateur community group activity among German and Austrian émigrés. It seeks to establish how Schuhplattler was construed as an important cultural resource of identification and self-image, and how it has contributed to the global shaping of local identities. Applying concepts from sociological literature concerning migration and its effects, such as long-distance nationalism, diaspora, and hybridity, the paper offers two case studies. The first examines ‘Young Austria’, a group of Jewish-Austrian exiles to England during the Nazi regime; the second investigates the contemporary (21st century) organization of Schuhplattler societies in the USA. Particular attention is given to the dance’s contradictory images and uses in different contexts to reveal the complexity of cultural practice and meaning of Schuhplattler in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
<sec id="section1-1749975512453658">
<title>Origins and Iconography of Schuhplattler</title>
<p>The name ‘Schuhplattler’ derives from a rhythmic hitting of the shoes and thighs. The dance was originally performed by country folk, such as peasants, hunters and woodcutters in the mountainous regions of Bavaria and Tyrol. In its early forms, it constituted a couple and courtship dance with improvised elements, during which the man, displaying male prowess, wooed his girl whose movements mainly consisted of spinning combinations. Most historians, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512453658">Schneider (1985)</xref>, concur in identifying the mid-19th century – when Germany consisted of many principalities, independent duchies and kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Bavaria – as the period when a recognizable form of the dance originated, although elements of it may well be much older.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512453658">2</xref></sup> Apparently a Schuhplattler society was formed in the 1860s in the small Bavarian town of Miesbach, which also lent its name to a specific traditional costume (<italic>Tracht</italic>) worn for the dance.</p>
<p>In 1883, a certain Joseph Vogel founded a Verein für Erhaltung der Volkstracht im Leizachthale (Society for the Preservation of the Folk Tracht in the Leizach Valley) which signalled the beginning of organized club-based activities. Three years later, King Ludwig II urged his people to found such clubs ‘in order to preserve the pretty mountain costumes and the old dances, in particular the Schuhplattler dances, and to foster camaraderie and the love of the homeland and the fatherland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453658">Bayerischer Trachtenverband, n.d.</xref>). Hence, from their inceptions, Schuhplattler societies fulfilled an identificatory function, promoting awareness of a local and national sense of self.</p>
<p>In striving to maintain folk dances for future generations, the clubs’ activities resulted in what is referred to in literature on folk art as ‘objectification’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512453658">Foley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512453658">Handler, 1988</xref>), a process during which artistic practices are standardized, institutionalized and homogenized. Crucially, distinctions are drawn between what are seen as kinemic, i.e. primordial and characteristic elements, of dances on the one hand and their variable, constitutive aspects on the other. The search for dances’ original form is typically undertaken in the quest for authenticity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512453658">3</xref></sup> which plays a vital role in preserving tradition but is dismissed by some critics as ‘an archaeological excavation of an idealized, irretrievable past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512453658">Shohat, 1992</xref>: 109). Indeed, there is a danger of ‘freezing’ folk dances which emanate from the living traditions of specific communities and turning them into forms which are essentially ‘static and ahistorical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453658">Copeland, 1993</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Alas, the preservation of the traditional Schuhplattler led to a reduction in the diversity of its localized varieties, as with the development of the club movement many societies in different areas of Bavaria and elsewhere copied the <italic>Miesbacher Tracht</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453658">Becher, 1983</xref>: 280). Moreover, Schuhplattler dances became objects of study and were transferred from a community setting onto the stage. They thus became both professionalized and de-contextualized. Consequently, Schuhplattler is now danced – contrary to its original practice – according to a fixed lexicon of movement and normally without any improvisatory sections.</p>
<p>There are about 150 Schuhplattler dances, often representing the environment and working lives of their original participants, such as the <italic>Mühlradl</italic>, which explores the movements and sounds of a mill. The spectrum of variations in the <italic>plattel</italic> (male slapping) sections is based on just 12 different hits. The male Schuhplattler repertoire consists of different sequences of varying durations, interspersed with other elements such as foot stamping (<italic>Stampfer</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512453658">Hegenbarth, 1977</xref>: 11). Serious dancers give meticulous attention to the routines in terms of timing, step execution and posture. For instance, the men train themselves to jump and slap in unison, while female dancers are meant to refrain from ‘spotting’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1749975512453658">4</xref></sup> (like ballet dancers) in order to maintain an even level of their skirts while spinning. Such details are paramount when it comes to competitive dancing, with tournaments for both group <italic>platteln</italic> and <italic>Einzelplatteln</italic> (couple dancing) being held in Germany, Austria and several countries abroad. Many Schuhplattler performances have now abandoned the courtship element, and many dances are nowadays performed exclusively by men. Poignantly, a group in Munich by the apt name of <italic>Schwuhplattler</italic> (a combination of the German words for ‘gay’ and ‘shoe’) is comprised of male homosexuals, whose skilful demonstrations of Schuhplattler have raised eyebrows in some more conservative clubs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1749975512453658">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Young Austria</title>
<p>The 1930s highlighted the importance of Schuhplattler to German national imagery. Adolf Hitler was much influenced by Herder’s conception of romantic nationalism, his notion of the organic unity of the Volk, and folk art. The latter was deemed ‘the language of the soul or the heart’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512453658">Bohlman, 1988</xref>: 54) and thus assigned a significant role in shaping and expressing national culture. Under Nazi politics, peasant folklore became part of a political programme to restore Germany’s confidence in its native culture, to promote national unity, and to counterbalance the alleged overemphasis on abstract thought and internationalism (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512453658">Kamenetsky, 1972</xref>). This logic led, among other things, to a bias against foreign influences and the extirpation of ethnic minorities, notably Jews.</p>
<p>Nazi ideologists stipulated the main function of dance, which encompassed the three main genres of folk, social and stage dance, to be the (re)construction of the German folk. Folk dance was specifically targeted and instrumentalized to disseminate the Nazis’ <italic>völkisch</italic> ideology and political agenda, which was bound up with assertions of ‘Aryan purity’. Consider, for instance, the musicologist Karl Huber, who aimed to found a ‘German School of Folk Music and Dance’ in the mid-1930s to fight off ‘the champions of Marxist tendencies and Jewish products’. He sought to foster the National Socialist vision by maintaining the ‘purity of German folk art’ which was to be ‘rooted in the soil’ and inherited from ancestors whose ‘race was congenitally tied to our own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512453658">Huber, 1936</xref>: 66, 68–9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1749975512453658">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like folk dance, stage dance was supposed to convey an essential Germanness. An article published by the dance section of the Kampfbund für Deutsche Kultur (Fighting League for German Culture) in 1933 summarized the main characteristics of Nazi-approved dance, stipulating that artistic dance should also ‘have its origin and echo in … the language of movement of the people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453658">Geistigen Grundlagen, 1933</xref>: 3). Consequently, dance genres or techniques with foreign origins, such as ballet which originated in Italy and France, were viewed with suspicion. In practice, however, such forms were often ‘Germanized’ through the intensive incorporation of folk dance elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512453658">Oberzaucher-Schüller, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this promotion of folk dance as a tool to transform society according to Nazi tenets, it may seem odd that Schuhplattler was concurrently deployed to very different ends by staunch opponents to, and victims of, the Nazi regime. Young Austria was a youth organization of Austrian emigrants to Great Britain under socialist leadership, most of them Jewish refugees. Founded in 1939 after the <italic>Anschluss</italic> (annexation) of Austria by the Third Reich, Young Austria had approximately 1000 members by 1943.</p>
<p>Archival research at the British Library in 2009 enabled me to examine the German-language journal <italic>Österreichische Jugend</italic> (Austrian Youth), the organization’s publication outlet which first appeared in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>. They provide insights into the activities and challenges of the group, most of whose members were deterritorialized during their apprenticeships or tertiary education. Austrian youth organizations were founded in London, Manchester and Liverpool, while outside these centres communities of Austrian youngsters were scattered in locations such as Bristol, Glasgow, York, Birmingham, and various refugee camps.</p>
<p>One of their explicit aims was to foster and promote Austria’s culture and traditions whilst in exile. In an English-language article titled ‘Why we still love Austria’, a member notes that ‘Sometimes, however, we find that some of our very best friends … cannot understand why we are still talking of a country, dreaming of a country, hoping to go back to a country that expelled us … .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1749975512453658">7</xref></sup> They’d rather see us forget the past. But should we, can we forget? We can’t’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 4: 2). This strong sense of attachment to Austria is paradigmatic of conditions of forced exile, which often evoke a sense of longing for a lost homeland and a powerful nostalgia for home life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453658">Kalra et al., 2005</xref>: 10). The transnational location of ‘Young Austria’ members clearly enhanced their sense of national identity rather than weakening it.</p>
<p>For this diasporic group, the idea of the ‘national’ became heavily embedded in their social and cultural life. Notwithstanding their predominantly Jewish ancestry, their self-identification was as Austrians first and foremost, and this was reproduced though signifiers such as folk dances and songs, often performed in traditional costumes during social gatherings, garden parties and so-called <italic>Heimabende</italic>: evenings to commemorate and celebrate their native country. The journal’s first issues contain descriptions of dance displays, which helped forge a distinctive collective identity and strengthen diasporic ties to home: ‘The love for our homeland’ – reads a note from August 1939 – ‘is embodied in the maintenance of our customs and traditions, the folk dances and songs of our homeland’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 4: 2). Claims such as Helen Maimann’s, who writes that Young Austria’s members ‘<italic>were put into</italic> lederhosen and dirndl and <italic>sent to</italic> Schuhplattler evenings into various English towns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512453658">Maimann, 1987</xref>: 20, my emphasis), are thus belied by my research into this organization. Rather than being enforced displays of nationalism, folk traditions were enthusiastically embraced by the youths as embodiments of a national Austrian imaginary. Owing to the close association of Schuhplattler with conservative and even fascist forces, their love and deployment of the dance in hindsight might appear inexplicable to contemporary commentators. However, articles in <italic>Österreichische Jugend</italic> show that presentations of Schuhplattler were juxtaposed with the raising of the red-white-red Austrian flag and fiery avowals of a free, independent and democratic Austria (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>, No. 2: 2–3; No. 11: 3).</p>
<p>I suggest this staging of Austrianness through folk activities manifests a form of long-distance nationalism: a term originally coined by Benedict Anderson and employed by Nina Glick Schiller, who distinguishes between the broader concept of diaspora and ‘the active politics of long-distance nationalists who establish sets of practices designed to influence the political situation within a territory that they still call home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453658">Glick Schiller, 2005</xref>: 571). However, whereas many accounts of long-distance nationalism emphasize its socio-economic or political dimensions, Young Austria’s activities seem more compatible with Sau-Ling Wong’s account of ‘cultural long-distance nationalism’ which involves practices that ‘derive their sense of legitimacy, their standard of authenticity, and often their content from the perceived source of culture – the nation-state from which the practitioners are now physically removed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1749975512453658">Wong, 2010</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>Young Austria members envisioned their ancestral territory as a democratic, modern nation and supported political movements seeking to liberate it from Hitler’s rule. They campaigned for the ‘non-recognition of the forced annexation of Austria’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512453658">Declaration, 1938/1939</xref>) by the British government as well as Austria’s right to self-determination. One journal issue lists the organization’s eight-point manifesto: the seventh point explicitly cites the ‘democratic reconstruction of Austria’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 6: 2) as a political aim. While the folk dances presented at social gatherings were not politicized in terms of their iconography, content or form, they were designed to arouse British sympathy for their cause; they were intended, as some articles suggest, both to entertain the British public (thus making them more receptive to their political message) and to facilitate the ‘understanding of two peoples’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 4: 6), namely Austria (conceived as a free country) and Britain.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such attempts at improved intercultural relations, the youths regarded Britain only as a temporary ‘host’ nation. The journal’s first issues suggest that the refugees scarcely engaged with British culture; instead, as one member noted, their cultural festivities aimed at ‘annexing a small part of English soil in the mountains for Austria’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 2: 2). Their identification thus continued to be with the territory of Austria itself, and the cultural ties to their homeland were crucial in strengthening their group identity as they were severed from it in most other – i.e. racial, religious and economic – terms.</p>
<p>The reception of Schuhplattler and its symbolic value as a national imaginary during the critical period of the late 1930s and early 1940s is instructive when considering its political significance. A journal entry about an Ealing garden party on 17 June 1939 indicates that, at this time, British citizens viewed the dance overwhelmingly positively, regarding it as merry entertainment as well as an excellent Austrian propaganda tool (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 2: 3). However, the eruption of, and Britain’s entry into, the Second World War and the subsequent change in political climate a few months later altered its appreciation dramatically: ‘Many were a little bewildered at the sight of refugees in national dresses, of refugees who could still sing and be gay’ (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453658">1939</xref>: No. 11: 3). Only shortly thereafter, the journal acquired an increasingly political undertone. Articles bemoaned the fact that Austrian refugees were now labelled ‘enemy aliens’ and subjected to interviews by British officials. Moreover, as many boys were sent to internment camps within Britain, girls had to take over the organization of their Austrian festivities (<italic>Junges Österreich</italic>, 1940: No. 2: 1, 16). Over the next year, the journal became increasingly dominated by reports about these camps, curfews, unemployment and low pay, while articles about <italic>Heimabende</italic> grew scarce before eventually almost disappearing.</p>
<p>Press coverage in Britain too proved sceptical, attacking the practices of Young Austria as reactionary (see the newspaper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512453658"><italic>London Information</italic>, 1992</xref>[1941]: 201). The beginning of the war shifted perceptions of the Schuhplattler from an innocent leisure activity to a cultural practice arousing suspicion among the British population. While it might have created a collective consciousness for Austrian refugees and was imbued with a socialist and democratic flavour, the promotion of folk dance did not sit easily with the British, and as the months went by contributed to an ‘othering’ of the group.</p>
<p>This scepticism should not surprise us. Young Austria’s choice of folk dance as a left-wing protest tool against the Third Reich was odd, to say the least. First, the rural, mountainous idyll evoked by Schuhplattler was at odds with the urban reality of the young émigrés who mostly hailed from Vienna. More poignantly, as outlined above, the British saw folk dance being concurrently promoted as a key marker of fascist identity. The predominantly Jewish, politically left-of-centre membership of Young Austria was both diametrically opposed to, and explicitly barred from, the promulgated cultural, political and racial essentialisms of the Third Reich – which by now included Austria itself. Their desire to embody in dance their sense of loss and yearning for an unobtainable home is understandable, but their attempts to forge friendships with their ‘hosts’ through such displays testifies to an unfortunate naïveté. Against the backdrop of Third Reich imperialism and the centrality of folk art to Hitler’s totalizing ideology, foreign observers would have been hard pressed to comprehend Schuhplattler as expressing an inclusive, progressive politics opposed to this regime.</p>
<p>One must conclude, then, that Young Austria’s cultural long-distance nationalism was ultimately unsuccessful. It had little or no bearing on the politics of their homeland; their activities were quickly curtailed; and the project of disseminating Schuhplattler in Britain was short-lived and left no traces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1749975512453658">8</xref></sup> Their case does, however, admit one important insight: the same dance can be appropriated by forces at polar opposites of the political spectrum. In this instance, Schuhplattler must not be viewed as a cultural instrument which is in essence politically conservative or right-wing.</p>

<title>Schuhplattler Societies in the USA</title>
<p>Following the Nazis’ appropriation of folk art to further their ideological ends, folk traditions considerably depreciated in public esteem in post-war Germany; as historian Konrad Jarausch claims, they ‘became tarnished and were thereafter taboo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512453658">Jarausch and Geyer, 2003</xref>: 242). Despite this, Schuhplattler societies in Germany and abroad have continued to flourish, and many clubs in the diaspora preserve their historical heritage and construct their national or regional identity through the dance to the present day. Several waves of German emigration saw the foundation of Schuhplattler societies in various countries abroad before and after the two world wars. The numbers of German émigrés to the Americas, including Latin America, and Australia were particularly high, resulting in proportionally large numbers of folk dance clubs, as well as the celebration of festivities associated with Bavarian traditions. For instance, the city of Blumenau in southern Brazil, which was founded in 1850 by German immigrants, hosts the world’s second largest <italic>Oktoberfest</italic>.</p>
<p>I shall now discuss the results of my empirical and fieldwork research into club-based Schuhplattler activities in the USA, a country with a particularly rich and longstanding tradition of <italic>Trachtenvereine</italic>. According to recent American Community Surveys, the most frequently occurring ancestry group in the US is German.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1749975512453658">9</xref></sup> German emigration to the US peaked between 1840 and the First World War, with German-Americans now accounting for 50 million or 17 per cent of the US population. Unsurprisingly, the states with the largest percentages of German-born citizens, such as Pennsylvania, New York, Wisconsin and California, contain the most Schuhplattler societies.</p>
<p>I became curious about the nature and purpose of these diasporic projects – which consist mainly of practising and performing folklore dancing – and about the clubs’ self-perceived and advertised relationships both to their members’ ancestral home and their place of residency. I therefore contacted several US-based Schuhplattler societies, examined dozens of websites, and interviewed a key figure in the movement over email. Furthermore, I conducted ethnographic fieldwork in the US in November 2006 and could thus liaise with numerous club members and gain first-hand experience of their dance practices.</p>
<p>My research revealed that the oldest recorded US Schuhplattler society, Schuhplattler-Verein Edelweiss of Chicago, Illinois, was founded in 1914 and continues today. The majority of Schuhplattler organizations were founded between 1920 and 1970, with peak periods in the 1920s and early ’30s together with the ’50s and early ’60s. This seems due to the high numbers of Bavarian immigrants during those decades, though it is conceivable that clubs were founded in response to the atrocities of the wars in order to restore a more idyllic image of Germany. Many clubs cater for children from as early as age three as well as adults; host, or are associated with, singing societies; and dance and perform other (mostly Bavarian but also Tyrolian) folk dances alongside Schuhplattler. The clubs’ offerings compete with other sporting and cultural activities such as basketball and soccer. However, to complement their knowledge of German culture, many children of (partial or full) German descent attend bilingual German schools or language schools where they are taught German for a few hours a week. In the state of New York, such schools exist, for instance, in Manhattan and Richmond.</p>
<p>Many clubs in the US and Canada have joined together and now operate under the umbrella organization of the Gauverband Nordamerika, founded in 1965 ‘for the purpose of promoting Bavarian and Tirolean [sic] folk dancing costumes, customs and culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1749975512453658">Gauverband Nordamerika, n.d.</xref>). This organization comprises nearly 70 clubs in the US and about 15 in Canada, and organizes a <italic>Gaufest</italic> (inter-club festivity) every other year. The Gauverband lists eight societies in Pennsylvania and 11 in New York alone. Not all Schuhplattler societies in the US belong to it, however, making the exact numbers of clubs and participants hard to ascertain. German-Americans, Germans and Americans of other ethnic origins participate in the activities organized by individual clubs and by the Gauverband, and the clubs entertain close links with their counterparts in Germany, the Gaue of Bavaria.</p>
<p>The clubs stage Germanness (or Bavarianness, and very occasionally Tyrolianness) through various means. Their names, the iconography of their websites and the language used are invariably invested with symbolic significance, often pointing to the original Bavarian location. Floral motifs, in particular the trinity of mountain flowers depicting Bavaria and Tyrol – the red almenrausch, blue gentian and white edelweiss – dominate many websites visually. ‘Edelweiss’ and other flowers are used for numerous club names, such as Alpenrose Schuhplattler (located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania), Alpine Dancers G.T.E.V. Edelweiss (Garland, Texas), and S.G.T.V. Alpenveilchen (Alexandria, Virginia). The blue and white Bavarian flag takes pride of place on many webpages, while some clubs have created their own emblems and flags following heraldic traditions.</p>
<p>The clubs see their mission as to honour the past and their Bavarian ancestry, thus perpetuating the experience of generations. The Gauverband Nordamerika website states as its purpose (Article II):<disp-quote>
<p>… to further the common goals and interests of its member Vereine [societies] through education in regard to the preservation and perpetuation of Bavarian and Tyrolean folk dancing, Tracht [ethnic costume], customs, language, and culture, as well as the establishment of mutual fellowship. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453658">Bylaws, 2010</xref>: 20)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Paraphernalia such as nature motifs, emblems and the dances’ iconography reflect the societies’ emphasis on tradition and heritage by offering representations of their homeland’s pre-industrial past. Gender roles are strictly divided in terms of step repertory, and much pride is taken in creating and donning authentic Bavarian costumes: ladies wear dresses and perform female-connoted steps such as spinning, while male dancers display gender-typical prowess in lederhosen outfits.</p>
<p>In their representative function, the clubs operate in ways notably similar to national or regional communities. A nation, according to Hall, is ‘not only a political entity but something which produces meaning – a system of cultural representation … a symbolic community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453658">Hall, 1992</xref>: 292). Similarly, the Schuhplattler clubs are defined not solely by their singing and dancing activities, but through an entire discourse involving flags, emblems and other symbols allowing their members to construct identities above and beyond the dance itself. Like nations, the Schuhplattler clubs deploy representational strategies to imagine their communities through emphasis on narratives (such as club histories on their websites), on traditions and continuity (for instance using old-fashioned types of scripts and costumes) and by investing contemporary identities with a sense of past forms of belonging through the incorporation of a 19th-century dance culture.</p>
<p>However, rather than evoking nationalism in the strict sense of collective identification with a <italic>nation</italic> and despite sharing attributes typical of nations (such as a common language, shared culture and common stock of memories; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453658">Hall, 1992</xref>: esp. 292–3), the club members’ allegiance seems predominantly to be to the Bundesland (county) of Bavaria rather than Germany as a whole. Most websites I visited emphasized Bavarian origins rather than German national identity, as indicated by the proud display of the Bavarian flag and other emblems. Historically, when Schuhplattler became a recognizable dance form, Bavaria was an independent monarchy (from 1806) which only later joined the German Empire. The clubs’ iconography is thus in tune with a pre-1870s conception of Bavarian identity, or contemporary local ‘Bavarianness’ as distinct from national Germanness – although the distinction necessarily remains ambiguous given that Bavaria now forms part of the Federal Republic of Germany. (As a modern nation-state, the country was first unified in 1871.)</p>
<p>The clubs’ emphasis on Bavarian culture combined with the fact that non-Germans typically (and wrongly) regard such traditions as representing Germany as a whole, have provoked a backlash based on the desire to promote a more ‘modern’ image of Germany. This led to disputes within the North American Schuhplattler scene and the German diplomatic corps. Lars Halter, the Chairman of the Annual German-American Steuben Parade in New York, which organizes a march featuring Schuhplattler and associated cultural performances, announced in 2006 that ‘we need to get away from the lederhosen-and-schuhplattler monopoly’ (Halter cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453658">Grieshaber, 2006</xref>). His point emphasized the need to offer a more contemporary image which would more accurately represent the diversity of the lives of German emigrants to the United States. The German consulate spokesman in New York, Werner Schmidt, also became involved in this debate, but both he and Halter were fiercely attacked for their calls to abandon national symbolism.</p>
<p>Asked about the current impact of Schuhplattler performances on the image of Germany in North America, the current president of the Gauverband Nordamerika, Tom Vogt, wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>… I can only speculate. We do not poll our audiences now and compare the results to ten or twenty years ago, however I do believe our performances in general have moved away from the beer-swilling, bar-fighting Bavarian farmer in grey Lederhosen whooping it up at an Oktoberfest, to more properly dressed and educated groups, present[ing] a more culturally rounded performance which often includes folk dances and music as well as the Schuhplattler to present a better snapshot of the Bavarian folk near the turn of the 19th century. (email, 17 September 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Vogt was helpful in arranging communication with individual US Schuhplattler societies, and in November 2007, during an extended stay in New York City, I visited the G.T.E.V. Schlierachtaler Stamm. Founded in 1928, it is one of America’s oldest Schuhplattler societies, and is presided over today by the Hugel family.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1749975512453658">10</xref></sup> The practice I attended took place on a workday evening in Franklin Square, just outside the boundaries of New York City, in fairly basic rooms adjacent to a restaurant offering typically German meals. It included a one-hour session for children of both sexes and different ages and a subsequent adult class, accompanied by live accordion music and fairly brusque instructions from the teacher and <italic>Vorplattler</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1749975512453658">11</xref></sup> although the atmosphere grew more lively and relaxed as the evening wore on. Although most members had some German heritage, the club had also attracted participants from other ethnic backgrounds. For instance, a 13-year-old Italian girl happily mingled with other children, learning how to spin around the boys in a dance and sing German folk songs. The main language spoken during the practice was English, though many songs were sung in both English and German.</p>
<p>The club’s self-presentation manifests somewhat the tension, oft-cited in literature on the sociology of cultural globalization, between local traditions and ‘the global’. The mission of the Schlierachtaler Stamm is to maintain Bavarian folkloric traditions in the diaspora, which they do by reconstructing and adhering to a provincial, community-orientated and possibly rather mythicized image of their homeland. Their website announces that</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Schlierachtal’ – the mere name tells one this valley must lie in Bavaria between the skyscraping mountains where even today the eagle nests and the mountain goat hides from the hunter. Schlierachtal – where the river Schlierach winds its way through green, flower-covered meadows … .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ‘skyscraping mountains’ of this quotation stand in notable contrast to the reality of urban skyscrapers dominating the horizon of nearby New York City. These romantic images also appear out of tune with, or contradictory to, developments in actual German (including Bavarian) society, which underwent significant processes of heterogenization during the wars and particularly after the Second World War, when West German society became more cosmopolitan, individualistic and globally-orientated. As Jarausch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512453658">Jarausch and Geyer, 2003</xref>: 237) writes: ‘West German society experienced a process of Americanisation of popular culture in film, music, dress fashion, leisure habits, and the like, that removed many of the traditional hallmarks of “Germanness”’. During times of rapid Americanization within Germany, notably the interwar period and the 1950s, large numbers of Schuhplattler societies were founded by migrants to the US – like the Schlierachtaler Stamm. It is possible that this was partly in reaction to, and compensation for, the strong influence of American culture both on their country of birth and everyday life in the USA.</p>
<p>Relatedly, it is notable that certain informal interviews I conducted at the club testified to a critical stance towards globalization (and specifically Americanization). Asked about his motives for sending his children to Schuhplattler classes, a male member of partly German, partly Slovakian ethnicity acknowledged that he sought to commemorate and keep alive the family’s uniquely German cultural identity. Another reason, he added, was the attempt to resist globalization trends: for example he cited the much-maligned spread of fast-food chains in Bavaria (conversation from 14 November 2007). The foundation of Schuhplattler societies in the US is a manifestation of cultural flows resulting from German nationals’ increasing geographical, specifically cross-border, mobility in the wake of (early) globalization; yet for some members the dance expresses a resistance to globalization processes. Thus their migration engenders a reinforcement and reassertion of the ‘local’ (here: local ethnic cultures) in response to the globalization ‘threat’.</p>
<p>During the evening I received a booklet marking the club’s 75th anniversary and consecration of its flag, which took place in 2003. I was surprised that renowned politicians – among them Hillary Clinton, then US senator, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Secretary of State for Bavaria Edmund Stoiber – all extended personalized greetings to commemorate the milestone, an honour which might more frequently be bestowed on major professional ballet companies than on amateur dance clubs. The letters unanimously highlight the club’s role in maintaining German heritage, in recognition of the significance of German folk art both as an embodiment of the German immigrant population’s identity and as an element of US cultural life.</p>
<p>The congratulations of George Pataki, Governor of the State of New York, are particularly intriguing: ‘Members of your Club are inspired by an appreciation for their ancestry and also by those values held by our American forefathers – freedom and democracy’ (letter dated 12 October 2003). I read his juxtaposition of German ‘ancestry’ – implying the conservative value of maintaining heritage – and American ‘freedom’ as attempting to acknowledge the worth of (overseas) cultural and ethnic traditions while reminding the reader of core American values. Pataki thus disassociates the Schuhplattler clubs from an image of essentialized Germanness which would be incompatible with US identity.</p>
<p>This capacity to assert specific local identities while simultaneously sharing in broader (in this case, American) ones is of course a key tenet of multiculturalism. Multiculturalist stances involve ‘a positive endorsement of communal diversity’ which is deemed beneficial to cultural groups or to a wider society in which ‘cultural difference can be reconciled with civic unity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512453658">Heywood, 2007</xref>: 310). Pataki’s desire to align German traditions with the pillars of American values is indicative of such a stance, as it seeks to balance cultural differences with a common civic allegiance. Moreover, the ‘cosmopolitan’ version of multiculturalism advocated by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453658">Jeremy Waldron (1996)</xref> accepts that people can hold multiple identities and loyalties simultaneously; for instance both to their country of origin (in this case Germany) and their country of settlement (the USA). Waldron indeed argues that a modern individual’s identity often cannot be defined by his or her membership of a <italic>single</italic> identifiable culture, but is invariably composed of multifarious attachments and affiliations reflecting a range of different influences:<disp-quote>
<p>We need a notion of respect for persons that is sensitive to … the fact that each individual’s identity is multicultural and that individuals can no longer be regarded in the modern world (if indeed they ever could be) as mere artefacts of the culture of the one community to which we think they ought to belong. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453658">Waldron, 1996</xref>: 114)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>US Schuhplattler clubs can be seen as a microcosm of the ethnic, cultural, and language diversification which is central to multiculturalism and which characterizes the social melting-pot of American society. The practice of Schuhplattler dancing has naturally been removed from its original Austro-German community context, as reflected for instance by the shift from German to English as the main teaching language, and the mix of English and German song lyrics. Most poignant, however, is the clubs’ acceptance of a pluralistic membership composition which effectively redefines local identity. Its welcoming of other ethnic groups and part-Germans has created new ‘floating’ identities which disrupt the logic of essentialized German- (or more precisely Bavarian-)ness. The experience of the Italian girl performing Bavarian dance in New York is typical of 21st-century cultural crossovers, and could be seen as manifesting a cosmopolitan multiculturalist stance which positively embraces cultural ‘mixing’ as broadening people’s social horizons. The non-first-generation German members and part-Germans inhabit the interstices between the stereotyped notion of the homeland and the wider host-society, hence partaking in at least two different cultural traditions. It was obvious that for many of these culturally and ethnically diverse participants, Schuhplattler had become an important tool in <italic>producing</italic> a collective identity, rather than <italic>reproducing</italic> and strengthening a national (or local Bavarian) identity which is assumed a priori.</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier, the emerging mixtures of existing social practices, ethnicities and cultural values in American Schuhplattler typify the hybridization of dance which has become commonplace in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Rowe and Schelling define hybridization as ‘the ways in which [cultural] forms become separated from existing practices and recombine with new forms in new practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1749975512453658">Rowe and Schelling, 1991</xref>: 231). Whilst in our case study hybridization consists mostly in the club’s membership composition and only marginally extends to the dance itself (and then through the bilingual song accompaniment rather than the dance’s actual iconography), there are numerous examples from the professional arts world of Schuhplattler being combined with distinctly different dance forms to create exciting new fusion techniques. For instance, American choreographer Agnes de Mille’s work <italic>The Other</italic> (1993) is a poignant example of the blending of Schuhplattler with a contemporary (i.e. a Western concert) dance genre. This, however, must be addressed in more depth elsewhere.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Schuhplattler has been used as a medium through which émigrés have constructed their self-image and image of their country of origin. Both Young Austria and the G.T.E.V. Schlierachtaler Stamm have created distinct senses of diasporic identity among Austrian and German migrants. They have commonalities in that they share collective memories and myths about their homeland, not only showing loyalty but idealizing their putative ancestral home by recourse to beautified, rural imaginings which conflict somewhat with contemporary lifestyles and dominant ideologies. Both subscribe to collectivist values, emphasizing the capacity of culture to generate social and political cohesion.</p>
<p>The dance’s global dissemination has resulted in its pluralistic and versatile use which is reflected, at amateur club level, less in its expressive possibilities than in its socio-political implications. Young Austria’s deployment of Schuhplattler manifests a cultural form of long-distance nationalism allied to progressive left-leaning politics. Group members used folk art to promote a concrete political cause: Austrian freedom and independence. For them, Schuhplattler dancing expressed a longing to return to their homeland, resulting in their being emotionally ‘more interested in the image of their country of origin than the country they <italic>currently</italic> live in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453658">Anderson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Members of contemporary US Schuhplattler clubs, who often migrated more or less voluntarily in pursuit of work or trade, pursue a conservative politics of preservation (the maintenance of cultural traditions over time) with respect to a homeland to which they have no immediate intention of returning. They effectively use folk art as an expressive cultural tool to guarantee continuity by ‘building the Future from the Strength of our Past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453658">Schlierachtaler Stamm, n.d.</xref>), and their allegiance lies with a regional locality within Germany (Bavaria in particular) rather than the nation as a whole. As I have argued, however, their local loyalties overlap with global identifications, and the clubs’ apparent conservatism is tempered by the enactment of a form of cosmopolitan multiculturalism.</p>
<p>The purposes of both movements are at odds with Schuhplattler’s use in the Third Reich, which imposed a strict monoculture founded on extreme nationalism. Consequently, the dance form grappled with the post-1945 resentments of left-wing intellectuals and others who portrayed it as expressing smugly conservative attitudes or, as was claimed in a 1980 document by the American Association of Teachers of German, being ‘very parochial’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512453658">Smith, 1980</xref>: 41). It is, however, important to remember that its deployment has oscillated between conservatism and even fascism to left-leaning politics, and from monoculturalism to multiculturalism. Schuhplattler practice is thus a clear indicator of cultural changes and shifting ideologies in the 20th and early 21st centuries, and of the different ways in which people seek to define themselves in the diaspora. The extent to which the ensuing hybridization of the dance will change its future reception and character remains to be seen.</p>
