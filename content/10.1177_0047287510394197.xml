<p>In this study, the validity of a measure of festival consumption emotions and the recollection consistency of visitors’ emotional experiences at festivals over time and across settings was examined. Data were collected from festival visitors using an on-site and postvisit survey in Texas. It was found that measures of a six-dimensional product consumption emotions scale were valid and reliable for festival visitors over time. Despite some differences in the type and strength of emotional descriptors across the studies, festival visitors experienced moderate levels of positive emotions when asked to rate their affective states both during and after their visit. Our results demonstrate that respondents reported a higher intensity of positive emotions but reported a consistent intensity of neutral and negative emotions when asked to evaluate their emotions on-site during their festival visit. Based on these findings, we provide practical and theoretical insights and offer suggestions for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of emotion in understanding consumer behavior and making evaluative judgments has attracted the attention of a number of researchers in recent decades. It has been suggested that affective states can play an important role in consumers’ evaluation of individuals or situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287510394197">Schwartz and Clore 1988</xref>). Peoples’ emotions create certain environmental cues that become more salient and evoke deeper information processing and better memory elicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287510394197">Chebat 2002</xref>). These emotions also afford judgmental responses that are (1) generally faster, (2) more consistent across individuals, and (3) more predictive of people’s thoughts when compared to nonaffective, reason-based evaluations of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287510394197">Pham et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers in the fields of tourism and service marketing have investigated the effect of emotion on consumer behavior and attitudes at various settings such as hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287510394197">Barsky and Nash 2002</xref>), tourist attractions and destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287510394197">Bigné, Andreu, and Gnoth 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287510394197">Lee et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287510394197">Tsaur, Chiu, and Wang 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287510394197">Zins 2002</xref>), fitness clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510394197">Collishaw, Dyer, and Boies 2008</xref>), and retail stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287510394197">Yüksel 2007</xref>). In these studies, emotions were measured using (1) real-time assessments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287510394197">Bigné, Andreu, and Gnoth 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510394197">Collishaw, Dyer, and Boies 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287510394197">Lee et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287510394197">Tsaur, Chiu, and Wang 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287510394197">Yüksel 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287510394197">Zins 2002</xref>), (2) retrospective evaluations of affective states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287510394197">Barsky and Nash 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287510394197">Westbrook and Oliver 1991</xref>), and (3) conjectural assessments inferred from hypothetical situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287510394197">Mano and Oliver 1993</xref>). Of these techniques, measurement of either immediate affective states using on-site interception methods or retrospective emotions using postvisit appraisal approaches have most commonly been used to assess emotional experiences in tourism product/service consumption contexts. Whereas the former approach is inclined to ensure contextual similarity across sample populations, the latter approach inevitably allows some degree of variance in self-reported past emotions across respondents because of a lack of control in the context and environments where the assessment is made. Therefore, studies of postconsumption emotions may not be free from the bias.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that emotions are considered to be dynamic phenomena that are dependent on the individual, the context, and the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287510394197">Kuppens, Stouten, and Mesquita 2009</xref>). Research in psychology has shown that self-reported retrospective emotions tend to deviate from actual emotional experiences because of individuals’ inability to accurately express their emotions postexperience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287510394197">Robinson and Clore 2002</xref>), differences in personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510394197">Barrett 1997</xref>) and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510394197">Dubé and Morgan 1996</xref>), and reflection of and inferences from current appraisals of events and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287510394197">Diener and his colleagues (1985)</xref> further maintain that the structure of emotions felt at a particular point in time is not the same as the structure of emotions within individuals over time. Therefore, there may be potential for variation in visitors’ affective states depending on when and where they are measured. While a few psychological studies have investigated the accuracy of emotional memory recall (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510394197">Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener 1990</xref>), little work on the consistency of emotion recollection has been done in the context of tourism.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the present study examined (1) the construct validity of a measure of festival consumption emotions across time and settings and (2) the variation in visitors’ recall of their emotional experiences at festivals over time. We have drawn on and extended work on product consumption emotions appearing in the consumer behavior literature and on memory accuracy of retrospective emotions appearing in the psychology literature. In the following review of the literature, we first define the key constructs underlying consumption emotions and present how taxonomies of emotions have evolved in the literature. We also review research findings on the stability of recalling past emotional states in psychology and address the sources that cause affective memory distortion. We then discuss two common approaches used to evaluate tourism product consumption emotions―namely, on-site interception and postvisit appraisal approaches.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0047287510394197">
<title>Conceptualizing Consumption Emotions</title>
<p>Emotions are understood to be a mental reaction consciously experienced as a subjective feeling state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287510394197">Westbrook 1987</xref>). Principally, consumption emotion refers to “the set of emotional responses elicited specifically during product usage or consumption experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287510394197">Westbrook and Oliver 1991</xref>: 85). Emotions are distinguishable from related affective mood states in terms of psychological urgency, motivational potency, and situational specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287510394197">Westbrook and Oliver 1991</xref>). Alternately, mood is a temporary state of affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287510394197">Gardner 1985</xref>) that is “the feeling side of consciousness, as opposed to thinking, which taps the cognitive domain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287510394197">Oliver 1997</xref>: 294). Despite the broader nature of emotion, including arousal and the cognitive domain of affect, emotion and affect are often used interchangeably in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287510394197">Oliver 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although several taxonomies of emotion have been proposed (e.g., Izard 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287510394197">Mehrabian and Russell 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287510394197">Plutchik 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins 1997</xref>), these existing scales have been criticized for their tendency to overrepresent negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287510394197">Mano and Oliver 1993</xref>) and for covering too broad a range of fundamental emotional responses to physical and social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins 1997</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287510394197">Mehrabian and Russell’s (1974)</xref> three dimensions of emotional states (i.e., pleasure, arousal, and dominance) that account for people’s emotional responses to physical environments are too general to maintain a psychologically consistent representation of complex human emotions. Similarly, Izard’s (1997) Differential Emotions Scale (DES) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287510394197">Plutchik’s (1980)</xref> Emotions Profile Index (EPI) tend to take account of more negative and less positive emotions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins (1997)</xref> has argued that emotions are more context-specific and that different emotions are salient depending on the context in which they are used. Richins introduced the Consumption Emotion Set (CES) scale as an alternative to existing scales, to describe emotions elicited in product consumption experiences. She found the CES to be superior to other measurement instruments in assessing the various emotions present in consumption situations. The results of her study also indicated that the possession of different product classes (e.g., sentimental objects, recreational products, and vehicles) evoked strong positive emotions of “joy,” “pride,” and “contentment” but weak negative emotions. Her scale was adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287510394197">Collishaw, Dyer, and Boies (2008)</xref> to examine the impact of customers’ perceptions of instructors’ emotional expressions on customer satisfaction and loyalty to a fitness club. Despite the recent work by Collishaw, Dyer, and Boies, evidence of construct validity for consumption emotions within tourist contexts remains lacking.</p>

<title>Recalling Emotions</title>
<p>Memory of emotional experience is reconstructed on the basis of past experience and current beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510394197">Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>). It involves the active reconstructive process that affords the opportunity for many different cognitive and motivational biases to come into play during reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287510394197">Watson and Spence 2007</xref>). Consequently, individuals tend to give a biased account of their emotions when asked to recall their past emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener 1990</xref>). Over time, people depend more on semantic cues of general beliefs to recall their emotional experience and less on episodic memories of emotions that are retrieved in their recall of specific details of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287510394197">Robinson and Clore 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals’ inconsistent accounts of emotions experienced in the past are particularly true of past sensory experiences such as pain. Clinical psychologists have maintained that people’s recollections of past states of pain are frequently inaccurate and biased in the direction of current experience. Such recollections were further found to have only moderate correlations with initial reports of pain intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287510394197">Erskine, Morley, and Pearce 1990</xref>). In a review of the literature on the memory of pain, Erskine, Morley, and Pearce reported that recall of acute pain was more accurate than recall of chronic pain. They also stated that the intensity of chronic pain was found to be typically overestimated in recall while acute pain such as childbirth was underestimated.</p>
<p>Past work in psychology has also investigated memory for past emotions focusing on the stability and accuracy of recalling emotional states in both clinical and nonclinical settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510394197">Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287510394197">Schmidt 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287510394197">Sotgiu 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener 1990</xref>). In clinical settings, most studies have examined the recall of emotional reactions and their consistency in memories of particular instances of great personal significance or traumatic events such as a presidential candidate’s withdrawal from the race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>), the September 11 attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287510394197">Schmidt 2004</xref>), and flooding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287510394197">Sotgiu 2007</xref>). The findings of these studies generally support the hypothesis that memories for emotional responses are partially reconstructed or are inferred through current appraisals of events.</p>
<p>In nonclinical settings, researchers have suggested inconsistency with the recollection of emotions over time. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener (1990)</xref> asked students to rate the intensity and frequency with which they had experienced momentary and daily affective states such as happiness, depression, and anger for three or six weeks. They found that their subjects overestimated the intensities of both their positive and negative emotions and underestimated the frequency of positive affect over time. Their findings imply that people―students in this case―tend to be very emotional in their lives and to recall negative feelings more readily than positive feelings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287510394197">
<title>Sources of Affective Memory Distortion</title>
<p>Psychologists have noted several sources that contribute to the distortion of emotional memory over time. The bias of retrospective emotions is attributed to individuals’ capacity to remember and integrate subtle distinctions in expressing their experiences when they report on bygone emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287510394197">Robinson and Clore 2002</xref>). It is particularly pertinent to mixed feelings (i.e., combination of positive and negative feelings). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510394197">Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin (2008)</xref> in their study of the recollection of mixed emotions, the intensity of mixed emotions is reported to be underrated at the time of recall and increased over time compared to that of unipolar emotions. They maintained that the former is much more difficult to accurately recall over time than the latter because of its complex nature. Therefore, it is easier and more accurate for people to recall unipolar emotions such as happiness and sadness when asked to rate the degree to which they felt emotions.</p>
<p>Another possible reason behind the distorted memory of past emotions is the occurrence of the so-called “rosy view” phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287510394197">Mitchell et al. 1997</xref>). The rosy view effect undermines people’s negative accounts of their experience during the event more than before or after the event. Because of its nature, retrospective evaluations of emotional states magnify more positive and less negative emotions compared with the actual emotional experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287510394197">Gilbert et al. 1998</xref>). For instance, Mitchell and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287510394197">1997</xref>) conducted a study on people’s recollection of meaningful life events (i.e., a trip to Europe, a Thanksgiving vacation, and a bicycle trip). They found that people’s subsequent recollection of the event was more positive than the actual experience because the overall enjoyment of the memory may not be considerably affected by negative feelings (e.g., distractions and disappointment) that, while salient during the actual experience, do not last long.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine (1997)</xref> has also noted that cognitive theory of emotions explains how current experience might bias memory of past emotions. Cognitive theories of emotions highlight that people experience emotions when they either consciously or unconsciously evaluate events on the basis of (1) their goals that are facilitated or obstructed, (2) who and what have control over the stimulus event, and (3) the level of certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287510394197">Watson and Spence 2007</xref>). When there are discrepancies in people’s memories for their past emotions as a result of appraisals, emotional memories may be reconstructed based on recollection of both emotion-evoking circumstances and past evaluations of those circumstances. If people have experienced a drastic change in their appraisals since the occurrence of the emotion-eliciting event, they may report a distorted recall of emotions that is consistent with their current appraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287510394197">Levine 1997</xref>). A study of emotional memory for appraisal of events with personal significance by Levine provided empirical support for these theories. She asked 133 Ross Perot supporters to recall their initial emotional reactions after the sudden withdrawal of his presidential candidacy and then following a four-month period. She observed that the initial emotions of Perot supporters who devoted their personal time and effort toward getting him elected varied based on their interpretation of the reasons for the candidate’s withdrawal. Supporters who regarded his withdrawal as a permanent loss reported the greatest intensity of sadness. Those who blamed him for his withdrawal reported the greatest intensity of anger, while those who believed that he still might be elected (i.e., achievement of their ultimate goal) reported the greatest intensity of hope.</p>

<title>Real-Time versus Retrospective Evaluations of Tourism Product Consumption Emotions</title>
<p>Emotions engendered in tourism product/service consumption contexts have commonly been measured either during an on-site interception or with postvisit appraisal methods. The former approach is associated with an evaluation of an individual’s current affective state, which tends to be influenced by immediate environmental attributes and conditions. Because of the fact that aspects of the environment and conditions in which the on-site assessment is made can be controlled by the researcher, on-site appraisals may share contextual similarity across sample populations. Alternately, postconsumption assessments of emotion rely on extensive introspection of overall emotional states after the visit to the destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287510394197">Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin 2008</xref>). There may be some discrepancy between on-site and postexperience measures of emotion because the latter are dependent on memory recall of past contextual situations.</p>
<p>Emotions are also considered to be a dynamic and time-dependent phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287510394197">Kuppens, Stouten, and Mesquita 2009</xref>). Over the course of a festival visitor’s experience (i.e., anticipation, travel to and from the festival, on-site experiences, and recollection), self-reported emotions may vary in type and intensity. For instance, a visitor may feel a moderate level of anxiety and joy on the way to the festival but, later, he or she might feel a high level of joy and surprise after having had a good time at the festival. Similarly, a visitor’s emotional experiences felt on-site are likely to differ from those when recalling his or her past emotions. This may be because the assessment occurring at the time or place after the actual visit affords an opportunity for respondents to move from their usual contexts and make introspective appraisals of past emotions. It is probable that the postvisit emotion evaluations of the visitors’ festival experience are influenced by immediate contexts.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the validity and stability of a measure of festival consumption emotions over time and across settings. Adapting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins’s (1997)</xref> CES, we measured reported intensity of visitors’ emotions during their visit to three community-based festivals in Texas and again at four to six months following their visit.</p>

<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0047287510394197">
<title>Study Sites</title>
<p>Three community festivals in Texas were chosen as study sites. The Poteet Strawberry Festival, which is located about 20 miles south of San Antonio, is one of the oldest and largest agricultural festivals held in Texas each year and currently attracts nearly 100,000 visitors during the three-day event. The Pasadena Strawberry Festival, also held annually, is located in Pasadena, Texas, and receives about 55,000 attendees from Houston and surrounding communities. These two strawberry festivals provide visitors with food and various entertainment attractions at designated sites over a three-day period. The Texas Reds Steak &amp; Grape Festival, which drew approximately 6,000 to 8,000 visitors in its first year in 2007, is an annual, two-day event held in June celebrating Texas’s beef and wine industries. The festival allows visitors to enjoy food and wine offerings and to take part in various activities themed around wine tasting and steak cook-offs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0047287510394197">
<title>Sampling and Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Data were collected in two phases using on-site and follow-up survey procedures. The first phase, the on-site survey, was conducted from April to June 2008 through collaborations with festival organizers at the three study sites. On-site surveys were administered over three days at various sites at the two strawberry festivals and over two days at the wine and steak festival. Identical procedures for distributing questionnaires were used to measure overall visitors’ emotions during their festival visit. To limit response bias and ensure the representativeness of the sample population, at approximately 15-minute intervals, trained interviewers distributed self-administered questionnaires to individuals within randomly selected groups who had spent some time at various venues (e.g., food venues and event arenas) at each site. We ensured that festival goers who just arrived at study sites were excluded in our sample population. Of those who were asked to participated in the on-site survey, one of three festival visitors, on average, elected not to take part in the survey because of a lack of interest, being preoccupied with festival activities, or attending accompanying visitors. Altogether, 743 individuals at the three festivals completed the survey questionnaire. After eliminating visitors whose mailing and/or e-mail addresses were missing or invalid, 579 potential respondents were identified for the next phase of data collection. The response rate for the first phase was 77.9%.</p>
<p>The second phase involved a follow-up survey procedure using postal mail and/or e-mail/Internet. Based on the preference of a follow-up survey distribution method indicated by respondents in the previous phase, individuals received a self-administered survey questionnaire via postal mail and/or e-mail/Internet. This mixed-mode approach has recently caught survey researchers’ and evaluators’ attention as a method to produce higher response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287510394197">Converse et al. 2008</xref>). Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287510394197">Dillman’s (2007)</xref> Tailored Design Method, a three-wave survey questionnaire and a postcard reminder were distributed to subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 579) either via postal mail or e-mail over a six-week period. Although the survey questionnaire addressed a range of issues and constructs, we only present findings related to our emotion measures. A total of 228 questionnaires were returned in six weeks; 12 questionnaires that did not match responses in the previous stage were omitted from data analyses. Of these, 89 were from the Poteet Strawberry Festival, 58 were from the Pasadena Strawberry Festival, and 69 were from the Texas Reds Steak &amp; Grape Festival. Therefore, the overall effective response rate for the three events at the second phase was 37.3%.</p>
<p>Nonresponse bias was examined using chi-square and independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Sociodemographics and trip characteristics were compared between respondents who completed both surveys and who participated in the on-site survey but did not respond to the later survey. There were no significant differences between these two groups in terms of gender, attendance patterns, and purpose of trips. Although statistically significant differences in the mean age scores were found between respondents (<italic>M</italic> = 40.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.98) and nonrespondents (<italic>M</italic> = 37.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.60, <italic>t</italic>(729) = −2.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the magnitude of their difference was very small (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287510394197">Cohen 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Exploratory Test for Survey Instrument Construction</title>
<p>Instead of directly adapting existing scales, we carried out a four-stage exploratory study prior to formal data collection at the designated sites to identify emotions that best reflected festival visitors’ emotional experiences. First, an open-ended survey was used to compile the full range of emotions relevant to the festival context by asking 34 individuals (e.g., university students and staff members) who had visited a similar type of agricultural festival in Texas within the past six months to list adjectives that best described their feelings experienced when visiting a festival. A large variety of festival-related emotions (<italic>n</italic> = 81) were documented in this stage.</p>
<p>The second stage consisted of compiling the emotion descriptors and incorporating these with other emotional descriptors identified in earlier studies. Based on the criteria by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287510394197">Ortony, Clore, and Collins (1988)</xref>, we eliminated irrelevant emotion descriptors: (1) words referring to physiological states (e.g., “hungry”), (2) subjective evaluations that become emotion-like only when juxtaposed with the word “feeling” (e.g., “feeling confident”), (3) behaviors (e.g., “talkative”), (4) action-tendency words (e.g., “hesitant”), and (5) cognitive in nature (e.g., “interested”). As a result, 89 emotion items were included for the subsequent stage.</p>
<p>The third stage involved reducing these 89 emotion descriptors by eliminating words that were unfamiliar or rarely used by respondents. A total of 104 undergraduate students were asked to indicate, on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>least likely</italic>, 4 = <italic>most likely</italic>), how likely it was that they would use a particular descriptor. They were also asked to indicate a word that was unfamiliar to them. Through frequency analysis, the items that were indicated as unfamiliar by more than 5% of the sample (e.g., “jittery”) and had mean likelihood ratings less than 0.5 (e.g., “humiliated”) were removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287510394197">Francis and Kucera 1982</xref>). As a result, a total of 47 emotion descriptors were retained.</p>
<p>The remaining 47 items were categorized under the six basic emotions (i.e., <italic>Love, Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear</italic>, and <italic>Surprise</italic>) proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287510394197">Shaver et al.’s (1987)</xref> prototype analysis. This procedure is particularly useful (1) to avoid redundancy by sorting out synonymous words, (2) to identify emotions that are most relevant and frequently used by average people, and (3) to understand the hierarchical relations of those emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287510394197">Shaver et al. 1987</xref>). After eliminating the subcategorical descriptors with a substantially lower likelihood of usage rating within a basic category, we obtained 24 emotion descriptors specific to the festivals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287510394197">Table 2</xref>). The order of positive and negative emotions was systematically alternated to reduce response bias and identical in the two stages of data collection. Using these 24 emotion adjectives, we asked festival visitors to rate the degree to which they were experiencing each adjective using a 5-point Likert-type scale where 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> through 5 = <italic>extremely much</italic>. Assessment of emotional intensity is more accurate than assessment of the frequency because of the ability to recall one’s emotion as they were felt at the time of experience with reference to the current state of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In the following analyses, we begin by comparing an on-site assessment of festival consumption emotions with a postvisit affective state estimate. First, we examined the construct validity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins’s (1997)</xref> product consumption emotions within festival settings using confirmatory factor analysis. Next, we performed paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test analyses using the pooled data collected from the three study sites to investigate difference in the intensity of on-site and postvisit festival consumption emotions over time and among the festival contexts.</p>

<title>Characteristics of Respondents</title>
<p>Sociodemographic and trip characteristics of respondents from the three festivals are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287510394197">Table 1</xref>. Overall, the respondents at the three festivals were predominantly white, female with an average age of 41 years. Approximately half of all respondents in each of the surveys indicated that they had graduated from college and/or earned an advanced degree. In terms of annual household income, respondents to the Pasadena Strawberry Festival and Texas Reds Steak &amp; Grape Festival survey reported higher incomes than respondents from the Poteet Strawberry Festival survey. Yet, there was no statistically significant difference in household income among the respondents across the three study sites. More than half of festival visitors were nonlocal, repeat visitors. Visitors categorized into local residents in this study are defined as individuals who lived within the city/town limit of the festival.</p>

<title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis of Festival Consumption Emotions: On-Site vs. Postvisit Measures</title>
<p>To prevent data- and measurement-related problems, data screening and correction were performed. Using PRELIS, this procedure involves three steps: (1) checking the data set for errors and outliers, (2) dealing with missing observations in the data file, and (3) screening the data to check the normal distribution of observed variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287510394197">Kline 2005</xref>). Inspection of the <italic>z</italic> score distributions and the Mahalanobis distance statistics revealed that none of the individual scores were considered extreme. For the next step, incomplete observations in which these data vary from 0.5% to 23.1% were replaced with values drawn from a multivariate distribution representing the true sample parameters using a robust multiple imputation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287510394197">Allison 2001</xref>). This procedure is essential to ensure the accuracy and the statistical power and validity of results when data are not missing at random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287510394197">Sinharay, Stern, and Russell 2001</xref>). The items of the emotions scale were further transformed into normal scores to meet the normal distribution requirement of SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287510394197">Jöreskog and Sörbom 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tested the structural validity of our conceptualization of emotion measured during and after the visit using CFA in LISREL 8.8. The factor structure of festival consumption emotions in this study is derived from theory and past empirical research. Our CFA model hypothesizes, a priori, that (1) emotions are explained by a certain factor structure, (2) each measurement item has a nonzero loading on the factor it was designed to measure and zero loadings on all other factors, (3) all factors are correlated, and (4) measurement error terms are uncorrelated. In addition to parameter estimates, the fit indices of the measurement model are also reported. The goodness-of-fit indices used to empirically assess model fit were the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287510394197">Steiger and Lind 1980</xref>), the nonnormed fit index (NNFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287510394197">Bentler and Bonnett 1980</xref>), and the comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287510394197">Bentler 1990</xref>). A review of the various fit indices, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287510394197">Table 2</xref>, revealed that the hypothesized model comprised six dimensions of emotions (i.e., <italic>Love, Joy, Surprise, Anger, Sadness</italic>, and <italic>Fear</italic>) was an adequate fit to the sample data for both on-site, Satorra-Bentler χ<sup>2</sup>(237) = 317.08, RMSEA = 0.05, NNFI = 0.98, CFI = 0.98, and postvisit measures, Satorra-Bentler χ<sup>2</sup>(237) = 278.44, RMSEA = 0.04, NNFI = 0.99, CFI = 0.99. Furthermore, parameter estimates of the emotional descriptor had correct signs, sizes, and appropriate standard errors, which indicated their statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287510394197">Byrne 1998</xref>). An investigation of composite reliability of each factor showed that all values of both measures were far higher than the recommended threshold (i.e., greater than 0.60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287510394197">Bagozzi and Yi 1988</xref>), thereby indicating acceptable reliabilities. It is evident that the postvisit estimates of festival visitors’ emotional experience had a slightly better fit to the data than the on-site estimates based on the fit indices and factor loadings. Therefore, the six-factor model of festival consumption emotions was found to be valid for visitors to the festivals across time.</p>

<p>To determine whether the difference in intensity was statistically significant for on-site versus postvisit estimates, paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test analyses were conducted. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287510394197">Table 3</xref>, on-site estimates of some positive emotional descriptors were found to be significantly higher than postvisit emotion estimates. These positive emotions included “caring” and “compassionate” in the <italic>Love</italic> category, and “happy,” “pleased,” and “joyful” in the <italic>Joy</italic> category. Respondents also reported a higher score on the on-site estimate of “surprised” in the <italic>Surprise</italic> category compared to the postvisit evaluation. Interestingly, only one negative emotion such as “unsatisfied” was overestimated in the postvisit evaluation. It should be noted that the descriptors with statistical significance in the <italic>t</italic>-test analyses had medium or small effect sizes ranging from 0.22 to 0.40, which indicates the marginal differences in their mean scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287510394197">Cohen 1988</xref>). Results of this procedure were consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287510394197">Gilbert et al.’s (1998)</xref> claim that the recall of emotions tends to become more positive and less negative than the actual emotional experience. Even though one’s positive emotional experience is reduced at the moment when one felt the disappointment during an actual experience, one does not necessarily remember the emotional experience negatively.</p>
<p>We further investigated the differences in these two different estimates across study sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287510394197">Table 4</xref>). The results displayed a similar pattern to the recall of aggregate emotional experiences illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287510394197">Table 3</xref>, although the emotion descriptors with significant differences in mean scores of both estimates varied across the festivals. At a glance, visitors were likely to report more intense emotions in their real-time experience than in the retrospective evaluation; however, the types of these positive emotions varied depending on the festivals. For instance, visitors to both strawberry festivals experienced stronger feeling of “compassionate” whereas festival goers to the Texas Reds Wine &amp; Steak Festival experienced significantly greater “pleased,” “cheerful,” and “joyful” feelings during their visit than they did during their emotional recollection. Taking <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287510394197">Table 4</xref> at face value, retrospective intensity appraisals of some negative emotions such as <italic>Anger</italic> and <italic>Sadness</italic> were lower in comparison with the intensity estimates of actual emotions. It appears that the longer the estimate duration between the on-site and postvisit study, the higher intensity are negative estimates of emotions. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the mean scores of negative emotions across the three festivals.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the validity and reliability of a measure of festival consumption emotions over time. Our results demonstrated that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins’s (1997)</xref> product CES consisting of six dimensions is valid for the emotions engendered from festival consumption contexts across time and settings. Although there was a slight difference in model fit between on-site and postvisit festival consumption emotions, measures of the six dimensions of emotions (i.e., <italic>Love, Joy, Surprise, Anger, Sadness</italic>, and <italic>Fear</italic>) were found to be valid and reliable for festival visitors across time (i.e., on-site and postexperience recollection). We found that the positive emotions of <italic>Love</italic> and <italic>Joy</italic> were most salient, while neutral and negative emotions were seldom experienced by festival visitors both during and after their visit. We also observed that the factor structure of on-site emotions was identical to that of postvisit emotions, which is incongruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287510394197">Diener et al.’s (1985)</xref> claim that the structure of emotions felt at a particular point in time is not same as the structure of affect within persons over time. It is important to note that although the factor structure of emotions was most appropriately described by a six-factor model for both assessments, our data indicated that postconsumption estimates were better representations than on-site emotion estimates evidenced in higher factor loadings and goodness-of-fit indices based on the underlying assumption of this study that we measured festival goers’ on-site emotional experience reasonably accurately.</p>
<p>The salient emotions experienced by festival visitors in this study are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins’s (1997)</xref> CES, which includes a set of emotion measures in the context of durable goods consumption and generic personal services. Her study found that positive emotions were most salient while few negative emotions were reported in all product consumption situations. Our findings are also consistent with findings of previous studies that have investigated tourism product consumption emotions in tourist attraction contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287510394197">Bigné, Andreu, and Gnoth 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287510394197">Tsaur, Chiu, and Wang 2006</xref>). In sum, despite some differences in the type and strength of emotional descriptors across the studies, positive emotions appear to be the dominant form of visitors’ affective experiences in response to the physical/social environment encountered at each of the festivals across time. As indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287510394197">Diener and Emmons (1984)</xref>, when a person strongly experiences positive emotions at the time when affective states are measured, he or she never simultaneously strongly feels negative emotions.</p>
<p>Another purpose of our study was to assess the consistency of emotional memory across time and settings. The analysis of emotion memory consistency revealed that there were statistically significant differences in mean scores of self-reported positive emotion estimates. Overall, respondents tended to report higher intensity levels of positive and neutral emotions, but a lower intensity of negative emotions when asked to evaluate their emotions during their festival visit in comparison with when asked to recollect their past emotional experience at their usual environment. Similar to the aggregate data, it was also found that some positive emotional descriptors were underrated at the time of recall. Yet, the types of emotions that were significantly different between the in situ and postexperience measures also varied across festival sites. No significant discrepancy was observed in the intensity of negative emotions between on-site and postvisit estimates across study sites.</p>
<p>If any general statement can be made based on these findings, it is that the accuracy of retrospective reports of festival visitors’ emotional experiences varies contingent on the types of emotional descriptors across study sites. The study results illustrate that festival visitors’ recall of their positive emotions during the visit is inconsistent with their on-site evaluations of positive emotions across settings. When people were asked to recall their past emotional experiences during their festival visit, they were inclined to underrate their positive emotions while providing a fairly accurate account of negative emotions. It should be noted that the magnitude of the difference between on-site and postvisit estimates was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>To some extent, our findings support previous research documenting that memories of emotions are inaccurate reflections of actual emotions. The results of our study are partially consistent with the findings of Thomas and Diener, which suggest that subjects’ intensity estimates of both past positive and negative emotions were statistically lower than those of the actual positive emotions. Yet, our study findings are inconsistent with the retrospective rosy effect associated with both an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions at the time of the recollection of vacation experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287510394197">Mitchell et al. 1997</xref>). The inconsistent patterns of inaccurate recall of emotions across studies may be attributable to dichotomous indicators that existing research has used, which have the potential to mask the construct’s complexity. Consequently, the findings of these studies provide little insight on temporal and contextual differences in specific feeling states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins 1997</xref>). This makes direct comparisons between our work and past research a little more challenging. Inconsistent results across studies are also attributed to the absence of a measure of an individual’s actual emotional experiences with which to compare his or her recollections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener 1990</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287510394197">Richins (1997)</xref>, research findings on emotions are context-specific and, therefore, not easily generalized.</p>
<p>This study also provides theoretical insight into the construct validity of emotions engendered in festival contexts across time and settings. We extend past work on the consistency of self-reported past emotion recollection in psychology and consumer behavior. Although this study is exploratory, we believe our findings contribute to the literature in confirming the pattern of consumption emotions in the context of festivals across time. It also affords the opportunity to address the methodological issues of a postconsumption emotion measure by exploring how the emotion is recalled and how consistently the memory of past emotions reflects the actual emotional experience in tourist attraction settings. The present study provides a framework for examining the convergence of operational indicators of festival consumption emotions over time.</p>
<p>The practical insights emerging from our study findings revolve around the identification of salient festival consumption emotions that can be potentially manipulated by festival organizers to enhance visitors’ experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287510394197">Schmitt (1999)</xref> has suggested that what today’s customers want are products, communications, and marketing campaigns that deliver a desirable experience by dazzling their senses, touching their hearing, stimulating their minds, and relating to their lifestyles. Festival organizers can focus on designing and managing environments that optimally create positive emotions. These efforts would focus on the management of festival atmospherics that most appeal to the festival’s target market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287510394197">Kotler 1973-1974</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287510394197">Lee et al. (2008)</xref>, festival environmental cues such as program content, facilities, and food have a significant effect on eliciting positive emotions and, in turn, positively influence visitors’ satisfaction and loyalty. Although we did not investigate the specific attributes of festival environments capable of inducing positive emotions, festival managers should pay close attention to the setting-based festival atmospherics to enhance visitors’ emotional experiences and, ultimately, their intention to return.</p>
<p>There are some limitations of this investigation that require articulation. Our response rate was relatively low in spite of our multiple method approach. This does potentially affect the external validity of our findings. The follow-up survey measuring the emotions in this study was conducted four to six months after the on-site survey. The inconsistent duration of data collection across sites may have also contributed to variation in the types and strengths of emotions that were statistically different over the two testing periods. Ideally, testing occasions should be synchronized in order to make accurate comparisons over time. Both assessment of festival consumption emotions over the course of festival experiences (i.e., anticipation and planning, travel to the site, on-site experience, return travel from the site, and recollection of the trip; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287510394197">Clawson 1963</xref>) and variation in type and intensity of past emotions reported by nonrespondents could influence the pattern of emotional experience, which would also be fruitful areas for future research. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see in a future study how changes in emotion intensity over time affect festival visitors’ decision making.</p>
<p>Last, we did not explore <italic>why</italic> people displayed the inconsistent memory of past emotions across time and settings. We also did not investigate whether the accuracy of emotion recall is either random or systematic across settings because of other intervening variables, for example, gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287510394197">Dubé and Morgan 1996</xref>) and personality trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287510394197">Barrett 1997</xref>). Therefore, as a next step in our analysis, we will begin examining why visitors underestimated their positive emotions but provided an accurate account of negative emotions over time. In addition, we measured only the intensity of emotions during and after festival visit in this study. A previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287510394197">Thomas and Diener (1990)</xref> suggested the different patterns of emotion recall between frequency and intensity estimates. Consequently, further studies need to investigate the frequency of festival consumption emotions and its patterns of recall across time and settings.</p>
