<sec id="sec1-0040571X13475404l"><title>Maximus the Confessor, <bold><italic>The Life of the Virgin</italic></bold>, trans. and intro. Stephen J. Shoemaker, Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 2012; 240 pp.: 9780300175042, £25.00/$35.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>In 1986 Michel van Esbroek published a critical text of a <italic>Life of the Virgin</italic>, ascribed to Maximos the Confessor. The text claims that it is a Georgian translation of an original Greek text, made by Euthymios, the early eleventh-century abbot of Iviron, then the Georgian monastery on Mount Athos. Van Esbroek argued that this was indeed a work of the Confessor, perhaps belonging to the early, little-known, stage of his monastic life. Hans Urs von Balthasar hailed this new addition to the Maximian canon (in a letter to Van Esbroek), but otherwise the <italic>Life</italic> has been largely ignored by Maximos scholars. With this English translation, Stephen Shoemaker, a distinguished Orientalist and Marian scholar, hopes to put the <italic>Life</italic> on the scholarly map as, at least, a work contemporary with Maximos, if not by him, and therefore the earliest surviving account of the Virgin’s life.</p>
<p>The <italic>Life</italic> draws mostly on the canonical Gospels, supplementing these with works such as the <italic>Protevangelion of James</italic>, and the Dormition, or <italic>Transitus,</italic> narratives, on which Shoemaker is an acknowledged expert. It is a rather sober account; the colourful details we find in the <italic>Protevangelion</italic> – such as Mary’s spinning the scarlet and purple thread for the veil of the Temple at the Annunciation – are omitted, and it explicitly disavows the gaudy miracles of the infant Christ, as found in the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic>. The <italic>Life</italic> provides interpretation through exegetical and homiletic digressions, but what is most striking about it is the parallelism depicted between the Mother of God and her Son: she is the one ‘who pondered all these things in her heart’, and not only shared in her Son’s ministry and initiated the mission of the early Church but also mirrored his suffering in her soul (Shoemaker is anxious to demonstrate that there is no hint of Mary as co-redemptrix, surely rightly), actually beheld the miracle of her Son’s resurrection, and completely understood the meaning of the Incarnation and death of her Son, even as he is taken down from the Cross.</p>
<p>Shoemaker seeks to show that the <italic>Life</italic> belongs to the seventh century, and so could be by Maximos. I am not sure that his arguments demonstrate more than that the <italic>Life</italic> cannot be any earlier than the seventh century, something fairly obvious. More could have been made of Maximos’ links with hagiographical circles in Alexandria and Cyprus, which display the kind of critical sobriety we find in the <italic>Life of the Virgin</italic>. There is probably more to be made of the translator, Euthymios, a skilled translator between Georgian and Greek (in both directions), who wrote a <italic>Life of St Maximos</italic>, and whose translation technique is hardly slavish (if the Greek version of <italic>Barlaam and Ioasaph</italic> is indeed his).</p>
<p>The question of Maximian authorship is perhaps a red herring, however, for it is the <italic>Life</italic> itself that is fascinating. Shoemaker’s translation reads exceedingly well; his notes indicate an improved Georgian text. This volume marks a landmark in the study of devotion to the Mother of God.</p>
