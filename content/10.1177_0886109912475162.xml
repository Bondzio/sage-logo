<abstract>
<p>Through a study of the narratives and practices in a gender-balanced social worksite, this article identifies institutionalized gender normalization processes. In the tales, the social workers told of their work, they reiterated the value of a gender-balanced workforce, together with the ideal of a gender-neutral profession. This view made it hard for the workers to see the ways in which the gender order they were involved in reproduces a gendered hierarchy in which male social workers are accorded greater value and an increased space of action, while female social workers and femininity are characterized by shortcomings when compared to men.</p>

<p>Sweden has long aspired to the liberal feminist ideal of a gender-balanced workforce. Since the 1960s, women’s right to work has been supported through, for example, the provision of high-quality public child care, which has resulted in a high level of participation by both men and women in the workforce. In spite of the high level of participation and of the profiled ideology of gender equality, Sweden has an extreme gender-segregated labor market. As is the case in most countries, social work in Sweden is a predominantly female field, and the absence of male social workers is considered to be a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475162">Christie, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475162">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). The rationale for increasing the number of men who are employed in the social work field rests on an assertion of the value of gender differences and of complementarity between the genders in, for example, youth care and in the care of substance abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475162">Johansson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>), in family law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>) and in health care (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I problematize the ideal of the gender-mixed or gender-balanced workforce by analyzing the normalization of gender differences that is invoked to justify it and that is realized within it. I argue that when gender equality is rendered a question of numerical balance (50–50 or 40–60), as it commonly is in Sweden today, instead of accomplishing an equalization of <italic>power</italic> between men and women, it conceals society’s hierarchical gender order and the way in which one of the sexes is privileged.</p>
<p>The workplace in this study is a Swedish home, here called <italic>The Family House</italic>, whose task is to investigate and work with families with severe social problems and with problems in providing care for their children. Since its inception some 20 years ago, the workforce at The Family House has consisted of five men and five women. Such absolute gender balancing is uncommon in this kind of institution in Sweden, but in this case, is considered important in working with troubled families. The Family House has become special in the eyes of the personnel in its ongoing accomplishment of a gender-balanced workforce. So special, indeed, that the head contacted me, since she knew I was a gender researcher, suggesting that I conduct a study of gender balance in the workplace.</p>
<p>My point of departure in this analysis is the assumption that the power structures in society and the ways of doing “normality” are reflected in the everyday routines of institutions and that the way in which gender is performed within those institutions is integral to the broader social order within those organizations and professional contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475162">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>). As social workers create narratives about their professional work, they participate in the structuring of practice at the same time as they are themselves subject to these structures. By creating gender meanings, they also conduct themselves according to professional patterns and norms that draw boundaries and shape practices. In this way, gendered and gendering organizational processes both reproduce and transcend given gender orders. Gender intersects in this case with the doing of sexuality, ethnicity, and parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>). The overall aim of this article is to identify institutionalized gender-normalization processes in social workers’ narratives about their work at The Family House and to consider the implications of these processes for the power relations among the staff.</p>

<title>Theoretical Point of Departure</title>
<p>Normalization is a contested concept, especially within the area of social policy and social work. Here, it is a central analytic tool that is used to grasp the processes that define and produce what is considered natural or right and, at the same time, to produce what in Sweden has come to be called <italic>the outsiderhood</italic>. The fields of social policy, public health, and social work are concerned with regulating the interaction between welfare institutions and citizens. Sweden has maintained a stronger commitment to the welfare state than have other capitalist economies. However, in delving into the processes of normalization in the Swedish welfare state, one finds not a panacea for global ills, but a complex set of processes that come at a considerable social cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475162">Fahlgren, Johansson, &amp; Mulinari, 2011</xref>). My use of the concept of normalization enables me to analyze the ways in which social work practices are just as contradictory, polysemic, and historically loaded as the concept of the normal itself. Within normalization processes, “the normal” is often assumed by naming and ordering “the other.” Normality is taken to be self-evident (uncategorized, genderless, colorless, and classless), and it is implicitly constructed in antithesis to “the abnormal.” This normalization process tends to hide the power within it and the way in which the process is both enabling and suppressing, productive and limiting, and including and excluding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109912475162">Foucault, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475162">Hacking, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>The Interviews</title>
<p>The staff at The Family House is tasked by the municipality social welfare office to investigate and foster parents’ ability to provide care in families that have needed repeated care from the social services. The social workers are responsible, during an 8-week period in which the families live at the institution, for assessing the children and parents, and supporting the parents in taking responsibility for their children in a “normal” manner. They are expected to identify what kind of help is needed, so that the parents will be able to develop their own skills and manage by themselves when they go home.</p>
<p>Ten of the staff members at The Family House, five men and five women (the female head included), were interviewed by me and my colleague Lena Sawyer in 2008. They were told that taking part in the research was voluntary and that they could stop at any time (only one man on the staff chose not to take part in the interviews) and that we would protect their identity as far as possible. In the interviews, the employees were asked (in open-ended questions) to talk freely about their work, reflecting on what they did during the day and what they found difficult or enjoyable in their work, as well as how they looked on themselves as a group of social workers. Each interview lasted about 2 hr and was recorded and transcribed. We also took part in two so-called <italic>Wednesday conferences</italic> in which the families who were staying at the house were discussed once a week by the staff, and we each participated in the life at The Family House for 1 day, writing diary memories. The focus was entirely on the staff; nothing was written down about the families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886109912475162">
<title>A Discursive Reading</title>
<p>My reading of these interviews in the context of the everyday practices of The Family House aims to identify the normalization that occurs through what is said, what is silent or silenced, or what is taken for granted. This represents a Foucauldian reading of discourses that I have developed as a research strategy in gender studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475162">Fahlgren, 1999</xref>) and subsequently have used in various research topics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475162">Fahlgren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475162">Fahlgren &amp; Johansson, 2010</xref>). In this reading, I look for how the organization, the staff, and the parents collaborate in doing gender. The interviewees are interviewed as professional social workers in their place of work and the position from which they speak inevitably affects their narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475162">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109912475162">Davies &amp; Harré, 1990</xref>). They presumably present themselves in ways that they think are appropriate for a professional social worker in this context and in ways they consider appropriate for a gender researcher. Their stories can therefore be read as reflecting how they think they <italic>ought</italic> to speak in relation to professional norms. Of course, professional norms may also be subject to questioning. I am more interested in finding the discourses that are available in this institutional context, the conditions of possibility, than in individual differences between social workers.</p>
<p>As the social workers create their narratives about their professional work, the narratives often tend to be more organization specific than gender specific. They all talk about differences (and similarities) between women and men in generalized and similar ways, as women versus men. When and if I find gender differences of interest, I exemplify them in the analysis.</p>
<p>In my close reading of the interviews, one way of uncovering these institutional discourses is to note ambiguity, paradoxes, or contradictions in the narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475162">Fahlgren, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475162">Foucault, 1991b</xref>). This is how the themes of the analysis are developed. The questions I focus on are How is gender constituted in these narratives? How are these meanings discursively produced? What are the implications of these meanings and constitutions for the gender relations among the staff?</p>

<title>Paradoxical Shifts in the Meaning of Gender Among the Staff</title>
<sec id="section6-0886109912475162">
<title>The Discourse of Gender Complementarities</title>
<p>What struck me most was the slippage in the interviewees’ talk between one construction of gender and another. These slippages occurred both in talking about the relationships among the workers and the relationships with the parents. I begin my analysis with their talk about the relationships among the staff.</p>
<p>The workers all attached great value to their gender-balanced workplace. They did so from a normalized ground of gender complementarity, inherent differences between women and men, and similarities within the genders. This notion of gender has proved to play a central role in the organization of social work in Sweden today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; Laanemets &amp; Kristinasen, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886109912475162">Palm, 2006</xref>). Similar constructions of gender have been observed both in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475162">McConkey, McAuley, Simpson, &amp; Collins, 2007</xref>) and Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475162">Petrelius, 2003</xref>). At the same time, however, the workers distanced themselves from a belief in gender differences, describing themselves as (gender) neutral professional social workers, having identical value, with all of them doing the same work. So there is a paradox in the way they were, at the same time, reproducing and transcending traditionally gendered norms.</p>
<p>One of the male workers described the “unfortunate” “domination” of social work by women, emphasizing the difference between men and women while distancing himself from any negative judgment of women:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there are masculine and feminine ways of thinking within the social services, and I reckon that in situations in which men and women work together, then it’s best to combine the two; it makes things more effective and the social services get closer to getting a 9 out of 10 score. Unfortunately, the social services tend to be dominated by women, and that explains some of the problems with them; they’re dominated by a female way of thinking. That may sound as though I think that women think wrongly, but it doesn’t need to mean that; it can be about thinking more broadly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The complementarity discourse is deployed here to equate top-scoring institutions with the breadth of thought that can come only from the presence of both genders (but particularly men) with their differences. Female “dominance” and female ways of thinking are constructed as a problem that creates shortcomings in the workplace that only a male contribution can overcome. Gender difference is thus naturalized (it is the way things are) and normalized (it is the way things should be). Within the social work arena, men are thus framed as a scarce and valuable resource, by both women and men, while women’s value is made invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>). Although the objective may be to achieve greater gender equality, gender hierarchy may actually be reproduced through these particular discursive constructions.</p>
<p>Almost all the interviews contained stories about the value that the workers attached to working in a gender-balanced workplace, drawing on the normalized discourse of gender complementarities. A predominantly female workplace is constituted as being pervaded with bitching, enmity, and hostility. Women are constituted as less direct in their communication and as making their own interpretations; they bog themselves down and want to get to the bottom of everything. Men, in contrast, are constituted as more rational and as using more direct and structured communication; they ask what they are supposed to ask, and that is it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475162">Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475162">Simpson, 2011</xref>). One of the male workers argued that the presence of men in a traditionally female workplace is a prerequisite for attracting other men to come and work there: “It isn’t that fun to be the only guy on a team of only women” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475162">McConkey et al., 2007</xref>). Men prefer men, and women are “only” women. At the same time, the female workers emphasized the difference, awarding greater responsibility to themselves not only for the atmosphere of the working environment, but for hatching ideas and planning:
<disp-quote>
<p>We girls … think more about development, both with the house and the work, and in everything. I think we’re more visionary than the guys. I think that’s manliness and womanliness. Men are more here and now, and we women are more like this, that we have such great plans for little things, like curtains and flowers and furniture, but a lot to do with the house and work with clients. And I think that we have this mainly in our heads.</p>
<p>Interviewer: More ideas?</p>
<p>We have more ideas. I think, yes. The guys seem to work and then go home … Yes, I’d better organize things while a man just, well, it’s good weather so let’s go out and do something fun.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the gender-complementary discourse gives female social workers more responsibility not only for the practical work and planning in the house, but for developing new ideas and visions. Although men’s lack of responsibility may be experienced as irritating, having taken up responsibility as their own, the female workers simply get on with it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets and Kristiansen (2008</xref>, p. 33) also found that female social workers take responsibility for “the new” and for taking initiatives, “men are men” (Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012). The attribution of taking greater responsibility and initiatives to female workers is not to be found in the male social workers’ talk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886109912475162">
<title>Still, a Need to Reproduce Gender Differences</title>
<p>Even though complementary gender differences seemed to be both naturalized and normalized, and thus taken for granted in these narratives, there still seemed to be a need deliberately to reproduce and maintain them as if they were threatened by the work at The Family House (and therefore not quite so “natural” after all?). At our visits to The Family House, we took part in the wednesday conference, in which all the staff gathered once a week to discuss their work. We were somewhat surprised when, at the coffee break, the men suddenly went off to one room to have their coffee, the women went to another, and the two female bosses stayed in the kitchen. During the interviews, we asked about this separation. Some told us that it had just begun as something funny; they would joke: “Come on, let’s have some girl talk.” Some of the men explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean we are together so much at work anyhow, so it can be nice to get some time to just gather as men or women. I think that’s quite positive. It’s really nice.</p>
<p>I think it’s a bit of a demarcation that we’re going to keep a bit of manliness and womanliness. We keep that up even if we do it with a giggle. But maybe it’s to stop us becoming androgynous (laughter) so you don’t end up not knowing what you are.</p>
<p>I don’t want men who think like women and women who think like men. I want us to have a fruitful give and take … I can see the importance of having a male coffee room because I want things to be as broad as possible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The gender division at the coffee break was thus constituted by the men as a more or less deliberate way of maintaining gender differences in a workplace in which gender may otherwise lose its meaning and everyone would become the same or “androgynous,” with male gender identity in particular being at risk in a predominantly female occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475162">Christie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). I interpreted this gender division as a need for gender affirmation that the organization of the workplace may either facilitate or hinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109912475162">Åse, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>). By spontaneously dividing up at the coffee break, the workers arranged this gender affirmation for themselves, for a short while constructing a traditionally culture within the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Some woman told a story about how some women used to joke about the male social workers not being <italic>real men</italic>, but said that it is not possible to joke in the same way about the women, since it is accepted that female social workers are somewhat androgynous:
<disp-quote>
<p>And that means you almost become androgynous for one another, and maybe that’s why one of my female colleagues says: I don’t think there are any real men here; they’re just a bunch of softies.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Do people say there aren’t any real women here?</p>
<p>No, no, there’s never any real sting to that. I think that’s why it doesn’t continue because she’s quite butch herself and quite forthright and so on. I think that’s what makes it rather funny.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because they are actually alike, the workers can play at affirming their differences, and the women can regard this as a joke, particularly because they do not engage in emphasized femininity. What this joking talk revealed is that since it is men whose identity is supposedly threatened at The Family House, their need for time away from the female workers can be affirmed in their practice of separating at the coffee break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). If they see themselves as actually alike, how is the importance of maintaining gender differences and gendered identities generated and maintained? One man explained this importance with reference to gendered roles within his own family. As a father, he said, he wants to provide a good male role model for his son as well as his daughter for when she chooses a boyfriend in the future. But this is not just normative, he believed, it is also “natural”: “I’m certain that we’re genetically just different.” The logic of his argument is that if there were not clear gender roles, it would be difficult to uphold heteronormativity as a foundation for his family and for society more broadly. The construction of gender contains the construction of sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). Perhaps, the need to redraw the gender lines also reflects coded homophobia? This may raise the question of how threads of heteronormativity that are reflected in staff relations may have an impact on the staff’s practice with (and assumptions about) the families they work with.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886109912475162">
<title>The Normalization of Gender-Neutral Professional Work</title>
<p>Even though the workers attached great value to their gender-balanced workplace, they frequently shifted with regard to the importance of gender differences. For example, gender was ascribed no importance when it came to respect shown for the staff. When asked whether men and women are equally respected in the workforce, the answer was affirmative: “There’s essentially no difference; it is more a question of professional knowledge, what you know or what you do, regardless of gender.” Or respect may have to do with individual differences in an “authoritative manner” rather than gender.</p>
<p>The staff believed that they also enjoyed equal respect from the families regardless of gender. When there were differences in respect, it had to do with individuals. As professionals they said that they were met and respected as (gender) neutral social workers. Apart from when contact persons took life histories from the families (I return to this point later), the work performed by the staff was not described as gendered: all the staff performed all kinds of duties. As one female worker explained: “It doesn’t matter what gender you are, we all make food, clean, hold discussions, play with the children.”</p>
<p>In their talk specifically about themselves as professional workers, the staff distanced themselves from gender. Professional discourse typically involved emphasizing “masculine” skills, such as the use of rational methods and the maintenance of distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475162">Bergman, 2003</xref>). Gender was thus awarded relevance in the workers’ narratives according to which aspects of their work they were describing. This same pattern has been found in the context of family law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>), in the care of substance abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>), in health care work (Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012), and in essays by social work students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475162">Petrelius, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0886109912475162">
<title>Man-to-Man Talk or the Discourse of Male Homosociality</title>
<p>I now turn to the analysis of the ways in which the social workers talked about gender in relation to their work with families. The equal gender balance in the staff at The Family House was also said to make it possible to meet the families, who are presumed, in line with heteronormative assumptions, to consist of a mother, father, and child, in a better way. The gender balance was constituted as particularly important for fathers: Fathers have a chance to come to The Family House in a way that they may not otherwise have had. They are said to have better chances of finding rapport there because of the presence of male staff with whom they can talk man to man, even if the men are actually feminized in some sense by working in a “female profession.” One male worker explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Of course, we use our advantage to establish contact with the fathers, man to man, so to speak. I usually say that I’m not a man, I’m a woman (laughter) because I’ve worked in a female profession all my life. That’s how it is—I’m such a girl, and I usually say yeah, I’m a girl, in this context, but I can talk about motorcycles and betting and sport and stuff. And I know how to make use of this when fathers come here and they’re nervous and scared and wondering: “What kind of women’s world have I ended up in? And then, yeah, but he seems nice, I reckon I can talk to him anyhow.” And then it’s up to me to take it further and to move on from talking about betting to talking about what we’re really here for. But establishing contact, starting up a dialogue with someone, creating a relaxed atmosphere where everyone feels safe because many of them feel vulnerable when they come into contact with the social services because it’s always women who come sneaking along … Of course there are advantages to being a man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The men described being male as an advantage in meeting fathers, as men. They understood and spoke the same language and therefore could reduce the tension and make these fathers, who they said feel threatened and vulnerable in relation to the social services (where it is always “women who come sneaking along”) feel safer. The value of male homosociality and the commonality between men was naturalized and normalized here and given importance in enabling the work at The Family House to be accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The female workers also assumed that fathers would more willingly come and participate in family therapy if they knew that male social workers are at the institution. One, who had previously worked in an all-female workplace, remarked that it was difficult there to engage the fathers and that she also felt it is an advantage to have male colleagues. The idea that fathers feel particularly “disadvantaged” in their meetings with female-dominated authorities thus created a focus on fathers that affected both the composition of the workforce and the organization of their tasks. While I do not dispute that the presence of male workers may well facilitate the important work with fathers, the matter was further complicated by cultural conventions that enhance such a view, that men do prefer men. But discourses fostering such normalized conventions also reproduce discriminating regimes of power. Male homosocial narratives implicitly render women different and unfamiliar with men’s worlds and unable to access the world and language of fathers. These notions of gender complementarity are thus built on assumptions not only of heteronormativity, but of male homosociality, both of which are discursive elements that are central to the maintenance of a hierarchical gender order in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475162">Lindgren, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, this play on stereotypical notions of gender simultaneously reproduces them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Women Understand Women Within the Discourse of Heterosexuality</title>
<p>The workers at The Family House followed a principal that said that when a new family enters the house, the family is allocated two contact persons from the staff, generally one woman and one man. This relatively common practice in social work appears to be an intriguing normalization practice affirming and valuing heterosexual coupledom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>). The workers we interviewed all attached great importance to this practice. When they first meet the parents who come to The Family House and ask them about their backgrounds and life stories, the male contact person generally talks to the father, and the female contact person talks to the mother. A female worker accounted for this practice by in terms of the differences between the gendered social workers:
<disp-quote>
<p>If there’s a mother and a father, they feel more acknowledged if there’s a person of the same sex … In the course of the investigation, we take a life story, and I think it makes a difference that the emphasis is a bit different.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What do you mean?</p>
<p>I think that even if we’re pretty similar as men and women if you compare with other workplaces, I still think that as a woman, I tend to ask more about feelings, while men ask more about practicalities … and I think that feels good for the parents.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Hmm, what is it that feels good?</p>
<p>Well, men meet men, and we can … you and I are alike, and I think you can even get more answers out of fathers if it’s man to man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarities within gender categories and differences between them mean that female social workers are constituted as finding it easier to deal with mothers, who are also assumed to feel more acknowledged by them, and men are assumed to feel better acknowledged by men. The social workers are also said to receive different information as men and as women. There was, however, a silent assumption here that heterosexual tension may arise between the parties to these discussions and that this tension should be avoided. The mothers, who were described as sexually traumatized by men’s abuse, will not want to tell men about their possible experiences of male aggression, sexual abuse, or sexual experiences. They are assumed to harbor a mistrust of other men, so they are offered discussions with female social workers, more to free them from men than because they necessarily have anything in common with the women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A consequence is that male social workers do not have to listen to stories about other men’s sexual abuse, stories that might have given them better insight into the gender order. Women’s sexual vulnerability is constituted as a women’s issue that can be understood and handled only by other women. Sexual abuse is assumed to be performed by men (not women) on women, who are thus positioned as already and always victims. The idea that fathers may have similarly traumatic backgrounds or may require shelter from other men (or women) was never mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>). This is what the discourse excludes and normalizes, no matter how good the intentions of the social workers are.</p>
<p>One can also discern heterosexual notions underlying other forms of a gendered labor division at this institution. For example, female social workers were described as usually caring for mothers with babies. One of the male workers observed: “You can think in terms of a substitute mother. And then it isn’t usually a guy who comes in, but a girl. I think that’s where we’re most gender divided; when it comes to newborn babies, then we have really competent women who keep this up by being called on in these situations.”</p>
<p>The fact that female workers are called on to be substitute mothers means that they are being constituted in terms of their “feminine” caring abilities, while men are being constituted as lacking these qualities. This seems to have been the case even on one occasion when they were working with a single father and his newborn infant. The male worker explained: “So they moved the father and the baby in to us, and we were there to support and help and say, ‘Yeah, come on, you’ll handle this just fine!’ And the girls were there saying, ‘Yeah, that much and fold the diaper this way and wash the baby from the eye outward.’”</p>
<p>When it came to taking care of babies, man-to-man talk was no longer appropriate. The men encouraged the father, but it was the women who taught the skills of caring for the baby. Institutional practice again reflects wider society’s ideas and values, not necessarily according to what is actually most common, but more according to ideas about how things <italic>ought </italic>to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109912475162">Foucault, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>). The “normal” was thus grounded in a gender power order that social work is perceived to have to deal with and becomes caught up in reproducing it by normalizing it through its own practices.</p>

<sec id="section12-0886109912475162">
<title>The “Problem” of Female Social Workers</title>
<p>The (gender) neutral view of the profession was not always upheld when the workers met with the families. The interviews contained several examples of problems that arose when a female contact person was dealing with a father and when the principle of having a male and a female contact person present had to be dispensed with. The following story told by a female worker shows how a compensatory form of practice was developed in relation to fathers and gender (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>): “This was a well-known case, and he’d been involved with the social services for many years. He had very negative experiences of the social workers and of women, so, in his case, we decided strategically to give him two male contact people. And he was so satisfied.”</p>
<p>One of the male workers noted that there were also times when female social workers were treated badly and met with condescension by the mothers and that when a man came into the room, he was treated as though he were superior. However, no example was cited of fathers or mothers having problems with a male contact person. It was only women who seem sometimes to have become problems because of their gender. These examples show how the organization collaborated with the staff and the parents in the doing of gender and that awareness of how it did so is essential if they are to prevent the gender hierarchy from being reproduced.</p>

<title>Bridging the Two Worlds</title>
<sec id="section14-0886109912475162">
<title>A Valued Male Femininity</title>
<p>The male worker who referred to himself as more of a woman than a real man because he had been working in a predominantly female profession all his life also claimed that he was able to talk to the fathers in the feminine mode, about “what we’re all here for after all,” like nursing and caring for children. He was familiar with the world of women and seemed to be able to create a bridge between the two “worlds.” In this case, his femininity was presented as a strength in dealing with the families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). In contrast, when a female worker was described as butch and a bit masculine, it was presented humorously and <italic>not</italic> as a professional strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475162">Halberstam, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In practice, this means that ideas about gender complementarity actually limited the female social workers’ scope of action to “female” areas, at the same time as it paradoxically expanded the men’s scope of action to include both the traditionally “male” and “female” spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475162">Halberstam, 1998</xref>). By refashioning masculinity, men may remain the dominant sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0886109912475162">
<title>A Valued “Real” Manliness</title>
<p>Having men on the staff was described as of importance not only to the fathers, but to the mothers. The male social workers were said to be able to represent role models of a “real” manliness that these mothers were assumed to have little experience of. The mothers were shown ordinary men who were pleasant and well behaved, were not interested in them for sex, and could take care of children and domestic work. As one male worker explained: “Many of these women have had terrible experiences of men … And then I can act as a model and explain that not all men are like that. I can tell them that there are men who can change a diaper and care for a child and give an infant food and set limits without losing it and who can function well in an ordinary environment.” A female worker concurred: “Single mothers benefit greatly from our men because they aren’t usually used to meeting men who aren’t … I mean something that isn’t anything more than a straightforward man-woman relationship without sex.”</p>
<p>Young single mothers, who are said to be the most common visitors to The Family House, are constituted within the discourse of heteronormativity. Almost all the workers said that the mothers had terrible experiences of men and had been sexually traumatized, thus finding it difficult to mix with men in a nonsexual manner. In this way, they were distinguished from “normal” women, in this case perhaps female social workers with whom it was possible to work together as men, day and night, without any suggestion of sexual relations. But the way in which normality was to be demonstrated to the mothers by the male social workers was silently unquestioned (e.g., in terms of class, ethnicity, or age). “Normality” was assumed to be self-evidently embodied by the men—even though the men sometimes referred to themselves as “such a girl”—and their (white, middle class?) norms were thereby universalized. The men implicitly positioned themselves as the representatives of normality by constituting the mothers as “the other.” In other words, the model is that in which “the other” inevitably fails to be normal or to acquire full human status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475162">Hacking, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475162">Johansson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475162">Pease, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-0886109912475162">
<title>Social Work as a Normalized Feminine Field</title>
<p>What was most remarkable about these interviews was the way in which the value of having female social workers as role models for these mothers and fathers was <italic>not</italic> noted. As was shown earlier, on a few occasions, male social workers told stories of how good some of the female workers were at helping newly delivered mothers with their babies. Sometimes the interviewees also explained that they all acted as role models for the families. However, never was any mention made in these 10 interviews of any <italic>special value</italic> that these highly qualified female social workers might have had for the fathers. Instead, there were numerous stories of how tired men–fathers were of meeting all these women in the social services and how they felt misunderstood by them.</p>
<p>The male social worker was thus, within the frame of a complementary view of gender, seen as embodying universal values that are both male and female, while female social workers were seen as carrying only those of the (subordinated) second sex. In other words, the value of a gender-balanced staff was the value of the contribution of men–masculinity, mirroring, and reproducing the gender order that pervades society as a whole. In this way, men take their male privilege with them when they enter predominantly female occupations (Williams, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475162">McPhail, 2004</xref>), and both female and male social workers redefine the work in ways that emphasize the value of masculine elements of the work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475162">Christie, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks on Shifting Meanings of Gender</title>
<p>In their talk about their everyday professional lives within a welfare institution, the social workers made collective representations of their profession and of the professional norms of gender neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475162">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>). The social practices within welfare institutions are governed by paradoxical institutional principles and rules within a gendered culture that normalizes the ways in which individual social workers act and speak. Where there is broad social acceptance of these normalized practices, it may prevent individuals from developing any awareness of normalization and its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475162">Hacking, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475162">Pease, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis presented here attempted to bring to light the way in which social workers make use of contradictory gender discourses to mange their work. This use sometimes enables them to develop challenging views, but more commonly they are caught up in the structures that surround them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>; Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475162">Simpson, 2011</xref>). They may therefore reproduce privilege as well as oppression even though they may strive for gender equality. But what does this situation mean for the gender power regime of the workplace?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0886109912475162">
<title>The Gendered Power Structures Become Invisible</title>
<p>The foundation of these social workers’ narratives was comprised of ideas of gender complementarity. These implied differences between men and women and similarities and uniformity within each gender were then maintained through discourses about a gendered work environment and a gendered social work practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>). They were further reinforced by the way in which the gender balancing among the staff was silently heterosexualized and related to male homosociality—the fact that men direct their expectations toward other men, both of which are central to the maintenance of a male sociocultural power position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475162">Halberstam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475162">Lindgren, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since these discourses were normalized, the meaning of gender slipped several times in the narratives in a subtle and seemingly obvious manner toward the idea that gender is irrelevant. The ideal of gender balancing was thus upheld, together with the idea of professional gender neutrality, and these notions were then interwoven with ideas about the staff’s work practices (Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012). These normalization processes enabled the transcendence of stereotypical ideas of a gendered division of labor (everyone can do everything; gender does not matter) at the same time as it paradoxically reinforced such ideas (men and women are good at different things and have different value).</p>
<p>It is important to discuss the ways in which these slippages made it harder for the workers to understand and reflect on the way in which gender ordering created a power hierarchy in the valuing of their work. The gendered power structures became invisible by being normalized. It thus became impossible to question the power differential between the genders; it simply became a nonquestion. In this way, the room for discussion was reduced, as was critical reflection about the creation of gender difference, which made it all the harder consciously to alter practice. If we are interested in preventing gender hierarchy from being reproduced, an awareness of how the organization collaborates with the staff and the parents in the doing of gender is essential.</p>
<p>Although these findings are essentially about the workplace and the ways in which workers experience their work, they may also say something about the work itself. If the workers replicate normative gender relations with each other, they may also delineate and underscore normalized gender (and sexual) roles in their practice with the families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475162">Foucault, 1991b</xref>).</p>

<title>The Paradoxical Doing of Professional (Gender) Neutrality</title>
<p>The idea of gender complementarity in a predominantly female workplace means that male social workers become a coveted commodity that is in short supply. Being a man has added value among the staff of The Family House, as well as in meetings with parents of both genders. The presence of men thus comes to signal neutrality and professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475162">McPhail, 2004</xref>); it is a privilege to be male, although it may be hard to see it oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475162">Pease, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475162">Johansson (2006</xref>) argued that the issue of male role models should be problematized. Masculinity is neither neutral nor homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>), so what kind of role model is being sought? At the same time, the notion of gender complementarity seems to render female social workers and femininity a problem or a shortcoming, especially in relation to men and fathers. Women are said to be unable to understand men, and the fathers are assumed to be fed up with dealing with women. This view gives male social workers greater value and therefore increased space of action, and it silently grants men privileges and reproduces a gendered hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475162">Pease, 2010</xref>). When men enter a predominantly female profession, they do not seem to encounter resistance and discrimination as women often do entering a male-dominated profession; instead they seem to take their gender privilege with them. Professional discourses and practices contribute to their dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475162">Cross &amp; Bagilhole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475162">Simpson, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The Next Question</title>
<p>In this article, I have shown that the manner in which social work is organized promotes particular gendered relations of power. However, neither in my own research nor in any of the literature I have read has there been any cases in which social workers have consciously acted in their daily practice in ways that challenge or alter normative, nonegalitarian gender patterns. Nor do the workers express a conscious ambition to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475162">Eriksson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475162">Eriksson &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>; Husso &amp; Hirvonen, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475162">Laanemets &amp; Kristiansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475162">Mattsson, 2005</xref>). For those who work with families who have difficulty performing “good-enough” parenting, it may seem desirable to try to reproduce what is considered to be “normality,” so that the families can live a socially acceptable life. However, “normality” is never unequivocal; its meaning shifts according to context. When “the normal” itself performs as a paradoxical powerful discursive construct that may imply oppression in relation to gender, race/ethnicity, or class, as the analysis in this article has exemplified, then it begs the question of how to deal with this question of “normality” in an ethical manner.</p>
