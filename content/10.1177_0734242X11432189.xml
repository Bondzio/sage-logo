<abstract>
<p>In Spain, hazardous household waste management by citizens occurs via fixed recycling centres (FRC) and mobile recycling centres (MRC) which usually depend on local governments. This paper addresses a request by the Madrid City Council, in an attempt to improve the service it provides to the city of Madrid. The aim of the study involved analysing the information people possess in relation to hazardous waste and to the use of available equipment, and conducting a post-evaluation of the effectiveness of an environmental communication campaign conducted by the Madrid City Council and aimed at providing awareness of the existence of new FRCs and MRCs. To this end, a questionnaire was conducted with 5644 inhabitants of the city of Madrid. Qualitative data was categorized using content analysis followed by chi-squared tests, considering some socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, such as age or place of residence (district). Communication campaigns influenced citizen awareness of what constituted hazardous waste, of how to properly separate waste and of the existence of FRCs and MRCs. However, few citizens actually used FRCs or MRC (18% across four districts), a fact that might be related to a lack of knowledge of downstream waste treatment issues, or to self-limiting hindrances to householders, such as distance to recycling centres. It is recommended that future communication campaigns investigate householder needs and pre-conceptions in relation to recycling, as well as tailored education aimed at addressing the barriers, perceived or otherwise, facing citizens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past hazardous waste was almost exclusively produced and handled by the industrial sector. However, increased consumption of diverse goods, such as batteries, medicines, oils or paints, by the general populace shows citizens’ attitudes and behaviour to constitute important factors of effective waste management in recycling centres. Studies recommending more effective education and communication programmes aimed at promoting citizen involvement contribute to a better understanding of the psychology of cooperation and may partly offset big downstream costs, such as post-collection sorting and treatment of re-usable hazardous waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11432189">Krook and Eklund, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X11432189">Stern 2000a</xref>). However, the efficiency and effectiveness of education campaigns are rarely monitored and some authors question the role of education in promoting environmentally responsible behaviour, such as recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11432189">Eagly and Kulsea, 1997</xref>). In the present study an attempt was made to assess an education campaign disseminating information in four districts of the city of Madrid (Spain) on the itinerary that citizens should follow to recycle hazardous waste. Recycling policies ought to ensure safe and cost-effective collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste presenting specific properties (e.g. corrosive, reactive, explosive, toxic, flammable, and infectious) that should be considered as hazardous or potentially hazardous to public health and to the environment if not properly managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11432189">Buenrostro et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11432189">Buenrostro et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734242X11432189">Nema and Gupta, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In Spain, waste management is regulated by legislation at four levels: (i) international, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11432189">EC, 1991</xref>); (ii) national, Law 10/1998 on Waste (21 April, 1998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X11432189">Spanish Law, 1998</xref>); (iii) regional, Waste Strategy of the Madrid Regional Govt. (2006-2016), Law 5/2003 on Waste of the Madrid Regional Govt. (20 March, 2003) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X11432189">Spanish Law, 2003</xref>); (iv) municipal, Law on public area cleaning and management of waste products of the Madrid City Council (27 February, 2009). According to Law 10/1998, hazardous materials are registered on the European Waste List (updated by 2001/118/EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11432189">EC (2001))</xref> applied across countries and constituting 850 different products, including common household products (e.g. paper, tins, plastics).</p>
<p>Municipal waste managers have frequently observed non-hazardous materials mixed with hazardous products, a fact that prevents re-use of beneficial waste due to presence of pollutants and increases emissions into the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11432189">Krook and Eklund, 2010</xref>). Legislation was enacted to address this problem in the city of Madrid through municipal transfer centres for selective collection of specific waste. Transfer centres are organized at fixed point locations, known as fixed recycling centres (FRC), and/or at alternating selected points, called mobile recycling centres (MRC). The main objective of municipal waste legislation involves providing all citizens with ‘public access’ for suitable management of hazardous waste.</p>
<p>The success of policies in the use of recycling centres and many other waste initiatives ultimately depends on the willingness of multiple householders to cooperate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11432189">Bulkeley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X11432189">Kgathi and Bolaane, 2001</xref>). Citizen involvement in waste management may be improved by education proposals and downstream issues relating to waste collection and disposal, and facilitation measures considering socio-economic and environmental constraints facing householders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11432189">Bortoleto and Hanaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11432189">Contreras et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11432189">Eagly and Kulsea, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11432189">Grodzińska-Jurczak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X11432189">Sharp and Giorgi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X11432189">Taylor and Todd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X11432189">Wilson, 2007</xref>). In order to educate citizens on the public access procedure, an environmental communication programme was introduced in the city of Madrid in 2008 by the Department of Education for Sustainable Development, together with the Department of Exploitation and Waste Collection, belonging to the Madrid City Council in four districts in which new FRCs had been set up. Following the development of the environmental communication campaign, the Madrid City Council requested an evaluation thereof by the Environmental Education Team (Autónoma University of Madrid), which resulted in the present paper. The campaign consisted of four actions.</p>

<list-item><p>Information stands were placed in various public spaces in each district. Educators informed and addressed inquiries by citizens about waste separation procedures. At these stands ‘ecocards’ and brochures were given out.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Meetings were scheduled with stakeholders from each district, such as members of non-government organizations and local associations, who answered queries regarding waste separation and informed members about local FRCs and MRCs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Environmental communication is critical with regard to complementing direct (financial) incentives, such as laws or taxes and, perhaps controversially, might be considered to constitute the best instrument. Policy objectives should therefore involve public communication at every stage of environmental management, and monitoring and evaluation should be planned permanently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11432189">Castro, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, communication of issues concerning public wellbeing acts as an effective motivator of citizen behaviour and cooperation in waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X11432189">Piñeiro, 2006</xref>). It is difficult to measure and objectively evaluate quality-control of information and communication, but nonetheless, effective delivery of education policies may constitute a critical factor for improved cooperation by householders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11432189">Dahlén et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present research attempted to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the local environmental communication programme with regard to providing knowledge and promoting the use of recycling centres for hazardous waste, in order to recommend improvements in the city of Madrid’s waste management system. At recycling centres, for instance, this could involve: (a) changing the state of conservation and location of containers; (b) improving terminology for sorting on information signs; (c) educating employees; or (d) information campaigns for educating citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11432189">Engkvist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X11432189">Vicente and Reis, 2008</xref>). Moreover, evaluation was required to determine whether a measure was capable of solving problems and should therefore be permanently implemented, or whether additional measures were needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X11432189">Thomsen et al., 1996</xref>). Hence, the specific objectives were: (a) to identify the obstacles that citizens of Madrid encounter with regard to hazardous household waste and to using FRCs and MRCs (b) to evaluate public knowledge and perception of procedures for managing hazardous domestic waste (in FRCs and MRCs); and (c) to assess the effectiveness of a local campaign in environmental communication aimed at disseminating information on FRCs and MRCs.</p>
<p>In order to reach these objectives, use was made of different studies identifying psycho-social determining factors of day-to-day pro-environmental behaviour. Factors such as attitudes, values, environmental beliefs and social norms were shown to influence determined pro-environmental behaviour patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X11432189">Nordlund and Garvill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X11432189">Oreg and Katz-Gerro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X11432189">Stern, 2000b</xref>). The general theoretical framework upon which this research is based is the theory of planned behaviour (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11432189">Ajzen (2002)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11432189">2011</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11432189">Ajzen et al. (2009)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11432189">2011</xref>)), as it has been seen that separation of domestic waste has been identified as a simple behaviour pattern that can be explained by the TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11432189">Corbett, 2006</xref>). For this context and theme, an attempt was made to study the behaviour of certain variables mentioned in this theory: (a) attitudes that reflect positive and negative evaluations of the individual with regard to separating or not their domestic waste, in particular hazardous waste produced in the household; (b) the norm or social influence pressuring the individual to separate domestic waste; and (c) barriers or facilitators/incentives perceived with regard to separating hazardous domestic waste or using FRCs and MRCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X11432189" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The questionnaire collected information on the following set of variables: (a) socio-demographic variables; (b) waste separation by householders (e.g. what waste was separated, who did it, inquiries about the separation procedure, separation of hazardous and bulk waste, and perception of management); (c) use and knowledge of FRCs and MRCs (the main objective of the environmental communication campaign); and (d) suggestions aimed at improving waste management (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11432189">Table 1</xref>). This questionnaire combines variables associated with the environmental management objectives of the Madrid City Council (how to identify the hindrances or facilitators/incentives of the population in relation to separating their hazardous wasted) with questions such as identification of attitudes tending towards protection of the environment and involving suitable management of hazardous domestic waste. This theoretical framework (TPB) has also been employed in other environmental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734242X11432189">López Mosquera and Sánchez, 2011</xref>). This confirms its suitability for analysis of the environmental attitudes of users and their participation in different action plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11432189">Ford et al., 2009</xref>), of attitudes and behaviour patterns tending towards environmental conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11432189">Fielding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X11432189">Kaiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X11432189">Oreg and Katz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11432189">Tonglet et al., 2004</xref>), and of the willingness to modify certain behaviour patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11432189">Burton, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Data were collected by means of face-to-face questionnaire in the street, in accordance with the methodology of several researchers investigating recycling behaviour of householders and with factors determining participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11432189">Áberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11432189">Berglund, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11432189">Chu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11432189">Curran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11432189">Díaz Meneses, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X11432189">Gonzalez-Torre and Adenso-Díaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X11432189">Robinson and Read, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X11432189">Saphores et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734242X11432189">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The gender distribution of participants was 56% women and 44% men. The most abundant age group was 30–60 years (49% of the population). This classification is based on ‘functional’ age groups – a population segment presenting the following demographic characteristics: adult population, employed and independent from parents. Of the remaining population interviewed, 23% were between 18 and 30 years of age, and 28% corresponded to the sample of over-60s. Data were stratified into age and district for the purpose of analyses, but otherwise the random sample reflected the natural demographic characteristics of the four districts of the city of Madrid.</p>
<p>The data were treated descriptively with the use of the statistical software SPSS (Version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Qualitative data were included in the descriptive analysis by emerging categorization, and determined following analysis of content, followed by chi-squared tests on selected categorical variables.</p>

<p>Similar results have been obtained in previous studies establishing different behaviour patterns and attitudes in relation to waste separation according to place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734242X11432189">Martimportugués et al., 2007</xref>) and age, thus highlighting middle-aged working citizens (particularly the 30–60 age group) as the more frequent recyclers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11432189">Arafat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11432189">Luna, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734242X11432189">Stern et al., 1993</xref>). The present research did not confirm the results of other studies in relation to better pro-environmental behaviour associated with variables such as gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11432189">Aguilar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11432189">Corbett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A positive perception towards recycling household waste was recorded, with respondents reporting high rates of waste separation in all categories and districts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X11432189">Table 4</xref>). Over 85% of the sample reported that at least one waste fraction was separated, a fact consistent with other results for Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11432189">Luna, 2003</xref>). When citizens were questioned about the type of waste they separated, over 80% of the sample stated that they separated some fractions: paper (85%), glass (84%), organic waste (89%), tins and plastic (87%), whereas other fractions (which included hazardous domestic waste) were separated by only 38% of the sample. This category refers to separation of batteries and medicines. If citizens were asked directly if they knew what hazardous waste is, the percentage increased to 71% of the sample. Following this answer, they give more examples of this type of waste produced in the household: oils, batteries, etc. If both variables are crossed: separating other waste in the home, and knowing what hazardous waste is, 43% of the population were aware of what hazardous waste is and admitted that they did not separate. Furthermore, 11% could not determine exactly what hazardous waste is, but stated that they separated hazardous waste in their homes.</p>

<p>In addition, most respondents (92%) who separated waste indicated that this task was performed by all household members (less than 3% of respondents admitted that they did not separate because this was the responsibility of someone else in the home). Based upon the TPB and studies by different authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11432189">Ajzen, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11432189">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X11432189">Thøgersen and Olander, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11432189">Tonglet et al., 2004</xref>), it was observed that the social norm is highly important for people with regard to expressing their environmental conduct, in particularly relating to separation of domestic waste. Moreover, the campaign conducted could have helped to make citizens aware of the importance of recycling, to facilitate certain behaviour patterns within this context, and to inform of the existence and location of FRCs and MRCs. About the last element, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11432189">Ajzen et al. (2011)</xref> consider that knowledge or correct factual information, plays no direct role in the TPB. However, this information could constitute the basis of beliefs upon which self-efficacy and the perception of behaviour control to be developed are structured (in this case, recycling) These beliefs can influence one’s the intention to separate according to the TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11432189">Ajzen, 2011</xref>). In addition, other authors do consider the advisability of including other variables such as past experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11432189">Conner et al., 2000</xref>), situational factors and the consequences of recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11432189">Tonglet et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The reasons given for separating domestic waste in the questionnaire refer to favourable attitudes associated with ecological concerns (referring to deterioration of nature) and “awareness” (defined here as knowledge of ecological matters and cause(s) of ecological damage) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X11432189">Table 5</xref>), which are strong motivations for pro-environmental behaviour such as recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11432189">Diaz Meneses, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X11432189">Stern, 2000b</xref>).</p>

<p>Conversely, reasons for not separating waste were largely related to self-limiting beliefs of householders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X11432189">Table 5</xref>), in accordance with several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11432189">Boldero, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X11432189">McCarty and Shrum, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734242X11432189">Oskamp et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X11432189">Pol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0734242X11432189">Vining and Ebrero, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X11432189">Vining et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X11432189">Werner and Makela, 1998</xref>). It therefore seems that Madrid’s municipal managers should focus on education programmes aimed at awakening citizens’ awareness of the social and environmental effects of recycling. Furthermore, perceived external barriers (i.e. ‘The city recycling drop-off centre is too far away for me to use’) may reflect an individual’s perceived personal limitations, but might also point to very real constraints of the social system (i.e. the city has far too few recycling drop-off centres). The TPB has demonstrated that the more control a person believes she has over a given behaviour pattern, the stronger the person’s intention to engage therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11432189">Corbett, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Assessment of public knowledge and perception of the functioning of FCR and MCR</title>
<p>On enquiring what the population does with their hazardous domestic waste, only 18% of respondents admitted to using FRCs or MCRs, whereas 48% of individuals reported using street containers to deposit this kind of waste (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734242X11432189">Table 6</xref>).

<p>A majority of respondents ranged from 30 to 60 years of age and they work full time. This might be a hindrance with regard to going to FRCs or MRCs due to their opening hours. Instead, use of recycling centres appears to be governed by a general lack of knowledge about FRCs and MRCs, consisting of 56 to 67% of the sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734242X11432189">Table 7</xref>). When the group of people who are unaware of the existence of FRCs or MRCs is informed that these exist and are in operation, a high percentage of them show their intention to use this service in the future (between 41 and 74% say they intend to use them). However, this positive value might be affected by the influence of the social desire to give a good impression to the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11432189">Cabañeros et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>District 4 is the one presenting the lowest values in relation to intention to use FRCs or MRCs. Among other reasons, this can be accounted for by their location and accessibility. A total of 82% of the population who have used FRCs in District 4 consider them to be quite inaccessible and 100% believe they are badly signposted).</p>
<p>Communication and education on recycling access points should be therefore improved and intensified. Moreover, there was ambivalence about future use of FRCs when respondents were informed about access points, whereas a clear intention to recycle via MRCs was expressed.</p>
<p>Two main reasons were considered, namely why citizens used neither the FRCs nor the MRCs: (i) remoteness of the location of access points (particularly in District 4); and (ii) a lack of awareness of each person’s responsibility for their own hazardous waste. Other studies have emphasized the importance of collection points close to the home in relation to increasing source sorting of recyclables; in other words, ‘distance matters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11432189">Austin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11432189">Dahlén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11432189">Gonzalez-Torre and Adenso-Diaz, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X11432189">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11432189">Jenkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X11432189">Pol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734242X11432189">Reid et al., 1976</xref>). Thus, MRCs could have been more attractive to citizens because they perceived that transfer points would likely coincide with their daily schedules, although provided that citizens possess information on timetable and places. Furthermore, municipal reports indicated that the more accessible recycling centres are, the more waste per capita is delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11432189">Dahlén et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of awareness, three major questions were raised by respondents: (i) how to manage specific waste (approximately 25% of the sample), for example, oils, containers, white goods, electrical devices, bulbs, aerosols, mobile phones and batteries; (ii) what municipal management procedures already existed, e.g., MRCs versus bulk waste collection trucks; and (iii) what management procedures made use of waste collection. The third point may have been particularly significant because only 5% of the respondents are aware of the treatment procedure for bulk waste management. In light of the importance of ecological consciousness for self-management of waste in the city of Madrid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X11432189">Table 5</xref>), the present study suggested that a gap in citizens’ awareness of downstream management issues (pertaining to impacts on environmental and public health) may have contributed significantly to the lack of waste separation at the household level.</p>

<title>Assessment of the effectiveness of a local environmental communication campaign aimed at disseminating information on FRCs and MRCs.</title>
<p>The effectiveness of the campaign was studied in relation to the fulfilment of the objective (disseminating the existence of the new FRCs and MRCs). This is measured according to the number of people who have been aware of the existence of the recycling centres since the campaign was conducted, the degree of knowledge of the theme (hazardous domestic waste and possibilities of depositing this in the FRCs and MRCs), as well as intention to separate different types of waste and to use the FRCs or MRCs.</p>
<p>The present results suggested benefits of environmental communication for: (a) waste separation; (b) knowledge of hazardous waste; (c) awareness of the existence of recycling centres; and (d) citizen intention to recycle via MRCs, especially since a previous education campaign had been in effect since 2008; this was designed to encourage the use of recycling centres in Districts 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11432189">Table 3</xref>). These results are confirmed by the rate of visits per household to the FRCs and MRCs recorded in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11432189">Ayuntamiento de Madrid, 2009</xref>), which was higher in Districts 1 and 2 (District 1 = 0.44; District 2 = 0.29; District 3 = 0.19; District 4 = 0.26).</p>
<p>According to age groups it was observed that the campaign was less effective in the older age group (the &gt; 60 age group possesses less knowledge). This group is less aware of what hazardous waste is, and find it more difficult to make their way to the FRCs.</p>
<p>With regard to the dissemination of information on the FRCs and MRCs, between 26 and 42% of the sample stated that they knew of them; this was a result of the environmental communication campaign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11432189">Figure 2</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734242X11432189">Olabarri and Quintana (2009)</xref>, this result was optimal. Whereas District 4 exhibited a lower frequency, District 3 presented higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11432189">Figure 2</xref>). Different factors relating to the specific characteristics of each district and to how the campaign was conducted can account for the answers by the populations: (i) in District 4 the first phase of the environmental communication campaign was incomplete; furthermore, it presents a more dispersed spatial configuration which can reduce the effect of the campaign in the neighbourhood; (ii) in District 3 the communication campaign was concentrated in an area smaller than that of the remaining districts and aimed at a smaller population concentrated in specific areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11432189">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>There was some indication that different communication initiatives, such as locally targeted (e.g. brochure distribution) versus general media, lead to different success rates among districts. Only in District 4, the effect of the stand located in the commercial area presented higher values, due to the high number of citizens therein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11432189">Figure 3</xref>). It would be interesting to study in greater depth whether the population confuses different campaigns by the same institution using the same channels and spaces.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>This study identified regular behaviour patterns related to hazardous waste management in households and citizen knowledge and use of FRCs and MRCs, such as waste separation or future intentions for the use of these FRCs and MRCs. This was mediated by: (i) socio-demographic variables of the city of Madrid such as age or place of residence (District); (ii) people’s level of information and knowledge of waste management in the city, the location and functioning of the FRCs and MRCs; and (iii) the communication campaigns conducted. Our data support those of other studies emphasizing factors in household waste management such as: number of members in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11432189">Gamba and Oskamp, 1994</xref>) and the features of the recycling centres themselves (Vining and Ebreo, 1990).</p>
<p>To increase the effectiveness of the self-access procedure used for recycling in the city of Madrid, the following recommendations have been made which synthesize the suggestions or comments of citizens that, in turn, are supported by the scientific literature.</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X11432189" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Public perception</italic>. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11432189">Luna (2003)</xref>, the population interviewed requests greater facilities with regard to separating (612 people provide different suggestions), for instance, the amount of containers (<italic>n</italic> = 504 suggestions), reducing the distance from the pickup points (<italic>n</italic> = 252 suggestions) or changing the location of the containers for collecting non-hazardous waste (<italic>n</italic> = 56 suggestions). More information is also required by the citizens, given the link between lack of participation, and opinions regarding the degree of cleanness of streets (ecological awareness). People demand a higher level of participation in management processes and want local technical experts to consider their needs when making changes in the management system; this coincides with the results of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734242X11432189">Palavecinos et al., 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Schedules and signalling</italic>. The respondents propose an increase in working time (<italic>n</italic> = 38 suggestions), in number (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and in frequency (<italic>n</italic> = 21) of stops by the MRC. Likewise, in Districts 2, 3 and 4 citizens consider it difficult to get to the FRCs due to a lack of signposting (particularly in District 4, in which 100% of the users make this appraisal). Improved signs informing citizens of the proximity of FRCs and MRCs is also desirable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Facilitation</italic>. Citizens may appreciate a reward system, such as tax returns for separating domestic waste and funding for enterprises providing infrastructures for small households. Citizens also mentioned the need to provide facilities to help the elderly to reach recycling centres or to provide a service for collecting this waste especially for this population segment. Although this factor is not considered in the TBP, some authors, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X11432189">Taylor and Todd (1997)</xref>, defend facilitation policies in waste management as a means of improving the magnitude of correlation between attitude and behaviour (i.e. self-limiting beliefs), as well as the levels of responsibility in relation to environmental behaviour.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Customer relations</italic>. The FRCs and MRCs are unknown by much of the population, although 98% of the people interviewed who have made use of them believe that the attention received is suitable or highly suitable. A total of 90% are satisfied with the information received and 92% consider that the maximum amount of waste permitted is acceptable. However, citizens questioned the example provided by municipal recycling systems because it was perceived that on many occasions these do not adhere to municipal regulations for management of hazardous waste. This fact could reduce the trust placed by the population in municipal managers, as these require pro-environmental behaviour by the population but their management shows incoherence with regard to waste treatment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Education accessibility</italic>. Environmental communication programs are sometimes designed as if recycling were an easy task, whereas in fact the systems are not well understood, as reflected by the inquiries by the citizens (1007 of these were collected from the population interviewed regarding how to manage different types of hazardous domestic waste) and there is a lack of participation in new facilities, such as FRCs and MRCs. In this sense, in District 4 one can observe the need to re-design actions, adapting them to the territory (considering the area and density thereof) and combining them with improved technical measures such as signposting. Considering the above-mentioned antecedents, the programmes should be adapted to the needs and previous knowledge of citizens, because people tend to assimilate new information on recycling in accordance with past experiences. Past experience is not a variable considered by TBP, and has been criticized by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11432189">Conner et al. (2000)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11432189">Tonglet et al. (2004)</xref>. Communication and education are recommended to be delivered via campaigns designed to respect the physical and structural limitations encountered by citizens in the context of each district and age group (paying particular attention to designing actions adapted to target groups who complain of greater difficulties, such as the elderly). It is important to avoid errors in environmental communication, such as the design of generalist campaigns that are not segmented according to population type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X11432189">Piñeiro, 2006</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Interestingly, many of these recommendations have been explicitly made by the population interviewed, and are therefore based upon their needs. Considering and implementing these recommendations involves a process of participatory management and will possibly provide more efficient management of hazardous domestic waste in the city of Madrid. This information, however, is often ignored in the decision-making processes of the managing institutions (Palavecinos, 2008). In contexts in which the population is aware of existing facilities for implementing behaviour, it would be of interest to consider greater public participation in municipal management.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that creating the infrastructure is publicity in itself but knowledge and use thereof should be reinforced by communication campaigns should be emphasized. Madrid City Council’s infrastructure and communication campaign was intended to inform citizens of the existence of the FRCs and MRCs and of the need to use them. The City Council therefore attempted to set a social norm aimed at changing people’s intention of behaviour, as per the TBP In this campaign, when people who were unaware of the existence of FRCs or MRCs were informed of their existence, a high percentage of them showed their intention to use them in the future (between 41 and 74% of the sample). The social norm might therefore enable citizens to manage their hazardous household waste properly.</p>
