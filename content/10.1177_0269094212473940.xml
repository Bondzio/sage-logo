<abstract>
<p>Since entering office in 2010, a distinct grammar of localism has pervaded the UK Coalition Government’s philosophical outlook inflecting localist policy discourses and practice. This article, written in June 2012, considers the implications of this new grammar for the scope, organisation and mobilisation of economic development interventions, through a focus on the 2011 <italic>Localism Act</italic>, which applies to England and Wales. Interpreting these changes through a localist conceptual prism, which helps to refract varieties of localism, it raises some serious concerns regarding localism in action through exposing the controlling tendencies of central government. Analysis is also directed towards the uneasy relationship between centralised powers, conditional decentralisation and fragmented localism. Nevertheless, emergent practice serves to demonstrate how ‘constrained freedoms’ can be negotiated to undertake innovative actions. It concludes by suggesting some foundational elements that would support the notion of ‘empowered localities’ that may secure the government’s imperative to enable private sector-led growth.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212473940" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Economic development is a dynamic field of activity with theories remaining fluid, policies mobile and methodologies contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094212473940">McCann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094212473940">Pike et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the term ‘economic development’ is highly contested and controversial although, as Kevin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212473940">Cox (2011)</xref> suggests, the crux of ‘development’ can be understood as being about people: how they develop. Welfare is thus an important aspect of economic development, despite tendencies of policy and practice more recently to give preference to the pursuit of business growth beyond all other development concerns. Collectively, this presents considerable conceptual and practical challenges for scholars, practitioners and policy makers in terms of the scope, organisation and mobilisation of economic development interventions. A further dimension of complexity, particularly pertinent to England, is that economic development lacks a firm statutory status. Although local government may be ‘empowered’ through catch-all powers, such as the duty to promote economic, social or environmental well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094212473940">Murat and Morad, 2008</xref>) or the duty to produce a Local Economic Assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094212473940">Pugalis and Carling, 2012)</xref>, the onus to undertake economic development interventions remains optional.</p>
<p>Despite European cohesion policy that seeks to accelerate convergence between ‘lagging regions’ and the rest of the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212473940">Kyriacou and Roca-Sagalés, 2012</xref>), the more traditional redistributive approach, relying on subsidies to address need, has been replaced by a neoliberal investment approach intended to develop ‘assets’, exploit <italic>opportunities</italic> and incentivise growth. In England – and other nations – the private sector has been thrust to the forefront of economic development strategies as a variegated neoliberal orthodoxy prevails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212473940">Brenner et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the consequences of the fallout from the global credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn continue to occupy public discourse across many parts of the world and in particular in Europe and North America. Many governments have reduced public spending and implemented other measures in this ‘age of austerity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212473940">Cameron, 2009</xref>). Economic crises or shifts in political leadership tend to prompt a re-evaluation of established priorities, institutional mechanisms and modes of practice. When these processes coalesce, the outcome can be institutional upheaval and rapid policy shifts.</p>
<p>In England, the Coalition administration formed between the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats has been steadfast in its pursuit of radical local economic development policy reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212473940">2011</xref>). Concomitantly, the country has been undergoing a period of transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094212473940">Hockey and Morad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212473940">Jones, 2010</xref>), as central government seeks to transform state-society-business relations; a process which Vince Cable, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), has described as being ‘Maoist and chaotic’. The Government is producing new state spaces as it rapidly goes about the restructuring of public services, reforming the planning system and making changes to local government finance. This has been achieved by utilising a new grammar of localism, which has since been supported by statutory instruments as set out in the 2011 <italic>Localism Act</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094212473940">HOC, 2011c</xref>). As part of this, and distinct from every other major European country, regional institutions have been dismantled across all parts of England outside of London as part of a crusade to reduce bureaucracy and ‘release’ the creativity of localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269094212473940">Pugalis and Townsend, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094212473940">Shaw and Robinson, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As a lightweight counterbalance, in June 2010 the Government invited bids for Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs): public-private institutions reflecting a sub-national political and economic geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212473940">Bentley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212473940">Liddle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212473940">Pugalis, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094212473940">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269094212473940">Shutt et al., 2012</xref>; see Appendix 1 for map of LEPS). Later, in December 2011 the Government announced their intent to agree a series of individual ‘city deals’ with the promise to ‘free’ England’s largest cities from Whitehall control with a White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2011</xref>) setting out a menu of ‘transformative’ new powers. Initially restricted to England’s eight ‘core cities’ this offer has since been expanded to other localities via a second ‘wave’ of bids, and the possibility of further ‘waves’ over the coming years. The <italic>Localism Act</italic> also provides the potential for the creation of Mayoral Development Corporations (MDC), reminiscent of earlier such vehicles implemented during the early 1980s onwards by the then Conservative Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094212473940">Imrie and Thomas, 1999</xref>). Underpinned by an emphasis on a ‘self-help’ variant of local autonomy and a preoccupation with economic growth, these processes are potentially contributing to new directions in economic development.</p>
<p>At the time of writing in June 2012, the UK administration’s ‘local’ economic policy is becoming a little clearer (although shifts are ongoing); it is opportune to consider the implications of this new grammar of localism for the scope, organisation and mobilisation of economic development interventions. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to trace new and emergent directions in economic development through a focus on the 2011 <italic>Localism Act</italic>, which applies to England and Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212473940">1</xref></sup> The article interprets these changes through a localist conceptual prism, which helps to refract different varieties of localism. Provisional analysis is directed towards the uneasy relationship between centralised powers, conditional decentralisation and fragmented localism. By exposing the prevailing controlling tendencies of central government, some serious concerns are raised regarding <italic>localism in action</italic>. Cases of emergent practice are utilised to demonstrate how ‘constrained freedoms’ can be negotiated to undertake innovative actions. The article concludes by suggesting some foundational elements that would support the notion of ‘empowered localities’ and may also secure the Government’s imperative to enable private sector-led growth.</p>
<p>With further policy changes expected over coming months and years, the article provides a platform for introducing some possible directions of travel and thus opens up space for debate. In addition, the localist conceptual prism can be deployed in future research to examine the extent of the Coalition Government’s localist credentials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212473940"><title>A localist conceptual prism: Refracting different varieties of localism</title>
<p>A detailed examination of the political alternatives and theoretical subtleties of innumerable varieties of localism is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say here that localism, new localism or even newer ‘new localisms’ did not arrive on the scene with the Coalition Government. A discourse of decentralisation and ‘new localism’ rhetoric was a cornerstone of the last Labour administration (1997–2010) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212473940">Corry and Stoker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212473940">Local and Regional Government Research Unit, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094212473940">Morgan, 2007</xref>), with promises of a ‘double devolution’: a transfer of power from centre to local government, and local to the neighbourhood level, signifying empowerment and a new community politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212473940">Atkinson, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, New Labour’s time in office was also marked by a ‘new regionalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212473940">Deas and Ward, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269094212473940">Pugalis and Townsend, 2012a</xref>), which indicates the tension between competing scales of decentralisation. Over the years, UK Governments of different political persuasions have passionately proclaimed to be ‘localist’. In spite of this, England remains one of the most fiscally centralised nations across the OECD with ‘the balance of power’ firmly in favour of the centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212473940">HOC, 2009</xref>). However, after the 2010 General Election, the Coalition Government sought to claim the localism mantra, aiming to disperse Whitehall powers and responsibilities to local authorities, business, communities and other actors.</p>
<p>Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, is reported as proclaiming on his arrival in the department that he had three priorities for his tenure: ‘localism, localism and localism’. Yet, ‘localism’ remains a contested concept. To the Conservative Party – or more specifically prominent elements of the party – it appears to mean ‘shifting’ control and power down the scalar hierarchy. It can be viewed as part of David Cameron’s initial enthusiasm for a ‘Big Society’ programme, ‘to restore civic life and ensure civic engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212473940">Conservative Party, 2009</xref>: 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212473940">Conservative Party, 2010</xref>). In defining localism in these terms, the Coalition criticises what is seen as ‘Big Government’, which they associate with the centralism of the previous Labour Government under Gordon Brown’s premiership. The tenor of the critique is manifest in the principles underlying the <italic>Localism Act</italic> set out as the ‘Six Actions of Decentralisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2010b</xref>: 15). These are: (1) lift the burden of bureaucracy; (2) empower communities to do things their way; (3) increase local control of public finances; (4) diversify the supply of public services; (5) open up government to public scrutiny and; (6) strengthen accountability to local people. A question that immediately arises is: how will these principles be acted upon and operationalised in practice?</p>
<p>From a politico-policy lobbying perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212473940">Cox’s (2010)</xref> exploration of the foundational elements of localism asserts that power ‘truly’ does have to be devolved to the local level, which would require a recasting of central-local relations. He argues that the principle of subsidiarity should be applied; that efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services requires that decision making reside at the lowest feasible level. To implement this would mean an end (or marginalisation) of the competitive grant culture, wherein local government has to bid to Whitehall for funding. Financial autonomy is a prerequisite of localism, which could involve permitting local government to determine its own rates of taxes (and subsidies). Also, in the interests of social justice ‘true’ localism, in the words of Cox, would see an end to the postcode lottery of service provision by establishing a broad framework of national minimum outcomes, which allows local decision makers to design and deliver services which are more tailored to their own local circumstances. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212473940">Cox (2010: 7)</xref> argues for a ‘constitutional settlement between central and local government to create genuine autonomy, enshrine the key principles of central-local relations to protect the legitimacy of local government’.</p>
<p>While intellectual and political debate will continue on the notion of localism, key elements of the discussion hitherto are the degree of local autonomy and the extent of central control, including the requirement of fiscal flexibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212473940">Pratchett (2004)</xref> <grant-sponsor>suggests three distinct ways in which autonomy is manifest: as freedom from central interference; as freedom to effect particular outcomes; and as the reflection of local identity. The problematic in relation to the decentralisation of economic development functions is that it requires a shift from a ‘freedom from’ to a ‘freedom to’. This raises the question: is an absence of restraint and controls (i.e. negative freedom</grant-sponsor>), adequate? The precise nature of central-local relations needs elucidation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473940">Hildreth (2011)</xref> elaborates on this point by identifying three models of localism: conditional localism; representative localism; and community localism. ‘Conditional localism’ is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212473940">Corry and Stoker (2002)</xref> would term ‘New Centralism’; the ‘steering centralism’ manifest under the 1997–2010 Labour Governments which, while it afforded some autonomy to the local level, involved what is seen as a debilitating ‘targetry regime’, which included Public Service Agreements, to ensure that sub-national state spaces were delivering outcomes defined by ‘the centre’. This was part of New Labour’s process of public service reform: to improve service delivery but arguably also to ensure policy coherence from centre to local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212473940">Bentley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473940">Hildreth (2011)</xref>, ‘representative localism’ is characterised by local actors or spaces of governance having a clear constitutional position in a democratic system. Through this variety of localism, the chain of democratic accountability is the defining feature. In other words, there is subsidiarity, and is akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212473940">Cox (2010)</xref> argues would entail ‘true’ localism. This model reflects some European and US experience, where directly or indirectly elected mayors are the epitome of a ‘representative leadership’ and are perceived to offer scope for transparency, advocacy and strategic capacity, although they are not without their own dilemmas and critiques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094212473940">Travers, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also a notion of ‘community localism’ which involves devolution of power to local communities (however defined), and the direct involvement of communities and which, on the surface at least, appears to be consistent with calls for a Big Society. However, there are two important variants of community localism. First, there is ‘commissioning community localism’ in which the central state performs a commissioning role when devolving responsibility to a community for running a service or delivering a specified policy goal. The second, ‘community asset localism’, involves the centre in assigning all responsibility for running a service or managing an asset to the nominated community. The crucial difference concerns accountability. In the case of the first, the commissioning agent (i.e. central government) retains accountable body status whereas in the case of the second, accountability transfers to the community organisation. Community asset localism could be particularly attractive to a government, either central or local, to completely outsource a service, such as community uses associated with the transfer of a property ‘liability’. However, it is difficult to conceive that the State would ‘risk’ outsourcing service activities in a ‘no strings attached’ manner. In most cases, the relationship of centre to local is likely to involve some elements of control.</p>
<p>In May 2010 the Coalition published its programme for government – a five-year policy plan, which is explicit about the most urgent issue facing the UK: deficit reduction alongside an economic recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2010a</xref>). Whereas, arguably, the repercussions of the global credit crunch took some time to affect the ‘real’ everyday economy, the Coalition’s fiscal austerity measures – which equate to almost £100bn a year less than Labour’s 2009 plans by 2015–2016 – have had a more immediate and noticeable impact on people and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212473940">BBC, 2010</xref>). A key means of achieving economic recovery, according to the Government, is through private sector led growth and a localist economic development strategy, which is embodied in the <italic>Localism Act</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212473940"><title>The <italic>Localism Act</italic>: A new grammar of localism</title>
<p>The <italic>Localism Act</italic> received Royal Assent on 15 November 2011. Much of the debate has concentrated on statutory planning issues, as well as other important matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212473940">HOC, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212473940">2011d</xref>), which has marginalised the discussion about the implications for economic development. Thus, an examination of the <italic>Localism Act</italic> in terms of provisions for economic development is especially worthy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212473940">Table 1</xref> for a summary).

<p>The passing of the Act signalled the legislative death of regional governance, policy making and administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212473940">Bentley, 2011a</xref>). The intricate and convoluted regional economic policy architecture, including Regional Development Agencies, Government Offices for the Region, Regional Observatories, Regional Ministerial posts, Regional Select Committees and Local Authority Regional Leaders’ Boards has been swept away. Regional economic policy architecture has ‘[gone] the way of Anne Boleyn’, to invoke the words of Eric Pickles, and with it central-regional-local relations were irrevocably ruptured.</p>
<p>LEPs, ‘joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by local authorities themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2010a</xref>: 10), have taken up the baton on the role of leadership and strategic governance to promote local economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212473940">Liddle, 2012</xref>). However, just as there was no statutory role laid down for LEPs in the <italic>Localism Bill</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212473940">Bentley, 2011a)</xref>, in line with ministerial views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2010b</xref>), there is nothing in the Act that provides LEPs with a statutory function. Unlike the Regional Development Agencies, which had a statutory role, and were legally tasked to carry out certain functions, LEPs are bereft of any statutory roles and devoid of a legislative framework. As voluntaristic networks or ‘loose groupings’ of public-private actors, according to Eric Pickles, they are expected to negotiate in a field of public sector financial retrenchment where the role of the state is one of <italic>enablement</italic> rather than <italic>control.</italic></p>
<p>Thus, the ambiguity in the purpose, nature and statutory roles of LEPs is in stark contrast to the clarity of Regional Development Agency functions, as prescribed by New Labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212473940">HM Government, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212473940">2009</xref>). This ambiguous character of LEPs is arguably a product of the Coalition Government’s ideological zeal to eradicate ‘regions’ and institute a ‘different’ approach to that developed by Labour during the 2000s. The transitional period created by their policy of localist decentralisation has been critiqued for a lack of foresight, limited understanding of the legalistic and operational practicalities, and a deficient assessment of the disbenefits and cost implications of ‘wielding the axe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212473940">HOC, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212473940">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094212473940">National Audit Office, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In principle, LEPs are ‘free’ to do whatever is necessary to secure economic prosperity and growth. The Act enshrines this principle in the General Power of Competence which is afforded to local authorities. With LEPs bereft of a statutory purpose, nevertheless a clause in the Act (Part 1, Chapter 4, Section 15) provides the Secretary of State with the power to transfer public functions to <italic>permitted authorities</italic> and, in particular, those that (1) promote economic development or wealth creation or (2) increase local accountability in relation to each local public function transferred by the order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212473940">HOC, 2011b</xref>). The first is a clear function of LEPs, and it would appear to potentially afford them a more formalised role as in this instance they would be executing some statutory public function under the guise of a permitted authority; albeit the precise nature of possible public functions is not laid down in the Act. Thus, the Act makes the provision for economic development functions to be transferred to specific permitted authorities, but such functions are to be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Early assessments of the Coalition’s decentralisation efforts in relation to economic development have tended to converge in arguing that their motives and actions sit uneasily with their localist rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212473940">Bentley et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, the question arises of what of localism in action? Will government decentralise powers to the local level? What variety of localism do LEPs represent? Will LEPs obtain greater autonomy from central government than economic development agencies hitherto? The following sections examine the scope, organisation and mobilisation of economic development interventions, interpreting the development of LEPs and the provisions for economic development policies in the light of the localist conceptual prism constructed earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094212473940"><title>Doing things their way? Scope and freedom for localities to deploy innovative economic interventions</title>
<p>The primary question here is: are the ‘shackles off’ for local authorities and LEPs? The General Power of Competence, which is afforded to local authorities, core members of LEPs, suggests this is the case. Instead of being permitted to act only where there is a duty or power to do so, lest otherwise they would be acting <italic>ultra vires</italic>, local authorities are <italic>freed to do anything</italic>. A council is now enabled to do anything ‘that individuals generally may do’, including ‘things unlike anything that other public bodies do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212473940">Eversheds, 2011</xref>), but provided they do not break other laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011: 7</xref>). What is more, the Government positively proclaims that authorities will be encouraged to come forward with innovative proposals. The Act grants the Secretary of State the power to remove unnecessary restrictions and limitations to Councils’ actions.</p>
<p>Moreover, it states that the ‘Duty to Co-operate’ will offer councils ‘increased confidence to do creative, innovative things to meet local people’s needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011: 7</xref>). This suggests that local authorities will have the freedom to effect particular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212473940">Pratchett, 2004</xref>) and would seem to encourage local determination of actions. Recent work provides some evidence that some LEPs are coming forward with proposals for what could be termed innovative actions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212473940">Table 2</xref>). Some of the actions reflect neoliberal thinking and are concerned with deregulation issues and infrastructure provision, whereas others represent more proactive measures to support business growth through subsidies.

<p>Attuned to the principle of subsidiarity, this could be interpreted as a progressive move towards a representative localism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473940">Hildreth, 2011</xref>). This view is further substantiated as the Act enables Ministers to transfer local public functions from central government and remote quangos to local authorities, Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards – in order ‘to improve local accountability or promote economic growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011</xref>: 9). What is intriguing about this scenario is that a group of local authorities could establish an Economic Prosperity Board as a mechanism to provide strategic economic leadership and deliver economic development interventions in a manner that overrides and completely bypasses LEPs. This is because the powers are devolved to local authorities and not to non-statutory LEPs.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, however, just how substantially different and innovative the LEP initiatives are from what has characterised economic development policy hitherto and whether localities do really have the freedom to effect outcomes. Looking at this through the localist conceptual prism, the question arises: do innovative actions represent a move towards a representative localism or does this belie a conditional localism where control is maintained by central government and LEPs’ and local authorities’ activities are circumscribed in other ways?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212473940"><title>The organisation and governance of ‘local’ economic development</title>
<p>The <italic>Localism Act</italic> enables Ministers to transfer local public functions from central government and quangos to <italic>permitted authorities</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094212473940">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011</xref>: 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212473940">HOC, 2011b</xref>) – this would include local authorities, Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards. How this relates precisely to LEPs is unclear. Do Economic Prosperity Boards supersede LEPs? Or do they underpin or overlay LEP configurations? Do they negate the role of the LEP? Or, are LEPs to be assigned permitted authority status? At the moment, local authorities appear to be a crucial bridging mechanism and also appear to have been granted a more prominent role in economic development than was the case under New Labour’s centralist-regionalist framework. Albeit, greater ‘freedom from’ is constrained by a depleted funding pot that restricts ‘freedom to’ act.</p>
<p>Observing the operation of the 39 LEPs to date, it is apparent that the majority are ‘propped up’ by local authority staffing and resources. In this respect, despite the wishes of central government for LEPs to be private sector led and free from ‘local authority bureaucracy’, local authorities are performing a critical role, which often remains understated. Despite this, these new powers provide the Secretary of State with the ability to significantly empower the major city authorities and other local authorities to develop their areas, improve local services, and stimulate their local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212473940">HM Government, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the only example of a Combined Authority (at the time of writing, although others such as the wider metropolitan area of Leeds are set to follow), the LEP performs an advisory role rather than the functions commonly associated with a strategic economic delivery body. In the Black Country, local authorities had already formed the Black Country Consortium and subsequently are working together with and on behalf of the Black Country LEP. It seems apparent from this and the possibility of the formation of Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards that this will result in a rationalisation of governance structures, partnership arrangements and the pooling of services, given central government powers could be handed down to these bodies. This raises the question: is the ‘local’ level being given a constitutional position? If so, this suggests a representative localism could emerge.</p>
<p>One further interlocking thread of the Localism Act, to support this idea, is the promotion of joint working among councils, as indicated by the Duty to Co-operate. Constituted as an Economic Prosperity Board, groupings of two or more local authorities have the potential to take on central government functions, as provided for in the Act. The Act grants the Secretary of State the power to remove unnecessary restrictions and limitations to Councils’ actions. Moreover, it states that the duty will offer councils ‘increased confidence to do creative, innovative things to meet local people’s needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011: 7</xref>). This would seem to encourage thinking ‘outside the box’. However, this is guided by a strong preference for cost savings that arguably override aspirations to devolution to secure better synergy and or potentially more appropriate geographies of policy delivery. Indeed, the <italic>Plain English Guide to the Act</italic> points to this; the general power of competence bequeaths councils more freedom to ‘work together with others in new ways <italic>to drive down costs</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011: 7</xref>, our emphasis).</p>
<p>In regard to major cities, it does however appear that the Coalition is championing a ‘representative localism’ since the Act offers the option of elected Mayors. Besides providing democratic accountability, Mayors would potentially have considerable powers, as does the Mayor of London, given MDCs can be set up, which would provide the LEP economic development advisory-type role with the ‘teeth’ and resources that they lack. Liverpool City MDC, for example, is to have a single investment programme, utilising public and private finance through a single capital pot, of circa £120–150m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212473940">Fitzgerald, 2012</xref>). However, MDCs are conditional on an elected Mayor. In practice, this option was discarded by voters after nine cities roundly rejected having an elected Mayor in the referenda held in England in May 2012. However, it is unclear whether the cities, local authorities, groupings of local authorities and/or other non-state spaces will seek and be granted additional economic development powers and resources, such as those they would obtain through a Development Corporation. Yet, the contractual localism that is present in City Deals requires significant pledges from local authorities in terms of accountability, efficiency and innovation, in return for rather limited flexibilities and incentives from central government. Such moves suggest a constrained set of local freedoms and a conditional form of localism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473940">Hildreth, 2011</xref>) far removed from the ‘freedom to’ act notion replete in ‘true’ localism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212473940">Cox, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A further form of localism refracted through the localist conceptual prism is related to service delivery. Arguably, the central government trend of devolving responsibility to particular ‘communities’ (e.g. LEPs) for running a service (i.e. a strategic economic development function) means LEPs could be interpreted as a form of ‘commissioning community localism’ since here government is the accountable body. However, it is questionable how representative LEPs are and, moreover, how representative they are of ‘the community’ in the sense of the Coalition’s predominant use of the term (i.e. the Big Society). This sits uneasily with notions of community localism.</p>
<p>All these scenarios generate competing spatial imaginaries, scales of governance and variable geometries of sub-national economic development bodies, which are reminiscent of the rival economic development entities (i.e. regions, city regions, multi-area agreements etc.) that mired Labour’s plans to simplify and improve the effectiveness of sub-national economic development and regeneration interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212473940">HM Treasury, 2007</xref>). This situation is likely to result in different places accessing different powers over different timescales: the outcome being a fragmented localism, more so when funding is taken into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094212473940"><title>Waving a magic wand? Mobilising economic development interventions</title>
<p>A critical issue in the local economic development debate is finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473940">Haughton and McManus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094212473940">Liberal Democrats, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269094212473940">Williams, 2011</xref>). One of the most important ways in which local autonomy can be demonstrated is by reference to the availability of resources and having power to take decisions over expenditure: a ‘freedom to’. At the time of writing the majority of dedicated funding streams that support local economic development interventions comes from central government and goes to the private sector directly or to local authorities, or comes with strings attached (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212473940">Table 3</xref>). This is a ‘conditional’ from of localism and akin to the mode of localism practised by the last Labour administration – a form of localism constrained by central interference.

<p>Due to the competitive nature of the rollout of Enterprise Zone policy, many LEP areas were unsuccessful. Consequently, there are LEP areas with Enterprise Zones, and the benefits conferred, and those LEP areas without. This, arguably, has created a two-tier LEP structure, consistent with a fragmented and possibly divisive form of localism and which fails to meet a tenet of a ‘true’ localism. The outcome is anticipated to be the development of multispeed LEPs: a postcode lottery is operating, especially between urban and rural LEPs, but also those that have in place a shared sense of purpose and concomitant institutional support and those that do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094212473940">Pugalis et al., 2012</xref>). A further issue is that the projects coming forward as competitive bids for Regional Growth Fund can secure support even if they do not accord with larger-than-local LEP priorities and/or local economic development priorities. Moreover, the <italic>Regional</italic> Growth Fund is centrally administered in this post-regional institutional landscape.</p>
<p>What the <italic>Localism Act</italic> does do, however, is to loosen the constrained freedoms of councils in terms of local authority finance. Providing councils with greater control over budgets, since the Act accords local authorities the power to retain business rates and to utilise these for economic development purposes, is a progressive step in terms of expanding the ‘freedom to’ permit local authorities to offer business rate discounts. In concert with neoliberal thinking, this would help attract firms, investment and jobs to a locality, although the actual outcomes remain contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269094212473940">Williams, 2011</xref>). However, there is a sting in the tail for local authorities – councils will be expected to meet the cost of any business rate discount from local resources. Although central government counter that councils ‘may decide that the immediate cost of the discount is outweighed by the long-term benefit of attracting growth and jobs to their area’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473940">DCLG, 2011</xref>: 8), in an age of austerity, where local authorities are having to reduce their spending on services by up to a third, the implementation of such a generally sound policy principle is likely to be limited in the immediate future. A further sting in the tail relates to the competitive nature of such a policy, which could breed a divisive variety of localism. One council may opt to offer a business rate discount while a neighbouring council might not, which may result in a zero-sum game of local place wars, whereby the main beneficiaries are the border-hopping businesses. This is reminiscent of the Conservative’s Enterprise Zone policy of the 1980s which was heavily criticised for causing business displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094212473940">Shutt, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to national resources, EU funds feature prominently across the English local economic development landscape. To date, clarity is lacking over their management over the 2014–2020 programming period, especially as ‘regional’ priorities are now defunct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269094212473940">Pugalis and Fisher, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, this state-led restructuring put the UK completely out of step with the rest of Europe and posed the question at what scale the administration of the Structural Funds was to be carried out in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269094212473940">Pugalis and Fisher, 2011</xref>). It could potentially involve an upwards rescaling (centralisation) with management via central government or a downwards rescaling (variety of localism) to sub-national geographies of governance, which could involve a management role for LEPs or other larger-than-local arrangements. However, any downwards rescaling would necessitate lengthy negotiations with the EU; there is only one case in the EU where a sub-regional authority performs a managing role. ‘Transitional arrangements’ have witnessed the recentralisation of managing agent functions to Whitehall. Nevertheless, small ‘local teams’ of civil servants and remodelled ‘local committees’ of strategic actors, have been retained, under the top-down jurisdiction of DCLG (that coexists with bottom-up shadow regional arrangements). It remains to be seen which scale(s) of governance will be responsible for management of the Structural Funds in the forthcoming 2014–2020 programming period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094212473940">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Drawing on USA models in particular, new financial instruments have been introduced such as Tax Increment Financing (TIF), which enable borrowing on future income, and which are to be channelled through local authorities, whereas other schemes, such as the Business Growth Fund, set up as part of Project Merlin, are to be delivered via the private sector. It is difficult not to be cynical about the latter scheme and to say, given this name, that, along with other schemes initiated by central government, this gives the impression that the Coalition Government is waving a magic wand and sprinkling ‘magic’ dust very selectively over the LEP areas. This is with the expectation that the private sector will create the jobs and growth necessary to climb out of a recession and ‘rebalance’ the economy.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212473940">Table 3</xref>, the funding streams and tools for local economic development interventions in the main bypass LEPs and/or local authorities. The broader point is that the Coalition Government appears to have set in motion a new direction for local economic development policy that entails a considerable degree of centralist control; those delivery mechanisms that are to be decentralised come with strings attached. For example, the only central government funds that LEPs have at their direct disposal are a nominal share of the £5 m Start-up Fund and the £4 m Capacity Fund, which they have to bid for. It is therefore no surprise that LEPs collectively argued for additional funding at the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094212473940">National LEP Network conference held in April 2012</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269094212473940">4</xref></sup> It is thus unfortunate for those seeking localism in action that the response from Eric Pickles was that any additional funding would come with strings attached. This indicates that far from any notion of a representative or community localism, the Government is promoting a form of conditional localism and the outcome is a fragmented and potentially divisive localism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094212473940"><title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Since entering office in 2010, the Coalition administration for the UK has embarked on a rapid public sector deficit reduction plan of unprecedented proportions. The result has been institutional upheaval, policy shifts and contracting pots of funding. Consequently, this potentially set in train new and emergent directions in economic development theory and practice. A new grammar of localism pervades the Coalition’s approach which is inflecting policy discourses and practice more broadly. Nevertheless, this new grammar masks a contextual history of centralisation. Indeed, England remains one of the most centralised nations across Europe. It is also distinct from every other major European country when it comes to strategic development as it embarks on a spatial ‘rebalancing’ plan within a post-regional institutional landscape which has changed the organisation of economic development. The UK Government once again demonstrates mobilities of policy as it borrows from US practice (e.g. Tax Increment Financing) but it also returns to the old as it reintroduces policies implemented by the 1980s Conservative administrations (e.g. Urban Development Corporations and Enterprise Zones).</p>
<p>Initial analysis suggests that the radical rhetoric of the Coalition’s localist discourse bears limited similarities to localism in action. This is not simply due to an inability to implement proposals. The Coalition Government’s absorption of many of the Regional Development Agencies’ most important functions at the national level at the same time was implemented swiftly and without consultation. This highlights the contradiction between a new grammar of localism and the insidious centralist tendencies; the uneasy relationship between centralised powers, conditional decentralisation and a fragmented localism. The implication could be the emergence of a divisive variant of localism in action where incentives produce ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ – rewarding the former whilst penalising the latter.</p>
<p>An initial examination of the new and emergent directions in economic development heralded by the Coalition Government’s localist policy discourses and specifically legislation enshrined in the 2011 <italic>Localism Act</italic>, shows that as far as the localism agenda is concerned, if localism means that authorities have ‘freedom from’, the <italic>Act</italic> promises that elements of this could be met. However, at the time of writing in June 2012, local and sub-national economic bodies have limited ‘freedom to’ make policy and investment decisions that significantly influence local economies since the Coalition administration appears to be intent on retaining a firm grip on the purse strings. Furthermore some of the policy priorities of government initiatives (e.g. RGF) might conflict with those of the LEP locality.</p>
<p>There should be no automatic assumption that LEPs are directly attuned with localism (either in a conceptual or operational sense), simply because they have ‘local’ in their name. In many cases, LEPs represent a weak variety of localism that displays few of the characteristics of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473940">Hildreth’s (2011)</xref> representative localism or still less of a community localism. Nonetheless, there is some indication that LEPs are ‘doing things their way’ since there is evidence that they are undertaking some innovative actions, subject to less central government interference than hitherto.</p>
<p>Although LEPs are not defined in legislation there are some provisions in the <italic>Localism Act</italic> that have important implications for the scope, organisation and mobilisation of economic development interventions. The General Power of Competence permits local authorities to do <italic>anything</italic> lawful. Also, clauses in the <italic>Act</italic> provide the Secretary of State with the powers to transfer public functions to <italic>permitted authorities</italic>, namely those that promote economic development or wealth creation. The Act also assigns a Minister of the Crown authority to delegate to a permitted authority any of the Minister’s eligible functions, the permitted authorities being Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards. This would suggest that the principle of decentralising economic development functions has been strengthened by the <italic>Localism Act</italic>, although the principle to formalise cross-authority working may have its philosophical roots in the imperative to drive down costs.</p>
<p>To conclude, a new deal for local economic development is required – a deal that is grounded in locally specific cocktails of representative and community localism, which offers the freedom to effect outcomes. Such a deal cannot possibly be delivered on a financial shoestring without the devolution of budgets<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269094212473940">5</xref></sup> and accompanying economic levers.</p>
