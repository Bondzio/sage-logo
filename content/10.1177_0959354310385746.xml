<abstract>
<p>Defiance is sometimes treated as behavior that needs to be punished or even diagnosed, especially when it is expressed by the subjugated. In contrast to that view, I argue that the readiness to be defiant is a virtue. Drawing upon an Aristotelian framework, updated by an uncompromising challenge to hegemonic power differences, I indicate a way for the subjugated and disenfranchised to recoup self-worth and moral agency. Defiance even may help correct for burdened virtues, as Lisa Tessman analyzes them. Thus, this article falls within the domains of moral psychology and social change. Difficulties in conceptualizing and operationalizing defiance as a virtue, especially since defiance tends to be divisive within society, are discussed in terms of cases. Special attention is paid to medicalizing discourses that take defiance to be a sign of pathology, especially with members of oppressed groups.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The classical conception of virtues presents a hopeful picture of flourishing individuals within a flourishing society. That is, the virtues arguably exist to enhance individual and social life within a well-functioning society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310385746">Aristotle, trans. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310385746">Plato, trans. 1974</xref>). But most current societies are not well-functioning. As Claudia Card has argued, what are virtues for one group may be vices for another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310385746">Card, 1990</xref>; cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310385746">Potter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>). I argue that defiance may be a necessary character trait in order for members of oppressed groups to live with self-respect under the rule of authority and even, sometimes, to effect societal changes. The readiness to be defiant I call a virtue. At the same time, I raise concerns about the potentially serious repercussions to the oppressed when they act defiantly—including the consequence that one may be diagnosed with a mental disorder. Let me say at the outset that I am not arguing against the existence of pathological behavior altogether; I do think there is such a thing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310385746">Zachar &amp; Potter, 2010a</xref>). But I do worry that medical and cultural matrices can collide when people seem to be defiant and that healthy virtuous defiance is sometimes conflated with bad, and even mad, behavior. So, it is important to get clear on how we think about, evaluate, and respond to, behavior that we or others interpret as “defiant.” This paper constitutes a beginning of that move toward clarity.</p>
<p>In this article, I first of all provide a conceptual analysis of defiance, setting it out as an attitude and behavior that responds to authoritative norms and structures as well as to authority figures. I distinguish it from civil disobedience, although I note that the two action-concepts share some features. In the next section, I explain why I draw upon virtue theory instead of the two prevailing moral theories, deontological and consequentialist, and then argue for the merits of thinking that, under certain circumstances, defiance is a virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354310385746">1</xref></sup> I then turn to Lisa Tessman’s theory of burdened virtues, where I situate defiance as a way to rescue at least some virtues from their burden.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354310385746">2</xref></sup> After that discussion, I address the messiness of distinguishing between defiance as indicative of bad behavior, mental disorder, or virtue. I first work through several examples and indicate what additional features or considerations would suggest how best to evaluate defiant behavior (as signs of madness, badness, or virtue.) I then grapple with retaliation as a response to defiance by the oppressed. It is important to consider retaliation because, depending on the severity and duration of retaliation, it can call into question the benefits of defiance. In the next section, I confront the problem that this analysis doesn’t result in a neat and tidy construct of defiance as a virtue; instead, it illustrates tensions between being virtuous and being defiant, tensions I do not try to resolve. Finally, I suggest one way to remedy the vices of the oppressor, or the defied.</p>
<p>By highlighting the value of defiance for members of oppressed groups, I do not mean that defiance is not also valuable for others. As I will argue, defiance has extremes, and we are challenged to identify the parameters and limits of proper defiance regardless of our positions within power structures. But consider: acts of defiance are sometimes lauded as heroic; recall Socrates, who defied Greek expectations of scholarly teaching when he refused to stop “corrupting the youth.” One might defy a policy, as seen with athletes who are not supposed to use performance-enhancing drugs but do so anyway. In this case, being defiant seems neither heroic nor praiseworthy—it just seems opportunistic. Abraham’s Sarah of the <italic>Old Testament</italic> scriptures defied the odds of getting pregnant in her old age by conceiving their son Isaac. But her act of conception isn’t praiseworthy because it was not within her power to reverse her sterility, and typically we should not be praised for things outside our control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959354310385746">3</xref></sup> “Defying the odds” here is metaphorical. At the very least, defiance needs to be done voluntarily, without coercion. The above examples of actions that could be called “defiant” raises questions both about its content and about its extremes and, while I do not set out necessary and sufficient conditions for defiance, I do address some of the questions that emerge when trying to be clear about the concept.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354310385746">
<title>The scope and content of defiance</title>
<p>Defiance can be understood as a response to authority and, in particular, the way that authoritative bodies use power. Authoritative institutions and persons seem to call for deferential obedience but may overstep their bounds, especially if they use coercion to enforce their power. As Meir Dan-Cohen writes, “those subject to an authority are expected to defer to its wishes and demands. ‘Deference’ signifies a ‘submission or yielding to the judgment, opinion, will, etc., of another,’ as well as an attitude of ‘respectful or courteous regard’” (1994, p. 35). Authority, argues Dan-Cohen, seeks voluntary obedience by appealing to an attitude of respect for authority’s claims on us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310385746">Dan-Cohen, 1994</xref>, p. 35); being motivated by respect or regard expresses our willingness to accede to it. In other words, deference given by the ruled toward authority is a communicative act; it conveys the attitude that authoritative bodies expect the ruled to adopt. But if those authoritative bodies use coercion to effect compliance, the attitude and motivation for being (freely) compliant is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310385746">Dan-Cohen, 1994</xref>, pp. 38–39). Authority’s use of coercion may undercut its own legitimacy and may call for a challenge. One such way to challenge coercive or abuse of authority is through defiance.</p>
<sec id="section2-0959354310385746">
<title>Attitude and behavior</title>
<p>Defiance belongs with a cluster of actions and attitudes that include (but are not identical to) dissent, resistance, rebellion, and civil disobedience. A defiant action is an “in your face” one; a defiant attitude is openly and deliberately disrespectful. In a refusal to bow to authority, the defiant person has the passion of anger (or indignation, or contempt) behind her. Defiance has less force and more limited scope than rebellion, but does not imply the “civilized” quality that dissent, resistance, and civil disobedience do; those latter forms of protest typically are organized and pre-planned. Harking back to the opening quote, I think defiance <italic>is</italic> uncivilized, in the sense that socializing systems and hegemonic order enforce civility as defined by European-American values.</p>
<p>Defiance is also active rather than passive, and for an act to be a defiant one, it must be more than merely refusing to participate. A person may refuse to pay income taxes because she doesn’t want her tax money to be spent on the military, but this strikes me as more akin to civil disobedience than defiance. My reasoning is that refusals to participate are more like acts of omission, and acts of omission are not emphatic or direct enough to function as a challenge to oppressive norms and practices. (I say more about the distinction between civil disobedience and defiance below.) Defiance acts in the face of direct authority.</p>
<p>To engage authority directly is important because it requires oppressors to acknowledge that their authority is being challenged. Although one can be quietly defiant, or defiant in maintaining one’s dignity in the face of dehumanization and subjugation, quiet defiance is closer to a deficiency. Consider actions that are directly confrontational contrasted with passive-aggressive efforts at thwarting authority. Passive-aggressive behavior doesn’t promote flourishing, because it complicates our ability to get our needs met and for others to take seriously our needs and expectations. Marcia Linehan’s description of active passivity is the sort of thing I have in mind, where the person is actively seeking help from others but not engaging in problem-solving herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310385746">1993</xref>, p. 78). Linehan distinguishes active passivity from learned helplessness, the latter expressing that the person has given up on seeking help from others. It’s not so much that active passivity is ineffective as it is that its indirectness takes the parties involved on a circuitous and unclear path toward problem-solving. Furthermore, in active passivity, the person’s solicitations for help may be experienced by others as demanding or clinging, and a vicious cycle of demandingness/invalidation between the parties is begun. Linehan notes that active passivity occurs more in women than men, and she cites evidence that women are encouraged to use indirect and sometimes helpless modes in problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310385746">1993</xref>, p. 80). In order to be defiant, then, we must directly engage authoritative power in the form of norms, persons, or policies. And, as I noted earlier, warranted defiance may be, in a sense, heroic, as when the defiant one takes substantial risks. Even then, though, risks, at least in principle, must be balanced against potential benefits. (I postpone a discussion of this matter until later in this article.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354310385746">
<title>Civility and civil disobedience</title>
<p>Since I emphasize that defiance is “uncivil,” a discussion of civility is in order. Civility has a variety of understandings. Joan McGregor says it concerns good manners and “treating others as if they matter. The standards are those that go beyond the moral minimum; that is, they include more than merely not violating people’s rights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310385746">McGregor, 2004</xref>, p. 26). Cheshire Calhoun’s idea of common decency as moral expectations we hold about how a minimally well-formed person will behave might also be included as a kind of civility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310385746">Calhoun, 2004</xref>). Jonathan Schonsheck argues that repudiating the central social values of tolerance and mutual respect is the most serious kind of incivility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310385746">Schonsheck, 2004</xref>, p. 169). His idea is that “incivility escalates to insurrection, to civil war” (p. 175).</p>
<p>It seems that civil behavior centered on values such as respect, tolerance, and decency is hard to come by in societies with multiple oppressions. But my point here is that (a) civility is a socializing mechanism that keeps people from revolt and people’s tempers from undermining social relations and (b) what counts as civility varies depending on the group(s) in which one holds membership(s). Practically speaking, civility is a valuable social lubricant both with our peers and with those across class and culture divides. Still, civility is taken to be a virtue best exemplified and passed on by women<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959354310385746">4</xref></sup>, and those who fail to exhibit manners such as deference to authority are judged as morally flawed or mentally ill. (More on this matter below.)</p>
<p>Civil disobedience, as I employ it, is a conscious, intentional, and public breaking of a law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310385746">Falcón y Tella, 2004</xref>, p. 315.) It is usually done collectively and with the expectation that the civilly disobedient will accept the legal sanctions against those actions. It is an act of law-breaking that is aimed at changing an unjust law where success counts as bringing about the change, and lack of change following civil disobedience tends to negate the efforts of disobedience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310385746">David Lefkowitz (2007)</xref> similarly defines civil disobedience as “deliberate disobedience to one or more laws of a state for the purpose of advocating a change to that state’s laws or policies” (p. 204). I am inclined to view the flag-burning that occurred during the Vietnam era as acts of defiance instead of civil disobedience; flag-burners exhibited an in-your-face dramatization of their belief that the war was unjustified and malignant. Burning the American flag signified the scorn that the flag-burners felt toward an America that touts liberty and equality and yet perpetuates an unwinnable war. The objective of defiance, in this case, is not a change in law but something much broader such as withdrawal of troops and a demand for transparency in America’s military conduct and strategies. Furthermore, it has the expressive content of challenging America’s values and its adherence to the status quo. In contrast to acts such as flag-burning, Lefkowitz emphasizes the quality of “suitably constrained” civil disobedience. It is one form of principled disobedience to the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310385746">Lefkowitz, 2007</xref>, p. 205). Individuals will often need to act collectively in order to bring about a change while protecting the moral rights of all; collective action is often more effective at bringing about institutional changes.</p>
<p>Both defiance and civil disobedience affirm the oppressors’ agency by treating them as agents, but the focus and attitudinal content of defiance is different from that of civil disobedience. Acts of civil disobedience make a moral claim on oppressors to recognize our humanity. They convey the message that the oppressors’ own values require them to treat us differently from the way they are treating us. Defiance speaks to norms as much as to persons, and it expresses that the oppressors’ values are distorted or perverse. For example, when the Madres de la Plaza de Maya organized a movement in which their walking vigils marked their refusal to let the memory of their lost ones fade, they seemed to be exhibiting defiance—of the authorities who demanded silence and acceptance from those whose loved ones were disappeared and of norms of femaleness as willingly subordinate, forgiving, and suffering in silence. By calling out a social norm, we identify it as a product of oppressive structures that benefits the privileged while it burdens the disenfranchised. We may defy a norm for reasons of self-respect or with the aim of presenting a direct challenge. Furthermore, and perhaps the most salient difference, is that civil disobedience typically requires of the actors that we be willing to submit to the rule of law when punishment is determined for violations. Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King led nonviolent protests in which their followers had to be ready and willing to accept the legal punishment that attends breaking a law. Neither civil disobedience nor defiance can accurately be described as submissive, but when leaders such as Gandhi or King emphasize not only acceptance of legal punishment but also an attitude toward love of one’s oppressors, their civil disobedience seems rather tame compared to defiance (although still quite taxing).</p>
<p>But what makes defiance a virtue, instead of just a tactical behavior or an expression like “ouch”? In the next sections, I explain why virtue theory is a good way to think about defiance and then I situate virtue theory as it aligns virtues in accordance with the status of different classifications of people (e.g., gendered, racialized). Here I draw on Lisa Tessman’s work (2005). This puts me in a position to argue that defiance is, in fact, a virtue, although a complicated and messy one.</p>

<sec id="section5-0959354310385746">
<title>What virtue theory is and what it has to offer</title>
<p>In both deontological and consequentialist moral theories, rules or principles predominate, and although one might be able to generate dispositions important to rule-following, rules or principles are taken to be the ultimate guides to morality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0959354310385746">6</xref></sup> But, as I argue elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310385746">Potter, 2002</xref>), theories of right action that take following rules or principles to be the path to morality do not adequately address the complex issues involved in being moral in our interpersonal, civic, and working lives. Rules can tell us what our duties are, or how to bring about the better state of affairs among the options available, but being a good person as a social, moral, psychological, and political component of our lives is much broader than rule-following. Instead of emphasizing the moral categories of the obligatory and the forbidden, virtue ethics focuses on what is involved in being a certain sort of person—namely, a good or virtuous one—and our responsibility is to keep such dispositional features in mind and strive towards them. This project takes as a starting point that virtue ethics provides a clarity and richness to our thinking about defiance that, in fact, requires that we sometimes <italic>challenge</italic> rules and principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0959354310385746">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>As I say, framing moral questions in terms of virtue ethics puts dispositions, and not rules, at the center. This approach suggests a way of thinking about morality that highlights the self as social and political. Along with modern moral systems that focus on rules and right actions, a certain conception of the self has emerged—the modern democratized self that “has no necessary social content and no necessary social identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310385746">MacIntyre, 1984</xref>, p. 205). This view of the self is an important or integral component of theories of right action, because most of them presuppose and require the impartial and autonomous moral agent. In contrast to that view, numerous writers have argued that the self is situated and inherently social, a view that I also hold. This means that, because we are historical and social selves, we are never simply individuals learning to be good. This point is important when considering Lisa Tessman’s caution that focusing on the morally damaged psyche of the oppressed often slides into victim-blaming instead of holding exploitative institutions and structures responsible. I return to this point shortly.</p>
<p>In the abstract, virtues are settled states of character that contribute to human flourishing. They are instrumentally good in that they are necessary to living a fully flourishing life, but they are intrinsically good as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310385746">Aristotle, trans. 1985</xref>, p. 1097b). Furthermore, virtue is not only a matter of being the sort of person who performs right actions but of being the sort of person who has <italic>feelings</italic> appropriate to a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310385746">Aristotle, trans. 1985</xref>, pp. 1106b15-25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310385746">Sherman 1991</xref>, p. 49). As with actions we perform, emotions are responses that affect both the agent and the observer, and the virtuous person <italic>cares</italic> about these responses. Many of the virtues can be understood to function as a kind of social glue: friendship, for example, brings together people who care about each other for the other’s sake; wit brings together people who enjoy pleasures of clever and keen-minded humor; generosity provides a bridge between people who have different levels of financial security; and justice serves as a corrective both for interpersonal and societal unfairnesses.</p>
<p>An interesting and significant feature of defiance is that it seems to be, and often is, divisive rather than cohesive, and that result seems to be antithetical to a virtuous society. Yet, as I go on to argue, when defiance expresses the mean, it contributes to the betterment of the defier and, in the long run, promotes flourishing and well-being of society more generally. In the conclusion, I argue that the best way to transform divisiveness into longer-term social cohesion is for those in relative power to draw upon another virtue—the virtue of giving uptake rightly. But first, since I primarily am focusing on ways that the lives of the subjugated can be improved, let me say a bit about another Aristotelian concept: flourishing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959354310385746">
<title>Virtues and flourishing</title>
<p>Virtues contribute to the good life—and not just for you or me, but for the neighborhood, the community, and society. What counts as the mean is contextual in that it is relative to me and it varies depending on the persons involved, the particularities of the situation, the parties’ relation to power and authority, and so on. But virtues are not subjective—in each situation, there is a right way to feel and act that is consistent with genuine flourishing. Of course, how a virtue is understood depends on historical context and societal needs at the time. For example, courage in ancient Greece focused on how and when to face fear in battle; Americans today might need courage to be whistle-blowers or to leave an abusive relationship. And although it is inescapable that talk about virtue is inflected by gender and racialization, how social groupings of difference are permitted or barred from expressing particular virtues varies from culture to culture. Still, virtues neither are merely for theorists nor merely culture-bound.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, the classical picture of virtues is that they contribute to flourishing both individually and collectively. But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310385746">Card (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman (2005)</xref> argue, current societies are far from egalitarian, and what is considered virtuous for one category of people is not a virtue for others. Virtues tend to line up along differences in power, where flourishing is a quality of life that the more powerful can experience with the aid of the subjugated whose virtues prop up those power differences. As we have seen, defiance engages people’s relationship to power and authority and to social norms that tend to preserve the status quo. Admittedly, this way of thinking about power and virtues is antithetical to an Aristotelian analysis of flourishing. Aristotle certainly paid attention to those power differences, but he argued that they are natural and unproblematic. I also attend to differences in power and authority but reject Aristotle’s reliance on hegemonic society. It is precisely because differences in power impede the flourishing of the subjugated that we need virtues like defiance that specifically target the injustices and harms that the disenfranchised experience. So, although I draw upon Aristotle’s framework of virtue theory, I challenge the value of hegemonic society and, instead, look to virtues that pave the way ultimately for more egalitarian social and interpersonal relations.</p>
<p>But structures within society seem to insist that the ruled learn (or at least pretend to learn) the values of civility, cooperation, and so on, even on pain of developing damaged characters. As Lisa Tessman says, “…having to develop virtues that are disconnected from flourishing can be understood as a real deprivation created by oppressive conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>, p. 49). Tessman calls such virtues “burdened.”</p>

<title>Tessman and burdened virtues</title>
<sec id="section8-0959354310385746">
<title>Flourishing and moral damage</title>
<p>Burdened virtues, as I understand it, are ones that, while being “virtues” in some abstract, decontextualized sense, fail to contribute to the oppressed person’s ability to live a flourishing life. That is, such virtues contribute to the workings of society <italic>as a whole</italic>, but do not enhance the experience or life of the particular person exhibiting the virtue.</p>
<p>Tessman starts from the empirical claim that oppression interferes with flourishing. For example, she discusses the (virtually world-wide) norm that women be self-sacrificing in service to their families and argues that the cost of living out this norm is that women “are unable to pursue their own interests as long as their interests conflict with that of others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">2005</xref>, p. 67). Systems of oppression create dispositions that are subjugated, yet the subjugated self may long for liberation. The conflict between the subjugated disposition and liberatory beliefs is not amenable to mere “bootstrapping.” Instead, Tessman challenges readers to combine a politics of personal transformation with that of a “feminist transvaluation of traditional virtues and vices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>, p. 16). The worry is that a focus on the moral and psychic damage done to those who are subjugated typically shores up attitudes of victim-blaming. As Tessman puts it, “the special problem of figuring out how to resist oppression creates the question of how to change the vices in the oppressed that may contribute to their own suffering and that may prevent them from (successfully) pursuing liberation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">2005</xref>, p. 19). It is in this spirit that I propose the virtue of defiance.</p>
<p>Tessman is careful to present an extremely nuanced framework for agency in the face of oppressive structures and institutions. She argues for a feminist virtue ethics that retains the notion of praiseworthy character while eschewing the authority of oppressors to decide what counts as praiseworthy; she holds us to an account of oppressive structures—and not just individuals—that does the moral damage. This is a crucial move, because it affects our understanding of moral responsibility: if my character is damaged because of my own choices and actions, then I am morally responsible for becoming the sort of person who now has a character flaw (of subservience, of passivity, of avoidance of conflict, and so on.) Tessman is right to insist that we keep within our field of vision the fact that oppressive structures themselves are the source of moral damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">2005</xref>, p. 36). She also suggests a vision of moral responsibility that is relevant to oppressed individuals. The emphasis is on being forward-looking and future-oriented instead of immersed in past regret, guilt, and shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">2005</xref>, p. 20). This task involves learning to identify which character traits are signs of moral damage so that we can engage our agency in the project of becoming a self who, in the future, can begin to flourish.</p>
<p>A shift in focus to oppressive structures instead of focusing on individual character flaws does not detract from the concern that some “virtues” of the oppressed do not contribute to flourishing and may, in fact, do harm to the oppressed. Tessman suggests that, in thinking about virtues under oppressive conditions, we should ask,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Does the character trait help its bearer to engage in liberatory struggles, the purpose of which is to eventually enable a good life for all? Or, alternatively, one might ponder, does the character trait help its bearer to live well now (or to contribute to others’ living well now,) in the context of continuing oppression…? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>, p. 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this passage, Tessman is offering two important tests for determining whether a character trait will contribute to flourishing for those living under oppressive conditions, each of which test has its place. One test is that of being able to survive the dehumanization and humiliation of being oppressed, and the other is that of furthering the aims of the oppressed for liberation from their oppressors.</p>

<title>Defiance as easing a burden</title>
<p>This seems to me to be the right direction to go—and I therefore take this path—although I am daunted by the ever-expanding scope of my project. Because, one of the more difficult tasks when considering virtue theory and problems of evaluating defiant behavior in the context of systematic oppressions is that it highlights tensions between conceptualizing character as individual versus social phenomena. Clearly, we need to disentangle ideas about the social production of burdened virtues as they apply to oppressed groups and ideas about character as they apply to individuals who are subject to assessments of moral responsibility and mental capacity. But a full treatment of this part of my project is beyond the scope of this article. Drawing on Tessman’s work, in which she argues that gendered and racialized systems of character formation create people who are afraid to fight back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>, p. 38), I suggest that defiance as a character trait can (in Tessman’s words) “enable the ruled to resist oppression . . . or to flourish as they would if they had already escaped it” (p. 23). Acting defiantly, then, we may aim for a relatively modest goal of asserting one’s separateness from oppressive norms, but we can also hold a loftier goal of agitating for social change. That is, defiance, properly understood, is liberatory for one’s character, and liberating oneself from damaging and oppressive norms, expectations, and conditions will contribute to one’s flourishing. It may be liberatory in that it affirms the defier’s self-respect while pointing to norms that claim to contribute to social well-being but instead are suspected of thwarting and frustrating the development of parts of society and community.</p>
<p>As I have characterized defiance here, it is not itself a burdened virtue; burdened virtues are those character traits that are disconnected from the oppressed person’s own flourishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">Tessman, 2005</xref>, p. 4). My idea, instead, is that defiance is a virtue that can help correct for moral damage. For example, consider the “burdened virtue” of being submissive. Author Curtis Sittenfeld describes how female submissiveness insidiously warps girls’ lives. She writes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In fifth grade, you can run faster than any other girl in your class . . . At recess, you’re the foursquare queen. You slam the red rubber ball onto your three opponents’ patches of pavement, and you gloat when they get disqualified . . . Once, after [the teacher has] rung the bell to call you inside, you pass her, your body still tense and excited, your face flushed. She says in a low voice, a voice that sounds more like the one she uses with adults and not with the other children in your class, “Anna, aren’t you being just a bit vicious?” The next time you’re playing, you fumble and let the ball slide beyond the thin white lines that serve as boundaries. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310385746">Sittenfeld, 2001</xref>, p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sittenfeld explains the insidious ways in which the socialization of females frames physical skill and energy as a vice of aggression; the implication, as most of us know well from experience, is that what is, for Sittenfeld, a vice, would count as a virtue for the boys. And Sittenfeld understood that, to be a “good” girl, she could not be a successful athlete. This outcome is particularly worrisome in light of research by Gilligan and Brown on adolescent girls’ loss of voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310385746">1992</xref>). Sittenfeld, like millions of girls globally, is discouraged from engaging in activities that boys are rewarded for doing. If Sittenfeld insists on playing sports her way, she will probably be judged as defiant and the teacher will come down harder (and less privately) on her. To earn her teacher’s praise, she must forgo her personal style and put on a performance of femininity. In my view, the virtue of femininity is a burdened virtue à la Tessman, and if Sittenfeld were able openly to resist and refute the teacher’s authority, she could retain some self-respect and joy in her life. But it is no surprise that defiance of the ruled is most often punished or pathologized.</p>

<title>When defiance gets criminalized or pathologized</title>
<p>As with other virtues, defiance has extremes and a mean. But identifying the extremes is difficult because actions that are appropriate from the perspective of the subjugated frequently are cast as an extreme (an excess) by those in authority. In the abstract (that is, without attending to the workings of stratified society), the deficiency would seem to be submission, fatalism, hopelessness, or subservience; the excess is random lawlessness, continually in-your-face actions, or belligerence. I am particularly concerned with ways in which acquiescence to authority is inculcated in the ruled and called “socialization.” That is, behavior that is praised by those who prop up and perpetuate the status quo (white middle-class heterosexuals) is more likely to be experienced as submissiveness by the subjugated. In theory, socialization and submissiveness are not necessarily the same thing, of course, but social practices seem to treat them as linked (except for things like “heroic defiance” as discussed in the beginning of this article). On this analysis, where the perspective of the subjugated is given full consideration in terms of responses to authority, those who are successfully socialized are more likely than not to have a deficiency of defiance. Therefore, in what follows, I discuss ways that defiant people are brought down by their brash and open refusal to bow to authority. As I describe and analyze excesses of defiance and their effects, I also indicate the force of socializing powers to push people not toward a mean for defiance, but in fact, a deficiency.</p>
<sec id="section11-0959354310385746">
<title>Bad boys morph into mad boys</title>
<p>For example, judging others as defiant may be a way to enforce social control. With respect to the time-worn but still relevant “mad or bad” distinction in philosophy of psychiatry and in the law, defiance in schoolchildren seems to force an unpalatable choice between being viewed either as “bad” or “mad.” I will argue that defiance in the American school context is clearly viewed by those in authority as something to be stigmatized and stamped out—or treated as a pathology.</p>
<p>Ann Ferguson’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310385746">2001</xref>) shows that institutionalized discipline practices perpetuate the racial order through charging African American boys with defiance. African American boys are sent to disciplinary rooms for behaving in culturally specific ways that then become central to “bad boy” identity formation. Ferguson discusses “‘stylized sulking’ as a face-saving device” that “involved hands crossed at the chest, legs spread wide, head down, and gestures such as a desk pushed away” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310385746">Ferguson, 2001</xref>, p. 68). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310385746">Rebekah Denn (2002)</xref> discusses African American students’ manner of speaking to teachers more as equals than as authority figures because that is how they are treated at home. Such behaviors are taken by teachers and principals to be indications of “bad attitudes” toward authority that warrant detention or placement in Punishing Rooms. Troublemakers, as these young boys come to be known, are “almost by definition characterized by school adults as defiant and disrespectful,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310385746">Ferguson, 2001</xref>, p. 69) where being defiant carries a strongly negative valuation.</p>
<p>Some children who are deemed “defiant” are eventually diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), with behavior characterized as “persistent stubbornness, resistance to directions, and unwillingness to compromise, give in, or negotiate with adults or peers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310385746">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>, p. 100). In other words, defiance sometimes is managed socially by medicalizing it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0959354310385746">8</xref></sup> My worry is that the diagnosis of ODD is called forth instead of grappling with many harder questions about how to habituate children to socialization while, at the same time, not squelching their ethnic, gendered, and idiosyncratic expressions.</p>
<p>A growing body of literature exists that examines the conceptual definitions of mental disorder (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310385746">Fulford, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354310385746">Megone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354310385746">Szasz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354310385746">Thorton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354310385746">Wakefield, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354310385746">2000</xref>) and, in particular, attention to philosophical concerns such as what human functioning is and what <italic>kind</italic> of thing mental disorders are—natural kinds? practical? theoretical? interactive? How those concerns get decided depends on the particular diagnosis. For example, schizophrenia is widely regarded within the medical community to be a dysfunction of an evolutionary design of the brain, and many clinicians, especially biological psychiatrists, view it as a natural kind. Alternatively, mental disorders may be better understood as interactive kinds, as Ian Hacking explains: “classifications of people into kinds affects—indeed, can change—the very beings meant to be classified” (1999). Classifying humans is different from classifying quarks or plutonium, in that the idea of quarks does not affect quarks themselves; quarks and plutonium are indifferent kinds. Hacking rightly points out that we need to be concerned about</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>classifications that, when known by people or by those around them, and put to work in institutions, change the ways in which individuals experience themselves—and may even lead people to evolve their feelings and behavior in part because they are so classified. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310385746">Hacking, 1999</xref>, p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On this view, if young African American boys are being diagnosed with ODD, they may begin to respond to their classification by exhibiting closer approximations to it. Even attempts to defy that classification serve to confirm it. The concern is that schools and other institutions are not merely identifying an existent mental disorder but are creating the conditions under which that disorder thrives. So the loopiness of human kinds is one problem that faces teachers who send their students to school psychologists for evaluation. A further difficulty in evaluating the merits of diagnosing children with ODD is that the diagnosis may not only be marking an interactive kind but a kind not in the medical domain at all. Some of the personality disorders arguably are not medical kinds but instead are moral kinds (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310385746">Charland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310385746">Zachar &amp; Potter, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310385746">2010b</xref>). In the nosology of psychiatry, the line between normal and pathological defiance is unclear. At the very least, the criteria for diagnosing ODD need to attend to socially mediated differences such as gender, race, and ethnicity in order for clinicians to heed their own advice not to medicalize behaviors that are merely expressions of disagreement between individual and society. But if this sort of thing (the suppressing, punishing, and diagnosing of young African American boys who act “defiantly”) is a probable outcome, why would—why should—anyone ever be defiant?</p>

<title>How much defiance is too much?</title>
<p>Girls of all colors are punished or chastised for apparently defiant behavior too, as we have seen with Sittenfeld. Or consider this next example of a young woman whose behavior is judged to be defiant.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the late Middle Ages, [white] 22-year-old Anna Büschler was banished from her widowed father’s home for having taken not one, but two lovers. She took him to court, charging him with abandonment. When he caught her, her father—the Bürgermeister—chained her to a kitchen table for six months, until a servant helped her escape. He disinherited her. She sued him again. In fact, Büschler spent the next 30 years in litigation against her father. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354310385746">Ozment, 1996</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although punished severely, Büschler exhibited a kind of feisty integrity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0959354310385746">9</xref></sup> and I offer her story as an example of someone who has a disposition to be defiant. (Whether or not her defiance hits the mean or is an excess is a separate question I address later.) Büschler surely was defiant—of the norms for proper womanliness in the Middle Ages, and of the proper place of a daughter under patriarchy. Was it good that she was defiant? Well, “good for whom?” It certainly was not good for social harmony, as it was conceived in the Middle Ages, for a woman openly to defy such norms. But it may have been good for other women, who later benefited from Büschler’s lawsuits against her father. But if one’s protest is likely to lead to persecution, and unlikely to bring about relief, then the question arises as to what the point of defiance would be.</p>
<p>As additional fodder, I also call readers’ attention to the many examples from fiction where the main female character has her defiant attitude toward the status quo stamped out of her until she forfeits her agency through death. I have in mind George Eliot’s <italic>The Mill on the Floss</italic> (Maggie), Gustav Flaubert’s <italic>Madame Bovary</italic> (Emma), Leo Tolstoy’s <italic>Anna Karenina</italic> (Anna), and Edith Wharton’s <italic>House of Mirth</italic> (Lily Bart). In each of these novels, the female figure defies social norms—especially gender norms—and suffers so that her life is no longer worth living. Such novels educate readers into the dangers of defiance by first engaging our sympathies with the stifled female and then our sense of tragic loss at her death. Readers may be outraged at the turn the heroine’s life has taken, but many readers also absorb the message that, if only she hadn’t taken things so far, she could have avoided a senseless death. Such novels function as a warning against defying cultural and gender norms.</p>
<p>And, as we saw in the case of African American boys, appearing to be defiant runs the risk not only of being sent to punishing rooms but also of being diagnosed with a mental disorder. Why take the risk?</p>

<title>Defiance as declaration of self-respect and bearers of moral rights; Defiance as a sign of indefeasible commitments</title>
<p>One answer, drawing from Bernard Boxill’s writing, is that it affirms self-respect at those junctions where it might be threatened.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The powerless but self-respecting person will declare his self-respect. He will protest. His protest affirms that he has rights. More important, it tells everyone that he believes he has rights and that he therefore claims self-respect. When he has to endure wrongs he cannot repel and feels his self-respect threatened, he will publicly claim it in order to reassure himself that he has it. His reassurance does not come from persuading others that he has self-respect. It comes from using his claim to self-respect as a challenge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310385746">Boxill, 1995</xref>, p. 102)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thomas Hill suggests another value. Hill’s analysis of self-respect includes the value of signaling to others that we have not agreed to give up our moral rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310385746">Hill, 1995</xref>). This signaling is something that defiance does for us. Additionally, defiance indicates—without any appeal to moral rights or assertion of our basic worth—that some ways of behaving are simply beneath us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310385746">Hill, 1995</xref>, p. 119).</p>
<p>If defiance as a virtue involves some level of reasoned motivations, including an assessment of the risks involved, it may not be accurate to identify Büschler’s behavior as properly defiant. For example, when Büschler defied her father, challenging him in court for refusing her her rightful inheritance, she was chained to the kitchen table for 6 months. Was this possible outcome weighed against the potential gain of her legal and moral claims against her father?</p>
<p>In situations of domination, those dominated may seek transgressive acts in order to break free of oppressive norms and identities, such as Büschler and the African American boys that Ferguson studied. I’ll consider the latter case first. Ferguson describes the authoritative power of the school system in the following paragraph:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the classroom, teachers demand bodies be arranged in certain positions before work can begin: sit up straight, both feet on the floor, hands off the desk, eyes in front toward teacher, or down on the desk. Bodies must be properly arranged both individually and as a group before they can erupt from the classroom to play. They must organize themselves into neat lines before they can enter or exit from classrooms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310385746">Ferguson, 2001</xref>, p. 66)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The authority of teachers in the classroom is situated within complex relations that divide, exclude, classify, hierarchize, confine, and normalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310385746">Best, 1995</xref>, p. 92). As Ferguson reports it, African American boys are judged as defiant troublemakers who are then expected to perform less well in academics and society. In this way, these boys’ identities are subjugated, marginalized, and marked off as “mad” or “bad.” The unconscious “choice” of either acquiescing to school rules, on the one hand, or risking the “mad or bad” signifiers, on the other, places them in a compromising double-bind.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, the case with African American boys who are praised for being obedient and compliant in school even when their behavior does not facilitate flourishing particular to African American males. The dominant group with its cultural attributes of whiteness and middle-class home life are the standard by which the schoolchildren are evaluated and African Americans become Other.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To invest the dominant group’s way of life with the stamp of “ideal” or “norm” means that the subordinate group’s family patterns, language, relational styles are constituted as deviant, pathological, deficient, inferior. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310385746">Ferguson, 2001</xref>, p. 202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though the pedagogical message is that all students will succeed according to merit, in truth the racial order of American society is reproduced. African American boys who want to be successful must adopt the mannerisms, behaviors, language, and values of their white peers but then accept accusations from their African American peers of “acting white”—or they can reject whitely ways but find the pathways to success closed off from them. To paraphrase Marilyn Frye: this sort of double-bind catches these boys between and among forces and barriers and restricts or penalizes motion in any direction. “It is the experience of being caged in: All avenues, in every direction, are blocked or booby trapped” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310385746">Frye, 1983a</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p>It is my position that the moral, intellectual, psychic, and physical damage of burdened virtues, if not turned into abjectness, can be countered by acts of defiance. And, these particular acts of defiance can eventually develop into a disposition of being ready to be defiant when appropriate situations arise.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0959354310385746">
<title>Means and extremes and the role of reason</title>
<p>Of course, defiance, as other virtues, must be exhibited at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310385746">Aristotle, trans. 1985</xref>, pp. 1106b15-25); Büschler, for example, may not have been defiant “in the right way,” because her pursuit of legal redress often harmed and humiliated her more than it liberated her. There are several analytically distinct points to make about the relationship of practical reason to defiance. First is that defiance should not merely be a gut reaction to being thwarted; some thoughtful judgment may need to go into it. Especially when it comes to the defiance of marginalized groups, it may be important to downplay what may look like impulsive behavior, because the disenfranchised are disproportionately vulnerable to charges of irrationality. But behavior can still be spontaneous if we create the background conditions for good decision-making such as Iris Murdoch discusses in <italic>The Sovereignty of Good</italic> : “I can only choose within the world I can <italic>see</italic>, in the moral sense of ‘see’ which implies that clear vision is a result of moral imagination and moral effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310385746">Murdoch, 1970</xref>, p. 37; See my <italic>Mapping the edges and the in-between: A critical analysis of borderline personality disorder</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354310385746">Potter, 2009</xref>, for a discussion of the difference between impulsivity and spontaneity). A background of good moral vision and just relations is compatible with the need for defiant acts to be “sense-making” even when those acts are not deliberated about in the unfolding of defiance. So defiance is made intelligible not necessarily by evident in-the-moment phronesis but by the defier’s ability to give post hoc “reasonableness” explanations of defiance’s expression.</p>
<p>The second point is that critical reflection may be especially important for those whose characters as submissive and compliant have become normalized. Tessman suggests that, upon reflection, many oppressed people come to regret the self that they have become and that agent-regret, coupled with anger, is a necessary step toward creating liberatory feminist virtues (2005, pp. 12-13). Learning to be defiant, then, will involve practicing new responses that, in turn, will require learning to identify situations that call for defiance rather than acquiescence or civility—but that are not excessive. The point is that the ruled need to develop practical reason (<italic>phronesis</italic>) with feminist sensibilities.</p>
<p>The third problem of the relationship of reasoning to defiant actions concerns the nature of reasoning itself. The problem with emphasizing <italic>phronesis</italic> in the development of defiance is that defiance itself can be disciplined. <italic>Phronesis</italic>, or practical reason, is the kind of reasoning we need if we are to develop a virtuous character. Aristotle is clear that, in practical reason, intellect leads to decision-making and the passions must be corralled in (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310385746">Sorabji, 1980</xref>). This governing of passion by intellect assures that the right ratio of rationality to appetite is found. Unruly appetites, or those that threaten to dominate practical reason and mislead us, must be suppressed. The problem is that we need some degree of <italic>phronesis</italic> in order to get it right with defiance and other virtues, but <italic>phronesis</italic> by its very nature is disciplining, taming—disciplining and taming the passions. By this I mean that any move toward striking the Aristotelian mean is a socializing move. So to exhibit the virtue, we must necessarily also shift the weight from its characteristics proper to a domesticated, less-frightening-to-others, approach. And the more we tether reason to defiance, the less likely we are to be able to retain what is most valuable about defiance—its unboundedness and its passion.</p>
<p>There is another reason why we might worry that defiance tamed would be a loss for the disenfranchised. I suggest that critical reflection about oppressive norms and structures is both necessary to liberatory praxis and anathema to spontaneous defiance. Among other things, we could reflect on the effectiveness and objectives of defiant acts. There is a place for critical reflection: for defiance to be genuinely empowering and efficacious, it most likely has to be taken up and reflected upon on a collective level. By this I mean that the benefits of defiance might include an assertion of self-respect or a communication of one’s moral worth. But holding oneself as a self-respecting being in the face of oppressive power structures doesn’t reach very far into the future in bringing about sociopolitical and economic change. Individual acts of defiance, therefore, may not be particularly empowering or liberating.</p>
<p>Since I’ve characterized defiance primarily as benefitting the individual, and civil disobedience as primarily benefitting a collectivity of people, the question now emerges as to whether or not <italic>collective</italic> defiance is still defiance. I think it’s possible that collective defiance does not always morph into collective civil disobedience; I want to leave open the possibility that a group of people can spontaneously defy authority. But if collective defiance is different from collective civil disobedience, it requires a way of demarcating them. Civil disobedience, as we have seen, is a lawbreaking action, a willingness to accept punishment or penalty, and an action permitted, and perhaps even protected, by laws as a moral right to civil disobedience. Defiance, in contrast, aims more at norms and other authoritative bodies (besides the law), is partly embodied by a refusal to acknowledge the state’s right to penalize, and is largely unprotected as a moral right.</p>
<p>The problem is that individual acts of defiance may be met with the full force of oppressive and abusive powers, and defiant groups may be read as excessive and subsequently suppressed. Collective defiance may, therefore, require considerable strategic planning and deliberation in order for members’ defiant voices to be heard without evoking suppression. Social movements involving collective defiance often eventually find that the “mean” amounts to “moderation.” As I have argued, as defiance moves toward the reflective, it becomes more tamed. Defiance becomes domesticated.</p>
<p>Here we see the struggle between radical movements that press against boundaries and a felt need for members of those movements to tone themselves down so as to be more “effective.” The problem is precisely this: there is a place for socialization and civilized behavior, but they can undermine the possibility of transformation. So the apparent excess of the moment is important to keep because, for defiance to be genuinely empowering, it tends to require social organizing and, hence, more reflective strategizing—yet as it moves to the collective and reflective, it becomes more “tamed” and hence less recognizable as defiance.</p>
<p>The problem with the institutionalization of maintaining social order is that punishing and diagnosing<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0959354310385746">10</xref></sup>—keeping people in line—have a structure that props up an imbalance of power—and that imbalance of power can be abusive. Social structures must be maintained, it is thought, so some people are in the business of ensuring that disciplinary structures are enforced; others are recruited to maintain them, as in U.S. military policy regarding treatment of prisoners at Abu Graib and the guards and medical military personnel who performed the actual torture. Others become victims of the disciplines, of oppression. The mechanics of society can be numbing, and people can become so comfortable living within status quo ideologies that we no longer think critically about the body politic. Defiance infuses into the body politic an element of raw human will. And, while raw human will seems to be a vital quality of defiance when expressed by the disenfranchised, it also is a quality expressed by governments, educational systems, prisons, and corporations. Whether it is individual or structural, defiance can jostle the social body to wakefulness and potentially to broader social criticism. When the disenfranchised express defiance, then, they can provide a check on abuses of power—provided power structures have fissures enough for defiance to erupt.</p>

<title>Excesses</title>
<p>This section considers more cases where the line between excess and mean is difficult to ascertain and, so, how to evaluate apparently defiant behavior—as mad, bad, or virtuous—is messy. I begin with an example of political leadership in America.</p>
<p>George W. Bush, former president of the United States, acted in defiance of the law with his secret policy on domestic spying without a warrant, and in defiance of the Geneva Convention, by signing a bill that allows intelligence officers to interrogate suspects with force. Bush seems to have a disposition to be defiant, but his defiance fails to be virtuous because he uses his position of power to violate people’s human rights. The consequences of being defiant depend on where one is located within social structures, and disciplining stratifies people: those with privilege become more powerful (and sometimes more arrogant) by their privilege being normalized. But the excessively privileged are outliers: they have so much power that they can be defiant of, say, constitutional law. Then defiance functions as an <italic>exercise</italic> of power. Defiance as an exercise of power is a vice, because it undermines flourishing and impedes—prohibits, even—another virtue: justice. It is possible, on the other hand, for a person in a position of power to use that authority to liberate or further others’ flourishing.</p>
<p>The next investigation into possible excesses of defiance returns our attention to those with relatively less power and emphasizes the point that the success of liberatory defiance is constrained by the cultural context in which oppression and defiance are mediated. Christina Doza’s English teacher had been sexually harassing her, so she wrote a crude comment about him in her zine. The teacher got hold of a copy of the zine and he asked Doza to apologize.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I tell him the comment was only the truth, and we both know it, and I’m not going to sit here and play psychological warfare with him. I tell him he’s a piece of shit, and I’ll apologize the day hell freezes over. I tell him he better think again if he thinks he can tell me what to do with my zine. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310385746">Doza, 2001</xref>, p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Büschler, Doza shows feisty integrity. But did she tell him off “in the right way”? The answer depends on how we understand the mean in relation to defiance. As I conceptualize defiance, it isn’t one of the “civilized” virtues. So respectfully and civilly telling off her English teacher would not count as defiance. (This means that I disagree with Cornell West, who says that the subordinated need to be defiant while remaining respectful and civil.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0959354310385746">11</xref></sup> Was Doza’s response excessive? I would argue that it was not, given that the teacher was intrusive not only intellectually but sexually. Was her defiance wise?—an important question if virtues are supposed to reflect reason. The answer may seem to depend on how we understand “for the right end.” As we have seen, for defiance to be a virtue, the object of the defiance must be some oppressive norm, condition or, even, a person; the aim is either liberatory for the subordinated person or for other subordinated peoples or, as Tessman says, it enables them to live well now—for example, by claiming self-respect or making clear to oneself and others that one is not acquiescing in oppressive structures. Doza’s defiance may be similar to the anarchic idea of creating Temporary Autonomous Zones, the “… idea of acting freely in a repressive context, of acting ‘as if one lived in a free society,’ creating zones of increasing freedom and viewing these as the proper end of oppositional action…” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310385746">Goldfarb, 1998</xref>, pp. 89–90). By being defiant, Doza preserves her integrity and outrightly rejects her English teacher’s claims to subordinate her, affirming, at least temporarily, her autonomy from him—important ends, I would think. Still, it isn’t clear that the long-term consequences of defiance won’t compromise her chances at flourishing; I return to this point shortly.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, let’s consider what it means to orient questions of the virtue of Doza’s actions to that of practical reasoning. Asking whether Doza’s defiance was wise is, on my analysis, to expect defiance to be tamed enough to reflect reason—certainly the Aristotelian way to think about virtues—but it also corrals Doza within disciplinary structures at a point where she is trying to, well, defy them. On the other hand, without reason, her defiance may be self-defeating, if her actions give others (apparent) justification to oppress her further. Casting defiance as a virtue, therefore, is in tension with standard virtue theory because defiance is a virtue for individuals for their flourishing (à la Tessman) and often erodes or compromises overall social well-being.</p>
<p>In the second half of this article, I have been thinking through the possibility that too much defiance can, over time, overtake the benefits that being defiant appropriately would bring. I now move on to my last case for discussion. I take this case to be a fairly clear example of an excess of defiance. The film <italic>Ladybird, Ladybird</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310385746">Hibbin &amp; Loach, 1994</xref>), based on a true story, depicts Maggie, a working-class mother of four children by four different fathers, as suspicious and distrustful of the social welfare system in Britain and frustrated in her ability to care for her children. We meet Maggie after her four children have been removed from her home after a fire broke out one night while she was working and jeopardized the lives of her children. When Maggie gets pregnant by a Peruvian illegal immigrant named Jorge, welfare workers take this child away as well, on the grounds that she isn’t a fit mother—decisions that, according to the film, are tainted by classism and racism. The heartbreaking story unfolds of a mother in the clutches of social workers, whose hope of regaining custody of her children rests on her ability to satisfy the court that she has her children’s best interests in mind and can protect them from harm. Maggie, unfortunately, cannot perform as the court, social services, her lawyer, and even her new partner, require of her. At sea since childhood in a child welfare system that repeatedly has failed her, Maggie is unwilling or unable to sit quietly during social worker visits or at trial. She defiantly shouts out of turn in court, tells off the social workers whose home visits are designed to establish Maggie’s maturity and trustworthiness, and throws off Jorge’s consoling caresses off in front of others to see. Interpreting her behavior through lenses of class privilege and racial bias, the court deems her of limited intelligence and an unfit mother. The long-term consequences of her defiance of social and extra-legal norms are the removal of even more of her children from her home. The courts’ biases in making these decisions compromised their epistemic and moral responsibilities to evaluate Maggie’s behavior through a just and impartial lens. Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that Maggie’s defiant behavior was excessive because it failed to further her interests, seemed to miss the mark of self-respecting demeanor, and seemed (perhaps unconsciously) driven by unregulated emotion. To the extent that defiance requires an accurate reading of the situation such that the defier can apply the mean while retaining her sense of challenge to the social and gender norms, Maggie seemed unable either to assess situations accurately or to control her outbursts to the degree that she can turn them to her advantage. Maggie, too, faces the “mad or bad” dichotomy and, when looking at the court records, she has been deemed “bad”—a bad mother.</p>

<title>The counterpart to defiance</title>
<p>As we have seen, a major problem with defiance is this: When Doza defiantly tells off her English teacher, the outcome for her is likely to be two-fold: she preserves her self-respect and temporarily experiences autonomy, but also may be suspended from school. As with young African American males, repeated suspension may result in poor education which, in turn, can inhibit flourishing. Furthermore, it can lead to rage and demoralization when oppressive systems remain entrenched and the subordinated still lack basic capabilities in their lives. Hence, defiant people like Doza end up saying,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I worry sometimes that I’m too angry and I’ll for sure explode if I don’t do something—like kill someone quick. I worry that I scream and scream and we make a wailing wall, all of us screaming at the tops of our lungs, screaming for our lives, and no one is listening, nothing is changing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310385746">Doza, 2001</xref>, p. 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Defiance is, under some circumstances, an appropriate response to oppressive rule. But an appropriate response exists to defiance, as well, and it is not to oppress more effectively. As Tessman argues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310385746">2005</xref>, ch. 3), domination is a vice and so the unjustly privileged and exploitative people need to work on their character as well.</p>
<p>The unjustly privileged and the exploiters, those who abuse their authority and institutionalized power, ought to avoid domination and work to change abusive and unjust structures and disciplines, and one way to do so is to cultivate virtues that are responsive to attempts to assert one’s worth—or autonomy, or to challenge the status quo—through a virtue such as defiance. For the sake of brevity, I will discuss one virtue for those whose positions of authority allow them to exercise excessive defiance or to abuse their power in disciplining others, and that only in sketch: giving uptake (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310385746">Potter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310385746">2002</xref>, ch. 5 for a full treatment of this virtue). Marilyn Frye, in discussing the trivialization, ridicule, and ignoring of women’s anger, argues that women’s anger is not given uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310385746">1983b</xref>). Uptake is a speech convention that, as introduced by Austin, is necessary in order for certain speech acts to come off. One cannot be said to have made a promise if the listener doesn’t recognize it as a promise, for example. Elsewhere, I have argued that, because many of our conventions in communication are constitutive of hegemonic relations, we need to be vigilant about how we receive the communications from subordinated others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310385746">Potter, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310385746">2002</xref>). Those in positions of privilege, including those in authority ranging from parents to teachers to worker/boss relations and so on, need to give uptake to the ruled.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Cultivating a disposition to give uptake rightly is necessary for the full flourishing of individuals and of society, as it provides the means for genuine communication in a variety of kinds of social settings. It facilitates democratic practices, as it enhances the possibilities of understanding what justice is and when we have gotten it wrong. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310385746">Potter, 2002</xref>, p. 152)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I apply this idea to those on the receiving end of defiance. By giving uptake, I say: you can count on me to take you seriously according to your idea of seriousness and not mine alone; you can expect me to treat your picture of the world seriously and take your defiance seriously. To take defiance seriously is to recognize the claim another is making on you, norms that you are enforcing, practices that benefit you but not the defier. Taking defiance seriously means that you are willing to consider the possibility that you are implicated in abusive powers and oppressive regimes. It indicates that you recognize the full humanity of the communicator. You do not assume the defiant one has a mental disorder. Developing a disposition to give uptake rightly means that, when confronted with the defiance of the ruled, you reflect not on their behavior but your own. Small shifts toward liberation may occur.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Burdened virtues, such as those Tessman so richly analyzes, may not be ones we need in an egalitarian and emancipatory future. But I am reluctant to entertain utopian ideals. Also, I think there are three reasons to expect defiance to stay around as a virtue. First, hegemonic and oppressive structures, and warped interpersonal relationships, may continue and defiance can function as a check on those in authority and with (access to) power so that power does not remain oppressive. Second, parents will always be in a position of power over young children, and defiance may be necessary for the development of psychologically healthy adults.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0959354310385746">12</xref></sup> Third, complacency is a risk with even the best societies, and defiance is a way to disrupt the false consciousness of prevailing ideologies. Defiance breathes life into us or, I should say, it gives us life.</p>
<p>There’s a future in defiance.</p>

<p>MacIntyre argues that the emphasis on rules and rule-following is distinctively modern:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Ronald Dworkin has recently argued that the central doctrine of modern liberalism is the thesis that questions about the good life for man or the needs of human life are to be regarded from the public standpoint as systematically unsettlable…In arguing thus Dworkin has, I believe, identified a stance characteristic not just of liberalism but of modernity. Rules become the primary concept of the moral life. Qualities of character then generally come to be pursued only because they will lead us to follow the right set of rules.
