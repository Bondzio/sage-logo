<abstract>
<p>Contribution of radon and its decay products towards the total effective dose has been reported to be more than 50% and is a second leading cause of the lung cancer after cigarette smoking. It is an established fact that besides soil and rocks, naturally occurring radio nuclides are also associated with the petroleum extracted from the sedimentary deposits. Therefore, radon measurement around oil refineries is desirable. In this regard, an indoor radon measurement study was carried out in 40 dwellings which were situated in the vicinity of an oil refinery in the Rawalpindi district using CR-39-based radon detectors. For comparison, indoor radon levels were also measured in 40 dwellings situated at a greater distance (&gt;2 km) from the refinery. The maximum measured indoor radon concentration was found to be 190 ± 6 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup> whilst the minimum recorded concentration was 12 ± 7 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup>. The mean radon concentration in the dwellings surveyed was 57 ± 29 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup>. No significant difference was observed in the average indoor radon levels in the dwellings situated near the oil refinery premises when compared with those further away. From the measured radon concentrations, an annual effective dose was calculated to be 0.9 ± 0.1 mSv which is below the ICRP recommended value.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11410583"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Radon (<sup>222</sup>Rn) is a radioactive noble gas and is generated from the decay of <sup>238</sup>U. It is a colourless, odourless, electrically uncharged gas but hazardous. It emits alpha radiation and decays with a half-life of 3.824 days. Radon is present in trace amounts almost everywhere in the earth’s crust. Its concentration in the atmosphere varies, depending on the place, time, height above the ground and meteorological conditions. Radon production rate from the soil depends upon the geological characteristics of the soil itself and its underlying geological strata. A fraction of radon emanated from the soil (and sometimes also from water, in which it may be dissolved) can find its way into the buildings through cracks in the foundations. After entering into the indoor atmosphere, it accumulates in poorly ventilated rooms to levels which may pose a significant health risk to the occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11410583">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11410583">9</xref>]. Rates of radon emission from the soil may vary markedly over time, even for a single location. In addition to the daily variations, radon levels in buildings are also season-dependent. Some of the influential factors on indoor radon include content and porosity of the soil, building structure, whether the house has a basement, insulation and heating system of the house and ventilation habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11410583">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11410583">12</xref>].</p>
<p>As radon is a human carcinogen, extensive data are available extending into the range of general population exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11410583">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11410583">16</xref>]. Risk projections imply that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Inhalation of radon decay products has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. As mentioned above, over 85% of human total annual dose, averaged over the world population, stem from natural sources, with about half of it coming from radon decay products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11410583">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11410583">23</xref>]. A survey of 120 schools situated in four districts of the Punjab Province in Pakistan has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11410583">24</xref>].</p>
<p>This article reports the measurements of indoor radon levels in 80 selected houses in the vicinity of and at some distance remote from an oil refinery located in the district of Rawalpindi. The dwellings selected, which were within a radius of 1 km from the main installations of the refinery, were considered to be in the vicinity of oil refinery. Dwellings located at a radius of 2 km or more from the main refinery installations were considered as being remote for comparison purposes. An increase in the indoor radon level in the vicinity of the refinery was expected due to the fact that the petroleum deposits would usually occur in the areas consisting of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks. The sedimentary and igneous rocks would contain <sup>238</sup>U in varying quantities and therefore act as sources of <sup>222</sup>Rn. Hence, it was expected that crude oil will contain considerable amount of the dissolved radon which in turn will result in higher radon levels in the vicinity of the refinery.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11410583"><title>Type of Houses</title>
<p>The types of houses surveyed were approximately similar in both locations. Most of the houses in the surveyed area were built from baked bricks, sand and concrete with roofs made of concrete. These included both single- and double-storey houses; however, most were double storied. Each house contained at least two rooms and one kitchen. CR-39-based radon detectors were installed in bedroom and living room of each house. In the case of double-storey houses, dosimeters were installed at the ground floor. All the houses surveyed were detached and semi-detached houses. The sizes of the rooms were approximately 3.7 × 3.7 × 3.5 m<sup>3</sup> with one or two windows and a door. Usually, the windows are not operational and remained closed especially in living rooms with no additional exhausting fans, which resulted in poor ventilation conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11410583"><title>Climate</title>
<p>Rawalpindi is located at a latitude of 34°20′N and a longitude of 73°06′E and at an altitude of 507 m above the sea level. Map of the studied area is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11410583">Figure 1</xref>.

</p>
<p>Weather of the Rawalpindi is highly variable due to its location. The average annual rainfall is 990 mm, most of which falls in the summer monsoon season. However, frontal cloud bands also bring quite significant rainfall in the winter. The temperature begins to rise in the area from early April and reaches around 47°C in June. The period from December to February is cold and temperature drops to a minimum of −4°C<bold>.</bold> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11410583">Table 1</xref> gives the temperature and rainfall monthly averages recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11410583">25</xref>].

<p>In order to carry out indoor radon measurement in dwellings in the vicinity and remote from the oil refinery, CR-39-based radon detectors were used. In this regard, introductory brochures were distributed amongst the inhabitants wherein instructions about installation and safety of the radon detectors were explained. Occupancy factor plays an important role in the dose calculation. Therefore, information regarding the indoor occupancy was obtained by interviewing the dwellers during the installation/collection of the dosimeters. Based on these interviews, an average occupancy factor 0.5 was estimated.</p>
<p>Large sheets of CR-39 having 500 µm thicknesses, supplied by the Page Mouldings, Ltd., UK were cut into small pieces of size 1.5 × 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. These small-sized CR-39 detectors were fixed by double-sided solo tape at the bottom of the dosimeters of National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK), now called the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency for radon measurements. From these detectors, some samples were kept in refrigerator for background purpose. Radon detectors were then installed in dwellings at various locations in the vicinity of the oil refinery. All the detectors were installed at head height and exposed for a period of 6 months. After exposure, the detectors were removed and subjected to a chemical etching process in 25% NaOH solution at 80°C for 16 h. The tracks produced in CR-39 were counted under an optical microscope. The measured track densities were related to the indoor radon concentrations (Bq·m<sup>−3</sup>) using calibration factor 2.7 tracks·cm<sup>−2</sup>·h<sup>−1</sup>·kBq·m<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11410583">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11410583">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11410583">27</xref>]. The minimum detection limit was 2<italic>σ</italic> of the background divided by the minimum acceptable sensitivity of the CR-39 detector. In this study, the average minimum detection limit was found to be 4 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
<p>The NRPB dosimeters were also calibrated and our values were within 16% of the above-mentioned factor. In this regard, ore with known uranium content was locally obtained. The secular equilibrium was confirmed by determining <sup>226</sup>Ra content of the ore samples using a coaxial HPGe detector. The dried ore was placed in three polyethylene terephthalate containers each having a volume 5.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. The NRPB radon detectors were then placed in the above-mentioned ore-containing containers at a distance of 25 cm from the ore and the containers were then hermetically sealed. The detectors were exposed to radon for 3 weeks. After exposure, the CR-39 detectors were chemically etched and counted under an optical microscope. The observed track density was divided by the radon concentration, as shown in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11410583">1</xref>), to provide a calibration factor as follows.

<p>The values obtained in these investigations are in good agreement with the values reported in the earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11410583">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11410583">24</xref>]. The average radon concentration in living rooms and bedrooms of the studied area is above the world average 40 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup>. Different reference levels have been recommended by different countries for indoor <sup>222</sup>Rn concentrations. ICRP recommends a maximum limit of 600 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11410583">1</xref>], whereas the action level recommended by US-EPA is 150 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11410583">28</xref>]. In this study, the indoor radon levels are within the acceptable limits of the ICRP limits. Indoor radon levels of a few dwellings are above the recommended limits of the US-EPA. The highest radon levels were observed in living rooms. This may be due to the fact that most of the time living rooms are closed and only used when some relatives or family friends visit the dwellers. This results in poor ventilations in the living rooms and therefore radon concentrations in living rooms are higher.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11410583">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11410583">3</xref> comprise frequency distributions of indoor radon concentrations in surveyed bedrooms and living rooms, respectively. As may be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11410583">Figure 2</xref>, most bedrooms (i.e. 60% and 65%) have indoor radon levels ranging from 0 to 50 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup> in either location with respect to distance from the oil refinery, whereas 27.5%, 10%, 2.5%, 22.5%, 10% and 2.5% bedrooms have indoor radon levels in the ranges 51–100, 101–150 and 151–200 Bq·m<sup>−3</sup> in the vicinity of and at a distance away from the oil refinery, respectively. In the living rooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11410583">Figure 3</xref>), measured indoor radon levels of the ranges 0–50, 51–100, 101–151 and 151–200 Bq m<sup>−3</sup> have been observed in 55%, 27.5%, 10%, 7.5% and 52.5%, 30%, 12.5% and 5% of the houses situated in the vicinity of and at a distance remote from the oil refinery premises, respectively.

Substituting the measured average radon concentration values in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1420326X11410583">5</xref>), the annual effective doses due to the indoor radon were estimated to be 0.8 ± 0.4 and 1.0 ± 0.5 mSv for bedrooms and living rooms, respectively. The mean annual effective dose was 0.9 ± 0.1 mSv for the inhabitants living in the studied area.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1420326X11410583"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, indoor radon levels have been measured in houses in the vicinity of and at a distance remote from an oil refinery situated in the district of Rawalpindi. No significant difference was observed in the indoor radon levels in dwellings from either location. In this study, higher indoor radon levels have been observed in living rooms as compared to the bedrooms. From the measured indoor radon concentrations, an annual effective dose was calculated using UNSCEAR model with occupancy factor 0.5 for the studied houses. The doses expected to be received by the inhabitants of the studied area were found to be less than the ICRP recommended values 3–10 mSv·y<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
