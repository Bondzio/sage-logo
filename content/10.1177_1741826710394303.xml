<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objectives of this study were to describe the hypertensive population and therapeutic management of hypertension in subjects between 18 and 74 years of age in continental France in 2006.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> ENNS was a cross-sectional survey conducted in continental France in 2006–2007. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in a national sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18–74 years and pharmacological treatment was collected by a self-questionnaire. Hypertension was defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg, or treatment with BP-lowering drugs. The therapeutic control of treated hypertensive patients was defined by SBP &lt;140 mmHg and DBP &lt;90 mmHg.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence of hypertension was 31.0%. Half of hypertensive subjects reported taking an antihypertensive drug (50.3%) and nearly half of them were treated with a single antihypertensive pharmacological class (44.3%). Overall, among hypertensives, 25.6% had a satisfactory BP control.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our survey revealed a high prevalence of hypertension in continental France, with only half of the hypertensive subjects receiving pharmacological therapy and one treated out of two with BP at goal. More effective measures are needed to improve clinical management of hypertension.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826710394303" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>High blood pressure is a frequent major cardiovascular risk factor. One-quarter of the adult world population was estimated to have hypertension in 2000. Because of projected changes in the age distribution of the population, this proportion could reach 29% in 2025.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826710394303">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Survey with blood pressure measurements are necessary to determine the prevalence of hypertension. In France, several studies involving blood pressure measurements have been conducted over the past few years in representative population samples in one or several French regions or limited to salaried employees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826710394303">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826710394303">6</xref></sup> The National Health Nutrition Study (ENNS 2006–2007) is the first survey using blood pressure readings taken in a national sample of adults aged 18–74 years and living in continental France. An initial article, published in a French non-Medline journal, established the prevalence of hypertension, as well as treated and controlled hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710394303">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objectives of the present study were to describe the treated hypertensive population and the management of the disease (pharmacological treatment and therapeutic control), and to examine factors associated with treatment and control of hypertension in continental French population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826710394303" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826710394303"><title>Objectives and study design</title>
<p>ENNS was a cross-sectional survey based on a multistage sampling design and including a food consumption survey and a health examination. It was carried out throughout the entire territory of continental France in 2006–2007. Its main objective was to describe dietary intake, physical activity, and nutritional status in a national sample of adults (18–74-year-olds) and children (3–17-year-olds) living in continental France. Secondary objectives included describing the prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors among adults.</p>
<p>The design of the ENNS has been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826710394303">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826710394303">9</xref></sup> Briefly, sample procedure was based on a three-stage design stratified by eight large regions and by the degree of urbanization. The sampling stages included: (1) selection of 190 geographic zones, (2) random selection of households from phone lists, and (3) selection of one participant per household using the date of birth method. The recruitment of the sample population was carried out over a 1-year period to take into account dietary seasonality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826710394303"><title>Data collection and variables</title>
<p>All current pharmacological treatments were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Drugs were studied according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of the World Health Organization (C02, C03, C07, C08, and C09 classes for antihypertensive drugs).</p>
<p>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at home or at a health examination center of the French National Health Insurance System, using an OMRON M5-I oscillometric automated device with an appropriately sized cuff on the left arm. Blood pressure was measured after a 5-min rest in the same position. Three readings were taken at 1-min intervals. If a difference of 10 mmHg was observed between the second and third measurement, a new run of three measurements was carried out. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were calculated using the mean of the last two measurements.</p>
<p>Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥140 mmHg, DBP ≥90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive drugs. Treated hypertensive patients were considered as being controlled when SBP was &lt;140 mmHg and DBP &lt;90 mmHg. Three levels of blood pressure were defined among uncontrolled treated hypertensives: BP-level 1: SBP between 140 and 159 mmHg and/or DBP between 90 and 99 mmHg; BP-level 2: SBP between 160 and 179 mmHg and/or DBP between 100 and 109 mmHg; and BP level 3: SBP ≥180 and/or DBP ≥110 mmHg. When SBP and DBP fall into different categories, the highest category was used.</p>
<p>Other vascular risk factors studied were: age (over 55 for men and 65 for women), current smoking (daily or occasional), obesity (defined by a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), treated diabetes, and treated dyslipidaemia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826710394303"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For the participants who underwent a health examination, probabilities of inclusion were calculated to take into account the complex survey design. In addition, in order to take into account potential participation bias, calibration on age, education diploma, presence of at least one child in the household, according to French national census data, and period of collection, was performed, separately for each gender. Calibration was carried out using the SAS macro program CALMAR (CALibration on MARgins) and census data came from the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). Because of the very small number of hypertensive subjects under 45, all age groups between 18 and 54 were grouped together.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C), using test procedures adapted to complex sampling schemes. For all analyses, <italic>p</italic>-values were two-tailed and differences considered significant at <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05. Kruskal–Wallis test was used to study quantitative variables while Pearson’s chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis were used for qualitative variables.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826710394303" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 6267 contacted households, 5217 were eligible, 3115 adults participated in the food consumption survey,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826710394303">8</xref></sup> and 2413 of them underwent a health examination (46.3% response rate) including BP measures. Compared to the French general population, young adults and subjects with a low level of education were poorly represented among participants who underwent a health examination. Calibration according to French national census data on this subsample corrected this participation bias. Finally, participants with incomplete and/or not valid BP measurements (i.e. less than two BP readings) were excluded from the present analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 147). Participants included in the analyses (2266 adults: 838 men, 1428 women) did not differ significantly from participants excluded for incomplete data.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1741826710394303"><title>Prevalence of hypertension</title>
<p>The prevalence of hypertension was 31.0% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826710394303">Table 1</xref>) and was significantly higher among men than among women (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02). The prevalence increased with age, attaining two-thirds of the population aged 65–74 (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001).

<sec id="sec11-1741826710394303" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ENNS survey is the most recent survey measuring blood pressure carried out on a national sample of the adult population (aged 18–74 years) living in the whole continental France. Salient findings of this survey are the following: the hypertension prevalence was 31.0% in the 18–74-year-old population; half of hypertensive persons reported taking an antihypertensive drug (50.3%). Less than half of patients were treated with a single antihypertensive pharmacological class (44.3%). Among hypertensives, 52.2% were aware of their status, 50.3% were treated with antihypertensive drugs, and 25.6% had satisfactory control of their hypertension.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1741826710394303"><title>Hypertension prevalence</title>
<p>ENNS is a cross-sectional study which involves taking several blood pressure readings on a single occasion. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of hypertension is based on observation of high values on several occasions. Studies on hypertension prevalence using a single run of measurements are useful for geographic and temporal comparisons. But for the more recent years, comparisons are difficult because of a lack of common protocol and disparities in the age groups studied.</p>
<p>In Europe, there were strong variations in hypertension prevalence between countries in the 1990s, with a prevalence ranging from 37.7% to 55.3% between 35 and 64 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826710394303">10</xref></sup> A recent comparison of studies carried out in various countries at the end of the 1990s concluded that the French hypertension prevalence fell within the average of the other countries for ages between 45 and 64 years, but that incidence was high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826710394303">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies carried out in North America reported lower prevalences of hypertension than our findings. The prevalence was 21.3% between 18 and 79 years of age in Ontario (2005) and 28% for all adults in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826710394303">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826710394303">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826710394303"><title>Treatment of hypertension</title>
<p>Half of the hypertensives were treated. This proportion is similar to estimates found in recent studies carried out in England and Switzerland, as well as the report of the French Mona Lisa study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710394303">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826710394303">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826710394303">15</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this is far from the situation observed in Ontario, Canada, where this percentage reached 82%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826710394303">12</xref></sup> and in the USA where the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated a percentage of treated subjects of 72.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826710394303">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>European recommendations in 2003, effective at the time of data collection, mentioned that a large proportion of hypertensives require several therapeutic classes to control their hypertension (‘most’ in the 2007 European recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826710394303">16</xref></sup>). In ENNS, 55.7% of treated hypertensives reported receiving treatment including several pharmacological classes. The proportion of hypertensives treated by polytherapy was slightly lower in the Mona Lisa French study (53% between 35 and 74 years), but slightly higher in refund data from the National French Health Insurance System (CNAMTS) (≥20 years: 61.0% in 2006).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710394303">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826710394303">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most frequently prescribed therapeutic classes were diuretics (46.2%), followed by BB (44.7%), ARB (29.9%), ACEI (26.7%), and CCB (20.3%). The study carried out in 2006 by the CNAMTS also noted the predominance of diuretics, followed by BB and ARB; the difference from ENNS results concerned CCB, which were used as frequently as ACEI in this study including all ages. A comparative study performed in five European countries had observed more frequent prescribing of ARB than ACEI in France, while the opposite was true in Germany, Italy, and the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826710394303">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826710394303"><title>Control of treated hypertension</title>
<p>Only half of treated hypertensives showed sufficient reduction in their blood pressure. This remains insufficient, although a substantial increase in BP control has been observed in France over the last decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710394303">4</xref></sup> Moreover the ‘Cardiomonitor 2004’ study showed that hypertension was more frequently controlled in France than in other western European countries, though far less than in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826710394303">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Insufficient hypertension control has been emphasized in numerous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826710394303">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710394303">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826710394303">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826710394303">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826710394303">22</xref></sup> Control of hypertension may be difficult to achieve, in particular in older subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826710394303">16</xref></sup> but other explanations are possible, including insufficient recognition of hypertension during the diagnostic phase and ‘clinical inertia’ in therapeutic follow-up<bold>,</bold> as shown in ‘Cardiomonitor 2004’. In this respect, a recent French study carried out among general practitioners reported that therapeutic modifications had been proposed for only 15% of uncontrolled treated hypertensive patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826710394303">23</xref></sup> Three reasons were given by doctors who did not modify treatment of hypertension: (1) the lack of confidence in a single BP measurement, considering its variability, (2) skepticism concerning the frequent modifications of recommendations, and (3) the need for a period of negotiation with the patient. Coexistence of non-cardiovascular pathologies and their accumulation were shown to be associated with less control and less tendency to make the necessary therapeutic adjustments. Moreover, the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, may decrease the effects of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826710394303">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826710394303"><title>Limits and biases</title>
<p>Certain limits to our study should be pointed out. First, the study population was limited to adults aged 18–74. Second, the participation rate in the health examination was rather weak, 46.3% and participants were slightly different from general population for age, gender, and education level. The health status of persons who refused to participate in the survey remains unknown. A calibration procedure on demographic variables was carried out and may have contributed to reduce differences between participants and non-participants. Third, the sample size was rather small limiting the statistical power of the analyses. Nevertheless, prevalence results are coherent with those of Mona Lisa study carried out at the same period in three French areas, for age groups common to both surveys (35–74 years: hypertension prevalence was 45.2% in men and 35.4% in women in ENNS, versus 47.3% and 35.0% in Mona Lisa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710394303">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hypertension was considered as being controlled for values of SBP and DBP strictly &lt;140 and &lt;90 mmHg, respectively, without adapting it to targets defined for populations at high vascular risk, diabetics, and patients with renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Finally, the population studied was not large enough to allow the conduct of analyses by subgroup with sufficient power. Therefore, regional and socioeconomic analyses were not performed. Also, the number of hypertensives under age 55 was low in the survey and thus 18–54-year-olds had to be grouped together into a single age group.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741826710394303" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>According to the ENNS study, there was an estimated hypertension prevalence of 31% in the 18–74-year-old population living in a typical household in continental France in 2006–2007. Overall, among hypertensives, 52.2% were aware of their status, 50.3% were treated with antihypertensive drugs and 25.6% had satisfactory control of their hypertension. Nearly half of treated hypertensives were treated with a single antihypertensive pharmacological class, 35.9% in uncontrolled. More effective measures are needed to improve prevention, detection, and management of hypertension.</p>
