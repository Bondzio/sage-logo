<abstract>
<p>This study describes a strategy for the covalent immobilization of active adhesion peptide moieties onto polymers through the intermediacy of itaconic acid. The arginine–glycine–aspartic acid peptide was grafted to a novel poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester)-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid bulk biomaterial, in order to improve the cell adhesion of the polymer. First, the arginine–glycine–aspartic acid sequence was grafted onto itaconic acid via an amidation reaction using <italic>N</italic>-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<italic>N</italic>′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride/<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide as activation complex. The itaconic acid–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid macromer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, yielding a functionalization degree of 85%. In a second step, poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid) (with a feed mixture of 90 wt% of caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester and 10 wt% of itaconic acid–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid macromer) and a series of copolymers of caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester and itaconic acid with different compositions (weight fractions of itaconic acid up to 20 wt%) were synthesized by radical copolymerization. The microstructure and network architecture of the new polymer systems were investigated. Mechanical moduli of poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid), evaluated by dynamic–mechanical analysis, increase with the itaconic acid content. In poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid), the glass transition temperature and the mechanical moduli of the system are smaller than in the nonfunctionalized poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid) copolymers, and the polymer is less hydrophilic. The results indicate that arginine–glycine–aspartic acid grafting of poly(caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester-<italic>co</italic>-itaconic acid) copolymer networks can be useful for tissue engineering applications, because regenerative processes in the nervous system can be promoted and accelerated, thus, opening a possibility to generate materials with a high potential for clinical applicability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell-based therapies combined with tissue engineering techniques have the potential to create artificial constructs that direct tissue regeneration. In recent years, a number of technological advances in the field of biomaterials science have focused on generating materials that are able to interact with cells via biological recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512469710">1</xref></sup> The surface modification of biomaterials with adhesion molecules (AMs) is the simplest way to encourage specific cell–biomaterial interactions.</p>
<p>A wide range of synthetic polymers have been explored and developed for use as biomaterials. Despite their reduced bioactivity, synthetic materials offer advantages such as easy processing and physical and chemical properties tailored to the application. In order to improve the bioactivity, most researchers attempt to modify the surface of polymers using adhesion-promoting proteins such as fibronectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512469710">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512469710">3</xref></sup> and laminin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512469710">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512469710">5</xref></sup> However, these proteins and other long-chain extracellular matrix proteins generally tend to fold randomly upon adsorption onto the material surface depending on chemical surface properties like topography, charge, distribution of functional groups within the surface, as well as the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. Protein density and conformation on the material modify the availability of the binding sequences to cell receptors and influence the biological success of the artificial substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512469710">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512469710"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512469710">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another philosophy explores working with cell recognition motifs, rather than the complete proteins. The peptides are more stable during modification processes, storage, and sterilization treatments and easy to characterize. Also, the peptide-binding sequences may be more accessible to cellular receptors. The most commonly used adhesive ligand sequence for surface modification is the arginine–glycine–aspartic acid/Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) tripeptide derived from fibronectin and laminin. Additionally, other peptide sequences like Ile–Lys–Val–Ala–Val (IKVAV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512469710">9</xref>

RGD grafting onto polymers has been undertaken both in bulk and as a surface modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512469710">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512469710">15</xref></sup> Bulk modification offers the possibility to design injectable scaffolds that can be adapted to the defect site. Behravesh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512469710">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512469710">17</xref></sup> reported injectable poly(propylene fumarate-<italic>co</italic>-ethylene glycol) hydrogels chemically modified with RGD motifs, and they found that a bulk concentration of 100 nmol/cm<sup>3</sup> was suitable to promote the adhesion of marrow-derived osteoblasts.</p>
<p>In this study, we first synthesized a novel carrier macromer for RGD motifs. In a subsequent second step, copolymers were formed with caprolactone 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester (CLMA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512469710">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512469710">19</xref></sup> Itaconic acid (IA) used as carrier monomer is obtained from renewable sources, by the fermentation of carbohydrate materials such as molasses and hydrolyzed starch by <italic>Aspergillus terreus.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512469710">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911512469710">21</xref></sup> The synthesis of the IA-RGD macromer was performed via a <italic>N</italic>-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<italic>N</italic>′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC)/<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activation complex promoted reaction. The physical and mechanical properties of functionalized and nonfunctionalized poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) copolymers were investigated. The cell viability and morphology of human Schwann seeded on the different substrates were examined. It was demonstrated that radical polymerizations, using a thermal initiator, do not affect the bioactivity of the RGD-copolymer materials.</p>

<p>Cell viability was assessed at days 5 and 10 using the CellTiter<sup>®</sup> 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium], inner salt; MTS assay; Promega, Spain) following the manufacture’s protocol.Briefly, at each time point, the cell–two dimensional (2D) materials were transferred into a 48-well plate, and fresh culture medium without FBS was added to each well together with phenol red mixed with MTS reagent in a 5:1 ratio. Care was taken so that the samples were completely immersed. The samples were incubated for 3 h in an incubator at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The absorbance of the resulting solution was read at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Victor 3; PerkinElmer, USA). The background absorbance was subtracted from all samples (<italic>n</italic> = 5). The background absorbance was measured on a sample containing polymeric substrates (without cells), medium, and MTS reagent.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p>HSCs seeded on the copolymer samples were identified by S100β, a Schwann cell-specific marker. Samples were washed with 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 10 min. Unspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by incubating the samples with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber with a mixture of monoclonal anti-S100 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies (Abcam 1:100) and a mixture of mouse monoclonal 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and anti-GFAP antibodies (Abcam 1:100) in blocking solution. Samples were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with the respective secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibody (1:200) (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 647 or goat anti-mouse Alexa 488; Invitrogen, Spain) for 2 h at room temperature in darkness. Finally, samples were washed three times with PBS before mounting the coverslip with a drop of vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to counterstain cell nuclei. Samples were evaluated by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The IA-RGD macromer was obtained by an activation reaction between the IA, EDAC, and NHS, followed by a reaction between the IA-NHS intermediary and the tripeptide RGD (see online supplement). SDR-FTIR analysis (see online supplement) confirms the amidation reaction between IA and RGD.</p>
<p>The absorption bands in the range of 3500–3000 cm<sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the acid group (COOH stretching vibrations) of IA, and the intense peak around 1700 cm<sup>−1</sup> was assigned to the C = O stretching vibration in the carboxylic acid groups. In addition, C = C and C–O stretching characteristics of IA were observed at 1634 and 1224 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The SDR-FTIR spectrum of RGD shows a broadband corresponding to amine groups around 3300 cm<sup>−1</sup>, a signal for the COOH group of aspartate between 3500 and 3000 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and signals at 1677, 1550, and 1260 cm<sup>−1</sup>, representing amides I–III, respectively.</p>
<p>The IA was then successfully functionalized with RGD through the reaction of the activated COOH groups with the amine moieties of the arginine constituent. Comparing the spectrum of the IA-RGD macromer with the IA and RGD spectra indicates a broad shoulder in 3300 cm<sup>−1</sup> corresponding to amine groups that are present in RGD; furthermore, the C = O stretching vibration band disappears in the macromer, and smaller peaks at 1670 and 1265 cm<sup>−1</sup> appear that correspond to amides I and III, respectively.</p>
<p>The amidation reaction signals were also clearly evident when comparing the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of IA, RGD, and the IA-RGD macromer (see online supplement). The spectrum of the IA monomer shows a singlet at 3.37 ppm that corresponds to CH<sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>–Csp<sub>3</sub>) and two signals at 6.31 and 5.84 ppm that are attributable to the vinyl CH<sub>2</sub> (a and b) of the acrylic group. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of RGD shows signals between 1 and 4.50 ppm for the H–Csp<sub>3</sub> of the tripeptide chemical structure and also protons of the amine group. Specifically, the triplet (c) at 1.10 ppm (RGD spectrum) was assigned to the protons of the CH<sub>2</sub> group present in the arginine sequence. No signals attributable to the COOH groups were detected. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of the IA-RGD macromer shows that the signals a–c that are present in the other spectra (IA and RGD, see online supplement) and confirm that RGD motifs were covalently linked to IA through amidation reactions. Also, by comparing the intensities of the signals a and c, we can infer that not all COOH groups of the IA monomer were substituted with RGD, thereby affecting the symmetry of the final IA-RGD macromer molecule. This is consistent with the stoichiometrically imbalanced ratio of RGD to IA used in the amidation reaction.</p>

<title>Poly(CLMA-co-IA) copolymer networks</title>
<p>Copolymer networks were obtained via radical polymerization using different weight ratios of CLMA and IA monomers, as described previously in the experimental section. ATR-FTIR spectra of the poly(CLMA) homonetwork and of the copolymer networks were obtained (figure not shown). The band at 3500–3200 cm<sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the C–O–H stretching of the hydroxyl group present in the side chain of the caprolactone unit in poly(CLMA) networks. In poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) copolymer networks, the C–O–H stretching of OH functional group overlaps with the band associated with carboxylic groups present in the IA structure and is more pronounced with increasing IA ratios. Other significant signals are the bands at 1717 and 1147 cm<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to the C = O stretching vibration of the carboxyl group and the C–O vibration, respectively. The bands between 2950 and 2900 cm<sup>−1</sup> are due to the symmetric and antisymmetric CH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub> stretching.</p>
<p>The DSC thermograms of the poly(CLMA) network and its copolymer networks with IA were obtained (figure not shown). As expected, no melting peaks were detected since the short caprolactone units are not able to crystallize; therefore, all the samples are fully amorphous.</p>
<p>A single glass transition temperature (Tg) was observed around −7.1°C for the poly(CLMA) homonetwork. Copolymers with 5 and 10 wt% IA were characterized by a single Tg that had shifted to higher temperatures (Tg = −3.1°C for 5 wt% of IA and Tg = 1.4 °C for 10 wt% of IA). Copolymers with 15 and 20 wt% of IA showed a broad glass transition between −70°C and 100°C centered at 5.3°C and 12.3°C for 15 and 20 wt% of IA, respectively. No other thermal events were observed in these samples, except for the CLMA sample, where thermal degradation started around 200°C (see also the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512469710">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>The main dynamic–mechanical relaxation associated with the glass transition of poly(CLMA) is centered at 33°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">Figure 1(b)</xref>). For poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) samples, the main relaxation shifted to a higher temperature with increasing IA contents (from 46°C to 75°C). When the temperature was increased above 100°C, the elastic modulus sharply increased again for all polymer networks, except for the poly(CLMA) homonetwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">Figure 1(a)</xref>). This may be due to a process of additional cross-linking of the samples, probably caused by esterification reactions between the hydroxyl groups of caprolactone units present in the poly(CLMA) networks and the COOH groups in IA comonomer.

<p>A characteristic band in the range between 3500 and 3000 cm<sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the stretching vibration of −COOH and −OH groups, and the band for the carbonyl group at 1709 cm<sup>−1</sup> is seen in the spectrum of poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA). The spectrum of the RGD-functionalized copolymer exhibits noticeable changes compared to nonfunctionalized copolymer. The band at 1490 cm<sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the amide II stretching vibration. Also, the intensities of the bands between 3600 and 3100 cm<sup>−1</sup> increased due to the amine and carboxylic groups present in the tripeptide sequence. The DSC scans show that RGD functionalization of the poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) networks do not affect the glass transition temperature, which is at approximately −20°C for both samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Besides, both samples have similar thermal degradation behavior (data not shown).</p>
<p>The mechanical properties are affected by the RGD grafting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">(d)</xref>). The storage modulus for the functionalized copolymer is lower than for the nonfunctionalized network (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512469710">Table 1</xref>). In the first heating scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(c)</xref>), the storage modulus for both copolymers increases past 150°C, probably due to additional cross-linking reactions taking place after the chains have sufficient mobility. A second heating scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(d)</xref>) no longer shows this marked increase, suggesting the completion of the additional reactions after the first heating.</p>
<p>The water contact angle (WCA) was measured on surfaces of poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) with 10 and 20 wt% of IA and RGD-functionalized networks. WCA shows a slightly decreasing trend as a function of IA content in the copolymer (from WCA = 72.54 for 10 wt% of IA to WCA = 68.22 for 20 wt% of IA). In poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA-RGD), the WCA is somewhat higher (WCA = 82.54) than in the nonfunctionalized network (WCA = 72.54). Grafting with RGD not only induces cell adhesion properties but also slightly increases the wettability of the system.</p>
<p>It was vital to maintain the biocompatibility of CLMA in the final material. Moreover, large amounts of IA would cause an increase of the hydrophilic properties in the copolymers, thus, decreasing the cell adhesion. Therefore, for cell culture experiments, copolymers with only 10 wt% of IA were chosen for grafting reactions with RGD.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence assays and bright field images confirmed the SEM observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512469710">Figure 5(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512469710">(e)</xref>). HSCs were positive for S100 and some of them expressed GFAP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512469710">Figure 5(d)</xref>). On the other hand, HSCs were positive for CNPAse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512469710">Figure 5(f)</xref>), indicating a potential capacity to participate in the myelinization process (CNPAse positive) or form the Büngner bands, which are important for guiding growing axons, while the remaining cells maintain their proliferative behavior.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IA-RGD macromers were successfully synthesized through the EDAC/NHS route and characterized by FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (see online supplement). The functionalization degree (FD) (ratio between the relative intensities of the signals of the CH<sub>2</sub> of RGD (c) and the vinyl CH<sub>2</sub> signal (a) of IA), estimated by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, was approximately 85%.</p>
<p>Poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) copolymer networks are homogeneous materials throughout all composition ranges, with the CLMA and IA monomers showing good miscibility as indicated by a single glass transition process in the DSC thermograms, by a single dynamic–mechanical main relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">Figure 1</xref>), and by the linear dependence of the specific volume on the copolymer composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512469710">Figure 2(c)</xref>). When the temperature was raised above 100°C, an additional cross-linking reaction seems to take place, causing the dynamic–mechanical modulus to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">Figure 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">(b)</xref>). A second heating scan showed that the reaction was completed and the final rubbery moduli remained unchanged, indicating that the modulus increase was irreversible. The samples with 10 and 15 wt% of IA show a two-peak split in the maximum of tan δ, and this may be due to the change in the chemical environment of the relaxing units caused by the structural change after the additional cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512469710">Figure 1(d)</xref>). This process could be caused by the esterification reaction between −OH and −COOH groups present in the CLMA and IA monomers, respectively. However, no trace of this hypothesized additional cross-linking process is revealed in the DSC thermograms, indicating that the number of units involved must be small, and giving rise to a negligible heat effect. This phenomenon was not observed by FTIR analyses of the samples used for DMA tests because a new appearance of bands attributed to ester groups would be colocated with the existing bands of carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups. The same phenomenon occurs in the RGD-functionalized copolymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">(d)</xref>). Quantitatively, the extent of additional cross-linking can be estimated by calculating the molar concentration of knots in the network derived from the feed ratio of the polymerization reaction and the values of the same quantity derived from the experiments using rubber elasticity theory.

<p>with <italic>φ</italic> being the functionality of the knot in the network,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512469710">23</xref></sup> in our case, <italic>φ</italic> = 4, due to the tetravalent EGDMA molecule that was used the cross-linker. The concentration of elastically active knots (<italic>n<sub>x</sub></italic>/<italic>V</italic>)<sub>exp</sub> is simply half the value of <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic>/<italic>V</italic>, since in networks with tetrafunctional knots, the molar number of knots <italic>n<sub>x</sub></italic> is half the molar number of chains <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic>. The excess of effective knots obtained experimentally over the theoretical value can be attributed to new physical cross-links formed by hydrogen bonds between side chains. The results of these calculations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512469710">Table 1</xref>, together with the mean molecular masses between elastically active knots in the network, <italic>M<sub>c</sub></italic>. An increase of the IA content in the copolymers results in a decrease of <italic>M<sub>c</sub></italic>. Furthermore, whereas the stoichiometrically derived molar concentration of knots should slightly decrease with the IA content in the copolymers, the concentration of elastically active knots increases with the IA content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512469710">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, it has been concluded that a number of physical cross-links form within the network proportional to the IA content, suggesting that the presence of the two −COOH functionalities contributed by each IA comonomer significantly augments the formation of stable hydrogen bonds with the −OH functionality of the CLMA comonomer. After an increase in temperature, some of these additional cross-links turn into newly formed covalent bonds.</p>
<p>Depending on how RGD moieties are grafted to the copolymer, the chemical composition might give rise to phase heterogeneity that could be detected by DSC through a change in the glass transition process in the copolymer networks. Here, the RGD units attached to the copolymer structure do not affect the Tg process of poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(b)</xref>) but decrease their mechanical storage modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512469710">Figure 3(d)</xref>). Thus, the bulky RGD substituent has a plasticizing effect that is caused by the increase of the free volume due to steric interference and by the disappearance of the −COOH groups involved in intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, now partly consumed in the grafting of the RGD motifs.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that an RGD sequence incorporation into the polymer backbone enables cell adhesion and proliferation of different cell types;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911512469710">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512469710">25</xref></sup> yet, it has been stated that other additional peptide motifs—or larger RGD-containing ones—are necessary to achieve significant cell responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512469710">26</xref></sup> The most common treatment to enhance the Schwann cell attachment to the synthetic substrates is the coating of the substrate surfaces with extracellular matrix proteins.

Vleggeert-Lankamp et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911512469710">31</xref></sup> have shown that laminin and fibronectin are the most suitable materials for coating the interior of the synthetic nerve guides.

Suri and Schmidt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911512469710">34</xref></sup> demonstrated that cocultures of Schwann cells and neurons in biomimetic scaffolds that employ native extracellular matrix components enhance the nerve regeneration process. Our SEM images showed the Schwann cells arranged in columns reminiscent of the Büngner bands, which are essential structures in the normal regenerating process of nerve cells during Wallerian degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512469710">Figure 5</xref>).

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An effective way to incorporate RGD motifs into a polymer precursor was devised, consisting of the synthesis of a RGD-IA macromer that was then reacted with CLMA, a polymer precursor. Physical and mechanical characteristics of the RGD-functionalized system, poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA-RGD), were compared with the poly(CLMA-<italic>co</italic>-IA) copolymer networks. Both monomers are homogeneously mixed in these materials, and strong side-chain interactions develop with increasing IA contents. RGD functionalized materials enhance the Schwann cell adhesion and proliferation and induce the spontaneous formation of cellular columns, crucial to guide axonal growth. This type of substrate could play an important role in the design of devices for therapeutic purposes aimed at accelerating the regeneration of neural tissue lesions.</p>
