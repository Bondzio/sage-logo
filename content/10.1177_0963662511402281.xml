<abstract>
<p>Many foods and eating practices have been framed as risky by risk societies. Recently, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become a highly scrutinized food additive. Informed by a social construction of risk framework, I analyze the discursive contributions of the Corn Refiners Association, a trade association, to public negotiations of HFCS risks. I describe how the association’s Sweet Surprise campaign advertisements rely on a deficit model to shape understandings of who should participate in conversations about HFCS. I conclude by exploring the practical implications of this analysis, particularly how trade associations can negotiate tensions between promoting health and serving commercial interests, and how these decisions contribute to understandings of the public’s role in risk negotiation.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Though many substances can be consumed, cultural beliefs and traditions shape public understandings of what is edible, what is safe, what is healthy, and what is just too risky to eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511402281">Lupton, 1996</xref>). The identification and management of food-related risks reflect the social negotiation of the various arguments put forth by various stakeholders, including industry, science, governmental, advocacy, and consumer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511402281">Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle, 2003</xref>). Risk discourses are not neutral, though. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511402281">Blue (2010)</xref> said that “the contemporary politics of food can also be read as a <italic>politics of discourse</italic> as more and more groups have the power to set agendas, frame debates, and grant voice to different concerns” (p. 148, original emphasis). Struggles for the authority to control meanings become particularly salient during times of crises or controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511402281">Mumby, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become a highly scrutinized food additive due to scientific controversies and the resulting media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511402281">White, 2008</xref>). HFCS is a corn-derived ingredient that has been added to food products, such as soft drinks and snack foods, as a sugar substitute since the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662511402281">Thompson, Garcia and Wildman, 1996</xref>). Though HFCS, cane sugar, and honey all share similar chemical structures and caloric values, HFCS became the sweetener of choice for many food companies because of its liquid form, intense sweet flavor, and nature as a preservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511402281">White, 2008</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, HFCS costs less for major manufacturers to produce, incorporate into products, and transport. The use of HFCS rapidly expanded in the last two decades. Between 1995 and 1997, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that production of high fructose corn syrup had outstripped sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511402281">Lord, 1997</xref>). At the time, the USDA projected that consumption would stabilize due to new taxes on the export of items containing HFCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511402281">Brant and Flores, 2004</xref>). Although the consumption of HFCS peaked in 1999 at 63.7 pounds per capita, the consumption of HFCS remains greater than that of refined sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511402281">USDA, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511402281">White (2008)</xref>, the success of this seemingly mundane ingredient was deflated by a publication in the 2004 <italic>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</italic>. In this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511402281">Bray, Nielsen, and Popkin (2004)</xref> concluded that HFCS may play a role in the obesity epidemic because items that contain HFCS are often cheaper and, therefore, over consumed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511402281">White (2008)</xref> argued that this study’s conclusions were “translated as fact by leading nutrition journals, weekly and specialty magazines, national and local newspapers, and an endless number of television programs,” and HFCS was subsequently “vilified by scientific circles and then in the public arena” (p. 1717S). There has been much debate since the publication of this study over the safety of HFCS. This scientific controversy has yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>Because risk societies are concerned with promoting safety and mitigating risk, the perception of risk surrounding a food ingredient can lead to uncertainty and negatively influence industry and consumer purchasing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511402281">McComas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511402281">Verbeke, 2005</xref>). Scientific controversy and consumer uncertainty, then, threaten the financial wellbeing of industries that rely on the sale of HFCS and demand a rhetorical reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511402281">Bitzer, 1968</xref>). In the case of HFCS, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) developed a communication campaign entitled Sweet Surprise aimed at promoting healthy discussions about HFCS. The CRA is an agricultural trade association in the United States that provides technical service, public relations, and government relations for the corn industry, specifically the wet milling industry, which processes more than 50% of the corn processed in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511402281">Singh and Johnston, 2004</xref>). A few of the member companies include major processors, such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, and Corn Products International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511402281">“Member companies,” n.d.</xref>). Because the success of these companies is in part linked to consumers’ support of their products, it was important that the CRA reestablished HFCS’s place in consumer pantries by refuting ascribed risks.</p>
<p>Although the controversy surrounding HFCS can be easily viewed from the standpoint of functional nutrition, an analysis of how the trade association’s discursive practices contribute to the public negotiation of risks associated with HFCS is equally important. While trade associations have been recognized as contributing significantly to the framing of risks and the subsequent health policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511402281">Michaels and Monforton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511402281">Michaels, Monforton and Lurie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511402281">Oreskes and Conway, 2010</xref>), few scholars have explored their role in representing the food industry in the context of food risk. In this essay, I adopt a social constructionist framework to explore a question raised by the authors of <italic>Food Fears</italic>: “How do food risks get communicated in meaningful ways?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511402281">Blay-Palmer and Donald, 2008</xref>: 127). More specifically, I ask, how does the CRA’s discussion about the relationships among HFCS, health, and risk serve to contribute to public negotiations of HFCS risks?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, I employ a close textual analysis of the CRA’s Sweet Surprise advertisements to identify its rhetorical strategies. These advertisements only represented one part of the CRA’s overall initiatives to shape the conversation about HFCS’s role in food systems. However, I limit my analysis to the campaign’s advertisements because their accessibility meant that they were more likely to influence a greater audience, including consumers, public health officials, scientists and organizational members, as opposed to the communicative events surrounding public health hearings or private meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511402281">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>). Further, isolating readily available and complete texts empowers me “to uncover subtle and otherwise unrecognized rhetorical strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511402281">Ceccarelli, 2001</xref>: 6) of a particular rhetorical event that may go unnoticed in a broader study of the CRA’s discursive actions.</p>
<p>Although my analysis isolates the Sweet Surprise advertisements, it is through an understanding of context and similar discourses that I develop a cohesive argument about the CRA’s rhetorical strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511402281">Browne, 2009</xref>). To better understand and explain the campaign’s contributions to public negotiations of HFCS risks, I situate it within broader discussions of trade associations and public understandings of science and expertise in the context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511402281">Beck’s (1992)</xref> risk society. Informed by this literature, I argue that the Sweet Surprise campaign relied on a deficit model to establish authority in the conversation about HFCS. By pairing a public knowledge deficit with the notion of personal responsibility, the Sweet Surprise campaign magnified the need for “healthy” conversations about HFCS. The campaign responded to their constructed exigency by extending their vision of healthy discussions. Their “healthy discussion” established boundaries between knowledge systems by representing some as more valuable and certain, such as scientific experts. However, even this group was limited to individuals who believed HFCS was safe to consume regularly. Further, I argue that by privileging scientific knowledge and downplaying the CRA’s economic interests, the campaign established its own authority in discussions about HFCS. I contend that these strategies ultimately contribute to public understandings of science, risk, responsibility, and the relationship between knowledge systems. I conclude by comparing and contrasting the CRA’s rhetorical strategies with those used by other trade associations and by exploring how the CRA’s investment in the agricultural industry might influence how risk was communicated.</p>
<sec id="section2-0963662511402281">
<title>The social construction of food risks</title>
<p>The term “risk” has a spectrum of meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511402281">Lupton, 1999</xref>). To the social constructionist, risks are understood as arising from social and cultural contexts. Though theorists in this paradigm have different epistemological beliefs about the nature of risk, social constructionists tend to agree that risks are never fully knowable outside of human observation. Adopting a social constructionist framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511402281">Beck (1992)</xref> described the difference between dangers and risks. Whereas dangers are events out of our control, being “at risk” is a period where something bad could happen, but has not yet occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck, 1999</xref>). It is a time when we think something can and should be done to mitigate risk. Because risks are often by-products of human action and are always identified, amplified, and attenuated within social structures and discourses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck (1999)</xref> theorized that risks have social births.</p>
<p>At the end of the 20th century, risk became one of Western culture’s defining attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511402281">Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511402281">Giddens, 1991</xref>). This shared cultural preoccupation with identifying and mitigating risk characterizes risk societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511402281">Beck, 1992</xref>). In general, risk societies represent and respond to public understandings of how people should make sense of and behave in the world. Superstitious beliefs that once governed public understandings of the relationship between nature and society have given way to contemporary ideologies that considered risk as objective, quantifiable, and, as such, manageable. Risks are represented as complex webs of invisible threats that do not distinguish between class, gender, or age, yet all individuals are expected to be informed and to make calculated choices based on scientific evidence to ensure their safety. For instance, contemporary health discourses remove food items from the eater’s focus and, instead, situate invisible components of food, such as pathogens, pesticides, or nutrients, as the primary concern for eaters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511402281">Pollan, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511402281">2008</xref>). To eat safely, consumers have to know not only what invisible molecules are (not) healthful, but also whether invisible molecules are present in or absent from food items. Consequently, most individuals experience uncertainty when making eating decisions because they cannot rely on their own perceptions. Instead, they need scientific knowledge to identify food risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511402281">Coveney, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The constructed nature of reality, however, suggests the possibility that knowledges can be partial, flawed, or even strategically assembled to serve the purposes of different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511402281">Potter, 1996</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511402281">Watson-Verran and Turnbull (1995)</xref>, “Where one system leaves off and another starts is a matter for strategic negotiation on the part of those involved in knowledge production enterprises” (p. 131). Often as much effort goes into proving the validity of scientific facts and theories about food risks, if not more, than that which goes into conjure up the facts in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511402281">Gieryn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511402281">Potter, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511402281">Heath (2009)</xref> said that “people defend and attack contestable propositions and argue over accuracy, sufficiency, and relevance of knowledge claims &amp;…; [in] a contest among voices” (p. 21). Such politics of discourse are referred to as the wrangle in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511402281">Burke, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511402281">Heath, 2009</xref>). Wrangles in the marketplace can represent diplomatic dialogue between stakeholders seeking to share information, reach a sufficient agreement, or coordinate actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511402281">Heath, 2009</xref>). From this perspective, the wrangle is beneficial because it tests completeness and adequacy of competing voices. The wrangle of the marketplace is not always pleasant or productive. When stakeholders perceive themselves as having something to gain or lose, such as financial resources, strategic relationships, or public image, they have a higher stake in the way in which an issue is discussed and subsequent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511402281">McKee and Lamb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511402281">Potter, 1996</xref>). As a result, stakeholders advocate more vigorously, ensuring that their voice is heard and their position is adopted. Rhetoric, in such instances, can become manipulative, “slick and hollow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511402281">Heath, 2009</xref>: 24).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck (1999)</xref> argued that “in a risk society the politics and subpolitics of risk definition become extremely important” because “risks have become a major force of political mobilization” (p. 4). Case in point: perceptions of and reaction to risks are functions both of observation and of the conceptual lenses shaped by public discourses. Rhetors can opportunistically select and represent particular realities over others to influence the outcomes of public negotiations of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511402281">Augoustinos, Crabb and Shepherd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511402281">Shaw, 2002</xref>). It becomes problematic when the representations of reality that the public respond to “drift dangerously far from the world that their fellow citizens experience and inhabit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511402281">Jasanoff, 1997</xref>: 231).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963662511402281">
<title>Politics of discourse</title>
<p>The metaphor of a wrangle of the market situates risk societies as systems of stakeholders who affect or are affected by the identification and management of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511402281">Giddens, 1991</xref>). The lack of scientific consensus surrounding HFCS served to jeopardize the authority of scientific experts and public health agencies, the ability of consumers to manage their health, and the market share of HFCS and, thus, financial wellbeing of the organizations represented by the CRA. From a systems framework, the power of these stakeholders is relational and lies in their abilities to access and utilize discursive resources to affect social and material realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511402281">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511402281">Jones, 2002</xref>). It is important for stakeholders to have their voice heard if they wish to participate in the public negotiation of a particular risk and hope to affect outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511402281">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511402281">Heath, 2009</xref>). As such, the contributions of the public, experts, policy makers, and industry in public negations of risk are marked by politics of discourse.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross (1994)</xref> argued that dominant understandings of the public’s relationship to science reflect a deficit model. The general public is considered ignorant and easily swayed by subjective biases. As such, its participation in risk negotiations is not valued. To make up for their deficits, the public is thought to rely on experts and governmental agencies whose knowledge is believed to be objective and sufficient. At the same time, however, as the public recognizes the role of science, technology, and government in producing risks, they simultaneously become increasingly skeptical of risk information communicated by these organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck, 1999</xref>). Such mistrust is often constructed as the public’s ignorance by deficit models, which subsequently influences the rhetorical strategies of those within the expert system who address that public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross, 1994</xref>). Rhetoric grounded in the deficit model “acts to accommodate the facts and methods of science to the public’s limited experience and cognitive capacities” (p. 6). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511402281">Blok, Jensen, and Kaltoft (2008)</xref> concluded that the deployment of deficit models “systematically downgrades other forms of knowledge” (p. 191). An interactional framework, on the other hand, values both lay and expert knowledge systems. The lay public contributes to the negotiation of risk by influencing knowledge production and policies that result from new knowledge. Because both systems are considered valuable, communication is envisioned “as a two-way flow between science and its publics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross, 1994</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Industry is another stakeholder in risk negotiations that struggles for the authority to participate in and shape the identification and management of risks. To ensure their voice is heard, many organizations voluntarily participate in trade associations, which work to shape key issues, induce actions, and develop a favorable public image by building strategic relationships, lobbying, and public relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511402281">Measell, 1992</xref>). Trade associations serve to represent otherwise unspoken interests or reinforce messages already being voiced by the organizations they represent. As such, trade associations can be understood as “discursive landscape architects.”</p>
<p>Trade associations, by nature, blur the boundaries established between research and education, as well as, advertising and advocacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511402281">Wansink and Peters, 2007</xref>). Their hybrid roles as commercial and health promoters have been met with mixed reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511402281">Ludwig and Nestle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511402281">Simon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511402281">Wansink and Peters, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511402281">Wansink and Peters (2007)</xref> argued that the hybridization of roles creates a win-win-win situation for the public, the industry, and public health because the industry has the financial resources and skill sets to develop persuasive messages that reach larger audiences than do public health agencies. By drawing on health promotion, the industry can keep the public healthy, while maintaining a strong consumer base. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511402281">Ludwig and Nestle (2008)</xref> argued that “irreconcilable conflict” between trade associations’ private commercial and public health interests would consistently keep organizations from adequately promoting health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle (2003)</xref> said that the trustworthiness of food campaigns should be questioned because their messages are often shaped by industry interests, not public interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511402281">Simon (2006)</xref> similarly argued that because trade associations have significant access to financial and persuasive resources, they should be watched carefully.</p>
<p>Indeed, scholars who have studied associations affiliated with pharmaceuticals, asbestos, and tanning beds, among other industries, have accused these industries of framing research in ways that recontextualize the actual rhetorical situations to create strategically advantageous conditions for their private interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511402281">Michaels and Monforton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511402281">Michaels et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, in the midst of controversy, these industries have attempted to destabilize renderings of reality that are less than favorable for the respective industry by emphasizing junk science and scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511402281">Gieryn (1999)</xref> said that while engaging in controversy, rhetors often draw on particular theories and, simultaneously, avoid contrary evidence to support their argument. By doing so, rhetors engage in boundary work which distinguishes between who should address certain problems and what types of knowledge should be used. Science is commonly considered sine qua non for risk controversies. Yet, even when people agree on that boundary, there are contests concerning what counts as “real” science or “junk” science. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511402281">Michaels and Monforton (2005)</xref> have argued that manufacturers who produce pollution and hazardous by-products have drawn on notions of junk science “to influence public opinion by ridiculing scientists whose research threatens powerful interests, irrespective of the quality of those scientists’ research” (pp. S39–S40).</p>
<p>In addition to refuting the authority of particular rhetors involved in public risk negotiations, trade associations have also been found to appeal to scientific uncertainty, which serves several functions for industries. First, appeals to scientific uncertainty can be used to maintain and focus media coverage. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511402281">Oreskes and Conway (2010)</xref> argued that industries draw on uncertainty and risk to keep issues or products on the public’s mind, which, regardless of whether the outcome is positive or negative, is better than being outside public interest. Further, by highlighting particular risks, rhetors also discursively restrict the frames of the debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511402281">Beck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511402281">Irwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511402281">Janasoff, 1997</xref>). Focusing in nutritional risks, for instance, serves to distance other matters central to food and health, such as issues of inequality or corporate responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511402281">Maurer and Sobal, 1995</xref>). Second, appealing to scientific uncertainty serves to block legislation. For example, by emphasizing uncertainty surrounding the correlational evidence between children’s use of aspirin and Reye’s syndrome, pharmaceutical companies were able to delay governmental intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511402281">Michaels and Monforton, 2005</xref>). Using uncertainty to block regulation has become so popular “that it is unusual for the science behind a public health or environmental regulation proposed in the United States <italic>not</italic> to be challenged by a corporation facing regulation” (p. S39, original emphasis).</p>
<p>With so many interest groups struggling for the authority in public negotiations of health risks, it can be difficult for a single group to attract public and policy makers’ attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511402281">Baumgartner and Leech, 2001</xref>). The collaboration of multiple organizations to form trade associations affords each corporation more discursive resources, including lobbyists and financial backing, which increase the likelihood of a message being heard. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511402281">Baumgartner and Leech (2001)</xref> found that, in 1996, “businesses and trade associations, taken together, spent over nine times more money on lobbying than citizen groups and nonprofits” (p. 1197). These discursive resources can also be used to conceptualize the potential impact of the CRA’s discourses on collective definitions of and responses to HFCS risks. The Lobby Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 requires organizations to disclose the names of their lobbyists and the amount of money they have spent on lobbying efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511402281">Hind, Kay and Varela, 2008</xref>). According to reports filed with the U.S. House of Representatives, the CRA had at least eight lobbyists between 2006 and 2010 and spent nearly one million dollars ($970,000.00) on lobbying efforts aimed at government officials during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511402281">U.S. House of Representatives, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511402281">Hind, Kay, and Varela (2008)</xref>, however, argue that the numbers reported by lobbying organizations are conservative because the LDA does not account for the money spent to influence public opinion and ultimately policy. As such, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the extent of the resources the CRA put into shaping policies and perceptions surrounding HFCS. For example, the resources allotted to the CRA’s Sweet Surprise campaign, aimed at educating the public about HFCS,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511402281">1</xref></sup> were not necessarily reflected in their reports, though its launch necessitated organizational resources and served to shape policy.</p>
<p>Given their discursive resources and potentially significant role in consumer health, it is particularly important to focus on the role trade associations play in public discussions of food risks. However, few scholars have explored their role in representing the food industry in the context of nutritional risk. In this essay, I explore the rhetorical contributions of the CRA toward public negotiations of HFCS risks.</p>

<title>2. Rhetorical texts and analytic method</title>
<p>Rhetoric not only reflects and influences public understandings of scientific knowledge and expertise, it also provides a method for identifying discursive patterns and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross, 1994</xref>). The current essay uses a close textual analysis (CTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511402281">Browne, 2009</xref>) to explore the rhetorical contributions of one such media discourse, the Sweet Surprise campaign, toward public understandings of eating risks. Rhetoricians using CTA typically examine a single text to explain how the form of a text was constructed to invite a particular reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511402281">Ceccarelli, 2001</xref>). Because the advertisements that comprised the Sweet Surprise campaign were intended to “change the conversation” about HFCS and served as the audience’s main exposure to the CRA’s discourse, it was the main focus of the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). I accessed the advertising elements through the CRA’s online press and news kit found on the campaign’s website on April 12, 2009 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sweetsurprise.com/news-and-press/">http://www.sweetsurprise.com/news-and-press/</ext-link>). Specifically, I consider the advertisements which were disseminated through major media beginning in 2008, including three television, three magazine, two newspaper, and seven internet banner advertisements.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511402281">Browne (2009)</xref> “CTA refers to an interpretive practice that aims to explain how texts operate to produce meaning, effect persuasion, and activate convictions in the public context” (p. 63). CTA seeks to identify the complex set of symbolic forces that affect a rhetorical text, as well as the utterance’s rhetorical potential. Guided by this analytical method, I seek to find reoccurring or forceful themes that comprised the campaign and significant lines of argument or evidence that provide meaning through their omission. I provide key examples to support my argument.</p>

<sec id="section5-0963662511402281">
<title>3. Conversations and HFCS: Navigating expertise and participation</title>
<p>The mission statement stated that the aim of the campaign was to “Chang[e] the Conversation about High Fructose Corn Syrup” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511402281">“Our mission”, n.d.</xref>). The newspaper advertisements clarified the type of conversation that the campaign sought to obtain by stating “We welcome a healthy discussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). Though “healthy discussion” has multiple interpretations, I argue that the campaign situated a healthy conversation as an exchange between knowledgeable medical professionals and an ignorant public. For example, the <italic>Campaign at a Glance</italic> webpage said that Sweet Surprise would “share the facts about HFCS with consumers and opinion leaders” and “provide[d] additional information and resources about HFCS and its role in a healthy diet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). In this section, I describe how the campaign characterized conversational participants and argue that these characterizations draw boundaries between what counts as valuable sources of information about HFCS, which served to contextualize participation in the “healthy discussion” about HFCS.</p>
<sec id="section6-0963662511402281">
<title>Flawed exchanges: An ignorant and needy public</title>
<p>The campaign regularly identified the public as a less than trustworthy source of information about HFCS. Magazine advertisements, for instance, depicted dialogue using textboxes which stemmed from the tops of the models’ heads cropped at the mouth. In <italic>Hairdresser</italic>, a young woman disclosed, “My hairdresser says that sugar is healthier than high fructose corn syrup,” to which another young female responded, “Wow! I didn’t know you get your hair done by a doctor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). In the advertisement <italic>Dry Cleaner</italic>, a male said, “My dry cleaner says high fructose corn syrup is loaded with calories,” and a woman replied, “A registered dietician pressed your shirts?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). Both advertisements situated science and health concerns, specifically those surrounding HFCS, as everyday discussion topics between friends, family, and strangers. Sarcastic responses from characters, however, questioned the validity of the information exchanged in these conversations. The sarcastic responses suggested that because peers are not scientific experts, the validity of their information and opinions is highly questionable. Subtext filling the bottom third of the advertisements continued, “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about sugar made from corn …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). This argument further supported the notion that the public should question the validity of common beliefs about HFCS. Together, the advertisements suggested that people should trust the expert knowledge held by health professionals, such as doctors and registered dieticians, instead of basing decisions on “unreliable” lay knowledge exchanged at the salon or dry cleaner. In doing so, the campaign contextualized the domain of knowledge from which lay individuals can speak with authority: Hairdressers know about hair, and dry cleaners know about stains and linens, not HFCS.</p>
<p>Although the magazine advertisements suggested that members of the public may have meaningful, though misguided, conversations about HFCS, the television advertisements <italic>Brothers</italic>, <italic>Party</italic>, and <italic>Two Bites</italic> suggested that anti-HFCS participants cannot support their positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). For example, in the commercial titled <italic>Brothers</italic>, a male teenager approached a slightly younger male who was eating a bowl of cereal. The older brother said, “Once again you are demonstrating your inferior intellect … that cereal has high fructose corn syrup in it … even a doofus like you must have heard what they say about it.” The younger brother asked for an explanation of what is wrong with HFCS. The big brother is then shown as being at a loss for words because he did not know what people actually said about HFCS. The younger brother replied, “It’s made from corn. That it’s nutritionally the same as sugar, and it’s fine in moderation.” Through this representation, the older brother, who could be understood to represent the greater anti-HFCS public, was discredited. He was unable to articulate a viable argument because he was mis- or under-informed. Further, by simply implying that his argument was based on what people were talking poorly about, the advertisement reinforced the notion that anti-HFCS members of the public are not informed outside of everyday conversations, which were already discredited.</p>
<p>In addition to positioning HFCS “facts” as being exchanged among uninformed consumers, the campaign situated the media as a malicious source of misinformation. For example, the CRA used one full-page newspaper advertisement called the Schmear Ad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). Above a bagel topped with cream cheese the advertisement asked, “Could it be another schmear advertisement?” The ad used a play on the word smear to refer to media reports that spoke poorly of HFCS. The ad’s subtext continued, “Lately, high fructose corn syrup has had its name dragged through the media.” This advertisement extended the argument that some sources of information might be not only invalid, but malicious. Thus, it reasoned, consumers should be careful of where they get their information.</p>
<p>By limiting the public’s authority to talk about HFCS risks, the campaign was able to restrict their agency in the “healthy discussion.” For example, the diminished role of the public in healthy discussions about HFCS is demonstrated in the television commercial <italic>Party</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). In this advertisement two mothers, approximately thirty years of age, hold an awkward conversation at a children’s birthday party. One mother approached the hostess, also assumed to be a mom, who was pouring red punch into a cup and said, “Wow! You don’t care what the kids eat huh?” Clearly confused, and probably offended, the hostess asked the mother why she would say such as thing. Confidently, the mother replied that the punch had HFCS in it and asked if the hostess knew what people were saying about HFCS. Instead of answering, the hostess asked about what others were saying. When the mother could not respond, the hostess began to pour another cup and said, “It’s made from corn. It’s natural and, like sugar, it’s fine in moderation.” The mother awkwardly looked around, picked up a cup of juice, and then changed the topic. The message suggested the mother, representing the anti-HFCS segment of the public, needed to become educated and “get the facts” before entering the conversation. The lesson is that the public should not openly question the safety of HFCS because they are likely uninformed. Such portrayals ignore the public’s ability to make valid judgments based on their knowledge and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511402281">Blok et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While “misinformed” members of the public were framed as inept conversationalists, the importance of their role in conversations about HFCS risks was grounded by the campaign’s demonstrations of their need for reliable, and thus <italic>scientific</italic>, health information. The campaign suggested that though health is important, many members of the public are misinformed about how HFCS impacts health. For instance, the <italic>Thirds</italic> magazine advertisement consisted of a three-quarter page image portraying side views of two faces cropped at the mouths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). A man said, “High fructose corn syrup made me fat,” to which the woman responded, “No, going back for thirds made you fat.” This advertisement argued against claims that correlate obesity and HFCS, but also underscored a causal relationship between ignorance and poor health. As such, the public was positioned as having a knowledge deficit and responsible for seeking valid information to prevent illness. If the public experiences poor health, HFCS and the corn industry are not to blame. Instead, it is the public’s fault because they have not sought out and adhered to sound scientific evidence. Through this positioning, eating becomes an uncertain situation where the public is situated as having a deficit understanding of nutritional science.</p>

<sec id="section7-0963662511402281">
<title>Expert talk</title>
<p>While the public was situated as a less-than-reliable source of information about HFCS, scientific experts, specifically health professionals, were situated as more credible sources. In this section, I describe how the campaign identified reliable sources of information. I argue that the campaign’s representation of medical professionals privileged expert opinion and positioned them as more qualified to participate in a “healthy discussion” about HFCS.</p>
<p>The Sweet Surprise campaign attempted to build expertise by emphasizing the authority of science and medicine. For instance, the four internet fact banners entitled, <italic>Doctors on Obesity</italic>, <italic>Nutrition Experts on Obesity</italic>, <italic>Dietitians on a Balanced Diet</italic>, and <italic>Doctors on Sweeteners</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>) drew on general titles and subject domains to appeal to the safety of HFCS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross (1994)</xref> argued that “facts” are often considered valid and reliable because they are established by scientific or technical experts. The campaign’s representation of health professionals as sources of valid information served to privilege scientific and medical knowledge over the public’s understandings of HFCS. Gross argued that this reliance on scientific and technical expertise perpetuated the deficit models of public understandings of science. Indeed, the campaign’s construction of expertise reinforced the dominant risk ideologies that privilege expert knowledge. However, it is interesting to note that while the campaign privileged the voices of health professionals, the campaign omitted opinions of scientific researchers in the advertisements. This is a curious choice considering that researchers traditionally establish “facts” and are considered authorities on risk and health.</p>
<p>By appealing to certainty and not contesting their experts, the campaign drew on scientific authority and reasoning. Unlike the consumer opinions that were scrutinized in the campaign’s other materials, these web banners present consensus among the opinions. For instance, one read, “Doctors have concluded that high fructose corn syrup doesn’t appear to contribute to obesity any more than other sweeteners.” Another banner proclaimed, “A leading nutrition expert notes that there’s no substantial evidence that high fructose corn syrup is somehow responsible for obesity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). In addition to representing this consensus, the campaign said that “Many dieticians agree that high fructose corn syrup, like all other sweeteners, can be a part of a balanced diet.” The idea of incorporating HFCS into one’s diet to obtain “balance” was repeated through all of the campaign’s advertisements. None of the advertisements represented a counter-HFCS statement from a scientific expert. The campaign’s omission of scientific researchers from the advertisements makes sense within a rhetoric of expert consensus. Though traditionally considered authorities, researchers have also been known to have contradicting opinions concerning the safety of HFCS. By omitting researchers from the advertisements, the campaign ignored scientific controversy and disagreement. Further, the omission of scientific researchers limited the CRA advertisements’ liability. For example, had the campaign only represented researchers with favorable opinions of HFCS, it would have been possible for audiences to accuse the CRA of a biased presentation. Failing to represent scientific researchers’ opinions, on the other hand, limited the ability of audiences to refute the campaign’s science-based arguments.</p>
<p>The campaign’s rhetorical decision to represent consensus and omit discussions of controversy served as an appeal to professional and more general audiences. By not representing controversy among professionals, it appeared as though there was no reason to distrust the campaign’s assertions about HFCS. The advertisements suggested that the public did not need to seek additional information beyond the campaign itself. However, by only using the campaign as a source of expert information, audiences limit their understandings of HFCS to the campaign’s reconstruction of the scientific controversy. The campaign’s representation of consensus also fits within the scientific understandings of authority, which privilege the longevity and consensus surrounding a theory, rather than that of a particular individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511402281">Rieke, Sillars and Peterson, 2009</xref>). By constructing using general titles and representing expert consensus, it appears as though the health field has a unified opinion of HFCS, even though the actual communication environment may be marked by debate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511402281">Rundblad, Chilton, and Hunter (2006)</xref> found that non-expert sources will often attempt to validate their position by referencing sources that are respected by the audience. Indeed, the campaign drew on scientific experts to validate their own authority in public negotiations of HFCS’s role in the human diet. The campaign avoided potential criticism of its role as a health educator by basing its messages on scientific professionals, whose knowledge was already culturally positioned as sufficient and objective. Additionally, by omitting information in the advertisements about the campaign’s connection to the agricultural industry through the CRA, the campaign limited the attention it called to its potential industry biases. The campaign’s distancing strategy is consistent with the behaviors of those whom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511402281">Blok, Jensen, and Kaltoft (2008)</xref> labeled “bureaucratic” experts. Those closely affiliated with a relevant industry “maintain a sharp boundary between ‘research’ as what they do and ‘politics’ as left for others” to avoid criticisms of their knowledge claims (p. 199). The campaign maintained that it represented research, not the subjective politics of the agricultural industry, in order to establish its own authority in the debate over HFCS risks.</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>With the aim of representing a “healthy discussion” about HFCS, the Sweet Surprise campaign rhetorically constructed a space where only a few stakeholders could participate. The authority of health experts was validated because their opinions appeared consistent and were never questioned. The public, however, was repeatedly situated as naive, gullible and in need of information. As such, a boundary was drawn between public and expert sources of information. The information exchanged between members of the public was situated as “junk science” as opposed to the “real science” offered by experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511402281">Gieryn, 1999</xref>: 16). The campaign’s characterization of the public and scientific experts fits well with prior description of deficit models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511402281">Blok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511402281">Gross, 1994</xref>). The campaign’s framing of valuable knowledge was also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511402281">Irwin’s (2001)</xref> work which demonstrated how organizations framed scientific discussions in such a way that gave the façade of public participation, but in reality limited the topics of discussions in a manner that served to reduce public scrutiny.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511402281">Beck (1992)</xref> theorized that as members of risk societies recognize the role of science and technology in producing risks, they become more skeptical of the help those disciplines offer. However, the current essay found that appeals to consumer ignorance served to make questioning the campaign a worthless exercise. In many of the advertisements, the individual who questioned HFCS’s safety was not only quickly proven wrong, but he or she was also ridiculed. Further, even if audiences desired to enter the discussion, the campaign did not provide extensive room for consumer participation. There was a question and answer section available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Sweetsurprise.com">Sweetsurprise.com</ext-link>. Yet, only two questions and responses were actually listed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511402281">Sweet Surprise, n.d.</xref>). This suggested either that audiences are not asking questions or that the CRA selected which to respond to publicly. This finding was discouraging since “the Internet now offers the basis of a better dialogue with consumers and shareholders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511402281">Doeg, 2005</xref>: 14). Perhaps it was safer for the campaign to ignore the voices of consumers, since public forums would likely introduce HFCS as a product of scientific controversy.</p>
<p>Appeals to expertise and consensus were also rhetorical strategies aimed at establishing the campaign’s own authority in public negotiations of HFCS risks. These strategies deflected potential rejections of the campaign’s argument that HFCS was safe, but also avoided criticisms of the tensions that characterize the boundary between their role as a health promoter and their commercial organization. For example, consumers were not invited to participate in discussions even though they were ultimately held accountable to make the decision about whether or not to consume HFCS. Audiences were told to manage their health by making rational decisions based on the opinions of scientific experts.</p>
<p>The Sweet Surprise campaign suggested that because HFCS was similar to sugar and honey and natural, consumers could manage their health while consuming HFCS in moderation. The comparisons to sugar and honey served to downplay any special relationship between HFCS and obesity risks. Consumers, the CRA reasoned, should feel just as safe eating HFCS-sweetened products as they would if they were eating sugar. The CRA’s attempts to make HFCS look comparable to sugar and honey were important because when making food decisions consumers find familiar risks less severe than unfamiliar ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511402281">Grunert, 2005</xref>). However, it is important to recognize that the CRA’s appeal to moderation did not suggest that consuming HFCS was a health-promoting activity, but, rather, that consuming HFCS posed no <italic>special</italic> risks to consumers as compared to other caloric-sweeteners. The appeal to eating in moderation could also be understood to promote HFCS consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle, 2003</xref>). Moderation allowed for the consumption of HFCS, however, the amount that could be safely consumed was never clearly defined which left consumers responsible for making the judgment. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle (2003)</xref> wrote that food companies argue regularly that “all foods can be part of a healthful diet” and the keys to healthful diets are “balance, variety, and moderation” (p. 360). However, industry appeals to moderation have been criticized because the term is “meaningless” and “leaves people in the dark” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511402281">Simon, 2006</xref>: 328). Consumers were expected to go online to become informed, had the freedom of choice to or not to eat HFCS, and were responsible to manage their personal risk taking behavior. The industry and public health were not held responsible for health outcomes related to HFCS consumption.</p>
<p>The campaign’s appeals to moderation reinforced the notion that food plays an important part in weight management, but displaced any blame that could be put on HFCS or the CRA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511402281">Simon (2006)</xref> argued that it is in the interest of the food industry to place the responsibility of risk negotiation on individuals because it mitigates the need for industry action and governmental regulation. As such, the campaign’s rhetorical strategies can be seen as compatible with neoliberal discourses which de-emphasize or reject government intervention and, instead, focus on negotiating risks by encouraging free-market methods and less restricted operations of industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662511402281">Waters et al., 2010</xref>). Further, within this framework of individual responsibility and rationality, organizations can simply provide educational materials to appear responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511402281">Simon, 2006</xref>). The educational nature of the Sweet Surprise campaign became a performance of goodwill for the CRA.</p>
<p>The rhetorical strategies of the trade association I identified in this essay vary from those uncovered by other authors studying industry responses to controversy, even though they share a common purpose of minimizing corporate responsibility and governmental regulation. The CRA’s attempts to construct certainty and scientific consensus were markedly different from those of other industries which have been found to emphasize <italic>un</italic>certainty in scientific findings and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511402281">Michaels and Monforton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511402281">Michaels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511402281">Oreskes and Conway, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels (2008)</xref> suggested that industries fluctuate between promoting scientific certainty or uncertainty in response to marketplace demands. The differences between the rhetorical strategies I and other scholars have uncovered may reflect and respond to the different marketplace pressures put on the respective industries. For example, by framing the controversy surrounding HFCS as simply a matter of nutritional science, the CRA selectively represented a controversy which they were able to reconstruct and appear to win. This discursive strategy allowed the CRA to avoid more complicated discussions of other controversial topics concerning HFCS production and consumption in the United States, such as U.S. government subsidies for corn, environmental sustainability, and the availability of nutrient-deficient foods. As such, the campaign’s appeal to certainty can be seen as a discursive strategy to limit controversy and remove itself from continued public scrutiny. The negative attention other industries, such as tobacco and asbestos, received mostly centered on epidemiological health issues, such as cancer incidences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels, 2008</xref>). Without the fear of other, more significant issues surfacing, it was strategic to emphasize uncertainty to prolong public negotiations of risk and stall or halt government regulation by appealing to scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p>The differences in these rhetorical strategies may also reflect variations in the organizations’ intended audiences. Other studies of industries’ responses to controversy, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511402281">Oreskes and Conway (2010)</xref>, have explored the development and translation of scientific evidence by organizations to directly influence policy. While these discourses served to influence consumers, the rhetorical strategies used by the CRA focused more directly on shaping or delaying policy makers, including government and public health officials. On the other hand, in this essay, I explored the Sweet Surprise campaign’s advertisements which were aimed primarily at influencing consumer beliefs, attitudes, and purchasing decisions. While consumers can surely impact the development of health policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511402281">Blue, 2010</xref>), their primary influence on the industry is their consumption behaviors. It was beneficial to frame HFCS as safe, so consumers would continue buying it and, thus, support the financial wellbeing of the corn refining industry.</p>
<p>The variations between rhetorical strategies uncovered in this essay and those in other studies highlight both the strength and the limitation of the current study. By only looking at advertisements published by a single trade association, the study identified the strategies aimed at consumer stakeholders and, based on the extant literature, suggests these strategies may be unique as compared to associations’ overall strategies. However, the lack of breadth limits the study, as it does not look at the other discourses to see if they are comparable to the strategies of other industries. It would be valuable for future research to explore the similarities and differences that emerge from comparing the public negations of risk across a particular trade association’s external discourses. It would also be fruitful to compare multiple associations’ discourses aimed at a particular audience. Specifically, it would be interesting to distinguish the variables that influence appeals to certainty or uncertainty and the use of selective representation to frame risk controversies.</p>

<title>Practical implications for stakeholders</title>
<p>Though some scientific controversies appear to be negotiated publicly for the public’s interest, there are often private interests working backstage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511402281">Miller, 2005</xref>). In the current context, consumer interests were addressed publicly, saving private industry interests for backstage communication between the trade association, its members, government and public health officials, and other industry organizations. The rhetorical strategies used in the advertisements had the potential to alter the welfare of and relationships between stakeholders.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511402281">Verbeke (2005)</xref> said that “perhaps the most important source of information about food quality and safety is the mass media, with advertising being the most widely used tool” (p. 357). The campaign’s specific impact on consumer health by encouraging the consumption of HFCS depends on who you ask; however, the campaign’s influence on public understandings of how to discuss food risks is more pertinent to this essay. Ultimately, the Sweet Surprise campaign situated the public as ignorant; that is, until they become educated by the campaign. It is discomforting that this campaign relied so heavily on the deficit model, undermining the public’s perceived ability to question nutritional claims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511402281">Rundblad, Chilton, and Hunter (2006)</xref> contended that it is essential to health communication that we ask “who has the authority to publically communicate the true picture of a possible causal link?” (p. 72). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511402281">Lyne and Howe (1990)</xref> also asserted that “educated people have a responsibility to understand the inherent dangers of such naturalizations of politics, whatever good intentions may lie behind the rhetoric” (p. 147). It would be beneficial for scholars to examine the impact of social marketing campaigns that purport to or silently represent both public health and commercial initiatives on public and industry goals. This is a possible location for applied studies of consumer health literacy and stakeholder management.</p>
<p>While never mentioned by the campaign, the wellbeing of the industry was also influenced by this campaign. The CRA’s goal for developing the Sweet Surprise campaign was to change the discussion about HFCS to highlight a more favorable understanding of the relationship between health and HFCS. By doing so, the CRA stood to gain financially because influencing favorable understandings of HFCS would potentially maintain, if not increase, its consumption. More favorable impressions of a food additive held by the public, regardless of their validity, can also influence policies surrounding foods with those additives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle, 2003</xref>). Simply put, if HFCS is considered safe by doctors and nutritionists, and soda and cookies containing HFCS taste good, the public is more likely to eat these foods and feel safe in doing so. If they feel safe doing so, they are less likely to petition the government to regulate HFCS. But we must consider the ethics of rhetorical strategies which serve to disguise the controversies surrounding HFCS and limit participation in public negotiations of health.</p>
<p>Scholars should seek to establish an ethical framework and a description of best practices for contemporary trade associations engaging in risk communication and stakeholder management by blurring the boundaries between health and commercial promotion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511402281">Michaels (2008)</xref> provided sets of rules and regulations concerning integrity in the context of industry, science, and policy maker relationships; however, very little literature is currently available on the guidelines or ethics associated with campaigns targeting the general public’s eating behaviors.</p>

<title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>While the campaign said its motivations were to promote “healthy discussions” about HFCS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511402281">Nestle (2003)</xref> reminded the public that food companies “routinely put the needs of stockholders over considerations of public health” (p. viii). While I did not demonstrate that public health was compromised by the educational efforts of the campaign, I have expanded understandings of how trade associations contribute to public negations of risk in the context of questionable food items. Trade associations can successfully manage the boundaries between their health and commercial promotions and protect their members’ wellbeing, if they emphasize consumer responsibility and the organization’s role as an educator while simultaneously limiting public participation and the discussion of corporate interest.</p>
