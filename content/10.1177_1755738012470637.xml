<abstract>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK. GPs with a list of 2000 patients can expect to see one new patient with breast cancer per year, although they will see many more women with symptomatic breast disease who do not have cancer. Breast cancer is the second-most-common cause of cancer-related death in women, causing over 10 000 deaths a year. Early diagnosis and improved treatments have substantially improved survival rates. This article aims to increase confidence in recognising sinister breast pathology, as well as to provide an overview of breast cancer management.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738012470637"><title>Epidemiology</title>
<p>In 2009, there were 48 788 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the UK; 1% of cases are found in men (a statistic that should not be forgotten), but the vast majority occur in women. Breast cancer comprises almost 31% of all female cancers in the UK, and over 81% of cases occur in women aged 50 years and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1755738012470637">Cancer Research UK, 2009</xref>). Europe has the highest recorded incidence of female breast cancer whereas the lowest recorded rates are in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>The risk of developing breast cancer increases in women who migrate from low- to high-risk countries; this is likely to be due to increased life expectancy and the existence of screening programmes in the Western world rather than an environmental influence. The incidence of breast cancer is greater in more affluent female groups.</p>
<p>The incidence of breast cancer in the UK has risen by more than 85% over the past three decades. However, mortality rates have fallen by 33% over a similar time period. The number of women alive and currently diagnosed with breast cancer was nearly 2% of the female UK population in 2009, and approximately 12% of those aged 65 years and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1755738012470637">Office for National Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738012470637"><title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Unless picked up by routine screening, diagnosis of breast cancer usually begins with a consultation in primary care. Knowledge and understanding of the disease, risk factors and presentation will allow the GP to promptly refer those with suspicious symptoms or signs to a specialist for further investigations and management.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1755738012470637"><title>Risk factors</title>
<p>Age is the strongest risk factor for breast cancer in women. Four out of every five new cases are diagnosed in women aged 50 years and over, with cases peaking in the 60 to 64 year age group. Additional risk factors for breast cancer relate to a woman’s exposure to oestrogen throughout her lifetime (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738012470637">Box 1</xref>).

<p>Women will be exposed to oestrogen over a longer duration if menarche is at an early age and/or menopause is entered at a later age. The average age of menarche in developed countries today is 12 to 13 years, compared with 16 to 17 years during the 19th century. The risk of developing breast cancer increases by nearly 3% for every year older a woman is at menopause. Parity is also important; the risk of breast cancer reduces by approximately 7% with each full term pregnancy and 4% for every 12 months of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>HRT delays the onset of the menopause, therefore the risk of developing breast cancer increases with duration of use. The risk is higher if women use combined oestrogen-progestogen HRT compared to single-hormone HRT. HRT also increases breast density, reducing the sensitivity and specificity of breast screening. However, it is important to note that cancers diagnosed in women taking HRT tend to be less clinically advanced than those diagnosed in women who have not used HRT.</p>
<p>Women with benign proliferative breast disease have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, especially if atypia is seen. A previous diagnosis of breast cancer raises the risk of developing a second primary breast cancer.</p>
<p>In developed countries approximately 10% of breast cancers have a genetic predisposition (familial breast cancer). A woman’s risk of breast cancer is more than doubled if it has been diagnosed in a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter). Her risk is further increased if a first-degree relative is diagnosed before the age of 50 years and it is almost six times greater if two first-degree relatives develop the disease. However, it is important to note more than 85% of women who have a single first-degree relative with breast cancer will never develop the disease.</p>
<p>Women who have a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer may be screened for mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2. Approximately one in 450 women carry a fault in the BRCA genes, giving a 50–80% chance of developing breast cancer. Genetic testing may be offered through the NHS but is appropriate for only a small proportion of women who are from high-risk families. This can be elucidated by enquiring about breast cancer risk factors, including a detailed family history that incorporates first- and second-degree relatives on both maternal and paternal sides of the family, as well as discussing if a faulty gene has ever been discovered in a family member. The classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer is described in further detail in the guidance produced by NICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1755738012470637">NICE, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Healthy lifestyle factors such as regular exercise and avoiding post-menopausal obesity are protective against breast cancer development. Post-menopausal women with a body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase their risk of breast cancer by 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012470637">Reeves et al., 2007</xref>). Physical activity reduces breast cancer risk by reducing levels of oestrogen and testosterone, especially in post-menopausal women, as demonstrated in the recent European Prospective Investigation of Cancer study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738012470637">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Smoking, a high fat diet and increased alcohol intake are also associated with breast cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1755738012470637"><title>Presenting features</title>
<p>The most common presenting symptom of breast cancer is a breast lump, although other signs and symptoms also occur (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738012470637">Box 2</xref>). Fortunately, almost 90% of breast lumps are benign in nature. However, this means that an accurate history and thorough examination is even more important in helping to distinguish between benign and malignant breast disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738012470637">Table 1</xref>). Key points in the history include determining the onset, duration and rate of lump growth. The existence of previous breast disease and breast surgery alongside any risk factors should be noted.

<p>When performing an examination, remember that almost half of all breast cancers are found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The examination should also include an assessment of the axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a breast cancer lump may be ignored, or not recognised, until it presents as a locally advanced cancer or fungating mass (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1755738012470637">Fig. 3</xref>). Patients might present late as they are anxious about the lump and have been trying to deny its existence – although there is no evidence to prove this conjecture. A meta-analysis found strong evidence for an association between older age and patient delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738012470637">Ramirez et al., 1999</xref>). NICE has produced guidelines for primary care physicians that outline the presenting features that warrant an urgent specialist breast clinic referral to be seen within 2 weeks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012470637">Box 3</xref>).

<sec id="sec6-1755738012470637"><title>Investigations</title>
<p>Women who present to their GP with symptoms suggestive of breast cancer require an urgent referral to secondary care for further investigations. All breast lumps and suspected breast cancers are investigated by triple assessment: clinical examination, radiological assessment and cytological/histological assessment. The full triple assessment is often undertaken within a day at a ‘one-stop’ clinic.</p>
<p>A two-view mammography is the gold standard radiological investigation in women aged 40 years and older. An ultrasound is preferred in women under the age of 35 years, as increased breast tissue density reduces the sensitivity and specificity of mammography in younger women. In women between the ages of 35 and 39 years mammography is preferred if the clinical findings are suggestive of malignancy, otherwise ultrasound is used (although a mammogram may still be considered if the ultrasound is normal). Cytological assessment of breast tissue is carried out via fine needle aspiration cytology and a core needle biopsy provides tissue for histology. Both are best completed under radiological guidance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly used modality for surveillance of women at high risk of, or diagnosed with, familial breast cancer.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1755738012470637"><title>Management</title>
<p>Following a diagnosis of breast cancer the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) works with the patient to determine subsequent management options. The health professionals involved in the MDT comprise: surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, breast care nurses and radiologists, amongst others. The characteristics and classification of the cancer, disease stage and prognostic indicators are all considered when determining the management options.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1755738012470637"><title>Characteristics and classification</title>
<p>Most breast cancers originate from epithelial cells lining the terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU). Invasive cancer cells breach the basement membrane component of the TDLU, invading the surrounding breast tissue. <italic>In situ</italic> disease does not breach the basement membrane. Invasive cancers can be grouped into: invasive ductal carcinomas, invasive lobular carcinomas, special type carcinomas and not otherwise specified carcinomas. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type, accounting for 80% of all invasive breast cancers. The second most common is invasive lobular carcinoma, comprising a further 10% of invasive breast cancers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1755738012470637"><title>Staging and prognostic indicators</title>
<p>Invasive breast cancer, once diagnosed, is staged using the International Union against Cancer system of tumour node metastases. Staging is an extremely important predictor of patient survival and is often used to determine the treatment for breast cancer. Prognosis thus relates to the stage of the disease at presentation.</p>
<p>Prognosis for invasive breast cancer can be calculated using the Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). This formula utilises the information gained from breast cancer grading and staging to predict survival and risk of relapse, and therefore help select appropriate adjuvant systemic therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738012470637">Box 4</xref>). The scores resulting from the NPI can be categorised into three bands. A score less than four implies a good prognostic outcome with high chance of cure. A patient with a score between 4.1 and 5.4 has a moderate level of cure. A score above 5.4 is associated with poor outcomes.

<p>Additional prognostic indicators include oestrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, lymphovascular invasion and over-expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) gene, all of which have implications for adjuvant endocrine and biological treatments. A positive HER-2 status correlates with a poorer prognosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1755738012470637"><title>Surgical treatment</title>
<p>Surgery is the first-line treatment for most early breast cancers, although in patients deemed to be at very high risk for surgical intervention primary endocrine treatment may be preferred. Surgical options include breast conservation therapy with local radiotherapy, or a mastectomy - with optional reconstruction. It must be noted that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may be utilised as the primary treatment in order to shrink large tumours, thus allowing breast conservation surgery to be offered instead of a mastectomy. The most commonly performed procedure is breast conservation surgery. This is routinely followed by local breast radiotherapy, which has been shown to be as effective as a mastectomy in reducing the risk of local recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738012470637">Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The axillary nodes are surgically staged by biopsy of the sentinel nodes. Advances are being made to examine nodes intra-operatively to avoid two separate operations. Radioisotope (technicium 99-m) and patent blue dye are injected around the tumour site to enable identification of the sentinel nodes in the axilla; the nodes that must be sampled will be blue and radioactive. If the nodes are identified as positive the patient will undergo a full axillary clearance. Sentinel lymph node biopsy avoids unnecessary axillary surgery, which has its own morbidity.</p>
<p>A mastectomy will be offered if the tumour is large, involves the areolar region, is multifocal, or involves the chest wall and skin. The type of surgery offered is also influenced by patient choice. Breast reconstruction should be discussed at the time of diagnosis and can be immediate or delayed. The latter is more common after adjuvant therapies. The most common options for reconstruction include utilising an implant alone or an autologous tissue flap, with or without implant. The most commonly performed procedures are a latissimus dorsi or a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1755738012470637"><title>Adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer</title>
<p>Biological, endocrine and chemotherapy may be offered if there is significant risk of cancer recurrence or death from possible microscopic spread. Endocrine therapy involves the use of drugs to counteract the effects of oestrogen, as oestrogen may encourage the growth of breast cancer cells, especially inER positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and a well-established endocrine treatment in ER positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen is generally prescribed for 5 years and has been shown to reduce the recurrence of breast cancer post-operatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738012470637">Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 2005</xref>). Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as Anastrozole are only effective in post-menopausal women, but they may be more effective than Tamoxifen in ER or PR positive women as they block oestrogen production. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine whether endocrine treatment for more than 5 years is beneficial.</p>
<p>Endocrine therapies carry significant side-effects, of which GPs should be aware. Tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer, thromboembolism and stroke, whereas AIs are associated with menopausal hot flushes, arthralgia, osteopenia and fractures. It is recommended that a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan is performed before commencing AI therapy, and appropriate bone protection should be prescribed accordingly.</p>
<p>Anthracycline (Doxorubicin or Epirubicin)-based chemotherapy is standard adjuvant treatment for breast cancer and reduces mortality by approximately 20–40% in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1755738012470637">Cancer Research UK, 2009</xref>). The addition of a taxane, such as Docetaxel or Paclitaxel, may be offered to high-risk women to provide some additional benefit.</p>
<p>Nearly 25% of breast cancers exhibit over-expression of the HER2 gene (HER2 positive). These are amenable to treatment with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). Unfortunately, cardiac dysfunction is a recognised adverse effect of trastuzumab; it is therefore essential that all patients have their cardiac function assessed with an echocardiogram both before and during treatment. This biological therapy should not be initiated in patients with pre-existing cardiac failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1755738012470637"><title>Practical and emotional advice</title>
<p>GPs will often see patients with breast cancer more often than the surgeon or oncologist and are frequently the first contact point for advice. They can provide support for patients and their families throughout the disease trajectory and they have a practical role to play regarding issues such as renewal and monitoring of ongoing prescriptions (e.g. for Tamoxifen). They can also countersign the application form for the medical exemption (MedEx) certificate, to which all patients with a diagnosis of cancer have been entitled since prescription charges for cancer patients were abolished on 1 April 2009. The MedEx lasts for 5 years; it can be renewed if at the end of this period the patient is still undergoing treatment for either cancer, the effects of cancer, or the effects of cancer treatment (including the use of Tamoxifen or lymphoedema garments).</p>
<p>GPs may also be called upon to provide a patient with a medical certificate for Statutory Sick Pay or Employment Support Allowance following a diagnosis of cancer, with the duration depending on the patient’s treatment and prognosis. They may need to signpost patients to external agencies, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau for further financial advice, or appropriate charities for emotional support and information. Breast care nurse practitioners (based in secondary care) and charities such as Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support often provide excellent support for patients. Cancer Research UK has a vast array of information online regarding various support organisations that patients may find extremely helpful (see further information).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1755738012470637"><title>Risk factors</title>
<p>A recent study estimated approximately 27% of female breast cancers are associated with modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1755738012470637">Parkin et al., 2011</xref>). Risk factors include:
<list id="list3-1755738012470637" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reproductive and hormonal factors that result in prolonged exposure to oestrogen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obesity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Excessive use of alcohol</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low levels of physical activity</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>GPs have an important role in identifying and helping modify these risk factors in their patients, encouraging and advising on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Where appropriate, advice should be given on avoiding post-menopausal obesity, taking regular exercise, reducing alcohol intake as well as initiating and prolonging breastfeeding. The risks and benefits of using exogenous hormones such as HRT and the combined oral contraceptive pill should be assessed and discussed on an individual basis. Research on the link between dietary factors and breast cancer are inconclusive, however the EPIC study showed breast cancer to be more prevalent in women consuming a diet high in saturated fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738012470637">Chan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in lifestyle and reproduction patterns may not be practicable, especially in Western countries, and therefore a lot of research is being devoted to the uses of chemoprevention in reducing the risks of breast cancer. At present SERMS are not licensed for use as chemoprevention for breast cancer in Europe.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1755738012470637"><title>Screening</title>
<p>Breast screening involves the use of imaging to allow the detection of very early stage breast cancer, before clinical changes in the breast become apparent. The NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) was introduced to the UK in 1988, with the aim of reducing the number of women dying from breast cancer. Screening units are situated throughout the UK. Women aged between 47 and 73 years who are registered with a GP receive an automatic invite for screening every 3 years, via a letter through the post. Over 2 million women in the UK were screened through the NHSBSP from April 2010 to the end of March 2011. 17 838 cancers were detected, most in women aged 50–64 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738012470637">NHSBSP/ABS, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Cancers detected through screening generally have an excellent prognosis; the 5 year relative survival rate for screen-detected invasive breast cancer for women screened in 2005–6 was 97.9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738012470637">NHSBSP/ABS, 2012</xref>). However, false positive results are an important problem associated with breast screening. It is estimated one in five women invited for screening will have a false positive result at some point over a 20 year screening period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738012470637">Jorgensen and Gotzsche, 2010</xref>). This undoubtedly leads to patient anxiety as well as the need for performing interventions in well patients, which could result in reduced rates of attendance for future breast screening.</p>
<p>Women under the age of 47 years are not offered routine breast screening unless: they have had breast cancer in the past; they have a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age; or they are confirmed as carrying a mutation in the BRCA genes. These women will be offered an annual screening.</p>
<p>Routine screening involves use of a two-view mammogram, exposing the patient to a minimal amount of ionising radiation with little risk of developing breast cancer as a result. Women under the age of 47 years will be offered screening using mammography or an MRI scan. Women aged over 70 years may be screened upon request.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1755738012470637" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Part of the GP’s role is to raise patient awareness about breast cancer and the benefits of screening. The GP has an additional challenge of recognising and promptly referring patients with a potential breast cancer out of a large cohort of those who have benign breast disease. Earlier detection and improved treatments have increased the survival rates of breast cancer patients; this swelling population of survivors is increasingly being managed in the community. The GP, alongside community health care workers, will play a pivotal role in caring for and supporting this patient group.
