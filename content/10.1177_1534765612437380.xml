<abstract>
<p>This study examines the effectiveness of the School Mediation Intervention (SMI) in preventing mental health problems and promoting social functioning among children living in armed conflict. The participants were 225 Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip, divided into the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 141) from schools where the SMI was implemented and the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 84) from a school with no SMI implementation. The SMI aimed at improving pupils’ social functioning through methods of problem solving, conflict resolution, and dialogue skills and at enhancing mental health through caring for peers and preventing disruptive and aggressive behavior. Older students acted as responsible school mediators and teachers as supervisors. Participants reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression (CDI), psychological distress (SDQ), and quality of friendship, prosocial behavior, and aggressiveness at baseline at the beginning of school year (T1) and at postintervention 8 months later (T2). The results defeated the hypothesis that participating in SMI would decrease symptoms and increase friendship quality and prosocial and nonaggressive behavior. Instead, SMI was effective only in limiting the deterioration of friendships and prosocial behavior across the intervention period. The results are discussed in regard to interventions tailored for children traumatized in armed conflicts.</p>

<p>Negative impacts of war trauma on child mental health are well documented. Children in armed conflicts suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, sleeping difficulties, and extended grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612437380">Montgomery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765612437380">Punamäki, Qouta, El Sarraj, &amp; Montgomery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437380">Smith, Perrin, Yule, Hacam, &amp; Stuvland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437380">Thabet, Abed, &amp; Vostanis, 2002</xref>). However, substantial knowledge is augmenting about protective factors that enhance healthy development even in conditions of recurrent destruction, life-threat, and losses. There is evidence that children who enjoy supportive family and peer relations, feel safe enough to share their experiences, and use active and constructive coping strategies can be resilient despite the exposure to war trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612437380">Barenbaum, Ruchkin, &amp; Schwab-Stone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437380">Daud, af Klinteberg, &amp; Rydelius, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765612437380">Qouta, Punamäki, &amp; El Sarraj, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Two main approaches can be outlined in efforts to help children to endure in traumatic war conditions. First, targeted psychosocial interventions focus on children at high risk and/or with severe symptoms, aiming at alleviating their distress. They base on the argument that only children who are free from symptoms are able to prosper and accomplish their healthy development. Second, universal psychosocial interventions involve all children living in war and conflict areas and emphasize the general importance of positive experiences, mastery, and self-efficacy as a basis for good mental health. In practice, both approaches apply partly similar tools to promote effective coping strategies and socioemotional skills and to enhance feelings of safety. This study examines the effectiveness of a universal intervention, the School Mediation Intervention (SMI), in preventing children’s psychological symptoms and to support healthy social development in conditions of severe military violence.</p>

<title>Improving Child Mental Health in Armed Conflicts</title>
<p>There is some evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in alleviating PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms among children living in and fleeing from armed conflicts and wars (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612437380">Jordans, Tol, Komproe, &amp; DeJong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437380">Peltonen &amp; Punamäki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612437380">Persson &amp; Rousseau, 2009</xref>). The three reviews agree that the reductions in symptoms are modest, especially when considering their clinical significances, and that the beneficial intervention effects commonly depend on children’s age and gender and the timing of the intervention. Available studies on war-affected children lack rigorous research settings (i.e., randomized controlled trials [RCT]) and comprehensive intervention outcomes. The reviews detected 4 to 5 studies based on RCT that were conducted in African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612437380">Bolton et al., 2007</xref>), Former Yugoslavian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612437380">Layne et al., 2008</xref>), Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437380">Jordans et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612437380">Tol et al., 2008</xref>), and Middle-Eastern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437380">Berger, Pat-Horenczyk, &amp; Gelkopf, 2007</xref>) conflict areas.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612437380">Bolton et al. (2007)</xref> showed that interpersonal psychotherapy (16 group sessions) was successful in decreasing depression among war-traumatized adolescent girls in Uganda but did not attenuate anxiety symptoms or conduct problems in the whole sample. Their research setting was based on pre- and postintervention assessments and had two control groups receiving either creative play or no intervention. As a part of comprehensive preventive program in Bosnia, a 17-session trauma- and grief-focused therapy turned out to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612437380">Layne et al., 2008</xref>). The levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms and pathological grief decreased significantly more in the intervention than in the control group, and the results sustained for a 4-month follow-up. A class-based intervention (CBI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612437380">Macy, Johnson-Macy, Gross, &amp; Brighton, 2003</xref>) was associated with a reduction psychological distress and aggression among boys and with elevated levels of prosocial attitudes among girls in Nepal, assessed in a cluster-randomized pre- and postintervention study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437380">Jordans et al., 2010a</xref>). CBI was also found to reduce PTSD symptoms for girls and helping maintain hope for boys in Indonesia but failed generally to reduce psychiatric symptoms in a study with pre-, post-, and follow-up setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612437380">Tol et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, a school-based intervention among Israeli children exposed to terrorism was effective in decreasing somatic complaints, functional impairment, and anxiety in a quasirandomized control study with pre- and postintervention assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437380">Berger et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These RCT effectiveness studies employed mainly symptom reduction as outcome criterion, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437380">Jordans et al. (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612437380">2010b</xref>) assessed prosocial behavior and hope too and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437380">Berger et al. (2007)</xref> assessed children’s adaptive functioning. There is a call to extend the criteria of intervention effectiveness from symptoms into children’s optimal social resources and other developmentally salient issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612437380">Jordans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437380">Peltonen &amp; Punamäki, 2010</xref>). Some studies have included more comprehensive criteria to indicate improvements among war-affected children. For instance, the Health and Peace initiative has been successful in promoting nonviolent conflict resolution and reducing ethnic biases among Sri Lankan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612437380">Chase et al., 1999</xref>) and Croatian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534765612437380">Woodside, Santa Barbara, &amp; Benner, 1999</xref>) children. They showed improved communication skills and self-esteem and more willingness to explore ethnic prejudices and to accept nonviolent conflict resolution and expressed less fears and more hope across the intervention. A controlled study found that an intervention emphasizing cultural and recreational activities (e.g., traditional dancing, art works and sports) was effective in decreasing externalizing and internalizing symptoms among Palestinian children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612437380">Loughry et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly in the Palestinian context, the SMI, aiming at universally improving peer relationships, cooperation, and problem-solving skills, was successful in degreasing children’s psychiatric symptoms, especially hyperactivity and anxiety in a noncontrolled study with pre- and postintervention setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612437380">Thabet, Tawahina, El Sarraj, &amp; Vostanis, 2009</xref>). Our study adds to these studies by examining the capability of the SMI to decrease both symptoms and distress and to promote social functioning in conditions of intensive military violence among Palestinian children.</p>

<title>Enhancing Social Functioning in War Trauma</title>
<p>Researchers agree that the ability to form, maintain, and enjoy supportive interpersonal relationships and to accept help from others are the core of resilience in hardships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612437380">Armstrong, Birnie-Lefcovitch, &amp; Ungar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612437380">Dumont &amp; Provost, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612437380">Rutter, 2000</xref>). Optimal peer relationships, especially in middle childhood, constitute important developmental resources and have been found to predict good mental health in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612437380">Bliese &amp; Halverson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612437380">Gifford-Smith &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>) and, to some extent, among children in armed conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612437380">Paardekooper, De Jong, &amp; Hermanns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612437380">Peltonen, Qouta, El Sarraj, &amp; Punamäki, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437380">Layne et al. (2001)</xref> in turn observed that favorable changes in mental health were associated with good peer relationships and better commitment to school work among Bosnian children.</p>
<p>With peers, children share their painful experiences, train cognitive-emotional skills, and learn to cope successfully, which explains the protective role of social relationships in traumatic conditions. There is some evidence of the protective function of good peer relationships. A study among Palestinians confirmed that war trauma did not deteriorate children’s mental health if they enjoyed optimal friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612437380">Peltonen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research shows, however, that severe and accumulative traumatic events can impair friendship quality by increasing withdrawing, rejecting, and negatively toned peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612437380">Paardekooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612437380">Peltonen et al., 2010</xref>). Traumatic war experiences tend to increase children’s aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612437380">Kerestes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612437380">Qouta, Punamäki, Miller, &amp; El Sarraj, 2008b</xref>), and aggressive children in turn enjoy low peer popularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612437380">Brendgen, Vitaro, Turgeon, &amp; Poulin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612437380">Cillessen &amp; Mayeux, 2004</xref>). In other words, trauma deprives children from social resources both through interfering with protective functioning of optimal peer relationships and through increased aggressive behavior toward peers. This developmental vicious circle caused by trauma presents a strong argument for supporting social skills and encouraging dialogues among war-affected children. In addition, trauma research provides a strong theoretical rationale for interventions to encourage good social relationships, empathy, caring, and shared problem solving in war conditions, as lack of social support is agreed to be one of the main predictors of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612437380">Brewin &amp; Andrews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612437380">Ozer, Best, Lipsey, &amp; Weiss, 2003</xref>). The SMI, examined in this study, aims at building on children’s natural social resources that good peer relationships and group cohesiveness provide. Facilitating competence, constructive problem solving, and mutual understanding is expected to improve children’s social functioning and to decrease mental health problems.</p>

<sec id="section3-1534765612437380">
<title>Research Hypotheses</title>
<p>The study examines whether the SMI would be successful in alleviating children’s mental health problems and enhancing their positive social functioning. To indicate intervention effectiveness, we hypothesize, first, that PTSD, depressive and psychological distress symptoms will decrease only among children participating in the SMI, whereas no beneficial symptom change occurs in the control group from baseline (T1) to postintervention (T2). Second, we hypothesize that friendship quality and prosocial behavior will increase and aggressive behavior decrease in the SMI group, whereas no change in social function will happen in the control group from baseline (T1) to postintervention (T2).</p>

<p>The participants were 225 Palestinian school children from the Gaza Strip. They were 10 to 14 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 11.37 ± 1.10), and 36% were girls and 64% boys. The number of children in the intervention group was 141 (101 boys and 40 girls) and that in the control group was 84 (43 boys and 41 girls). There were 53 dropouts between baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2), accounting for 23.5%. The attrition did not differ according to the intervention vs. control group, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, 225) = 0.276, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, gender, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, 225) = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, age, <italic>t</italic>(1, 225) = −1.16, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, T1 military trauma, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, or any of the outcome variables, PTSD, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 1.39, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, depressive, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, psychological distress, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, friendship quality, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 0.60, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, prosocial behavior, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 1.06, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, and aggression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 223) = 1.25, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>.

<title>SMI</title>
<p>In response to teachers’ and parents’ concern about the impact of war violence on children’s development, behavior, and learning, the SMI was provided by Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP). The intervention views children as active participants and responsible actors in improving their peer relationships, solving moral problems, and protecting each other, and expects teachers, parents, and school administrations to facilitate pupils’ optimal activity. The intervention aims at enhancing conflict resolution and social dialogue and preventing disruptive school behavior in a number of ways: (a) introducing self-regulation techniques to attune provocative and aggressive behavior, (b) offering an atmosphere of safety and mastery for victims of peer aggression and bullying, and (c) enhancing attitudes, behavioral rules, and social conduct that improve school commitment and adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437380">Humphries, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612437380">Table 1</xref> presents principles and corresponding methods to gain these aims in the SMI.</p>

<p>Before the academic year of September 2005-May 2006, eight students were trained to take the responsibility to act as school mediators with 20 teachers as field supervisors in two schools in the Gaza Strip. The basic procedure of the mediation involved 10 steps such as determining the nature of the problems, entering the conflict situation, determining the critical disagreements of the conflicting parties, making the children to agree on the mediation rules, hearing, writing down, and offering solution options, enhancing the communication skills, motivating for looking diverse solutions, and making mutual plans to achieve agreed better practices in peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612437380">Moriarty, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The mental health group of GCMHP was responsible for the intervention, training, and supervising. A workshop for all teachers and field supervisors was held to acquaint them with the SMI, emphasizing both pupils’ own activity and need for adult support. The intervention was conducted during the school year as a routine part of the school work. The mediators interrupted emerging conflicts and bullying during school brakes and resettling discussions continue in the classes. All students contributed either as the active or passive group members, and in that sense nobody could decline the participation. Teacher’s role was generally passive, but they participated as discussion facilitators. The SMI was manualized, and the fidelity of the implementation was guaranteed by monthly work shops and school supervising for the trained mediators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534765612437380">
<title>Study Procedure</title>
<p>To study the effectiveness of SMI, three school classes were randomly selected from the two schools where the SMI was implemented, and two school classes served as controls also randomly selected from schools without SMI in the same areas. The children were assessed at baseline (T1) before the intervention and immediately after the completion of the intervention after 8 months (T2). The research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the GCMHP and permissions to enter the schools were obtained from the school headmasters. The research procedure in the schools was conducted by two Palestinian master’s-level researchers who were trained by the second author. They held information meetings in each participating classes, explaining the purpose of the study to the pupils and teachers. Written information about the study procedure was sent to parents through their children. Pupils completed both T1 and T2 questionnaires during school hours in two sessions each lasting about 1 hr. The researchers gave the instructions and provided advice and information when requested.</p>

<title>Measures at Baseline (T1) and Postintervention (T2)</title>
<p><italic>Military trauma</italic> was measured by a 25-item list capturing typical violent and traumatic events during the Al-Aqsa Intifada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612437380">Qouta, Punamäki, &amp; El Sarraj, 2005</xref>). Twelve events refer to own losses and experiences of military violence (e.g., shelling of home, being detained, wounded and beaten, losing a family member) and 13 events to witnessing killing, injury, and destruction. Children reported whether they had been exposed to the event (1 = <italic>yes</italic>; 0 = <italic>no</italic>) during the past year. Two linear sum variables were constructed by adding together the “yes” answers at baseline (ranging from 0 to 22) and postintervention (ranging from 0 to 24).</p>
<p><italic>PTSD</italic> symptoms were measured by the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437380">Pynoos, Frederick, and Nader (1987)</xref> and translated into Arabic by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612437380">Nader, Pynoos, Fairbanks, al-Ajeel, and al-Asfour (1993)</xref>. It is a 20-items scale covering the intrusion (nine items), avoidance (seven items), and arousal (seven items) symptoms of PTSD. The participants indicated on a 5-point scale how often they experienced each symptom (ranging from 0 = <italic>never</italic> to 4 = <italic>most of the time</italic>). A linear sum variable was constructed ranging from 2 to 39 in this sample at the baseline.

<p><italic>Depressive symptoms</italic> were measured by the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612437380">Kovacs (1981)</xref>, a 27-item self-report test assessing cognitive, affective, and behavioral signs of depression in children. The items consist of three sentences of which the participants were instructed to select the one that best describes how they have been feeling in the past 2 weeks. Each sentence is given a rating of 0, 1, or 2. A linear sum variable was constructed ranging from 1 to 38 in this sample at the baseline. The cutoff for clinical depression was 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437380">Kovacs, 1992</xref>). The CDI has previously been found reliable and valid among Palestinian children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765612437380">Thabet, Stretch, &amp; Vostanis, 2000</xref>), and in this study its Cronbach’s α reliabilities were .83 (T1) and .76 (T2).</p>
<p><italic>Psychological distress</italic> was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Scale (SDQ) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437380">Goodman (1997)</xref>. The scale consists of 20 items describing emotional problems of depression and anxiety and behavioral problems such as aggression and hyperactivity. Each scale consists of five items, and the participants evaluated on a 3-point scale how well the description fits them (ranging from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 2 = <italic>yes, fits well</italic>). A linear sum variable was constructed ranging from 2 to 32 in this sample at the baseline. The cutoff score of clinical level of psychological distress is 16 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sdqinfo.com">http://www.sdqinfo.com</ext-link>).

In this study, the Cronbach’s α reliabilities were .73 (T1) and .63 (T2).</p>
<p><italic>Friendship quality</italic> was measured by eight items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437380">Bukowski, 2004</xref>). The participants evaluated on a 5-point scale how well the descriptions matched their experiences with peers and schoolmates (ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very well</italic>). Items included descriptions such as “I have friends with whom I can share my secrets” and “If I have problems, my friends are always there to help me.” The Friendship Quality Scale has been previously applied among Palestinian children and shown sufficient reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612437380">Diab, 2011</xref>). An average sum variable was constructed ranging from 1 to 5 at the baseline, showing the Cronbach’s α values of .79 (T1) and .82 (T2).</p>
<p><italic>Prosocial behavior</italic> was measured by the five-item prosocial subscale of Strength and Difficulties Scale (SDQ) by Goodman (2006). The participants evaluated on a 3-point scale how well the description fit them (ranging from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 2 = <italic>yes, fits well</italic>). A linear sum variable was constructed ranging from 0 to 10 in this sample at the baseline. The Prosocial scale has shown to have validity and internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437380">Bourdon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437380">Goodman, 1997</xref>). The Prosocial Behavior Sum scales in this study have only moderate Cronbach’s α values of .64 (T1) and .60 (T2).</p>
<p><italic>Aggression</italic> was measured by a 13-item general aggression subscale of the Multiple Aggression Questionnaire (MAQ), standardized in Arab populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612437380">Abaza, 2003</xref>). The MAQ consists of 41 descriptions of behavior, thinking, and feelings covering physical, instrumental, and general aggression. Items of the general aggression scales are, for example, “It is easy to make my classmates to be afraid,” “I try to harm others,” and “I feel happy when I see people fighting.” The participants estimated the appropriateness of the statements on a 4-point scale (ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>very well</italic>). A linear sum variable was constructed ranging from 14 to 54 in this sample at the baseline. The aggression scale has previously been applied among Palestinian children showing adequate reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612437380">Qouta et al., 2008b</xref>). The sum score was calculated for general aggression, ranging between 13 and 44 in the sample. The Cronbach’s α values were .80 (T1) and .81 (T2).</p>
<p>The research instrument assessing friendship quality was not available in Arabic. A bilingual psychologist first translated the items from English into Arabic, and a researcher then made the back translation.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics included group comparisons on symptoms, social functioning, and some demographic factors by using two-tailed independent <italic>t</italic> tests or by χ<sup>2</sup> tests (Fisher’s exact). To test the effectiveness of the SMI in decreasing symptoms and increasing good social functioning, a repeated measures MANCOVA with Doubly multivariate design was applied, including six dependent variables (PTSD and CDI depressive symptoms; SDQ psychological distress; and friendship quality, prosocial behavior, and aggression), one between-subject variable (intervention vs. control group), and one within-subject variable (time from baseline T1 to postintervention T2). Significant Time × Group interaction effect would indicate expected changes in outcome variables indicating effectiveness. Age, gender, and military trauma (combined T1 and T2 levels) were treated as the covariates because the intervention and control groups differed in them. If covariates became significant, they were included in the model as additional between-subject variables before examining the univariates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ideally, the interventions to help children in armed conflict should both reduce mental suffering and encourage healthy development. Yet our results show that a school-based universal intervention enhancing pupils’ social relationships and problem-solving skills was not effective enough to improve their mental health and social functioning. It managed only to prevent some deterioration in children social functioning. The intervention took place in the mid of war and military violence, and the results tell about children’s struggle to maintain their healthy development in life-endangering conditions.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers worry about war trauma harming their children’s prosocial and empathetic development and increasing aggression. The SMI was launched to tackle these and mental health problems among Palestinian pupils. The intervention was chosen because it portrays children as active agents of their social world and encourages their own responsibilities. Peer relationships should consequently improve and aggressive behavior diminish. Although these optimistic aims were not accomplished, the participating children managed to maintain their successful friendship relationships and prosocial behavior and attitudes, whereas the social functioning was deteriorating among the control children. Earlier research showed more optimistic results of SMI among war-traumatized Palestinian children. They did not considered PTSD as intervention outcome, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612437380">Thabet et al. (2009)</xref> confirmed in a noncontrolled study that SMI could reduce children’s anxiety and hyperactivity.</p>
<p>The failure of the school intervention to reduce PTSD, depressive, and psychological distress symptoms and aggression may partly be explained by severe military violence during the academic year under inspection. Children in the Gaza Strip experienced shelling and targeted killing by the Israeli army and the beginning of international siege of their land. Especially the fractional fighting within the own Palestinian forces may have reflected on the deterioration of the social behavior and friendships in the control group children. The year 2006 was the first time since the 1982 Lebanon war, when Palestinians, now Fatah and Hamas movements, were fighting against each other. However, children’s personal exposure to war trauma did not contribute to the intervention-related changes in mental health or social functioning. The exception was the result that girls who were exposed to high military trauma benefited from the SMI participation as their friendship quality improved. The result hints that intervention could facilitate girls’ successful seeking of support and intimacy when in life threat.</p>
<p>Generally, however, the results concur with observations that protective processes, unfortunately, can have their beneficial function in child adjustment only <italic>after</italic> the war atrocities are over. A study found that active coping strategies were associate with poor mental health in acute life danger but contributed to good adjustment in safer conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612437380">Punamäki, Qouta, &amp; El Sarraj, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612437380">Qouta, El Sarraj, &amp; Punamäki, 2001</xref>). In other words, when there is acute war and violence threatening children, they may not have been able to take the full advantage of intervention that aims at buffing their natural protective resources. However, in the aftermath of the acute violence, when the protective factors began to work, children may reap more of universal preventive interventions benefits.</p>
<p>The PTSD symptoms increased especially in the intervention group, which is of concern. The results indicate that we should be more conscious about individual differences and children’s specific vulnerabilities and strengths when implementing universal interventions in war zones. Methods for stabilizing traumatized children before intervention could have been helpful. This could have been done for example with the starting period of 1 month consisting of relaxation and safe place exercises as a part of routine school work, jointed with preparatory discussions concerning the actual SMI. However, depressive symptoms remained under the clinical level in the intervention group while in the control group both depression and psychological distress increased into a treatment-demanding level. Attention given by peers, teachers, and intervention staff may have worked against the tendency to withdraw, feelings of meaninglessness, and melancholy that are typical for trauma-related depression.</p>
<p>The core question “what works for whom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612437380">Roth &amp; Fonagy, 2005</xref>) and why is highly relevant when helping children in armed conflicts. It is apparent that in conditions of life threat and intensified insecurity, the child-centered mediation intervention was not powerful enough to improve children’s mental health and facilitate their necessary resources, although it could prevent an exacerbation of the social problems. We should be more conscious about individual differences and children’s specific vulnerabilities and strengths when planning interventions in war zones. Methods for stabilizing would be important both for ethical and mental health reasons among traumatized children before school interventions can be helpful. Universal interventions in schools should be tailored so that children with PTSD should have targeted interventions, for example, cognitive behavioral group therapies. As an example, a study found that a skill-based group intervention was effective in decreasing PTSD symptoms only with children who had clinical levels of PTSD before the intervention. Subsequently authors suggest that children without PTSD may in turn have benefited more from a universal resilience-enhancing intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437380">Brown, McQuaid, Farina, Ali, &amp; Winnick-Gelles, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The cumulative evidence suggests that various interventions based on CBT techniques are effective in reducing the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety among traumatized children in times of both peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437380">Taylor &amp; Chemtob, 2004</xref>) and war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437380">Peltonen &amp; Punamäki, 2010</xref>). To tackle severe mental health problems, most certainly, it is urgent to expand interventions to include CBT-based methods with the focus on processing of traumatic experiences. They facilitate children’s cognitive-emotional and symbolic processes and narrative capacities, and results are generally favorable in decreasing PTSD symptoms among war-traumatized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437380">Peltonen &amp; Punamäki, 2010</xref>). However, results are mixed in the Palestinian context. A study showed that cognitive-behavioral crisis interventions failed to improve child mental health in acute life threat and military violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437380">Thabet, Vostanis, &amp; Karim, 2005</xref>), although there is evidence that children benefitted of interventions encouraging social and cultural capabilities, mastery, and action taking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612437380">Loughry et al. (2006)</xref> showed that structured extracurricular cultural and recreational activities and parent–child participation was successful in decreasing internalizing and externalizing problems among Palestinian children in less dangerous times.</p>
<p>We may cautiously suggest that by employing children’s own capability to take action, it is possible to make a difference in social domains of child welfare in highly dangerous conditions. The protective and healing power of companionship, sharing, and intimacy between peers experiencing similar hardships can be mobilized in interventions among children in war zones. A glimpse of experiences of a Palestinian pupil who volunteered as a mediator shows some group-dynamic changes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We noticed that children, particularly the weak ones, are asking for our help, particularly if they get harassed by other children. We provide security and protection for the children. The word <italic>mediator</italic> became a part of common language in our school. The message that conflicts, conspiring, and polarizations are not acceptable in the school anymore reached all students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The study can be criticized for relying solely on children’s self-reports as outcome variables. Evidence shows that using parents’ and teachers’ observations of children’s depressive and aggressive behavior differ: Adults perceive more aggression and less depression than children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612437380">Achenbach, 2006</xref>). Also, ideally methods basing on sociogram would have revealed more dynamic and reciprocal friendship and peer relationship qualities than self-reports. Furthermore, our research setting was not capable to answer the dismantling question about the most helpful method used in the school intervention. Thus whether they were the modeling of efficient conflict-resolution skills, defending the weaker peers or prosocial attitudes, remains inconclusive. We can only state that the intervention as a whole succeeded to create school atmosphere where the maintenance of existing friendships and prosocial attitudes toward peers were possible despite the traumatizing environment. Finally, our results might not be generalized to all children in armed conflicts or postconflict situation but may tell something specific about children who are forced to live in constant insecurity and danger.</p>
