<abstract>
<p>The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a powerful group contingency with a history of documented empirical support. The purpose of this study was to compare two interdependent group contingencies, the GBG and a positive variation, the Caught Being Good Game (CBGG), in a school implementing school-wide positive behavior support. A kindergarten and fourth-grade classroom teacher with 17 and 20 students, respectively, implemented both versions of the game in a counterbalanced fashion. Using a withdrawal design, results showed similar effects on disruptive and on-task behaviors. The CBGG is discussed as an effective variation of the GBG that is acceptable to both teachers and students.</p>

<p>School-wide positive behavior support (SWPBS) is a systems-level, multitiered approach to addressing discipline in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711421008">Horner, Sugai, Todd, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2005</xref>). Efforts to scale-up SWPBS nationally have been fueled by evidence supporting systemic approaches to behavior management and the numerous investigations promoting SWPBS as an effective practice for addressing discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300711421008">Bradshaw, Koth, Bevans, Ialongo &amp; Leaf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300711421008">McIntosh, Chard, Boland &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300711421008">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002</xref>). The outcomes associated with SWPBS implementation have included reductions in office discipline referrals and out-of-school suspensions, improvements in the proportion of students meeting state reading standards and improvements in overall school organizational health or climate (i.e., improved staff affiliation, collegial leadership and academic emphasis, among others; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300711421008">Bradshaw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300711421008">Horner et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite positive systemic-level outcomes, the implementation of SWPBS does not guarantee that daily, reciprocal interactions that occur repeatedly between teachers and students at the classroom level will also improve. The fact is that some educators simply do not bring the effective elements associated with SWPBS, including a focus on teaching and reinforcing expected behaviors, to the classroom level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300711421008">Chitiyo &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>). The reasons for failing to implement positive behavior support strategies at the class-wide level are varied. In addition to philosophical differences, including the use of positive reinforcement as a behavior change strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300711421008">Kohn, 1999</xref>), others may include teacher skill deficiency, a particularly difficult classroom environment or, in the worst-case scenario, a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Traditionally, concerns of low integrity associated with the use of effective behavior management strategies at the class-wide level have been addressed through training combined with various forms of feedback, including peer coaching and self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300711421008">Codding, Livanis, Pace, &amp; Vaca, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300711421008">Sutherland &amp; Wehby, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300711421008">Sutherland, Wehby, &amp; Copeland, 2000</xref>). However, when these strategies are insufficient, as sometimes occurs, a more robust class-wide intervention may be required to reduce the level of problem behavior. The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is one such intervention that has been repeatedly demonstrated to improve classroom teachers’ ability to effectively manage the classroom environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711421008">Tingstrom, Sterling-Turner, &amp; Wilczynski, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The GBG is a powerful interdependent group-oriented contingency. Since the first evaluation of the GBG almost 40 years ago to reduce the talking-out and out-of-seat behavior of a fourth-grade class during math and reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300711421008">Barrish, Saunders, &amp; Wolf, 1969</xref>), numerous replications have supported its effectiveness in addressing a variety of target behaviors and student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711421008">Tingstrom et al., 2006</xref>). For example, in addition to general and special education classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711421008">Lannie &amp; McCurdy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300711421008">Salend, Reynolds &amp; Coyle, 1989</xref>), the GBG has been used to increase appropriate behavior in other, nonclassroom settings within the school including the library and the school cafeteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300711421008">Fishbein &amp; Wasik, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300711421008">McCurdy, Lannie, &amp; Barnabas, 2009</xref>). The GBG has been implemented with preschool as well as secondary-level students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300711421008">Davies &amp; Witte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711421008">Swiezy, Matson, &amp; Box, 1992</xref>) and a variety of ethnic, rural, and urban populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711421008">Darveaux, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300711421008">Huber, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711421008">Lannie &amp; McCurdy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300711421008">Saigh &amp; Umar, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to addressing behavior in the classroom, more recent investigations of the GBG have focused on epidemiology. For example, Kellam and his associates demonstrated the positive impact of the GBG in reducing the aggressive behavior of the most aggressive first-grade children, an effect resulting in a reduced prevalence of conduct problems and lower rates of mental health service need and utilization that persisted into middle school and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300711421008">Ialongo, Poduska, Werthamer, &amp; Kellam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300711421008">Poducka et al., 2008</xref>). Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711421008">Eddy, Reid, and Fetrow (2000)</xref> and, later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300711421008">van Lier, Muthen, van der Sar, and Crijnen (2004)</xref> showed the GBG to be effective in preventing the development of disruptive behavior problems, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, and conduct problems, among a group of at-risk elementary school children.</p>
<p>Despite the supportive evidence base for the GBG, there are some disadvantages including undue peer pressure and the potential for elicited emotional effects associated with the use of response cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711421008">Tingstrom et al., 2006</xref>). The question remains as to whether there are equally effective variations of the intervention that can be implemented without the use of response cost and by focusing, instead, on the use of praise to reinforce desired behavior. One example may be the Caught Being Good Game (CBGG). The CBGG is an extension of the timer game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711421008">Wolf, Hanley, King, Lachowicz, &amp; Giles, 1970</xref>). As originally designed, the timer game required that the teacher set a timer to buzz in the classroom on a VI-20-min schedule. When the timer went off, the teacher scanned the room and awarded five points to any student who was on-task at the time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711421008">Swiezy et al. (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300711421008">Fishbein and Wasik (1981)</xref> modified the timer game to be more similar to the GBG by assigning points contingent on the entire group or team engaging in expected classroom behaviors during variable interval scans. However, despite its effectiveness, to date no studies comparing a positive variation and the traditional GBG have been conducted. The purpose of this study is to compare two interdependent group contingency strategies, the GBG and a positive variation game, the CBGG, to examine the relative effectiveness of each as a tool for class-wide behavior management, and to assess the relative teacher and student acceptability of both games.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1098300711421008">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in two general education classrooms in an elementary school that has been implementing SWPBS with fidelity since 2006. The district is located in a first-generation suburb of a larger urban area in the northeast United States. The school serves 607 students in Grades pre-kindergarten to 4 with 36% of the student population receiving free or reduced-price lunch. Recent statewide assessment results reported to meet No Child Left Behind accountability requirements show 63% of students in the school as proficient in language arts and literacy and 87% of students as proficient in mathematics.</p>
<p>Two teachers in the school were identified by administrators as experiencing difficulty with classroom management. Both teachers were certified to teach elementary education in their state but neither had acquired more than 3 years of teaching experience. After discussing the purpose of the project, both teachers agreed to participate and were trained to implement both the GBG and the CBGG. The teacher in Classroom 1 was female and taught a class of 9 male and 8 female kindergarten students. Kindergarten operated for a full day in a classroom space of approximately 40 feet by 40 feet. Students were assigned individual work spaces at one of four small tables. No more than five students were seated at one table.</p>
<p>Classroom 2 was a fourth-grade class of 10 male and 10 female students with a male teacher. The classroom was approximately 30 feet by 40 feet in size and contained 24 desks arranged in four groups of 6. Both teachers implemented the intervention (GBG or CBGG) on a daily basis during a 40-min language arts class period where independent seat work was typically assigned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098300711421008">
<title>Response Definitions and Measurement</title>
<p>Student disruptive behavior served as the primary dependent measure. Disruptive behaviors included both verbal (e.g., callouts, nonsanctioned talking to peers) and motor (out of seat, bending, physically contacting another student, drawing or writing, playing with objects) behaviors. Callouts were coded when the student made nonsanctioned comments or other audible sounds (e.g., whistling, humming). Talking to others was coded when the topic was unrelated to the academic situation and/or when talking was clearly prohibited by the teacher (e.g., “Everyone is to work quietly”). A student was considered out-of-seat when she or he was not seated with both feet on or toward the floor. Out-of-seat also included walking around the room, leaving the room, and standing at a table. Bending was coded when the student bent over to obtain a book bag or pick up a pencil. Physical contact with another student included touching another and passing nonacademic material. Drawing or writing was coded when it was not related to the academic work and not permitted. Playing with objects was coded when the student was playing with a pen, folding paper, playing with shoelaces, playing with hair, or writing on body parts.</p>
<p>The secondary dependent measure was on-task behavior. On-task behavior was defined as passive on-task and included the student attending to the teacher or assigned material (eyes oriented toward work or teacher) and active on-task included academically related writing (while looking at the paper), raising hand to respond to or ask a question, answering questions, looking through the assigned text, and/or reading aloud.</p>
<p>On-task and disruptive behaviors were measured using a combination of momentary time sampling and partial interval recording procedures. All observations were conducted during the 40-min language arts period by the experimenter (first author) and a second observer previously trained on the observation code. Data was collected in each classroom on a daily basis for 20 min. Starting with a randomly selected student, data collection involved the observation of one student for one 15-s interval. At the end of the interval, the experimenter observed the next student and continued in this manner, rotating from one student to the next, for 80 observation intervals. When each student in the class was observed, the experimenter started again with the first student and continued in this manner until the end of the 20-min session.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<sec id="section5-1098300711421008">
<title>Teacher training</title>
<p>Materials necessary for teacher training of both games included a teacher manual and script. The manual provided information on general operating procedures for both games (e.g., organization of the classroom into teams, development of game rules, definition and examples of target behaviors, and specific GBG and CBGG procedures). The script served as a prompt for the teacher in explaining the GBG and CBGG procedures to the students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1098300711421008">
<title>Game implementation</title>
<p>The following materials were required for daily implementation of the GBG and CBGG: game rules, daily and weekly score boards, point sheets, digital timer, and a procedural checklist. The daily and weekly score boards were divided into four quadrants with team names. Point sheets provided a space to log the date, start/stop time, and daily point criterion and space for the team point tally. A digital timer was used to ensure duration of the game. Materials for the CBGG condition included the materials as discussed above and an audio cueing computer program to signal the teacher at random intervals to scan for appropriate behavior. Daily and weekly tangible rewards (e.g., candy, pencils, and erasers) were provided to winning teams in both conditions.</p>

<sec id="section7-1098300711421008">
<title>Experimental Procedures</title>
<sec id="section8-1098300711421008">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Data was collected on student disruptive and on-task behaviors in Classrooms 1 and 2 during the language arts class periods while the students were engaged in teacher-led instruction or completing in-seat assignments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300711421008">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Following baseline, the teachers were trained by the primary investigator in the procedures to implement one of the game versions (CBGG or GBG). After reviewing the purpose of the specified game, training included the development of rules, teaching the rules, development of teams, assignment of points, determination of a winner(s), and distribution of rewards. Training included an opportunity to observe a model and engage in role-play with feedback. Training terminated when the classroom teacher met a criterion of 100% procedural integrity in a role-play test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1098300711421008">
<title>Game implementation</title>
<p>The teachers’ assigned condition, GBG or CBGG, was implemented once daily for the duration of the language arts class period. Initial condition assignment was determined by examiner coin toss. Prior to implementation, the teacher divided the class into four teams each containing three to five students. Teams selected a team name that was posted along with other team names on the score board. After initial explanation of the intervention condition to the class, the teacher signaled the start of the game to students.</p>
<p>In the GBG, following each teacher-observed occasion of student disruptive behavior (defined as out of seat, talking without permission, playing with objects, and not following directions), the teacher was instructed to assign a point to the team to which the student belongs. At the end of the period, the teacher tallied the points. The team(s) with point earnings not exceeding a preset mystery criterion earned a reward. Each team’s points were recorded daily on a chart that was posted in the classroom. Weekly, teams also had the opportunity to earn a reward if their point earnings remained below a weekly criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711421008">Lannie &amp; McCurdy, 2007</xref>). The primary mechanism of behavior change operating under the GBG condition included response cost (i.e., point assignment contingent on the display of undesirable behavior among any member of the group) combined with a DRL (differential reinforcement of low response rate) schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300711421008">Cooper, Heron, &amp; Heward, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The CBGG was implemented in a similar fashion as the GBG with the exception that to win the game, team point earnings had to meet or exceed the preset mystery criterion. In the CBGG, the teacher scanned the room based on a computer-generated audio cue occurring at random (VI-4-min) intervals. Teams were assigned points if all team members were on-task during the scan. Points were exchanged for a backup reward if they met or exceeded the preset mystery criterion number. Weekly, the teams had the opportunity to earn rewards if their points remained above an established weekly criterion. Unlike the GBG condition, the CBGG incorporated a variable-momentary DRO schedule to effect and maintain behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300711421008">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1098300711421008">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>An ABAC withdrawal design was used to evaluate the results of the experiment. The order of intervention was counterbalanced to control for carryover effects such that an ABAC design was used in Classroom 1 and an ACAB design in classroom 2. Phase changes occurred when a stable pattern of responding was observed for the primary dependent measure or the data trended in an undesired direction (during baseline or withdrawal phases).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1098300711421008">
<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>Interobserver Agreement (IOA) was collected for 30% of the observation sessions. Percentage agreement for student on-task and disruptive behaviors was calculated using an interval-by-interval method by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements and multiplying by 100. Mean IOA for student on-task behavior was 98.09% (range, 94.14%–100%) and 98.73% (range = 90.9%–100%) for disruptive behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1098300711421008">
<title>Treatment Integrity</title>
<p>Using a checklist of procedural steps, the experimenter documented teacher adherence to Game procedures. For the initiation of each Game condition, performance feedback was provided to the teacher on a daily basis following each session. Once the teacher met the criterion of 85% for two consecutive days, integrity measurement was reduced to once weekly with no feedback to the teacher. Following initial training, teacher implementation performance never fell below the 85% criterion for 2 consecutive days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1098300711421008">
<title>Treatment Acceptability</title>
<p>At the conclusion of each condition, both teachers completed the <italic>Intervention Rating Profile</italic> (IRP-15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711421008">Martens, Witt, Elliot, &amp; Darveaux, 1985</xref>). The IRP-15 contains 15 statements of intervention acceptability. The teachers responded to the statements indicating the degree of their agreement or disagreement with each item on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores on the scale are associated with acceptable interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711421008">Martens et al., 1985</xref>). The <italic>Children’s Intervention Rating Profile</italic> (CIRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300711421008">Turco &amp; Elliott, 1986</xref>) was used to evaluate student ratings of acceptability. Students in the fourth-grade classroom completed the CIRP with a 6-point rating scale (1 = <italic>I agree</italic>, 6 = <italic>I do not agree</italic>) and a possible total score range of 6 to 36. For developmental reasons, the CIRP was modified for the kindergarten classroom to simplify the response requirements. Students in the kindergarten classroom completed the CIRP with a 3-point rating scale (1 = <italic>I agree a lot</italic>, 2 = <italic>I agree a little</italic>, 3 = <italic>I do not agree</italic>) and a possible total score range of 6 to 18.</p>

During the withdrawal phase, a level change and countertherapeutic trends were evident for both on-task (<italic>M</italic> = 65.76) and disruptive (<italic>M</italic> = 51.27) behaviors. The implementation of the CBGG, following the withdrawal phase, resulted in a return to the previous intervention level for disruptive behavior (<italic>M</italic> = 27.78) only. On-task behavior (<italic>M</italic> = 77.85), although higher than during baseline conditions, remained lower for the CBGG condition than the GBG condition.</p>

Initial baseline levels of on-task (<italic>M</italic> = 74.19) and disruptive (<italic>M</italic> = 30.44) behaviors were relatively stable, with the slightest evidence of a countertherapeutic trend for both. The introduction of the CBGG resulted in a level and trend change for both on-task (<italic>M</italic> = 94.70) and disruptive (<italic>M</italic> = 12.35) behaviors. Student on-task behavior increased and showed little variability, whereas disruptive behavior decreased and continued on a decelerating trend.

With the implementation of the GBG, student disruptive behavior (<italic>M</italic> = 14.46) decreased to a low level and continued to decelerate and on-task behavior (<italic>M</italic> = 86.96) increased but, similar to the kindergarten classroom, not to the previous intervention level achieved with the CBGG.</p>

<p>Students also rated the GBG and CBGG as acceptable interventions. With a possible total score range of 6 to 18, kindergarten students provided low ratings, indicating greater acceptability, for both the GBG (<italic>M</italic> = 9.23) and CBGG (<italic>M</italic> = 9.13). Likewise, with a possible total score range of 6 to 36, fourth-grade students also rated the GBG (<italic>M</italic> = 14.00) and CBGG (<italic>M</italic> = 12.83) interventions as acceptable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current investigation demonstrates an interesting case study of two approaches, the GBG and CBGG, both of which seem to have similar effects on behavior and acceptability ratings. In both the kindergarten and fourth-grade classrooms, the initial implementation of a group contingency (either GBG or CBGG) resulted in a decrease in disruptive and a concomitant increase in on-task behaviors. Withdrawing the interventions resulted in a return to baseline levels for both behaviors. Finally, the reintroduction of the group contingency (either the GBG or CBGG) led to a decrease in disruptive behavior that mirrored the first intervention phase and a more modest improvement in on-task behavior. This was true whether the second intervention was the GBG or CBGG. Essentially, there was no difference in the effectiveness of the GBG or CBGG to affect disruptive behavior. Without being able to draw firm conclusions, the data suggest support of the interdependent group contingency literature, including the GBG and variations, showing decreases in disruptive and increases in on-task behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711421008">Darveaux, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711421008">Lannie &amp; McCurdy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300711421008">Tankersley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711421008">Wolf et al., 1970</xref>). Given the limited nature of this project including the number of demonstrations of basic effect (i.e., replications) and the number of classrooms, many avenues for future investigation have been identified.</p>
<p>Teacher and student ratings of acceptability for both the GBG and CBGG were similar and indicated that both interventions were acceptable. Interestingly, teacher ratings on the IRP-15 reported the condition implemented last as more acceptable. No differences were detected in student acceptability ratings. Student ratings were similar across both interventions as the mean scores for both interventions, as rated by the kindergarten and fourth-grade classrooms, were below the midpoint (kindergarten = 12, fourth grade = 21) of the possible range for total scores.</p>
<p>The current investigation extended the literature on the GBG by comparing it to a similar interdependent group contingency where points were assigned based on appropriate student behavior. It is unknown why on-task behavior did not increase during the replication of the group contingency intervention in each classroom, no matter whether the group contingency consisted of the GBG or its positive variation, the CBGG. One likely hypothesis is that the initial increase was due to novelty effects. Given that this study was the first time student participants experienced such an intervention, be it the GBG or CBGG, there may have been a stronger reaction. A second plausible hypothesis is related to the use of praise. The GBG, despite its powerful impact on reducing disruptive behavior, does not lead to increased teacher praise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711421008">Lannie &amp; McCurdy, 2007</xref>). There is preliminary evidence that the same holds true for the CBGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300711421008">Dullum, Jeffrey, &amp; McCurdy, 2009</xref>). It may be, then, that game components are sufficiently powerful to improve on-task rates during the first implementation of either the GBG or CBGG but that once the novelty wears off, teacher praise, or lack thereof, is not sufficient to maintain on-task rates at the previous level.</p>
<sec id="section19-1098300711421008">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although it appears that the interdependent group contingencies used in this investigation (GBG and CBGG) were equally effective, the design of the experiment precludes drawing a definitive conclusion. Time limitations imposed by the fast-approaching end of school year did not permit a replication of each condition within each classroom. Moreover, limiting the study to only two classrooms, while using a withdrawal design, did not allow for a counterbalancing of order at the classroom level. Future investigations comparing the GBG and CBGG should incorporate three classrooms and the use of an alternating treatments design in which multiple, counterbalanced replications of each intervention could take place within each classroom.</p>
<p>Another limitation is related to the differences in imposed schedules of punishment and reinforcement across both interventions. Although the stated purpose of the study was to compare two interdependent group contingencies that outwardly appear to simply impose different consequences (e.g., response cost/negative reinforcement vs. positive reinforcement), the reality is that these conditions also impose differing, and sometimes compound, schedules of reinforcement and punishment that may affect behavior in different ways. For example, in the GBG condition, the teacher attempts to impose a fixed ratio (FR 1) schedule of punishment by assigning a point for each display of nonsanctioned behavior while also providing reinforcement for low rates of behavior (DRL). The FR 1 schedule of punishment was the goal for the teacher to achieve, and it is not likely that they were able to catch/observe each occurrence of disruptive behavior; however, they were asked to do their best to assign a point for each observed occurrence of disruptive behavior. Alternately, in the CBGG condition, student behavior is reinforced on a variable-momentary DRO or possibly DRA schedule. Technically speaking, these two interventions should lead to differences in responding based solely on schedule effects. For example, an FR 1, or continuous, schedule should produce high rates of responding while a VI schedule will produce a low to moderate rate of responding that may be more consistent or stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300711421008">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>). Such differences were not observed in this experiment, likely because of the short lengths of each condition. Nevertheless, future studies comparing group contingencies, specifically the GBG and CBGG, should take into consideration the possibility of compound schedule effects.</p>
<p>Finally, it was noticed by the primary investigator that during the CBGG condition the audible signal to cue the teacher to scan the room also served as a cue for some of the students to initiate on-task behavior (prior to teacher observation). The result of this procedural artifact was likely an increase in the number of points awarded to groups. Quite possibly, a scallop effect might be anticipated in which disruptive behavior rates would begin to increase (while on-task rates decreased) immediately after the point award until the presence of the audible signal. However, because observer recording occurred continuously throughout the 20-min period, and there was no discernible difference in responding, it is unlikely that the audible signal produced an additive impact on the recording of target behaviors. Nevertheless, future investigations of the CBGG should incorporate private cueing signals to initiate teacher scanning in order to better understand the effects of this intervention.</p>
<p>The CBGG may be an acceptable alternative to the use of the traditional GBG in the context of a systemic application of SWPBS. Trainers and technical assistance specialists are less likely to confuse practitioners when promoting the CBGG as a class-wide PBS strategy. The intervention is designed to encourage and support positive behavior, aligns well with the basic premises of PBS and, like the GBG, is easily implemented by practitioners who may otherwise have difficulty adapting school-wide PBS strategies for the classroom level. However, before recommending the CBGG as a replacement for the GBG, particularly given the abundance of empirical support for the latter, additional research is recommended. Specifically, as previously mentioned, comparison studies of the CBGG and GBG are recommended incorporating designs that control for order effects across and within the classroom. In addition, researchers are encouraged to more rigorously evaluate the effects of the CBGG itself. For example, the impact of the CBGG should be evaluated in both regular and special education classrooms at a variety of grade levels. Classrooms in which children’s exposure to developmental risk factors are greater (e.g., urban classrooms) and/or there are more inexperienced teachers may also be targeted. Finally, since the CBGG is intended to emphasize a positive approach, greater attention should be given to examining the relationship to teacher praise as well as maintenance and generalization effects.</p>
