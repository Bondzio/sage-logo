<p>We come together to honour, in the sight of God, the life and work of the Revd Professor Daniel Wayne Hardy – Dan to those who knew and loved him. And we do so in the context of worship, where we have heard from the word of God, and will participate in the Eucharist – nothing could be more appropriate to the person we remember. Not only was his whole life theo-centric – a pointing away from himself to God – but also his commitment to the life of the mind, indeed his epistemology, was shaped by doxology: he found access to the truth in praise of the God of all creation; in worship he discerned ‘the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ’.</p>
<p>The last time I met him, last summer, there was a glow in his face, as he spoke of a special experience of light during a visit to the Holy Land. Already his brain tumour had been diagnosed, but ‘seeing the glory of the Lord’ – his face reflected it – he surely was in process of transformation from glory to glory … By all accounts Dan’s passing could be described as a ‘good death’ – a rare thing these days! It’s not difficult to imagine him in the temple, saying with Symeon,<disp-quote>
<p>Lord, now let your servant depart in peace;</p>
<p>Your Word has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>My own eyes have seen the salvation,</p>
<p>Which you have prepared in the sight of all people;</p>
<p>A light to reveal you to the nations,</p>
<p>And the glory of your people Israel.</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec1-0040571X12456666"><title>Life</title>
<p>Though rarely speaking of his own life, Dan would be the first to say that the particularities of the life lived is the place where God is met, that there is no substitute for those particularities, that abstractions cannot capture the history of God’s ways with the world, or with the person. He would doubtless add that the extensity of the story is not enough without the depth of its intensities, and the complex interweavings of its relationships. To do justice to all that in a few minutes is way beyond us but, despite his own reticence about his personal pilgrimage, to be true to Dan we cannot avoid giving a sketch of the particularities of his life.</p>
<p>He was born in New York in 1930. The genesis of his profound faith lay in his student experience at the Quaker foundation, Haverford College, though the Anglican form in which it was expressed had its roots earlier – in the liturgies shared at school. He decided to seek ordination, and trained at the General Theological Seminary in New York, where the daily services were, as he recently put it, an ‘invitation to go deeper into the intensity of God, an attraction that has perhaps been the most fundamental dynamic of my life’. He then served as Assistant Minister in Greenwich, Connecticut. There he met and married Kate Perrin Enyart, a key relationship at the heart of his life thereafter; together they had four children – his family was very important to Dan.</p>
<p>It was also there, in Connecticut, serving as a priest, helping to design a new church, and developing a youth group from 15 members to 120, that he discovered the absolute necessity of theology. He returned to the General Theological Seminary to teach. That only confirmed for him (I quote) ‘the crying need for theological thinking’, and he went on to Oxford for four years to study with Ian Ramsey and others. But Oxford, in the grip of the apologetics demanded by logical positivist philosophy, was a severe disappointment – his own assessment was that it was ‘rarely confident enough to explore the depths and wonders of God and God’s ways with the world’. Yet it was here that he had the opportunity to immerse himself in all kinds of reading and in sustained thinking, establishing a ‘rigorous pattern of study for about nine hours a day’. So, in Oxford and despite Oxford, he began to construct that extraordinary reservoir of learning from which he would draw as he challenged standard, current approaches to theology and carved out his own re-conception of the subject.</p>
<p>In 1965 Dan took up his first academic post, teaching in the Department of Theology in Birmingham. He was there for twenty-one years – I joined him in 1971, David Ford in 1976. Both of us found his colleagueship an immense privilege.</p>
<p>I guess all of us, Dan included, profited enormously from the extraordinary intellectual freedom we were given by our Head of Department. The old style of theological syllabus was whittled away as Gordon Davies both led us and encouraged us in pioneering directions. We liked to believe we were streets ahead of the older universities, and I can only deduce that we were, from the way Cambridge has stolen one Birmingham luminary after another.</p>
<p>In all this Dan was a key figure. Modern and Systematic Theology began to have a role way beyond anything elsewhere in England at the time. The classic topics of the Philosophy of Religion were challenged; the dominance of historical theology questioned; yet, when religious studies became fashionable elsewhere, Dan, the passionate theologian, joined forces with biblical studies to resist Birmingham following the trend. He was after a ‘third way’, neither confessional nor neutral, seeking truth, committed not only to God but also to reason, open and critical, searching for an adequate conceptuality, one true to reality, true to the diversity and complex interweaving of things as we know them, true to the intellectual disciplines whereby human beings have discovered some understanding of them – science, philosophy, history, social science, economics, literature and literary criticism, culture and the arts, especially poetry and music – you name it … His horizons were immense.</p>
<p>Years later here in Cambridge he would describe theology as ‘the thinking of the dynamic “architecture” of the constancy of the reality of the living God, as the vital and moral source of the ordered energies of the world and human life in all the rich variety with which cosmology, ontology, sociality, human character, culture, symbols and religion exemplify’.</p>
<p>Meanwhile this vast vision generated a sustained critique of generally accepted norms and approaches to the subject. Students were either utterly unable to understand what Dan was getting at or deeply attracted, as he reworked his courses year by year, seeking, as he himself put it, ‘a theology that might give dedicated attention both to the intensity of God and to the way the world is, especially as described, interpreted and explained by theologians, philosophers and scientists since the sixteenth century’. And I know a Cambridge-educated theologian who found herself disturbed out of fundamental assumptions in ways that became increasingly creative – about the historico-critical presuppositions with which biblical interpretation was conducted; I was puzzled to be faced with interpretative insights drawn from modern economics (how anachronistic can you get?), about the way we scholars presume to sit in judgement on the Scriptures rather than submitting to the judgement of God mediated through the text – could we really be so clear about God and God’s involvement? Back then I rather doubted it. Dan offered a comprehensive challenge to empirical bottom-up theology, to biblical criticism’s limitation of itself to what he described as an archaeological approach, to theology’s capture by the prevailing culture.</p>
<p>In 1986 Dan moved to the Van Mildert Professorship of Divinity in the University of Durham and a canonry in Durham Cathedral. After those twenty-one years in an explicitly secular university, his job reintegrated daily worship with academic work, something I know he valued. In Birmingham he had exercised his priesthood in a parish, and had taken on important and innovative roles in the diocese and the Church of England, the latter related to theological education for clergy. But now the very nature of the Church became an academic preoccupation. There would be two further moves in his life – five years back in the States as Director of the Princeton Center of Theological Enquiry. Then retirement – though I guess that’s hardly the right description – here in Cambridge. It was in retirement that publication of the fruits of his intense theological journey began. Yet, through most of his active career, the extraordinary reputation of this priestly theologian did not rest on publications. Wise people discerned the integrity of his intellectual search, his gift for building up institutions, his profound commitment to people, especially students.</p>
<p>So he had repeated opportunities to be a catalyst. If, sometimes, he felt he was ploughing a lone furrow against the trends of contemporary theological interests, the fact is that his influence has been extraordinary and, if we are to turn to consider his legacy, that is where we must begin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X12456666"><title>Legacy</title>
<p>For we who are gathered here constitute his principal legacy. What he did and meant as a theologian is less enshrined in books than in students and colleagues, in Birmingham, Durham and Cambridge, not to mention the members of the Society for the Study of Theology, the Center for Theological Enquiry and latterly those Jews, Christians and Muslims involved in the development of Scriptural Reasoning.</p>
<p>A former student was kind enough to respond to my request for some reminiscences – I did warn him he’d be quoted! I’m sure he speaks for many others in describing Dan as a dominating influence on his intellectual development. He expresses immense gratitude for Dan’s courses on Modern Theological Thought – seeing them as<disp-quote>
<p>a foundation for later engagement with the giants of twentieth-century theology, who tend to assume that their readers are already familiar with Kant, Hegel and the rest. Dan was giving us a chance to be aware of the complex narrative of modern Western intellectual history, and what it means to think about God in it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>He confesses that only later did he realize how prominence given to some characters in the story (Coleridge, for example) indicated something of Dan’s own approach to all that.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more telling is what he says about Dan as a doctoral supervisor:<disp-quote>
<p>[H]e was unquestionably demanding. A stranger to superficiality himself, he had a keen eye for anything trivial, any unsupported assertions or unquestioned assumptions. That could be intimidating for those of us who were all too aware that we were unlikely ever to meet Dan’s high standards. But the rigour was accompanied by what I can only describe as a priestly pastoral concern. For Dan, theological thinking was part of the whole of life and he was interested in the whole person.</p>
<p>Sometimes I was impatient to settle down to a focused topic on which to write, but I am now glad for the philosophical and theological spadework Dan asked me to do. I think he was more interested in training people to be theologians than he was in getting people to write on a narrowly defined topic.</p>
<p>The abiding memory of Dan as a supervisor is his vision of theology as vocation and discipleship. He would have no patience with the all-too-prevalent idea that intellectually rigorous theology and Christian discipleship were two separate channels.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Yes, we are grateful for the books, lest we forget, and so that others not so privileged as we are may find a glimmering of what Dan’s theology was about. In the books we can trace leading ideas that keep recurring, that profound sense of the dynamism and diversity of things and the superabundant richness of God, whose dynamism is to be discerned in the world; that call to wisdom, to exploring the shape of God, and God’s covenant with us; that interest in the nature and fabric of creation, in all its complexity; that celebration of goodness and truth wherever it is to be found, and the call to realize goodness in our historical and social existence; that deep resistance to separating things out, to the compartmentalization of knowledge and methodological simplification, to all kinds of dualisms or binary oppositions, to the whole process of arguing the kind of thesis which involves abstracting a particular line and so reducing the holistic complex in which things are intricately and inextricably interwoven – such an approach is worked out, in dense papers and surprisingly accessible sermons, in relation to the Trinity, to the created world, to human society, to education and the academy, to the nature of theology, above all to the Bible, which is not reducible to propositions or a moral code.</p>
<p>From cosmology to anthropology, from universals to the finest details, his explorations are at multiple levels, surprising and stretching, turning topics in totally unexpected directions – an exemplification of what he saw was needed – creativity in response to the creative dynamic of God’s abundance.</p>
<p>But even the books are largely collections of occasional pieces. Characteristic of Dan’s immensely profound engagement with Theology was the fact that he could never rest in a position – everything was constantly reworked, reconceived from first principles, as he engaged and re-engaged with the thought of others – so his approach could never be confined within what we now have in written form …</p>
<p>In the complex interweaving of things, Dan was himself the link between diverse networks, the spider at the heart of the web, the generator of wisdom in others, the ultimate teacher, the everlasting searcher … We are his principal legacy.</p>
<p>To celebrate saints’ days and commemorate those who had died, the Fathers of the Church adapted the techniques of the ancient art of encomium; one such technique was <italic>syncrisis</italic> – in other words, they would explore, sometimes startling, exemplary comparisons. I shall not resist the temptation to do likewise! We might compare Dan with Socrates – Dan was a stimulator, one who worked through the medium of face-to-face dialectic, testing and questioning, suggesting and rethinking, never content with a system, never arriving at definitive conclusions, always on the move and moving with his conversation partners. I guess we all craved his approval, yet more often found ourselves willing to take his criticism, because time and again it would generate for us new things of lasting value in our own theological journey.</p>
<p>Typical is this final reminiscence from that former student:<disp-quote>
<p>Like all other members of SST [Society for the Study of Theology], I will miss Dan’s perennial habit of asking the ‘killer question’ at the end of a plenary session. On one occasion, after an hour of discussion in which the whole conference seemed bogged down in complex and unresolved argument, Dan rose to his feet and told us, ‘I’m afraid it’s nowhere near as simple as you all seem to think’!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Socrates, Dan probably needs both a Plato and a Xenophon; whether or not that kind of tribute emerges on paper, his legacy rests with us, with our testimony. That is our responsibility.</p>
<p>Then we might compare Dan to Augustine – not of course with respect to the vast extant written remains of that great Christian thinker but rather in that restless search, that engagement with contemporary philosophy, science, ethics and literary method, that willingness to move on and rethink while betraying deep continuities in conception, and sustained moral commitments, that immersion in Scripture, that priestly and pastoral focus on the building up of the Body of Christ, that overriding focus on God.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Psalms, Augustine once wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Singing to God is singing ‘with jubilation’ … Think of people singing as they go about some hot and exhausting job – at harvest-time, say, or in the vineyard. They start celebrating in their happiness with the words of familiar songs. But they end up turning away from words and syllables, as if they were filled with so much happiness that they couldn’t put it into words. And off they go into the noise of ‘jubilation’. This kind of singing is a sound which means that the heart is giving birth to something it cannot speak of. And who better to receive such ‘jubilation’ than the ineffable God – ineffable because you cannot talk about Him … So when do we ‘jubilate’? When we praise what we cannot speak of. (Quoted by Rowan Williams, <italic>The Wound of Knowledge</italic>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I can imagine Dan saying something very like that. His priestly ministry to us is to lead us in the way of jubilation as the way of knowing God. His legacy rests with us, with our following in his steps.</p>
<p>We must end by taking some of Dan’s words to heart. First, a challenge for the future – on overcoming interreligious alienation: ‘For Christians that will mean accounting for the “otherness” of others … as an aspect of the provenance of the dynamic activity of the Triune God which calls all not only to difference but to love. And that will demand the facing of a theological task which few envisage as yet.’</p>
<p>Then: ‘It is possible to live in earnest desire, that is a rational, passionate intensity of heart, soul, mind and strength through which we constantly find intimations of the deeper treasures of the wisdom of God.’</p>
<p>Again: ‘[God’s holiness] is a highly dynamic and healing “holiness”, well beyond simple … [or] bland conceptions of “knowing God” through “God’s self-communication”. [Such deficient theologies] avoid the refining fire of the holiness in God and in the Cross of Christ.’</p>
<p>And again: ‘God is most God where in the utmost love he enters most deeply into our life, in the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus into which we are drawn by the Holy Spirit. There … God lives through the extremities of our life – our sin, our self-isolation and our death – and is still most near to us.’</p>
<p>Then, as we approach the Eucharist: ‘Like drama, the Eucharist is a patterning of particulars – particular people in a particular setting in a particular timescale, in which the various dimensions and connections of their life in the world are infolded, within dramatic actions – in order to signify the reality of their intrinsic connection to the inner dynamic of God’s holiness … What occurs in this performative event of signification is the refining holiness of God in Christ as performative in all that we do in our enactment of goodness with each other and with the world.’</p>
<p>And let me leave you with some words of Coleridge, to whom Dan acknowledged such a debt:<disp-quote>
<p>He prayeth well, who loveth well</p>
<p>Both man and bird and beast.</p>
<p>He prayeth best who loveth best</p>
<p>All things both great and small;</p>
<p>For the dear God, who loveth us,</p>
<p>He made and loveth all.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Amen.</p>
