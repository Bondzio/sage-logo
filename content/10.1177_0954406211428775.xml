<abstract>
<p>This article deals with the effects of parameters relating to the yield drop phenomenon on the deformation of Taylor projectiles. The numerical modelling approach performed using LS-DYNA was validated by considering a solid cylindrical projectile made of AA7010 aluminium alloy impacted against a massive, rigid target as described in the literature. Both the projectile and target were modelled using three-dimensional brick elements. A popular strain rate and temperature-dependent constitutive relation known as the Johnson–Cook model was used to represent the alloy projectile material behaviour, whilst the target plate was assumed to be rigid. A generally good agreement between test and numerical results was found. A steel projectile was then considered using a simple piecewise linear plasticity model which has provision for introducing the yield drop effect and in which temperature effects were ignored. The impact velocities varied from 200 to 1000 m/s. Significant influence of the yield drop on the deformation behaviour of the projectile at low impact velocities was found. However, the effect was far less significant at higher impact velocities (&gt;400 m/s).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211428775" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Taylor projectile impact test was initially developed for assessing the high-strain rate dynamic compressive yield stress of materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211428775">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211428775">2</xref></sup> Taylor’s original approach consists of firing a cylindrical solid projectile against a massive, rigid target. The front part of this projectile expands radially or 'mushrooms'; however, the rear part of the projectile is left undeformed. By considering the deformed and undeformed profiles of the Taylor projectile and the initial impact velocity, a minimum value for dynamic yield stress can be determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211428775">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, one of the main purposes of the Taylor’s test has been to validate the constitutive relations used in explicit finite element solvers such as LS-DYNA and ABAQUS/Explicit by comparing the predicted post-impact deformation behaviour of the Taylor projectile with experiment. Forde et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211428775">3</xref></sup> outlined the use of symmetric Taylor impact tests for the validation of constitutive models of copper and Rolled Homogeneous Armour steel. They also made predictions of rod/projectile deformation profiles using the Armstrong–Zerilli constitutive model within a Lagrangian finite element code and found excellent correlation between test and computed results for both materials. Teng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211428775">4</xref></sup> studied the Taylor impact test through numerical simulations using ABAQUS/Explicit for two different materials, 2024-T351 aluminium alloy and Weldox E460 steel. The impact velocities varied from 240 to 600 m/s and the Johnson–Cook material model was used to describe the stress–strain data of the test materials. The investigators observed a number of cracks in the material due to circumferential tensile stress wave propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211428775">4</xref></sup> Taylor testing of tungsten alloy was considered using both experimental and numerical approaches by Couque and Cazenave.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211428775">5</xref></sup> The effect of projectile size was studied and it was found that an increase in specimen length implies an increase in final-to-initial diameter ratios associated with an increase of the effective plastic strain at the impact face.</p>
<p>In a very different field from that of Taylor impact testing, simulations of chip formation during high-speed machining of metals, such as carbon steels have indicated the significant influence of the inclusion of an upper yield point in the description of initial yielding. Without such inclusion, it has been found that the cutting and thrust forces and chip thickness ratio predicted by simulations do not simultaneously agree with experimental results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211428775">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211428775">10</xref></sup> This statement applies to machining at typical cutting speeds used in industry. Such speeds, typically 100 to 500 m/min, lead to strain rates in the chip formation zone in the range 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and to a time duration of loading of the material, as it approaches the deformation zone of the order of 10<sup>−4</sup> s. As long ago as the 1960s, it was suggested that such short loading times affect the material deformation characteristics. It was noted that speeds &gt;100 m/min resulted in very different chip formation characteristics than speeds &lt;0.5 m/min (when loading times are &gt;10<sup>−2</sup> s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211428775">11</xref></sup> The range of times from &gt;10<sup>−2</sup> to &lt;10<sup>−4</sup> s is the range over which the yield delay and yield point phenomena become significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211428775">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211428775">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>These short time durations and high-strain rates are also typical of deformations during the Taylor test, and it is interesting to investigate whether the yield drop phenomenon affects the deformation of such projectiles. Hence, this article studies the effects of parameters relating to the yield drop phenomenon on the deformation of steel projectiles when fired against a rigid target. The numerical modelling approach was first validated by considering a solid cylindrical projectile made of AA7010 alloy impacted against a massive, rigid target and a comparison was made between test data and numerical results. A mild steel projectile was then considered using a simple piecewise linear plasticity model which has provision for introducing the yield drop effect and in which temperature effects were ignored. Several different material models and a range of impact velocities between 200 and 1000 m/s were considered.</p>

Both projectile and target plate were modelled using three-dimensional solid elements. A general contact interface algorithm was defined between the projectile and the target plate and frictional effects at the interface were also considered. The values assumed for the static and dynamic frictional coefficients were 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. A popular strain rate and temperature-dependent model (i.e. Johnson–Cook material model) available in LS-DYNA was used to represent the stress–strain data of the projectile alloy material as defined in the following section.

<p>The objective of this section is to determine a suitable element size which will yield reliable results. With this aim in mind, the Taylor projectile was meshed using solid element sizes of 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 3 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1 × 4 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211428775">Figure 2</xref>. For this comparison, an impact velocity of 200 m/s was assumed as per the study of Vili Panov.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211428775">1</xref></sup> The smallest time step required for these analyses based on the minimum element dimension is 1.22 × 10<sup>−8</sup> s.

<p>The ratio of final to original diameters of projectiles with distance from the impact end for the various mesh densities is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211428775">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that significant differences exist between the results for the various mesh densities with the finer mesh densities expected to give the more reliable results. However, there was little difference in the deformed profiles between the 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> element sizes, indicating that convergence of the numerical solution had been achieved. Therefore, the 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> element size was considered suitable for the subsequent analyses due to its computational efficiency.

<p>The post-test and post-simulation geometries of the projectile are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211428775">Figure 4</xref>, which indicates good general correlation of the deformed profile between test and simulation for the 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> element mesh.

In the experiment, some ovalisation of the profile was observed due to the anisotropy of the plate material from which the specimens were machined. Hence, results are presented for both the major and minor axes of the cross-section. For the simulation, no such ovalisation was observed since the material is assumed to be isotropic. Nevertheless, the simulation results agree well with the corresponding test data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211428775">1</xref></sup> especially near the impact face for this fine mesh density. Hence, both the mesh density and other parameters of the simulation such as the frictional contact conditions were considered suitable for the present class of problems.

<p>This section aims to compare the results of the simulations for two different material models. The piecewise linear plasticity model available in LS-DYNA is an elasto-plastic material model with an arbitrary stress versus strain curve and the ability to define arbitrary strain rate dependency. Also, failure based on a plastic strain limit or a minimum time step size can be defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211428775">14</xref></sup> The stress–strain behaviour may be treated as a bilinear stress–strain curve by defining an initial elastic modulus and the plastic tangent modulus. In the present analysis, quasi-static mechanical properties of the AA7010 alloy were obtained from the study of Vili Panov.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211428775">1</xref></sup> The stress–strain data for different strain rates were computed using the scaling formula given in the study of Raguraman et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211428775">15</xref></sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211428775">Figure 6</xref>.

<p>A yield drop usually occurs only for ferritic materials. Hence, mild steel projectiles have been selected to study the effect of yield drop phenomenon rather than the aluminium alloy used for the above validation.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211428775"><title>Material modelling</title>
<p>Although the Johnson–Cook material model is a popular relation to define the strain rate and temperature dependency of a material in numerical simulations, it does not have provision for describing the yield drop phenomenon which is of prime interest in this study. Hence, the alternative piecewise linear plasticity model available in LS-DYNA has been used to study the effects of an upper yield point and the yield drop phenomenon on the deformation behaviour of a steel Taylor projectile. Due to the constraints of the model, thermal softening due to any adiabatic temperature rise was ignored.</p>
<p>The piecewise linear plasticity model is an elasto-plastic material model with a piecewise linear stress versus strain curve and the ability to define arbitrary strain rate dependency. Also, failure based on a plastic strain limit or a minimum time step size can be defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211428775">14</xref></sup> The stress–strain behaviour may be treated as a simple bilinear stress–strain curve by defining an initial elastic modulus and the plastic tangent modulus. In the present analysis, mild steel designated as MS1 in the study of Raguraman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211428775">16</xref></sup> has been considered as the projectile material. The true stress–strain data at various strain rates obtained from the study of Raguraman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211428775">16</xref></sup> are used to form the material model, which is reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211428775">Figure 8</xref>(a). An initial much higher yield stress and subsequent drop in the flow stress back to the standard stress–strain curve were then introduced at various strain rates, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211428775">Figure 8</xref>(b). Initially, an arbitrary value of upper yield point (i.e. 1000 MPa) at quasi-static strain rates was assumed with the yield drop occurring at a strain of about 0.01. Values for other strain rates were computed using the scaling approach outlined in the study of Raguraman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211428775">16</xref></sup> A mild steel Taylor projectile of 9.30 mm diameter and 46.5 mm length was considered in the present analysis. In order to investigate the effect of impact velocity, the velocity was varied from 200 to 1000 m/s in steps of 200 m/s.

<p>For further validation of the present numerical scheme, the procedure outlined in ‘Effect of element size on deformation of AA7010 alloy projectiles’ section was repeated to study the effect of element size on the deformation behaviour of mild steel projectiles, impacting against a rigid barrier at an impact velocity of 200 m/s. As before, the projectile was meshed using solid element sizes of 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 3 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1 × 4 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>. The piecewise linear plasticity algorithm shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211428775">Figure 8</xref> was used to represent the stress–strain behaviour of the material, initially without any yield drop condition.</p>
<p>The ratio of final to original diameters of the projectile with distance from the impact end for the different mesh densities is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211428775">Figure 9</xref>. It can be seen that significant differences exist between the different mesh density results. However, the results for the element sizes of 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> are again very close to each other, indicating convergence of the numerical solution. Therefore, for reasons of computational efficiency, the element size of 1 × 2 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> was considered as a suitable mesh density for the subsequent study of the effect of the yield drop phenomenon.

<p>The final simulation profiles with and without yield drop conditions for an impact velocity of 200 m/s are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211428775">Figure 10</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. Although the two cases appear qualitatively quite similar, some detailed differences in the profiles are apparent. The final-to-original diameter ratios against distance from impact end is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211428775">Figure 11</xref> for both no yield and yield drop conditions. For the no yield drop condition, the final deformed diameter at the impact face is lower and the deformation profile extends further from the impact end towards the free end. However, in the case of yield drop, the deformed diameter at the impact face is significantly greater and the extent of the plastic deformation along the length of the projectile is much reduced. Thus, there is a significant and measurable effect on the deformation of Taylor projectile due to the introduction of the yield drop phenomenon at this impact speed.

<p>The deformation profiles at higher impact velocities ranging from 400 to 1000 m/s for different times after impact are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211428775">Figure 12</xref>. A much greater ‘mushrooming’ effect at the impact face is apparent, especially at 1000 m/s. To understand this behaviour more clearly, a comparison of original-to-final diameter ratios at different locations from the impact end for the different impact velocities is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211428775">Figure 13</xref>. It can be seen that the difference in the deformation behaviour between the no yield drop and yield drop conditions becomes far less significant for higher impact velocities. This is because the deformation becomes increasingly dominated by the post-yield response and inertial effects, rather than the initial yield conditions that are influential at the lower impact velocity of 200 m/s.

<sec id="sec9-0954406211428775"><title>Effect of magnitude of initial upper yield point</title>
<p>In order to study the effect of magnitude of the initial upper yield point in the yield drop definition, two different values of initial upper yield point, namely 1000 and 1500 MPa, were considered in the analysis. The numerical scheme outlined earlier was kept unchanged and the simulation was carried out for impact velocities of 200 and 1000 m/s. The ratio of final to original diameters with distance from the impact end for both 1000 and 1500 MPa cases is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211428775">Figure 14</xref>. It can be seen that there is no significant change in the diameter ratio for these two cases. However, the magnitude of the initial upper yield point may have more significant effect when it is closer in value to the lower yield stress.

<p>A numerical study of the effect of the yield drop phenomenon on the deformation behaviour of Taylor projectiles has been carried out. Good agreement between test and simulation results was found for a trial aluminium projectile with a suitably refined mesh. Having validated the numerical procedure, the effect of the yield drop phenomenon was studied using a simple piecewise linear plasticity model for mild steel which has provision for introducing the yield drop effect and in which temperature effects were ignored. A significant influence of the yield drop phenomenon on the deformation behaviour of the projectile at low impact velocities of the order of 200 m/s was found. However, the effect was far less significant at higher impact velocities (&gt;400 m/s). It is concluded that the yield drop phenomenon may have an important influence on the numerical analysis of high-strain rate deformations and this should be apparent in the final deformed profile of Taylor impact test specimens impacted at moderate impact velocities. The Taylor test may, therefore, be a suitable means of investigating this phenomenon.</p>
