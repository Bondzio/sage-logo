<abstract>
<p>Endogenous digitalis-like factors (EDLFs) appear to be hypertensiogenic and increased in the serum and placenta of women with preeclampsia (PE), a complication of pregnancy. Digibind, an anti-digoxin antibody Fab fragment, reverses in vitro effects of EDLF and in vivo features of PE. We used Digibind in a radioimmunoassay to measure EDLF and compared this to a bio-functional assay of EDLF with good agreement. These methods confirmed that human placenta was a source of EDLF, synthesizing and releasing EDLF into the media of cultured human placental tissue. Ketoconazole, a steroid synthesis inhibitor, and 17-OH progesterone, a possible substrate of steroid synthesis, were shown to inhibit or increase EDLF release respectively, suggesting overlap of synthetic pathways. Abnormalities of PE such as placental hypoxia, increased reactive oxygen species and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines were demonstrated to increase placental EDLF release. These findings strongly support placental production of EDLF with increased release due to features of PE. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) may now be the leading cause of death among pregnant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424441">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424441">2</xref></sup> Hypertension and proteinuria in the second half of pregnancy are still used to diagnose this disorder, but generalized edema, hyperuricemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic changes, and/or elevated liver enzymes can also occur and often herald more severe forms of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424441">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424441">2</xref></sup> Preeclampsia occurs more often in first pregnancies and in women who are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111424441">3</xref></sup> Additionally, PE frequently leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and is a leading cause of preterm delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111424441">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Many abnormalities have been reported in established PE, but the relation of each of these abnormalities to the cause or intermediate pathophysiology of PE is still unknown.  One abnormality frequently seen, which may precede clinically established disease, is generalized damage to the maternal vascular endothelium.  These changes appear weeks earlier in pregnancies destined to develop PE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424441">2</xref></sup> Such injury is accompanied by the release of markers of endothelial dysfunction, including proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell surface adhesion molecules, and locally acting modulators of vascular tone, secondary to the original damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424441">5</xref></sup> Since the causes of PE are incompletely known, there is no direct way to test if or when PE will occur, and no effective treatment to prevent or treat PE.  When it is severe, even if it occurs early in the pregnancy, the only effective treatment is to deliver the fetus in order to protect the mother.  Clearly, better understanding of the early changes preceding clinically established disease might allow for more effective therapies.</p>
<p>As to the earliest physiologic events that lead to PE, there is evidence to suggest that PE begins as a pregnancy complicated by early placental dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111424441">6</xref></sup> Current thinking is that PE is, at least in part, due to an incomplete adaptation of maternal spiral arteries that supply blood, with its oxygen and nutrients, to the fetal–placental unit.  This is thought to result in underperfusion, hypoxia, placental damage with local release of ROS and proinflammatory mediators, including activation of leukocytes and platelets, increasing circulating cytokine levels, for example tumor necrosis factor-α  (TNF-α), interferon-γ, and interleukin 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424441">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111424441">8</xref></sup> These in turn may lead to more generalized effects on placental, fetal, and maternal endothelial function, causing a more exaggerated inflammatory response with evidence of broader maternal, and perhaps fetal, oxidative stress potentially accounting for the endothelial damage evident in the mother with clinical disease. </p>
<p>An additional abnormality found in women with PE is an elevation in the circulating level of endogenous “digitalis-like” factors (EDLFs) that appear to be native inhibitors of [Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>]ATPase (also termed the sodium pump, SP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111424441">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111424441"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424441"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111424441">12</xref></sup> Additionally, these factors have been shown to cross-react with digoxin, ouabain, and other cardiac glycoside antibodies, suggesting strongly that EDLFs are compounds structurally related to digoxin, ouabain, bufalin, proscillaridin A, and/or marinobufagenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111424441">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111424441">14</xref></sup> However, the exact structure of the circulating factor in PE is unknown.  Endogenous digitalis-like factors, which share biological and immunological properties with known cardiotonic drugs, such as digoxin, have been found in a number of tissues and body fluids of animals and humans. Previous research has indicated that increased levels of EDLF may be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of essential, some secondary and experimental hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111424441">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424441"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111424441">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although elevated levels of immunologically detected EDLFs are found both in normal pregnancy and in pregnancy complicated by PE, nonetheless EDLF levels in PE are substantially higher than in normal pregnancy.  This raises the possibility that EDLFs might play a role in the pathophysiology of PE.  Given the central role of the placenta in the development of PE, it is of potential importance that we and others have provided evidence for placental EDLFs.</p>
<p>Digibind is a commercially available Fab fragment derived from polyclonal antidigoxin antibodies raised in sheep.  It is used for the treatment of digoxin overdose and accompanying toxicity by binding digoxin and making digoxin unavailable for binding to the [Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>]ATPase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424441">18</xref></sup> The Digibind–digoxin complex accumulates in the blood and is excreted by the kidney.  The net effect is to shift the equilibrium away from the binding of digoxin to its receptors in the body, reversing its effects.  In experimental models of hypertension with elevated EDLF levels, Digibind has been demonstrated to lower blood pressure, providing evidence that the antibody cross-reacts with and inactivates EDLF. This is supported by a much larger in vitro literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424441">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111424441">17</xref></sup> These observations support the hypothesis that Digibind might improve some of the symptoms of PE, especially hypertension, and it could be a potential therapy for PE.  This has been recently tested in a clinical trial of Digibind in women with severe PE with positive results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424441">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that EDLF was structurally the steroidal glycoside digoxin or an analogue having an unsaturated lactone ring that it is synthesized by the isoprenoid/steroid pathway, a very complex route that involves multiple steps.  For this research, key intermediates of an endogenous digoxin synthetic pathway would be of interest.  Previous studies of steroid synthesis have demonstrated that ketoconazole is a general inhibitor of cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes, which block gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis by inhibiting several cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111424441">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424441">21</xref></sup> It also inhibits cholesterol synthesis in humans by blocking the conversion of methyl sterols to cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111424441">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424441">23</xref></sup> In this study, we postulate that ketoconazole and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, an intermediate of steroidogenesis, would alter EDLF production and thereby provide evidence that the EDLF synthetic pathway may include enzymes utilized in steroid synthesis.  Having clear, unambiguous evidence for tissue synthesis and a reliable tissue source of 1 or more EDLFs would represent a major milestone in this field. </p>
<p>If research could identify a tissue source of EDLF production, it would then be possible to provide a greater understanding of EDLF synthesis in response to factors that may affect that production.  Such a demonstration of regulated secretion of EDLFs in response to factors thought to mediate PE would represent a marked advance in this research.  It would also help to integrate EDLF into the overall context of PE and other hypertensive diseases.  Hypoxia, oxidative stress, and cytokines have all been shown to be increased in PE, and we hypothesize that these factors that will modulate EDLF production.  Our results are presented below.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1933719111424441">
<title>Placental Homogenate Preparation</title>
<p>For these initial studies, placentas were obtained from both normal and preeclamptic pregnancies immediately after delivery and a full thickness cut (∼2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm) was removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until later processing and assay.  Placental pieces were shaved into flakes using a surgical blade and tissue flakes were placed into a Sartorius Mikro Dismembrator stainless steel cylinder along with 15 stainless steel balls. The entire cylinder, including contents, was submerged in liquid nitrogen for 4 to 5 minutes.  After the thorough freezing of the cylinder contents, the cylinder was placed in the Sartorius ball mill and shaken at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The process of submersion and shaking was repeated until the contents became a fine powder.  The placental homogenate was transferred from the cylinder to a 50-mL conical tube and the volume was brought up to 5 mL by adding deionized H<sub>2</sub>O.  To remove protein, 2 volumes of methanol (10 mL) were added gradually to the homogenate while the mixture was vortexed continuously for 5 minutes.  The placental sample mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm to remove the precipitated proteins.  The supernatant was transferred to a new conical tube and dried overnight in vacuo to remove residual methanol.  Then, the volume was brought back to the original volume of 5 mL using deionized H<sub>2</sub>O.  The placental homogenate was stored at −80°C for further processing and assay.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719111424441">
<title>Placental Explant Culture and Conditioned Medium Collection</title>
<p>For these studies, placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies were obtained immediately after delivery and 4 to 5 small tissue pieces (∼5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm) were cutoff from the inner fetal side.  The tissue pieces were dissected into tiny pieces with sterilized scissors.  Any visible clots and blood vessels were removed with sterilized tweezers.  The remaining villi were washed repeatedly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove blood from the intervillous space.  Villous tissue of ∼5 mg/well was then patted dry by sterilized paper towel and incubated in a 6-well cell culture plate with 5 mL of serum-free DMEM (Gibson, Grand Island, New York) containing 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL amphotericin B (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) per well for 48 hours at 37°C in an incubator gassed with 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole (Sigma; 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 µmol/L),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111424441">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424441">21</xref></sup> 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone (Sigma; 200, 500, 1, and 2 µmol/L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111424441">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111424441">25</xref></sup> or pregnenolone (Steraloids Inc, Newport, Rhode Island; 2 µmol/L), human TNF-α (Sigma; 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 nmol/L), or hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, New Jersey; 1, 5, 10, and 20 nmol/L) were added to the tissue culture individually at the beginning of incubation.  Time course experiments (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours) were performed to study the effect of the potential substrate 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. For the low O<sub>2</sub> culture experiments, the culture plates were placed in a portable air chamber (Billups-Rothernberg, Del Mar, California) flushed daily with a gas containing 2% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, 93% nitrogen (Airgas AcuGrav, Salt Lake City, Utah) for up to 48 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111424441">26</xref></sup> The chamber was housed inside a regular incubator to maintain the temperature of 37°C.  At the end of incubation, samples of the culture medium were collected in 15 mL conical tubes and any residual villi were removed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was stored at −80°C as conditioned medium until later processing and assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719111424441">
<title>Digibind Radioimmunoassay</title>
<p>After the homogenization and tissue culture processes, the homogenate and conditioned media samples were collected and assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA).  Digibind (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) was used as the primary antibody anti-EDLF/ouabain and a rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulin (IgG) Fab fragment antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, Pennsylvania) was used as the secondary antibody. Digibind represents the Fab fragments of an anti-digoxin antisera produced in sheep and used therapeutically to counteract digoxin overdose in humans. Tritiated ouabain (30.0 Ci/mmol; Perkin Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts) was used as a tracer. Cold ouabain solutions at graded concentrations were used as standards. A 100 μL aliquot of specimen or standard ouabain solution (50 nmol/L, 0.1 µmol/L, 0.2 µmol/L, 0.5 µmol/L, 1 µmol/L, and 3 µmol/L), plus 50 µL of a 2.22 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L tritiated ouabain solution, 300 µL of 1.8 µg/mL Digibind solution, 60 µL of 2.12 × 10<sup>−7</sup> mol/L 2° Ab solution, and 10 µL of 10 mmol/L pH 7.4 Tris buffer were combined and mixed well, then allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight to allow antigen–antibody binding. For the assay of conditioned media, because samples contained DMEM medium, 100 µL of DMEM were added to the reaction solutions for each standard and 100 µL of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O were added to reaction solutions for bringing the specimens to the same volume. Endogenous digitalis-like factor in the several conditioned media/homogenate specimens or standard cold ouabain in the calibrating solutions competed with the labeled ouabain for Digibind and then the 2° antibody was added to bind to the 1° antibody–antigen complex to decrease its solubility. After the overnight incubation, 563 µL of 16% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, California) was added to each reaction solution to precipitate the antibody–antigen complex.  After centrifugation at 13 200 rpm for 30 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 500 µL of .05 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Then 4 mL of Ecoscint, a scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, Georgia), was added to the resuspended solution, and the mixture was measured by scintillation counter to determine EDLF concentration.  All individual specimens were assayed in duplicate. </p>
<p>Digoxin was not used as the competing tracer because its affinity was significantly higher than ouabian or EDLF and was unusable for these purposes.  Ouabain and the EDLF were sufficiently similar in their binding affinity to the digoxin antibody Fab to allow for competition. This led to EDLF quantity being expressed as nmol/L ouabain equivalents. When other candidate EDLFs were tested in the RIA, bufalin bound more tightly and had a 719% cross-reactivity (ie, 10<sup>−7 </sup>mol/L bufalin appeared as 7.19 × 10<sup>−6 </sup>mol/L ouabain) and proscillardin A had a 174% cross-reactivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719111424441">
<title>Progesterone Experiment</title>
<p>In order to ensure that results of Digibind RIA represented EDLF levels, we tested the effect of progesterone, the main placental sterol, on the assay.  A volume of 20 µL progesterone solution at graded concentrations (final concentration 1.00 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mol/L, 1.00 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L and 1.00 × 10<sup>−7</sup> mol/L), 100 µL of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, 100 µL of conditioned medium sample, 50 µL of tritiated ouabain solution, 300 µL of Digibind solution, 60 µL of 2° Ab solution, and 10 µL of 10 mmol/L pH 7.4 Tris buffer were combined and mixed well. Reaction solutions containing 20 µL of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O instead of progesterone solution were used as negative controls. Mixture solutions were incubated, precipitated, and analyzed as described in the Digibind RIA procedure.</p>

<title>Lipid Hydroperoxide and TNF-α Determination Assays</title>
<p>Conditioned media from placental explants cultured with hydrogen peroxide or under low O<sub>2</sub> conditions were collected and assayed by a lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan) and a human TNF-α Quantikine ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Mineapolis, Minnesota) following the manufacturers’ methods to determine the levels of lipid oxidation.</p>

<sec id="section8-1933719111424441">
<title>Rubidium Uptake Using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry</title>
<p>This represents a functional bioassay of EDLF.  Conditioned media containing EDLF released from cultured placental tissues were assayed by Digibind RIA as described above to determine apparent EDLF concentration. Concommitantly, the same samples were assayed by cell Rb<sup>+</sup> uptake using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAA, model 4100Z, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts) that measures [Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>]ATPase–dependent rubidium (Rb<sup>+</sup>) transport into fresh human red blood cells (RBCs).  Ouabain was used in this assay to achieve complete inhibition of the [Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>]ATPase activity.  Blood was collected from nonpregnant healthy volunteers into EDTA-containing tubes, left to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove the plasma.  The remaining RBCs were washed with 2 volumes (10 mL) of RbCl buffer (containing NaCl 135 mmol/L, RbCl 6.73 mmol/L, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 8.10 mmol/L, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 1.27 mmol/L, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.0 mmol/L, pH 7.45, omitting K<sup>+</sup>), 3 times vortexing for 5 minutes before recollecting the cells by centrifuging at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes.  After washing, a 10% hematocrit (Hct) RBC solution was prepared and 800 µL of this 10% Hct RBC solution, 100 µL of conditioned media sample or control (ouabain at 1.00 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mol/L final concentration) with and without 100 µL of Digibind solution (1.00 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mol/L final concentration) were mixed in an Eppendorf tube and rocked in an incubator at 37°C at 220 rpm for 45 minutes to allow the Rb<sup>+</sup> ion uptake into the cells.  After incubation, each bioassay solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to isolate the RBCs from the RbCl buffer.  The RBCs were then washed by adding 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (containing choline chloride 149 mmol/L, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.0 mmol/L, 3(N-morpholino) propane sulfonic acid (MOPS) 5.88 mmol/L, Tris 2.12 mmol/L, pH 7.40) and centrifuged again to remove residual extracellular Rb<sup>+</sup>.  This washing process was repeated 3 times.  Cells were lysed by the addition of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, centrifuged to remove cell ghosts (4000 rpm), and stored at −80°C overnight.  Rubidium uptake into the cells was then measured by standard operation of a GFAA instrument to determine the ability of EDLF to inhibit [Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>]ATPase-mediated ion transport.  Before the GFAA step, 10 µL of the isolated cytosol from the RBCs were diluted to 500 µL with deionized H<sub>2</sub>O from which the autosampler of the GFAA injected 10 µL for Rb<sup>+</sup> ion quantitation.  All samples were assayed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Results are reported as the mean <underline>±</underline> 1 standard error of the mean (SEM).  Comparisons of the EDLF measured by RIA with EDLF measured by the GFAA Rb<sup>+</sup> ion uptake assay were carried out by means of Pearson product–moment correlation analysis.  Effects of time or concentration on EDLF release from placental tissue were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Dunnett pairwise comparisons.  Comparisons involving 2 groups were carried out by 2-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test if data were normally distributed or by Wilcoxon test.  A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant. </p>

<title>Endogenous Digitalis-Like Factor–Specific Immunoassay Employing Digibind</title>
<p>A clinical trial, termed the DEEP Trial, done in conjunction with our laboratory, suggested that women with PE who had increased serum EDLF levels experienced clinical benefit with Digibind compared with placebo treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424441">19</xref></sup> Moreover, recent research also points to EDLFs present in both serum and placenta from women with PE being bound and inactivated by Digibind.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111424441">27</xref></sup> Because Digibind recognizes and binds the active EDLF found in PE, we developed an RIA using Digibind as the primary antibody.  The assay then measures the same EDLFs endogenous to PE women which it would bind and inactivate as part of Digibind therapy.  Hence, this assay serves as a probe to identify women having observable serum EDLF and which consequently should respond to Digibind treatment, that is a theranostic test.  Using tritiated ouabain as tracer, a standard curve was developed using graded concentrations of nonradiolabeled ouabain as standards.</p>
<p>After development of the assay, it was important to demonstrate that the antibody assay result for EDLF abundance correlated with the results from our functional bioassay that assays the levels of EDLF by the degree of cell SP inhibition produced.  Using the Digibind RIA, EDLF has been measured in the serum of pregnant women with PE.  Some women had substantially higher concentrations of EDLF than others (data not shown).  This assay was also successfully applied to the measurement of EDLFs in placental homogenates. </p>
<p>Using this novel RIA assay, 11 conditioned media specimens assayed by both Digibind RIA and by SP inhibition of red cell Rb uptake demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between these 2 assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111424441">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>R</italic>

<p>Data indicated that protein-depleted placental homogenates from women with PE appeared to have higher EDLF levels than levels found in PE sera, sometimes much higher.  This observation suggested that placenta might be a source of EDLF.  As was found with PE serum, some pregnant women had substantially higher placental concentrations of EDLF than others.  Moreover, comparison of EDLF concentrations in placental homogenates from women with PE to those from women with uncomplicated pregnancies showed that PE placentas had increased tissue EDLF levels and this difference between normal and PE homogenates was still significant even with sequential dilutions of the specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424441">Figure 2</xref>; neat serum, PE 32.88 ± 14.63 vs control [CTL] 7.44 ± 1.15 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, <italic>P</italic> = .0002; 1:2 dilution, PE 20.76 ± 11.29 vs  CTL 6.28 ± 0.85 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, <italic>P</italic> = .002; 1:3 dilution, PE 16.96 ± 9.12 vs CTL 5.04 ± 0.50 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, <italic>P</italic> = .002; 1:4 dilution, PE 15.61 ± 11.47 vs CTL 4.17 ± 0.54 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain controls, <italic>P</italic> = .02).  This study and the previous comparing the 2 assays provided evidence that the placenta was a source of EDLF and that the RIA employing Digibind as the antibody appropriately measured EDLF in placenta and had adequate sensitivity.</p>

<title>Endogenous Digitalis-Like Factor Synthesis and Synthetic Pathway in Placenta</title>
<p>In addition to identifying placenta as a source of EDLF in PE, it was also of interest to provide greater understanding of its tissue production, including an indication of what pathways may be involved in its production. Current evidence suggests that EDLF is a sterol and consequently its synthetic pathway may well share steps with the steroid synthetic pathway.  There are known substrates of these pathways and also some agents that can block some of the enzymes involved. </p>
<p>To clarify whether EDLFs required steps in the steroid synthesis pathway, we carried out initial experiments using ketoconazole, an agent that blocks steroid synthesis generally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111424441">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424441">21</xref></sup> When this drug was applied to explanted placental tissue, it caused a marked reduction in EDLF production and release into the culture media in a dose-dependent manner.  In more detailed studies involving dissection of fresh placenta into maternal and fetal tissues, a more elaborate differential profile was obtained.  In the fetal tissues of normal human placenta, there was a significant decrease in EDLF production in response to ketoconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424441">Figure 3A</xref>, with graded increasing concentrations of ketoconazole, respectively [1.0 µmol/L] 7.99 ± 13.21, [2.0 µmol/L] 5.58 ± 8.91, [5.0 µmol/L] 1.60 ± 1.62, [10.0 µmol/L] 1.47 ± 1.64, [20.0 µmol/L] 1.25 ± 1.43 vs control levels 17.78 ± 33.21 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L RIA ouabain equivalents; ANOVA of the fractional change; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the maternal tissues showed substantially less production under these conditions and little change or if anything a small increase in EDLF production with 48 hours of ketoconazole treatment compared with untreated tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424441">Figure 3B</xref>, with graded increasing concentrations of ketoconazole, respectively [1.0 µmol/L] 1.90 ± 2.05, [2.0 µmol/L] 1.79 ± 1.96, [5.0 µmol/L] 1.83 ± 2.03, [10.0 µmol/L] 1.73 ± 1.82, [20.0 µmol/L 2.46 ± 2.60 vs control 1.23 ± 1.41 × 10<sup>−8</sup> M RIA ouabain equivalents; ANOVA of the fractional change, <italic>P</italic> = .51).  Basal fetal EDLF levels were higher than basal maternal levels (<italic>P</italic> = .03).  These results confirm the feasibility of this approach and further suggest that ketoconazole had a pronounced inhibitory effect on EDLF production and release. </p>

<p>In an effort to assess whether EDLF production involves enzymes used in steroid synthesis, factors that may serve as precursors or intermediates of steroid synthesis and hence may increase EDLF synthesis and release were tested.  Hence, we tested 2 possible steroid precursors that may identify steps common to both synthetic pathways.  Initially, we applied graded concentrations of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17P) to placental tissue culture.  This particular steroid was chosen because placenta is reported to lack a 17-hydroylase enzyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111424441">33</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424441">Figure 4</xref> shows that 48 hours of 17P treatment resulted in elevated levels of EDLF released into the culture media in a dose-dependent manner, with increasing concentrations of 17P respectively (0.20 µmol/L) 3.60 ± 1.06, (0.50 µmol/L) 3.76 ± 0.84, (1.0 µmol/L) 4.40 ±1.12, (2.0 µmol/L) 4.91 ± 1.52 vs control 2.28 ± 0.41 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents; ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> = .003, with concentrations 1.0 and 2.0 µmol/L being significantly greater than control, Dunnett test).  In order to further characterize its role in EDLF synthesis, time-dependent experiments were also carried out using an optimal concentration (2.0 µmol/L) of the 17P.  Control specimens in the absence of 17P showed that EDLF in the medium increased with longer incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424441">Figure 5A</xref>; n = 5, 6 hours 8.76 ± 2.56; 12 hours 23.70 ± 6.92; 24 hours 39.32 ±14.76; 36 hours 67.59 ± 26.89; 48 hours 81.38 ± 18.77 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).  Moreover, addition of 17P to the culture media enhanced the accumulation of EDLF in culture in a time-dependent manner with significantly more EDLF produced at each time point compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424441">Figure 5B</xref>; n = 5, 6 hours 12.60 ± 3.81, 12 hours 28.30 ± 6.30, 24 hours 55.39 ± 33.62, 36 hours 95.00 ± 40.44, 48 hours 132.43 ± 74.37 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 ANOVA for trend and <italic>P</italic> = .03 for comparison of the effect of the area under the curve (AUC) of 17P vs the AUC with no 17P).  These results strongly suggest that 17P had an effect on placental EDLF synthesis.</p>

<title>Regulation of EDLF Release From Placenta</title>
<p>Preeclamsia is attended by many abnormalities.  Among those considered mechanistically important are placental hypoxia, increased production of ROS, and greater local and circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines.  Consequently, there was interest in knowing the effects of such factors on placental EDLF production and release.</p>

<p>Because oxidative stress has been shown to be increased in PE, we thus used hydrogen peroxide, an ROS, to treat placental tissue in culture and assayed the media to reveal the effects on EDLF release to the media.  By analyzing specimens from 6 individual placentas treated with graded concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we found that 5 nmol/L of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the amount to induce maximal EDLF production and release. This concentration resulted in a near doubling of the quantity of released EDLF compared with the conditioned media from untreated placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1933719111424441">Figure 8</xref>; 4.87 ± 1.57 vs 2.82 ± 0.60 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L ouabain equivalents, <italic>P</italic> = .009).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The direct mediators of hypertension associated with PE are at best incompletely understood.  Endogenous digitalis-like factors have been strongly implicated as potential hypertensinogenic factors in essential and experimental hypertension and have also been found to be increased in the setting of PE.<sup>9-17</sup> They are attractive candidates because they are systemic in their actions and relatively long lived.  They increase peripheral vascular resistance while potentially maintaining cardiac output.  Also, if a placental or fetal source could be demonstrated, it might explain the rapid disappearance of EDLFs from the maternal circulation after delivery and a rapid resolution to these women’s hypertension postpartum.  Given our own and other’s previous studies providing evidence for EDLFs in placental homogenates, we sought to determine whether the placenta might produce and secrete such factors and if so, then further clarify whether production might be altered by conditions and biochemical alterations known to exist in women with PE.</p>
<p>The studies reported here provide strong evidence that human placenta is not only an enriched source of EDLF but that it synthesizes and releases EDLF into conditioned media.  The presence of these secreted EDLFs has been demonstrated by both an antibody assay and by a functional assay measuring SP inhibition. We developed this Digibind-based RIA in order to employ an antibody that has established selectivity for EDLFs.  Moreover, further studies applying both RIA and GFAA in our laboratory suggested that ketoconazole is an inhibitor of EDLF production in placenta, whereas 17α-hydroxyprogesterone may be a substrate or lead to a substrate, or may be converted into a hormone that upregulates EDLF synthesis. Their effects were dose dependent. These results cannot be explained by high levels of either 17-OH progesterone or progesterone because these had negligible cross-reactivity with this antibody and do not inhibit SP activity at the levels used here. </p>
<p>The experiments with pregnenolone in their own way suggest that the steroid synthetic pathway may be involved in the production of EDLF.  It is clear that application of pregnenolone to the explanted placental tissues reduced EDLF production after 6 hours. We do not have an explanation for this, however, published studies point to the absence of a 17-hydroxylase enzyme in human placenta and this may be important for the conversion of intermediates into EDLF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719111424441">34</xref></sup> Also, other studies point out that the 3β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that converts pregnenolone into progesterone requires continued addition of NAD<sup>+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111424441">35</xref></sup> This was not done here, and it is possible that this led to limited production and ultimately to a drop in the intermediates, leading to EDLF.  There is some evidence that increased pregnenolone or progesterone or their metabolites can lead to downregulation of certain steroid synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111424441">36</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>If the first hypothesis, that EDLFs were synthesized and secreted by human placenta, was verified, we then predicted that factors known to be altered in women with PE might affect EDLF production. For those familiar with the field of PE research, it is evident that one could choose any of hundreds of described abnormalities associated with PE.  However, there are a few well-established abnormalities found in PE that are considered part of the pathologic process.  These include placental hypoxia, oxidative stress mediated by ROS and endothelial damage and activation with release of proinflammatory cytokines. We have chosen 1 representation of each.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia appears to result in placental and fetal hypoxia, which is a potent stimulus of endothelial dysfunction.<sup>2,6-8</sup> In this article, we demonstrated that both 24 hours and 48 hours of hypoxia (2% O<sub>2</sub>) treatment appeared to induce modest increases in EDLF production and release from placenta in tissue culture.  In both situations, the increase was small and its significance is unknown.  It should be noted that we were working with tissue explants and not plated cells, hence, 21% O<sub>2</sub> may not diffuse efficiently throughout the tissue.  If that is true, which it likely is, then 21% O<sub>2</sub> may still yield relatively hypoxic tissues and may reduce the differences between conditions.  Further study will be needed to elucidate these observations.  Also, the EDLF levels were lower at 48 hours, suggesting that the tissue may not be entirely healthy after 48 hours at this very low O<sub>2</sub> concentration or that the synthetic mechanisms are dramatically curtailed as the tissue experiences prolonged oxygen starvation.</p>
<p>Clinical evidence shows that markers of oxidative stress in placenta are elevated in PE.  Here we tested the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on EDLF production and found that a low concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could stimulate EDLF production and release from healthy human placental tissue placed in culture.  However, higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not supplement EDLF levels further.  The changes in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were much more pronounced than those observed with low O<sub>2</sub>.  The ROS findings are consistent with the hypoxia findings discussed above and further demonstrate that these abnormalities associated with PE can regulate EDLF synthesis and release through 1 or more of the complex pathways they initiate.  Multiple steps with multiple intermediate factors are almost certainly involved in these 2 EDLF responses.  All of this awaits further clarification.</p>
<p>Endothelial dysfunction is a central pathophysiologic feature of PE. Altered endothelial function involves, among other things, an exaggerated inflammatory response in PE, including increased circulating cytokine levels of TNF-α.  Our research provides strong evidence that TNF-α stimulates human placental EDLF production and release in a dose-dependent manner.  Therefore, proinflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF-α, might represent an important initiating factor in pathogenic processes leading to PE and indeed some of these alterations may be mediated by EDLF in response to cytokines.  In addition, the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and TNF-α on placenta appear to be independent, given that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not stimulate TNF-α.  All of the above findings provide some insight into how EDLF synthesis might be reduced as a possible future therapeutic approach.  In addition, because of the very low quantities of EDLF in serum, the ability to isolate and identify the factors has been very challenging.  Agents, such as these, that result in increased and accumulating EDLF concentrations could open up possibilities to overcome this limitation.</p>
<p>Realistically, this study only opens the door to a complete understanding of the EDLF synthetic pathway and its regulation.  This is undoubtedly a complex route involving multiple intermediates, enzymes, and regulatory factors.   Fortunately, we have developed a very sensitive and specific assay using Digibind that can be used as a tool to detect EDLF levels in serum, placenta homogenates, and tissue culture.  Nevertheless, this work provides evidence of EDLF tissue production, suggestions as to the pathways involved, and added insight into how EDLF may fit into the larger context of PE.</p>
