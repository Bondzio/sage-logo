<abstract>
<p>Previous investigations suggest that temporary deafness can have a dramatic impact on audiovisual speech processing. The aim of this study was to test whether temporary deafness disturbs other multisensory processes in adults. A nonspeech task involving an audiotactile illusion was administered to a group of normally hearing individuals and a group of individuals who had been temporarily auditorily deprived. Members of this latter group had their auditory detection thresholds restored to normal levels through the use of a cochlear implant. Control conditions revealed that auditory and tactile discrimination capabilities were identical in the two groups. However, whereas normally hearing individuals integrated auditory and tactile information, so that they experienced the audiotactile illusion, individuals who had been temporarily deprived did not. Given the basic nature of the task, failure to integrate multisensory information could not be explained by the use of the cochlear implant. Thus, the results suggest that normally anticipated audiotactile interactions are disturbed following temporary deafness.</p>

<p>Recent experiments have shown that blindness caused by congenital bilateral cataracts during the first 5 months of life results in permanent deficits in multisensory integration capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612471142">Putzar, Goerendt, Lange, Rösler, &amp; Röder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612471142">Putzar, Hötting, &amp; Röder, 2010</xref>). These experiments with children treated for congenital bilateral cataracts following varying periods of visual deprivation shed light on the role of visual inputs in the normal development of audiovisual speech processing. The results show that visual input is necessary not only for early development but also for full maturation of these important processes.</p>
<p>The effects of temporary auditory deprivation on multisensory processing have also received some attention. Auditory detection thresholds can sometimes be restored via a cochlear implant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612471142">Ponton et al., 1996</xref>). Auditory processing with a cochlear implant happens without delay, allowing individuals to detect sounds at normal levels in real time, although the fine structure of the sounds is essentially lost in the process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612471142">Drennan &amp; Rubinstein, 2008</xref>). This device, which replaces the function of the inner ear, has allowed researchers to ascertain the consequences of temporary deafness on multisensory processing. The ability of temporarily deaf individuals (i.e., formerly deaf individuals whose hearing has been restored) to fuse incongruent audiovisual speech information has been studied over the past decade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612471142">Schorr, Fox, Wassenhove, and Knudsen (2005)</xref> used McGurk-like stimuli, which have incongruent lip movements that can induce the misperception of spoken syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612471142">McGurk &amp; MacDonald, 1976</xref>), to investigate temporarily deaf children’s ability to integrate incongruent multisensory cues. Performance was essentially normal in children who received their implants by age 2½ years, but audiovisual fusion was reduced in children who had their audition restored later in life. Since this study, these results have been replicated in temporarily deaf individuals of various ages and using a number of audiovisual tasks involving speech elements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612471142">Desai, Stickney, &amp; Zeng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612471142">Rouger, Fraysse, Deguine, &amp; Barone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612471142">Rouger et al., 2007</xref>). This body of research suggests that temporary profound deafness that occurs in adulthood might also have a dramatic impact on audiovisual speech processing.</p>
<p>It is too early to affirm that temporary deafness can have an effect on multisensory processing in general because the previously used tasks focused exclusively on interactions between auditory and visual input. Moreover, the auditory input always consisted of speech stimuli. In individuals with a cochlear implant, speech recognition performance, unlike auditory detection capability, is highly variable and unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612471142">Green, Katiri, Faulkner, &amp; Rosen, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612471142">Schwartz (2010)</xref>, it is unclear whether performance differences in audiovisual-speech fusion tasks reflect differences in integration per se or are merely the consequence of differences in unisensory perception. Given that some cochlear-implant users have a reduced ability to recognize auditory speech stimuli, it is not surprising that some deaf individuals who use implants rely more on visual than on auditory cues in audiovisual-speech tasks (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612471142">Landry et al., 2012</xref>). Such intersubject variability in the recognition of speech components makes it difficult to interpret observed differences in multisensory integration. Thus, the impact of temporary auditory deprivation (and other important events) on multisensory integration in humans remains uncertain.</p>
<p>To determine whether temporary deafness can have an impact on the development of multisensory processes, researchers need to examine the performance of temporarily deaf individuals in other sensory modalities (e.g., an audiotactile task) and in tasks that can more precisely match unisensory capabilities across groups and individuals. In the study reported here, we used the audiotactile illusory-flash effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting &amp; Röder, 2004</xref>), in which the simultaneous presentation of a somatosensory stimulus with a larger number of successive nonspeech sounds can lead to the perception of as many tactile as auditory sensations in normally hearing individuals. In addition to testing discrimination of nonspeech sounds presented with tactile stimuli, we included unisensory control conditions that allowed us to establish proper unisensory functions in these two domains independently from multisensory abilities.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 15 temporarily deaf individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612471142">Table 1</xref>) and 15 normally hearing individuals who were matched to the temporarily deaf participants on handedness, sex, and age. The temporarily deaf individuals (4 male, 11 female; mean age = 45 years, range = 22–65 years) had lost their hearing for a period of 13 to 53 years. The groups were comparable with respect to their educational background and occupational status. All temporarily deaf participants had previously experienced profound bilateral hearing loss (pure-tone detection thresholds ≥ 80 dB hearing level at octave frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 8 kHz). Speech recognition performance was assessed in temporarily deaf individuals using a phonetically balanced French word list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612471142">Benfante et al., 1966</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612471142">Table 1</xref>). Their principal method of communication was oral, using lipreading. At the time of the study, all temporarily deaf individuals, and the matched control subjects, had pure-tone detection thresholds within normal limits (≤ 30 dB hearing level at octave frequencies ranging from 250 to 6000 Hz). The Research Ethics Board of the Université de Montréal approved the study, and all the participants provided written informed consent.</p>

<title>Procedure, stimuli, and design</title>
<p>First, participants’ tactile and auditory capabilities were measured, to ensure that the groups had equivalent unisensory abilities. A static two-point discrimination evaluation was used to test innervation. Five one-point contacts and five two-point contacts at a set distance were presented in random order on the index finger. For each two-point distance, participants were required to correctly identify the number of points on 7 of the 10 trials. All eligible participants were confirmed to possess normal to fair (criterion met for two-point distances between 6 and 10 mm) innervation density on the right index finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797612471142">Warwick, Dunn, Melikyan, &amp; Vadher, 2009</xref>). Tactile sensitivity thresholds were tested using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612471142">Bell-Krotoski &amp; Tomancik, 1987</xref>). All participants were able to detect a pressure of 2.83 g/mm<sup>2</sup> on their right index fingers.</p>
<p>Two additional tactile evaluations were conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612471142">Table 2</xref>). Tactile resolution of the right index finger was tested using a grating-orientation task in which domes of varying grating widths were presented in descending order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612471142">Van Boven &amp; Johnson, 1994</xref>). Participants were asked to assess each dome’s orientation as either parallel with or perpendicular to their right index finger, using only tactile cues. The smallest grating width at which participants correctly identified the orientation on 75% of trials was then determined. Mean vibrotactile discrimination thresholds were calculated using a 2-down, 1-up staircase method. The task was to report whether two consecutive vibrotactile stimuli presented to the right index finger were identical or different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612471142">Alary et al., 2009</xref>). No significant differences were found between groups in the grating-orientation task, <italic>t</italic>(28) = −0.077, <italic>p</italic> = .939, <italic>d</italic> = −0.29, or the vibrotactile discrimination task, <italic>t</italic>(28) = −1.151, <italic>p</italic> = .259, <italic>d</italic> = −0.44.</p>

<p>An auditory discrimination task based on the audiotactile task was used to ensure that all participants were able to discriminate different series of successively presented auditory stimuli. This task also served as one of our control conditions. Ten trials each of one, two, three, or four auditory stimuli (2100 Hz, 10-ms duration, 100 ms between stimuli) were presented in random order. The stimuli were delivered at a comfortable level (60–70 dB hearing level) via attenuating circumaural headphones (10 S/DC, David Clark, Worcester, MA). For the temporarily deaf individuals, the headphones were positioned in a normal fashion with the speaker over the cochlear implant’s microphone located behind the helix of the pinna. To simulate the same aural environment as in the audiotactile task, we used a white-noise generator to create background noise. Participants were instructed to report the number of auditory stimuli on each trial. This task was presented on a computer running a custom cognitive evaluation program using PsyScope software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612471142">Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, &amp; Provost, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The stimuli and procedure for the audiotactile task followed the method used previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting and Röder (2004)</xref>. Participants sat in front of a computer that was running a custom cognitive evaluation program on PsyScope and placed the index finger of their dominant hand on a tactile stimulator. Background noise (70 dB SPL) was generated using a white-noise generator in order to mask any auditory hints emanating from the tactile stimulator. Before the experiment, participants were asked if they were able to guess the number of tactile stimuli without having their finger on the tactile device. This precaution was taken to ensure that participants could not hear any auditory hints produced by the device. Tactile stimulations were delivered at a suprathreshold level using a bone conduction transducer (Madsen Electronics 03204, Otometrics, Taastrup, Denmark). Auditory stimuli were delivered via headphones in the same manner as described for the auditory discrimination task.</p>
<p>Twelve trial types were presented, 25 times each. One tactile stimulus was paired with zero, one, two, three, or four auditory stimuli; two tactile stimuli were paired with zero, one, or two auditory stimuli; three tactile stimuli were paired with zero or one auditory stimulus; and four tactile stimuli were also paired with zero or one auditory stimulus. Trials with no or one auditory stimulus were used as control conditions. The trials with two auditory and two tactile stimuli were used as filler trials. The 300 trials were performed over five blocks of 60 trials, with trial types in random order. Auditory stimulation (2100 Hz, 10-ms stimuli), when present, was simultaneous with tactile stimulation (1000 Hz, 50-ms stimuli). Within a trial, the interstimulus interval was 100 ms for auditory stimuli and 200 ms for tactile stimuli. As per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting and Röder (2004)</xref>, the first auditory stimulation preceded the first tactile stimulation by 25 ms. Participants were instructed to ignore auditory stimuli and to report the number of tactile stimuli by pressing the number “1,” “2,” “3,” or “4” on the computer keyboard with their nondominant hand. All degrees of freedom and <italic>p</italic> values associated with the analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction when Mauchly’s test of sphericity was significant.</p>

<p>The ability to accurately identify the number of tactile stimuli when no auditory stimuli were presented was also similar in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612471142">Fig. 1b</xref>). An ANOVA with group (control or temporarily deaf) as a between-subjects factor and number of tactile stimuli (one, two, three, or four) as a within-subjects factor revealed that the main effect of the number of tactile stimuli was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1.93, 54.027) = 2,435.811, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .989.

<p>Following a previous suggestion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting &amp; Röder, 2004</xref>), we analyzed judgments of the perceived number of tactile stimuli in trials with no auditory stimulus and trials with one auditory stimulus, to investigate whether the presentation of a tone had an effect on participants’ judgment of the number of tactile stimuli presented (e.g., attentional effect). In this ANOVA, group (control or temporarily deaf) was a between-subjects factor, and trial type (eight types: no auditory stimulus with one, two, three, or four tactile stimuli and one auditory stimulus with one, two, three, or four tactile stimuli) was a within-subjects factor. The analysis revealed that both groups were able to discriminate between differing numbers of tactile stimuli and that the main effect of trial type was significant, <italic>F</italic>(2.320, 64.957) = 1,358.829, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<italic><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .980.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612471142">Figure 2</xref> presents the average performance of each group on trials with one tactile stimulus as a function of the number of auditory stimuli (zero, one, two, three, or four). The figure suggests that the control group perceived an illusory audiotactile effect on these trials: They reported more tactile stimuli when more than one auditory stimulus was presented with the tactile stimulus (<italic>incongruent audiotactile conditions</italic>) than when the tactile stimulus was presented alone or simultaneously with one auditory stimulus (<italic>congruent conditions</italic>). All participants were clearly able to perceive the correct number of auditory stimuli when they were presented alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612471142">Fig. 1a</xref>), yet the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612471142">Figure 2</xref> suggest that temporarily deaf individuals were less predisposed to perceive the audiotactile illusion compared with the matched control subjects. An ANOVA with group (control or temporarily deaf) as a between-subjects factor and number of auditory stimuli (zero, one, two, three, or four) as a within-subjects factor was conducted in order to verify this impression. Main effects of the number of auditory stimuli, <italic>F</italic>(1.313, 36.759) = 10.649, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .276, and group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 6.6061, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .178, were found.

<p>The performance level of every temporarily deaf individual was examined further. The data revealed that the performance of only 3 deaf individuals (S4, S11, and S13) was similar to that of the control participants when a single tactile stimulus was presented with two auditory stimuli (mean perceived number of tactile stimuli = 1.36 for S4, 1.28 for S11, and 1.40 for S13) or three auditory stimuli (<italic>M</italic>s = 2.24, 1.52, and 1.32, respectively), and that the performance of only 2 deaf individuals was similar to that of the control participants when a single tactile stimulus was presented with four auditory stimuli (<italic>M</italic>s = 1.80 for S11 and 1.32 for S13). All other temporarily deaf participants perceived a maximum of 1.24 tactile stimuli in these conditions.</p>
<p>Individual performance of the temporarily deaf participants in the incongruent audiotactile conditions with one tactile stimulus and two or more auditory stimuli was also examined in relation to tactile performance in the grating-orientation task and the vibrotactile discrimination task, auditory performance in the auditory discrimination task and in the speech recognition task, and characteristics of hearing loss.

<p>We also conducted an exploratory analysis to examine whether the timing of the period of deafness (i.e., whether or not it occurred during a sensitive developmental period) might account for the results observed in the incongruent audiotactile conditions. To do this, we divided the temporarily deaf participants into a congenitally deaf group (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and a late-deaf group (<italic>n</italic> = 7). (Because 2 participants, S10 and S12, had progressive deafness starting at birth, and might have had near-normal hearing abilities during early childhood, they were removed from the analysis.) An ANOVA with group (early-deaf or late-deaf) as a between-subjects factor and number of auditory stimuli (two, three, or four) as a within-subjects factor revealed no main effects of condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 22) = 0.028, <italic>p</italic> = .452, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .070, or group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 22) = 0.188, <italic>p</italic> = .673, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .017, and the interaction between these factors was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 11) = 0.728, <italic>p</italic> = .494, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .062.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the effects of temporary auditory deprivation on audiotactile integration. The experimental audiotactile task revealed a statistically significant difference between normally hearing individuals and temporarily deaf individuals. Normally hearing individuals’ tactile sensations were influenced by auditory stimuli, whereas temporarily deaf individuals’ tactile sensations were not.</p>
<p>Prior studies have often suggested that manual tactile perception may be altered by changes in sound perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612471142">Foxe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting &amp; Röder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612471142">Ito &amp; Ostry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612471142">Jousmäki &amp; Hari, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0956797612471142">Zampini &amp; Spence, 2004</xref>). Recent neuroimaging studies have confirmed the link between auditory and tactile perception in humans, and electrophysiological recordings have demonstrated an early-stage neural interaction between auditory and somatosensory input in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612471142">Kayser &amp; Logothetis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612471142">Soto-Faraco &amp; Deco, 2009</xref>). Moreover, research in the domain of speech processing has suggested an influence of tactile stimulation on auditory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612471142">Bernstein, Demorest, Coulter, &amp; O’Connell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612471142">Gick &amp; Derrick, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that multisensory functions develop gradually and are influenced by early sensory experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612471142">Wallace &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>), it is conceivable that auditory deprivation from birth, even if temporary, could have a dramatic impact on the emergence and maturation of these important processes. The notion that transient sensory deprivation leads to reduced multisensory capabilities is supported by previously reported results for audiovisual integration in children temporarily deprived of visual inputs at an early age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612471142">Putzar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612471142">Putzar et al., 2010</xref>). Our results for temporarily deaf individuals performing an audiotactile task are also consistent with this notion. However, the data suggest that audiotactile integration might be even more readily impeded than audiovisual integration. Our results suggest that temporary auditory deprivation does not necessarily have to occur at birth to disrupt audiotactile integration in adults, as we found no difference in performance between early- and late-deaf individuals. These findings suggest that the development and maintenance of audiotactile processes might require an uninterrupted bond between the modalities, as a temporary auditory deprivation in later life appears to have a dramatic impact on audiotactile integration.</p>
<p>This conclusion must be considered speculative, however. There is a general consensus that audiovisual integration is easy for cochlear-implant users when auditory and visual cues are both available and related (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612471142">Bergeson &amp; Pisoni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612471142">Geers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612471142">Kaiser, Kirk, Lachs, &amp; Pisoni, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612471142">Moody-Antonio et al., 2005</xref>). Some researchers have even gone so far as to state that cochlear-implant users may be better at integrating congruent audiovisual information than normally hearing individuals are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612471142">Rouger et al., 2007</xref>). The body of evidence regarding this population’s ability to process incongruent multisensory cues, as in the present study, is far more limited. Recent studies have shown that although congruent audiovisual information typically facilitates speech perception, speech discrimination might be hindered for some cochlear-implant users when incongruent auditory and visual inputs need to be segregated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612471142">Landry et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>These results with incongruent audiovisual input highlight the importance of considering multiple factors when investigating multisensory interactions in cochlear-implant users. Their performance has been shown to depend on the duration of deafness, the communication strategy used before implantation, age at the onset of deafness, and the extent of cross-modal plasticity prior to implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612471142">Collignon, Champoux, Voss, &amp; Lepore, 2011</xref>). All these factors interact and influence auditory perception following implantation. Multisensory integration in cochlear-implant users most probably reflects the variability in auditory perception that results from these variables. This high level of variability in cochlear-implant users’ performance and the heterogeneity of our temporarily deaf group might explain some of our results. Indeed, the data reported here contrast with previous results indicating that auditory or visual deprivation affects the development of multisensory integration if the deprivation occurs specifically during a sensitive period (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612471142">Putzar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612471142">Schorr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612471142">Wallace &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). We found no significant correlation between the onset of hearing loss and performance in the audiotactile task. However, because of the heterogeneity of our participants in regard to the onset and duration of their deafness, future investigations with larger samples at each developmental stage are needed to resolve the important question of whether auditory deprivation at any stage results in reduced capabilities for audiotactile integration.</p>
<p>It could be argued that our findings do not reflect multisensory integration per se. According to the modality-appropriateness hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797612471142">Welch &amp; Warren, 1980</xref>), the most task-appropriate modality is dominant, and audition dominates in temporal tasks. Thus, enhanced tactile capabilities or reduced auditory capabilities in our temporarily deaf participants might explain the results, as such changes in discrimination skills reduce susceptibility to interference by task-irrelevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting &amp; Röder, 2004</xref>). Enhanced tactile capabilities have been shown to explain a reduced tendency to fuse auditory and tactile information in certain cases. For instance, greater tactile capabilities in the blind, compared with sighted individuals, can lead to greater ease in segregating audiotactile stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471142">Hötting &amp; Röder, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612471142">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Imaging studies have revealed that tactile stimuli can activate auditory regions in deaf individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612471142">Levänen &amp; Hamdorf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612471142">Schürmann, Caetano, Hlushchuk, Jousmäki, &amp; Hari, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612471142">Sharma, Gilley, Dorman, &amp; Baldwin, 2007</xref>). Such plastic changes may lead to the enhanced tactile capabilities reported in profoundly deaf individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612471142">Heming &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612471142">Levänen &amp; Hamdorf, 2001</xref>). However, these changes might depend on a number of characteristics related to hearing loss (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612471142">Collignon et al., 2011</xref>), as enhanced tactile capabilities were not found in other investigations using similar tactile tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612471142">Conway, Pisoni, Anaya, Karpicke, &amp; Henning, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612471142">Moallem, Reed, &amp; Braida, 2010</xref>). Our tactile tasks did not reveal any significant differences between groups, which suggests that the lack of integration in our temporarily deaf participants was not related to a change in tactile processing capabilities.</p>
<p>In the auditory domain, our evaluations confirmed that the cochlear implants of our temporarily deaf participants transmitted sounds within normal levels of intensity. Furthermore, all participants were clearly able to discriminate the correct number of auditory and tactile stimuli in the control conditions, which confirmed that the temporal resolution skills required for the experimental task were comparable between the two groups. Moreover, 3 of the temporarily deaf individuals were able to achieve a level of performance relatively close to that of the control group in the experimental conditions. That is, their tactile perception was significantly influenced by the auditory stimuli in the experimental conditions. These results indicate that the cochlear implant does not completely eliminate the possibility of fusion, thus confirming that the use this device is not responsible for the lack of integration observed in the temporarily deaf group.</p>
<p>Despite these considerations, we are unable to settle the exact influence conveyed by each sensory modality in the multisensory conditions we investigated. Further investigation incorporating relevant cognitive factors is needed to determine why temporarily deaf individuals are less able to integrate tactile and auditory stimuli compared with normally hearing individuals, despite having similar unisensory abilities, and to properly interpret the results in the framework of the modality-appropriateness hypothesis.</p>
<p>Whatever the basis for the performance differences between the control and temporarily deaf groups, these data highlight the importance of uninterrupted auditory stimulation in ensuring normal multisensory integration. Unlike audiovisual integration, for which impairment following temporary hearing loss can vary and depends on various features related to the hearing loss (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612471142">Collignon et al., 2011</xref>), audiotactile integration appears to be disturbed in most individuals following temporary deafness. The factors that determine whether such impairment occurs need to be investigated further, as the temporarily deaf participants who were able to fuse auditory and tactile information in our study had no commonality that set them apart from the other temporarily deaf individuals.</p>
