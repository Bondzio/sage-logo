<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been proven an effective method in treating large articular cartilage defects in short- or medium-term follow-up clinical studies.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> First generation ACI of patients with large full-thickness chondral defects of the knee could yield reliable functional outcomes after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between 1997 and 2005, 42 patients (45 knees) underwent first generation ACI for symptomatic chondral defects of the knee. All patients had moderate to large (mean, 5.33 cm<sup>2</sup>) full-thickness chondral defects. Patients were evaluated using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Examination Form, the Tegner activity score, the Lysholm score, the Stanmore functional rating score, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean follow-up was 96 months (range, 62-144 months). At the final follow-up, a significant increase in all scores was recorded. Compared with preoperative findings, the median Lysholm score significantly improved, increasing from 56.0 to 89.0 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The IKDC and the Tegner activity score showed significant improvement postoperatively, increasing from 45 and 5.5 to 69 and 6.5, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The mean ICRS improved from grade 3.8 preoperatively to grade 2.8 postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The Stanmore functional rating score and the VAS pain score were decreased from 3.06 and 7.33 to 0.94 and 2, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Reoperation was required in 5 patients. In 2 of them graft failure was recorded due to degeneration or partial detachment, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The long-term outcomes of our series support the effectiveness of first generation ACI in both pain relief and functional rehabilitation of patients with large full-thickness osteochondral defects of the knee.</p>

<body>
<p>Cartilage lesions seldom heal spontaneously, thus they constitute one of the main reasons for joint disease and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428778">3</xref></sup> Cartilage defects gradually lead to degeneration of the articular cartilage and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428778">7</xref></sup> All reconstructive procedures should include the replacement of the defect with healthy chondral tissue and its incorporation to the neighboring chondral tissue as well as to the subchondral bone.</p>
<p>A review of the literature revealed the existence of many novel and promising techniques for articular cartilage repair. Cartilage repair procedures comprise arthroscopic techniques, open surgical procedures, procedures that follow autogenic and allogenic tissue transplantation principles, and tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428778">15</xref></sup> Arthroscopic techniques include arthroscopic lavage, shaving and debridement, abrasion chondroplasty, Pridie drilling, and microfracture technique. Open surgical procedures, such as osteotomies and distraction of joints, have only limited applications. Procedures that follow tissue transplantation principles comprise osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty), perichondral and periosteal grafts, as well as osteochondral and chondral allografts. In tissue engineering the main consideration is to find a specific cell population that will be able to produce a new tissue with hyaline cartilage properties. For this reason several cell populations and factors have been used, such as autologous chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, scaffolds, growth factors, and cytokines.</p>
<p>First of all, Peterson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511428778">27</xref></sup> and Grande et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428778">11</xref></sup> investigated the application of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and the capability of reconstructed cartilage for healing defects with an intact subchondral plate in rabbits. They observed a significant amount of cartilage reconstitution after ACI compared with ungrafted control animals. Comparison between the use of periosteal grafts with and without chondrocytes in suspension showed that the tissue that is produced and fills the defect is superior when using the periosteal graft with cultured autologous chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428778">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ACI technique was initially applied in clinical practice in 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428778">3</xref></sup> Since then many short- or medium-term clinical studies have shown satisfactory outcome after ACI. In our study we evaluated first generation ACI with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511428778" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between 1997 and 2005, 42 patients (45 knees) underwent first generation ACI for symptomatic chondral defects of the knee. There were 29 male patients and 13 female patients. The right knee was affected in 33 cases and the left knee in 12 cases. The mean age was 28.9 years (range, 12-47 years) (see the Appendix, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>). All patients had isolated moderate to large full-thickness (Outerbridge grade III or IV) chondral defects of the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511428778">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exclusion criteria were age older than 50 years, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, obesity, kissing or multiple lesions, active inflammatory arthritis or infection, untreated varus/valgus alignment greater than 5°, and knee instability without reconstruction.</p>
<p>The study was performed in compliance with the ethical review board of our hospital. All patients gave their consent to participate in this study.</p>
<p>The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) form,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428778">6</xref></sup> the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Examination Form,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428778">16</xref></sup> the Tegner activity score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511428778">32</xref></sup> the Lysholm score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428778">20</xref></sup> and the Stanmore functional rating score were used to collect demographic data and to record the history, symptoms, functional score, pain, characteristics of the cartilage defect, and findings of the clinical examination. Additionally, a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain evaluation was used. Preoperatively all patients underwent weightbearing standing radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the affected knee.</p>
<p>Trauma was the most common cause of the chondral defects (38 cases). In 7 cases osteochondritis dissecans was the underlying cause. The mean duration of symptoms was 28 months. Fourteen patients had undergone an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, in 13 cases during arthroscopic cartilage retrieval and in 1 case a year earlier. Eleven patients underwent partial medial meniscectomy simultaneously with the cartilage retrieval, and 1 patient had a supracondylar femoral varus osteotomy during the implantation stage.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511428778">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The surgical technique described by Brittberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428778">3</xref></sup> was performed in all cases and included 2 stages. During the first stage healthy articular cartilage was harvested through an arthroscopic or mini-open surgical procedure. The cartilage defect was evaluated and its size, depth, and location were recorded. In all our patients the medial or lateral border of the upper trochlear groove was used as the donor site area. The specimen should include only cartilage without subchondral bone, and its total weight should be at least 300 mg. The biopsy specimen was then placed in a sterile transport medium provided by Genzyme (Boston, Massachusetts) and was sent for culturing. Chondrocytes were isolated through enzymatic digestion and then cultivated for 14 days. Three weeks after surgery, a report was sent about the suitability of the sampled cells for culture.</p>
<p>When the date for the second stage was fixed, a second cultivation followed and the concentration of autologous chondrocytes reached 30 million cells per mL. A lateral or medial parapatellar arthrotomy, according to the affected site, was performed in a tourniquet controlled bloodless field. The chondral lesion was debrided to healthy cartilage with special curettes in a smooth elliptical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428778">Figure 1</xref>). In all cases care was taken not to penetrate the subchondral bone plate or provoke bleeding from the wound bed. A periosteal flap was harvested from the proximal medial subcutaneous surface of the ipsilateral tibia. The flap was fitted and sutured to the surrounding rim of the debrided cartilage with interrupted No. 6-0 absorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey) with the deep cambium layer against the bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428778">Figure 1C</xref>). The periosteal rim was sealed with fibrin glue (Beriplast P Combi-Set CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany) except 1 corner. Through this, the autologous chondrocytes suspension was injected underneath the periosteal flap. The small remaining opening was closed with 1 suture and sealed with fibrin glue.</p>

<p>In 7 patients with osteochondritis dissecans, the defect was cleaned and reconstructed with allograft cancellous chips (Cancellous Chips, Osteotech Inc, Eatontown, New Jersey) to the subchondral plate level and covered by the chondral flap. At the second stage, the provisional chondral flap was removed and the same technique as above was followed.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, the patients underwent continuous passive motion for 48 hours. Active knee flexion and extension was encouraged without exceeding 90° of flexion for the first 30 days. Mobilization of the patient on crutches began with non-weightbearing for 6 weeks, progressing from partial to full weightbearing by 10 to 12 weeks. Emphasis during rehabilitation was on functional use of the limb and active muscle recruitment. Moderate exercise, such as short hikes or cycling, was started 3 to 6 months after surgery. Return to preinjury sports activity was allowed at 6 to 9 months after the operation.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546511428778">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Baseline clinical scores were compared with follow-up data by paired Wilcoxon tests. Statistical comparison of different groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for nonparametric data. All tests were calculated with use of the SPSS, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) statistic package for personal computers. In all instances, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Isolated cartilage defects ranging from 1.8 to 12 cm<sup>2</sup> (mean, 5.33 cm<sup>2</sup>) were detected by MRI and verified with arthroscopy (Appendix). Thirty-two knees had isolated medial femoral condyle lesions, 12 had isolated lateral femoral condyle lesions, and 1 had a trochlear lesion. Fourteen patients had a concomitant tear of the ACL, while 11 patients had meniscal tears. Weightbearing standing radiographs of the affected knee revealed no osteoarthritic changes.</p>
<p>All 42 patients were followed up for a mean period of 96 months (range, 62-144 months). Clinical evaluation was performed before implantation; at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after implantation; and annually thereafter. Improvement in knee function was constant over continuous follow-up at all time points. At the final follow-up, a significant increase in all scores was recorded. Compared with preoperative findings, the median Lysholm score significantly improved, increasing from 56.0 to 89.0 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The IKDC and the Tegner activity score showed significant improvement postoperatively, increasing from 45 and 5.5 to 69 and 6.5, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The mean ICRS improved from grade 3.8 preoperatively to grade 2.8 postoperatively. This difference was also found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Pain was also found to be significantly reduced after the operation. More specifically, the Stanmore functional rating score and the VAS score were decreased from 3.06 and 7.33 to 0.94 and 2, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>At the first year follow-up, 2 patients had a painless clicking and catching sensation and a third patient complained of a painful catching sensation. All 3 patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy that revealed overgrowth of the graft. Arthroscopic debridement was performed and all patients were free of symptoms during the 2-year follow-up. One of these patients 5 years after the initial chondrocyte implantation complained of persisting knee pain. Arthroscopy revealed degeneration of the graft. The graft site was debrided and a microfracture technique was performed. He underwent a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 7 years after the initial procedure at the age of 42 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428778">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In 1 of our patients, partial detachment of the graft was recorded 5 years after surgery. The lesion was treated with regional trimming, removal of the detached segments, and a subchondral microfracture technique of the detached graft area. This treatment had a small effect, and the patient underwent a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 2 years after the treatment with a microfracture technique.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old girl, 8 months after ACI for the treatment of a lateral femoral condyle lesion, had mild swelling of her knee. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed degeneration at the implantation site and loose bodies in the joint cavity or adhered on the synovial. Arthroscopy demonstrated the presence of numerous loose bodies, degeneration, and discoloration of the graft. Histological features were compatible with synovial chondromatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428778">33</xref></sup> Subsequently, she underwent debridement of the graft site and microfractures for the treatment of the chondral defect and removal of all the loose bodies. The patient was free of symptoms at the final follow-up, 3 years after reoperation.</p>
<p>No serious complications, such as deep infection or a thromboembolic event, were recorded on any of the patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple techniques have been developed during the past decades in an attempt to repair the articular cartilage defects. These techniques include the Pridie drilling, microfracture technique, abrasion arthroplasty, osteochondral autologous transplantation system (OATS), and tissue engineering methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428778">15</xref></sup> Autologous chondrocyte implantation was the first tissue-engineering technique used to repair articular cartilage defects and was first used in humans in 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428778">3</xref></sup> The original ACI technique consists of implanting a suspension of cultured chondrocytes in situ of the debrided articular cartilage defect. Autologous periosteum harvested from the proximal medial aspect of the ipsilateral tibia is used as cover material for the implanted chondrocytes. This method is considered the first generation of ACI and is the method used in all our patients.</p>
<p>Complications associated with the first generation of ACI, such as hypertrophy and delamination of periosteum, pioneered the development of second generation ACI where the implanted chondrocytes are covered by a bilayer membrane of type I/type III collagen instead of periosteal graft. Gooding et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428778">10</xref></sup> compared the outcomes of first and second generation ACI using clinical and arthroscopic criteria. In this prospective randomized trial, 68 patients with a mean defect size of 4.54 cm<sup>2</sup> were evaluated. At 2 years’ follow-up, good or excellent functional results were recorded in 67% of the patients treated with first generation ACI compared with 74% of patients managed with second generation ACI. Although second-look arthroscopy at 1 year after surgery revealed similar results between the 2 techniques, 36.4% of the patients in the first generation ACI group required shaving for symptomatic graft hypertrophy compared with none for the second generation ACI group. In a prospective study of 63 patients treated with second generation ACI, no symptomatic graft hypertrophy requiring an additional operative procedure was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428778">31</xref></sup> The ICRS and modified Cincinnati score showed significant improvement at 6, 18, and 36 months after implantation. Good to excellent functional results were also obtained in 72% of 31 patients who underwent second generation ACI at 2 years after surgery. Likewise, a recent systematic review did not find any differences in clinical outcomes between first and second generation ACI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428778">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>New methods of cell delivery using biodegradable 3-dimensional scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes were also developed. These new techniques constitute the third generation of ACI. A widely used approach of third generation ACI is the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACI). In a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the first generation ACI with MACI in 21 patients, Zeifang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511428778">35</xref></sup> found no significant differences in IKDC, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36), and Tegner activity scores at 12 and 24 months follow-up. The difference in the Lysholm and Gillquist score at 12 months and 24 months after implantation was found to be significant, favoring the first generation ACI. Magnetic resonance findings at 12 months and 24 months after implantation were also statistically insignificant. To compare second and third generation ACI, Bartlett et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428778">1</xref></sup> designed a randomized controlled trial in 91 patients, of whom 44 received collagen covered ACI and 47 MACI grafts. At 1 year after implantation, the frequency of good to excellent functional outcomes was higher for MACI than for collagen covered ACI. However, no significant difference was recorded in the modified Cincinnati knee score, the VAS, and the Stanmore functional scores between the 2 techniques. One year after implantation, the arthroscopic appearance of the graft and the histological findings were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Hyaline-like cartilage or hyaline-like cartilage with fibrocartilage was present in 42.9% of collagen covered ACI biopsy specimens and 36.4% of MACI biopsy specimens. A good to excellent ICRS score was recorded in 79.2% of collagen covered ACI and 66.6% of MACI grafts.</p>
<p>Lately, novel techniques have been described, some of which are designed for a 1-stage procedure. These techniques, known as third generation ACI, include the Histogenics NeoCart and VeriCart (NeoCart and Vericart, Histogenics, Waltham, Massachusetts), the Zimmer DeNovo ET (DeNovo ET Engineered Tissue Graft, Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, Indiana), and the alginate-cultured chondrocyte beads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428778">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511428778">14</xref></sup> All the above aim to improve on the previous generations of cartilage repair techniques either by reducing surgical intervention or by improving the mechanical and biological properties of the construct.</p>
<p>Autologous chondrocyte implantation is best suited for symptomatic Outerbridge grade III and IV lesions of the femoral condyle or trochlear regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428778">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428778">16</xref></sup> Autologous chondrocyte implantation is mainly indicated for lesions from 2 to 12 cm<sup>2</sup> (1.8-12 cm<sup>2</sup> in our study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511428778">17</xref></sup> Patients ranging in age from 15 to 55 years are the best candidates for ACI. In our study group the mean age was 28.9 years (range, 12-47 years). Obesity, joint instability, and malalignment of the mechanical axis are contraindications for ACI. Such patients were excluded from our study. Kissing lesions on high-demand patients are a relative contraindication for the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511428778">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428778">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Postoperatively, we followed the rehabilitation program proposed by the ICRS. The duration and characteristics of this program are directly related with the cartilage maturation that occurs in 3 distinct phases. During the first 6 weeks of the proliferative phase, the chondrocytes adhere to the subchondral bone and proliferate. During this time the patient should not be allowed full weightbearing, and only 0° to 90° of flexion should be permitted. The second or transition phase lasts for 4 to 6 months. During this period the matrix produced by the chondrocytes increases, and the patient can start weightbearing. The third phase of cartilage maturation is known as the matrix remodeling phase. During this period the cartilage tissue acquires a quality similar to the native cartilage. This process begins approximately 6 months postoperatively and lasts for 6 to 12 months. Although at this stage the patient can return to normal activities, cartilage maturation continues for up to 3 years postoperatively.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic assessment remains the gold standard for postoperative visualization. The repair is directly visualized and biopsy can be performed for histological assessment. Biopsy can damage the articular cartilage. Hattori et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428778">13</xref></sup> showed that ultrasonic measurement scan can assess chondral regeneration using tissue-engineered cell/scaffold complexes. Kuroki et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511428778">19</xref></sup> using the same method, were able to evaluate regenerated articular cartilage in osteochondral plugs after mosaicplasty. However, this method can evaluate only the cartilage surface.</p>
<p>Although a relatively new technique, ACI has increased in popularity during the past 10 years with numerous early studies showing promising results. Brittberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428778">5</xref></sup> demonstrated the durability of the clinical improvement of patients who underwent ACI for large full-thickness chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee joint. At a mean follow-up of 4 years, 90% of 244 patients with femoral condylar lesions showed good or excellent results. When a portion of this cohort was followed for 5 to 11 years (mean, 7.4 years) after the implantation, the clinical improvement was found to be almost stable, with 84% of the patients treated with ACI demonstrating good or excellent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511428778">26</xref></sup> More recently, Peterson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428778">28</xref></sup> reported 10- to 20-year (mean, 12.8 years) outcomes on 244 patients treated with first generation ACI. In this series the Lysholm, Tegner-Wallgren, and Brittberg-Peterson scores were all improved compared with the preoperative values. All functional scores in our patients also showed significant improvement. The improvement of the Lysholm and Tegner activity scores is in accordance with the results of Peterson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428778">28</xref></sup> The improvement of the IKDC score in our patients is similar to the improvement obtained by Ferruzzi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428778">8</xref></sup> in the group treated with ACI through an open technique in 48 patients and a mean follow-up of 5 years.</p>
<p>The ACI technique has been found to have superior functional results compared with debridement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428778">9</xref></sup> More specifically, 81% of patients managed with ACI had at least 5 points of improvement in the Cincinnati knee score whereas only 60% of patients treated with debridement had a 2-point improvement. Median pain and swelling scores were also significantly improved in patients treated with ACI, but they had more subsequent procedures than patients managed with debridement.</p>
<p>Knutsen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511428778">18</xref></sup> randomized 80 patients to receive either first generation (n = 40) or microfracture (n = 40) and reported on Lysholm, Tegner, ICRS, mental component, VAS, and SF-36 scores after 2 years of follow-up. At that time a significantly greater improvement in SF-36 scores was noted in patients treated with microfracture. The number of failures after ACI was greater than after microfracture (2 and 1 failure, respectively). Second-look arthroscopy performed in 76% of patients revealed no significant difference in the frequencies of hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage between groups. When the same patients were followed at 5 years after surgery, no difference was noted in SF-36 scores. Nevertheless, the number of failures after ACI was equal to that after microfracture (9 failures in each group). Saris et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511428778">30</xref></sup> reported clinical outcomes and histologic scores in a multicenter randomized study of 118 patients in which characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI; 57 patients) was compared with microfracture (61 patients) for the management of single, symptomatic lesions of the femoral condyle. Follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months demonstrated similar scores between the 2 groups. However, histological evaluation revealed superior structural regeneration after CCI correlated with improved clinical outcomes at longer follow-up. This is in accordance with a systematic review of 3122 patients who underwent microfracture, demonstrating that outcomes following this technique peak early and deteriorate with time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511428778">23</xref></sup> According to a Cochrane database review of 4 randomized controlled comparative ACI studies, there is no evidence to suggest a difference between ACI and other cartilage repair techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511428778">34</xref></sup> However, as of today there are no level I studies of surgical alternatives using a true natural history control group that may prove that any intervention for articular cartilage repair significantly alters the natural history of these lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428778">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite sufficient results in the management of patients with chondral defects of the knee who undergo ACI, technique-dependent complications do occur. These include graft hypertrophy, partial graft detachment, malfusion, and delamination. Graft hypertrophy has been associated with the use of periosteum and the location of the lesion treated with ACI, with a higher portion of hypertrophies found on the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511428778">24</xref></sup> The most common complication after ACI is transplant hypertrophy, which appears 6 to 12 months postoperatively. According to a systematic review the incidence of transplant hypertrophy is 22%, 5%, and 4% after first, second, and third generation ACI, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428778">12</xref></sup> Two of our patients (5%) at the first year of follow-up complained of a painless clicking sensation, and arthroscopy revealed graft hypertrophy. Arthroscopic shaving was performed in both patients. A second-look arthroscopy and graft biopsy were beyond the goals of this study. Therefore, the prevalence of graft hypertrophy could be underestimated since asymptomatic cases remained undiagnosed.</p>
<p>Detachment of the graft, often partial, is another common complication of ACI and was observed in 1 of our patients, 5 years after the initial operation. In a recent study, a case of a 12-year-old girl who 8 months after ACI developed chondromatosis of the knee was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428778">33</xref></sup> This complication is probably the result of dissemination of chondrocytes through an opening of the periosteal graft.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ACI is a valuable method for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage lesions. Long-term outcomes of our series support the effectiveness of first generation ACI in both pain relief and knee function rehabilitation of patients with large full-thickness chondral defects of the knee. Patient selection, careful preoperative planning, and meticulous operative technique minimize complication rate and ensure a longstanding outcome.</p>
