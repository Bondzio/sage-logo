<p>For almost two decades, Wendy Goldman has been one of the foremost social historians of Stalin’s Russia. Her latest book, <italic>Inventing the Enemy</italic>, explores the most notorious period of Soviet history, the terror of 1936–38, and seeks to elucidate how the campaign developed and spread by looking in detail at five large factories in Moscow. Using stenographic reports of Communist Party factory group meetings and the factories’ own newspapers, Goldman tells a grim and compelling tale of frightened people trying to protect themselves and (sometimes) their loved ones in the bewildering and terrifying environment of an ever-widening witch-hunt.</p>
<p>It is these sources that give Goldman’s contribution to this already well-documented field its originality. This is microhistory at its best. By looking at the responses of ordinary party members to the state campaign to root out spies, wreckers and enemies, Goldman illustrates some of the most important mechanisms which shaped and spread the terror in localities across the USSR, and at the same time brings to life the motivations and fears of its participants. She argues against those historians who posit that the ‘Great Terror’ was a series of discrete, separate terror operations directed from above, or that Stalin and the top leadership alone bore responsibility for it. By the time government decisions to target specific groups (such as former kulaks or ‘spies’ from Poland) had percolated down to the grassroots, they were experienced by ordinary people as a ‘series of concussive assaults’ (16), part of a single ‘process that was both beyond their control and of their own making’ (313).</p>
<p>In the factories, the terror largely took the form of a campaign against ‘wrecking’. The Serp i Molot factory in Moscow adopted a model resolution which encapsulated the campaign’s assumptions: ‘We know that production complexes do not stop themselves, machines do not break themselves, boilers do not explode on their own. Behind each of these acts lies some kind of hand. Is this not the hand of the enemy?’ (47–8). At first, as Goldman shows, it was specialists and managers who were most vulnerable to charges of wrecking. But as the campaign also demanded ‘vigilance’ and cast suspicion on those who failed to show it, a frenzy of pre-emptive denunciations of colleagues and associates soon developed, which the local party hierarchy had to take seriously, lest they too were accused of insufficient vigilance. The excerpts from factory newspapers and meeting minutes graphically illustrate the resulting chain reaction, in which party organizations and work collectives tore themselves apart with accusations, confessions and counter-accusations. The factory papers were particularly virulent in fomenting the campaign and ensuring that, as Goldman stresses, nobody in the factories could stand aside: everyone was a perpetrator, a victim or, very frequently, both.</p>
<p>Although women overall were a small minority of those sent to camps or executed, a strength of this book is the prominence it gives to women’s stories. We meet comrade Stepanova, a worker who disliked her boss, David Sagaidak, and whose inchoate denunciations of him as an enemy wrecker eventually led to his arrest, along with several others. Sagaidak was also in the sights of Mariia Zhidkova, a fanatical party member from an old Bolshevik family, whose incorruptible zeal made her a ‘small juggernaut of terror’ (212) in the conditions of 1937. The fact that her own beloved brother had been arrested did nothing to soften her righteous certainty as she denounced anyone she deemed suspicious. One of her victims, Esfir Krivitskaia, a Polish political refugee and party functionary who was eventually arrested and shot, aroused Zhidkova’s personal ire by leaving her husband following his expulsion from the party and becoming over-friendly with Somov, head of the Serp i Molot party committee. In general, though, women party members were expected to renounce their husbands if they were expelled or arrested. Varvara Torbeeva, whose husband had been imprisoned on charges of Trotskyism, was asked about her attempts to visit him in jail: ‘How do you view the fact that you wish to go to the prison to meet with a Trotskyist?’ Her poignant answer: ‘You know, I have two children, and he is their father’ (159) failed to impress the meeting, which expelled her from the CPSU.</p>
<p>Overall, Goldman’s book is a fine piece of scholarship which fills in another part of a massively complex picture. It deepens our understanding of the dynamics of the terror within Soviet factories and their party organizations. However, its source base – party records and factory papers from Moscow – necessarily leaves certain questions unanswered. The ways victims acted after their arrest is not much explored here. How far was the behaviour of CPSU members – who had a stake in the regime and shared its political assumptions – typical of the Soviet population as a whole? How far was the experience of Moscow workers different from that of people in small towns, peasants, or members of national minorities? One thing is certain: Stalin’s terror will continue to fascinate historians for years to come.</p>
