<p>In the eighteenth century, Alex Preda tells us, financial activities were relegated to the fringes of society. Those who practiced them enjoyed no social recognition; they were a population of marginals and parasites who were stigmatized by the disparaging term “speculators.” Three centuries later the situation has certainly changed. The legitimacy of financial markets is still a subject of debate, but no one would question the very principle of their existence, and they occupy a key position at the heart of contemporary capitalism. While “speculation” still has negative connotations, it has been replaced by the more honorable term “investor.” Finance has to be regulated, and framed, but it has made itself indispensable.</p>
<p>How has this radical transformation occurred? This is what Preda’s book aims to elucidate. Based on a very detailed historical study on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, in which a rich diversity of sources and material are used, Preda sheds original light on what was truly a revolution. To this day, this revolution is still largely unknown and underestimated, yet without it the successive industrial revolutions would not have had the same magnitude or impact.</p>
<p>A superficial reading could leave one with the impression that Preda’s work has added one more chapter to a well-established field of analysis: the (historical) sociology of professions. The author does indeed show the gradual constitution of a professional group whose legitimacy was ultimately secured by rooting itself in the progressive constitution of specialized knowledge and know-how. However, this interpretation would not do justice to this work of Preda, who explicitly invites us to avoid it. Preda’s historical analysis highlights the fact that (quasi)professional structures appeared in a constituted form in the 1970s only, after a long and painful process of elaboration and testing of sophisticated knowledge and techniques, of constitution and structuring of work sites, of coordination of agents, and of transmission, diffusion, and adaptation of practices: “In other words, an account of the constitution of jurisdiction should include and start from the content of this expert knowledge and its generation” (p. 150). That is why the inquiry rightly focuses on knowledge and techniques, and on their structuring role in the constitution of professional groups and the construction of their legitimacy.</p>
<p>In this race for skills and respectability, a revolutionary technical device, the stock-ticker, played a crucial role. It was to the financial revolution what the steam engine was to the first industrial revolution. Indeed, its appearance in the mid-nineteenth century triggered a total upheaval in speculative activities. By ceaselessly spewing out the price of securities, the stock-ticker allowed prices and especially their movements to be observed, thus facilitating the transformation of the speculator-gambler into a rational economic agent, a speculator-investor, capable of calculating his decisions on the basis of an interpretation of “objective” data. By facilitating the rationalization of agents’ behaviors, the observation of price movements enabled the market to exist as an entity in its own right. Price movements informed on the behaviors of other agents, and in turn enabled each agent to calculate his decisions; they attested to the existence and functioning of this abstract market which, as a device for collective calculation of prices, can be seen as the consequence of the process of rationalization of agents. In itself this process would not have existed without the ticker which set, objectified, and standardized prices. The observation and interpretation of price movements generated intense inventive activity in which scientific and lay expertise were combined, and which contributed to the birth of “technical analysis” and Chartism. Based on the assumption that price movements constituted a continuous variable, technical analysis affirmed that they could therefore not be correlated with outside events, since those events were necessarily discontinuous. Financial markets were therefore made self-explanatory. This hypothesis, which asserted (and contributes to the establishment of) the autonomy of financial activities, simultaneously drawing a line between these activities and society, is now at the heart of knowledge on finance.</p>
<p>The constitution of rational agents, which allowed for the establishment of the “real” markets, did not however resolve the formidable question of the legitimacy of financial activities. Preda examines the debates on the social utility of financial activities, which raged throughout the three long centuries that he studies. We bump into the usual suspects—Smith, Marx, Sombart, Weber—but also more unexpected authors such as Proudhon who proved to be a fierce advocate of financial markets. This merciless critic of private property contended that without them small investors would be unable to participate in the collective enterprise of developing industrial and economic strength. We learn that a metaphor, that of society as a living organism, underlies the conception of financial activities as a vital force, in which the stock exchange is the heart and money the blood. This view was instrumental in making finance a civilizing force. To be sure, it was one that was difficult to tame, with all its excesses and pathologies that had to be guarded against, yet without which society would no longer advance and progress. Rational and reasonable speculators, tamed and well-regulated financial markets: here was what favored social and economic progress.</p>
<p>One of the main merits of Preda’s book is that it highlights the role of techniques and knowledge in the constitution of financial markets and in their social integration—not to make them a determining factor, but to show how they have contributed to opening and structuring new spheres of action. It has also brought to light a largely unknown history that resonates with society as a whole and enables us to put current debates on financial activities into perspective. One would have liked Preda to devote a little more space to the history of financial products and of their controversial framings (even though he does mention debates on options). Finally, the long introduction may seem a bit daunting to those who are more interested in history than in analytical frameworks, but it can easily be skipped in a first reading. Despite these minor reservations, <italic>Framing Finance</italic> is an indispensable book that can also be read as a key contribution to the sociology of markets and to the study of the mechanisms that have constituted market arrangements.</p>
