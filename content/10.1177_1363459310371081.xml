<abstract>
<p>This article describes a qualitative synthesis of published research on cancer patients’ experiences of complementary therapies. We conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies on this subject published between 1998 and 2007. Twenty-six refereed journal articles met the inclusion criteria. These 26 articles were repeatedly read by the research team and key concepts emerging from them were identified. Differences and variations were examined in association with treatment, therapy type and by stage of cancer (early stage, mid-treatment, advanced cancer, palliative care and long term ‘survivors’). Six overarching concepts were located, which describe the key aspects of patients’ experiences of the use of complementary and alternative medicine after a diagnosis of cancer: Connection; Control; Well-being; Transformation; Integration; and Polarization. These are described in a ‘line of argument’ synthesis, and differences associated with treatment type and stage of disease are noted. The findings are presented in a table showing the six concepts according to treatment type and stage; as a composite story; and in a diagrammatic model showing the individual, practitioner and organizational levels. The synthesis identified various specific ways in which complementary therapies supported cancer patients, as well as occasional negative effects. The most notable barrier was the perceived polarization of complementary therapies and biomedicine; patients reported better experiences in integrated settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-1363459310371081">
<title>Growing consumer demand for complementary therapies</title>
<p>The existence of a range of complementary therapies is not new, but there has been a recent upsurge in the popularity and status of complementary approaches. Population based surveys demonstrate that increasing numbers of people are using complementary therapies alongside biomedical care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459310371081">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) and that a substantial and increasing minority (30–40%) of patients use complementary therapies when they have been diagnosed with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459310371081">Ernst and Cassileth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459310371081">Molassiotis et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the ‘patient choice’ agenda, these upward pressures are only slowly translating into increasing state provision of complementary therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459310371081">Tataryn and Verhoef, 2001</xref>). For example, in England in 1998 it was estimated that 90 per cent of the total of 22 million visits to complementary therapists were purchased privately, and that the users of such therapies were socio-economically advantaged compared to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459310371081">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). The use of complementary therapies in a supportive role for cancer patients is included in National Health Service (NHS) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459310371081">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2004</xref>), but access to such services is still limited and often dependent on charitable institutions. Internationally, state provision of complementary therapies is very uneven and is often marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459310371081">Shuval et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1363459310371081">
<title>Reasons for choosing complementary therapies</title>
<p>There is considerable research about the reasons why people seek complementary therapies. Many researchers have used a ‘push–pull’ model, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459310371081">Andersen’s (1995)</xref> Behavioural Model, which suggests that people use complementary therapies either because they are dissatisfied with conventional medicine (pushed away) and/or because they are attracted (pulled) to complementary therapies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459310371081">Kelner and Wellman (1997)</xref> identified three ‘pull’ factors – <italic>predisposing</italic> (being female, highly educated), <italic>enabling</italic> (sufficient income, services available) and <italic>need for care</italic> (chronic ailments). In addition, people were ‘pushed’ by dissatisfaction with conventional care for a particular health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459310371081">Kelner and Wellman, 1997</xref>). Both ideology and practical conditions influence these decisions with people choosing specific types of practitioners for particular problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459310371081">Sharma, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1363459310371081">
<title>Using complementary therapies after a diagnosis of cancer</title>
<p>A systematic review of quantitative research of the use of complementary therapies by people with cancer found: a perceived beneficial response, wanting control, a strong belief in complementary therapies, complementary therapies as a last resort, and finding hope as the main reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459310371081">Verhoef et al., 2005b</xref>). Cancer is often included in studies of chronic illness but can be experienced by doctors and patients in very different ways, with particular meanings and ways of talking about the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459310371081">Reisfield and Wilson, 2004</xref>). A number of in depth qualitative studies indicate that the push and pull factors involved in decision making for people with cancer are similar to those for people with chronic illness. Individuals choosing to use complementary therapy appreciated the chance to take an active role, but noted that taking responsibility for treatment decisions at this time was particularly difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459310371081">Bishop et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to use complementary therapies after a diagnosis of cancer takes place against a background of sometimes heated debates. Given the potential vulnerability of people with cancer, oncologists and others have criticized complementary therapists for exploiting patients’ fears. On the other hand, there is a range of sometimes challenging and expensive therapies which proponents claim can cure cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459310371081">Broom and Adams (2009)</xref> interviewed oncology consultants and oncology nurses from two Australian clinics and found that the consultants were unanimous in depicting complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use as driven by ‘irrationality’, the need for control and desperation. None of them identified physiological benefit as a factor. The majority said that they used the potential risks of interaction and adverse effects to deter patients from using CAM, despite the fact that they had little knowledge of either. In contrast, the nurses appeared to see their role as that of CAM and patient advocate, an approach which the consultants disapproved of.</p>
<p>In the medical literature, the contested application of a narrowly defined ‘evidence-based’ policy determines the provision of complementary therapies in the health service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459310371081">Barry, 2005</xref>). However the methods and outcomes employed by medical researchers do not necessarily reflect the concerns and needs of those using complementary therapies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459310371081">Broom and Tovey (2007)</xref> explored cancer patients’ perspectives on the nature of evidence, and the degree to which different understandings of evidence informed their decision making about complementary therapies and biomedicine. They found that a significant group of patients prioritized experiential knowledge and rejected the need for scientific evidence in treatment decisions, but that there was a spectrum of views about the legitimacy of biomedical knowledge. They concluded that what characterized patients’ engagement with CAM in cancer care was a complex dialectical tension between the appeal of individualization (recognition of the subjective self) and depersonalization (appeal of control and certainty); most people did not resolve this tension but managed it through the disease and treatment process.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to build on the existing literature and to describe and synthesize the experiences of people with cancer who use complementary and alternative therapies, in the context of these ongoing debates. The study is focused on how people experienced these therapies and what they perceived as the benefits and difficulties of such treatment. We did not set out to address the reasons why people chose to use complementary and alternative therapies, or to explore the wider context of these experiences. In this study we originally used the term complementary and alternative medicine, but as most of the included articles described treatments which were being used as complementary therapies in conjunction with biomedical treatment, we decided to use the term complementary therapies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Many qualitative studies have now been published which describe participants’ experiences of using complementary therapies after a diagnosis of cancer. These studies are a rich source of patient-centred information but they tend to be small-scale and narrowly focused. Syntheses of other fields of qualitative research have shown that authors tend not to build on each other’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459310371081">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>). Meta-ethnography is an increasingly recognized method for synthesizing qualitative research and is based on the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459310371081">Noblit and Hare (1988)</xref> and developed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459310371081">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>). It involves several stages, including a systematic search for all relevant articles, and a rigorous process of data extraction to identify the key concepts from each article. Concepts from one article are translated into those of other articles. Meta-ethnography aims to go beyond describing the emerging concepts, by generating new conceptual models (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459310371081">Malpass et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We decided to use the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459310371081">NCCAM, 2009</xref>) definition of CAM, excluding spiritual healing, and conventional diet and exercise regimes (topics we considered needed a separate study). These therapies were to be provided within a cultural context where they are not considered to be traditional forms of healing. The NCCAM definition is widely accepted in the CAM research community and provides a point of comparison with other reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459310371081">Verhoef et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-1363459310371081">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>We carried out an initial scoping search, after which we refined the research question to exclude the decision-making process, on the grounds that its inclusion would exceed our available resources. Thus the focus of our study was people’s experiences of using complementary therapies after a diagnosis of cancer. We developed a string of search terms for the research question with the help of experts in the field, which is available from the authors. We carried out systematic sequential electronic searches of PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Web of Knowledge, AMED and PsycInfo, as well as hand searching, reference list searching and a Google search. This yielded 4833 articles including duplicates. The inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed articles in academic journals, published in English between 1998 and 2007, using wholly or mainly qualitative methods of both data collection and analysis; and meeting the NCCAM definition excluding spiritual healing, and conventional diet and exercise regimes. On the basis of titles and/or abstracts, we excluded articles because they were irrelevant to the study question, were not qualitative, were not mainly or totally about cancer, were not about CAM, had inadequate descriptions of methodology or were not published in a refereed journal. This left 99 articles which broadly fitted the research question criteria. We read closely the abstracts or full articles, as necessary, for these articles, and rejected 73; reasons for rejection include not being fully or mainly qualitative, not in English, not being primarily about experiences of complementary therapy use or for not fitting the NCCAM definition of complementary therapies. The final sample for the synthesis consisted of 26 qualitative or mainly qualitative articles (see References). At least two members of the project team independently extracted data from the selected articles using data extraction sheets. These sheets required details of each article including aspects of the study setting, and first and second order constructs. A quality appraisal sheet for each article consisted of 10 sensitizing questions about the aims, theoretical perspective, sampling, analysis and reflexivity. Rather than weighting the answers to these questions, we gave each article an overall assessment score of 1 (excellent) – 4 (poor), but did not use the scores as a criterion for exclusion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459310371081">Table 1</xref>). Previous experience suggests that poor quality articles with a few findings but little original analysis provide confirmatory evidence in support of the better articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459310371081">Atkins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459310371081">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

We made lists of the original authors’ interpretations, explanations and key constructs, known as second order constructs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459310371081">Britten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459310371081">Malpass et al., 2009</xref>) from each article. Together with quotations from participants (first order constructs), these constituted the data for the synthesis. Using the network function of Atlas-ti, we considered the key constructs in relation to those in the other articles, and we identified overarching concepts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459310371081">Table 2</xref>). We carried out the translation by making translation grids for each overarching concept in which, for each article, there were separate columns for first and second order constructs; we identified what each second order construct was contrasted with (for example noting that integration was contrasted with fragmentation in some articles). The terminology from the original articles was preserved in the translation grids as far as possible, including participants’ own words in the columns for first order constructs. The translation grids were drawn up by the first author and circulated to the other authors for confirmation; all differences were resolved in the course of discussion. On the basis of these grids, we were able to summarize and describe each overarching concept, and were also able to map which articles included which concepts. By examining the relationships of these concepts to one another using successive diagrams and lists, the synthesis produced the following outputs: (1) a line of argument synthesis; (2) a composite narrative of complementary therapy use after a diagnosis of cancer; and (3) a synthesis model. The line of argument synthesis describes the overarching concepts and shows how they fit together in a way that describes the patient journey, and is described in the results section. The composite narrative summarizes this journey as if it applied to a hypothetical individual (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459310371081">Figure 1</xref>). The synthesis model provides a visual display of the concepts to show their relationships with one another and the three levels of analysis which emerged from the synthesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363459310371081">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Line of argument</title>
<p>We identified six overarching third order concepts, which are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459310371081">Table 2</xref>. These concepts include positive and negative aspects of the experience of using complementary therapies, and encompass a number of barriers and facilitators to the achievement of positive outcomes. The concepts emerged differently according to the treatment type/stage of illness. We linked them together in a line of argument that accounts for cancer patients’ experiences of using complementary therapies.</p>
<p>While our study focused on experiences after a diagnosis of cancer, our line of argument implicitly starts at a stage before this, at the point of diagnosis of cancer. The diagnosis stage for cancer or life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, is a point of major disruption and loss of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459310371081">Gately et al., 2008</xref>). In this state, many people felt a sense of being out of control, a loss of identity, a disruption to the familiar life narrative. Our study focuses on what happens after this point, for people with a diagnosis of cancer who use complementary therapies.</p>

<title>Complementary therapies as a way of taking back control over life at a time of disruption (Concept 1)</title>
<p>Participants in these articles used complementary therapies in a variety of ways, but generally as ways of feeling more in control of the situation they were in – either in terms of taking/having control over their treatment, the progression of the illness or of having some control over symptoms of the illness or the biomedical treatment, such as nausea or pain. In the majority of cases, participants did not want to take charge of their biomedical treatment, but they did want an area of their life and treatment in which they could take charge:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I do the yoga and meditation I’m in better control of myself, physically and mentally. Not that it works all the time. Doing meditation on a regular basis takes self-discipline. Now it’s to the point that if I don’t do it, I really notice it. Things go haywire. (First order construct, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459310371081">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>: 63)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A major theme among the authors writing up these articles was the ways in which complementary therapies could empower cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459310371081">Bennett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459310371081">Bilhult and Dahlberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459310371081">Dunwoody et al., 2002</xref>). The second order concept of <italic>Empowerment</italic> was used less often by the participants, who tended to talk about the more pragmatic benefits of complementary treatment – the social side, the sense of taking control, the relief from pain or nausea. For example, a man contrasted trying to do something for himself with the experience of passivity in his conventional treatment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just wanted more, I thought there’s got to be more to this than just medical treatment actually … they’ll stop my chemotherapy after twelve treatments so then they’re going to give my body a rest and that’ll be interesting, and I’m kind of looking forward to that actually, … to see without the treatment what I can do, and if the cancer comes back, all I can say at the moment is that I am giving my best to try and do something. (First order construct of man, age 49 with metastatic colorectal cancer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459310371081">Evans et al., 2007</xref>: 520)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This study has several examples of participants actively <italic>surrendering control</italic> through complementary therapies. This was conceptualized by the authors as an empowering activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459310371081">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459310371081">Montbriand, 1998</xref>). This highlights ‘stages’ in the process of feeling ‘empowered’. Some people needed to ‘let go’ first in order to ‘regain a new sense of control’. In some instances, complementary therapies provided a means of letting go, of relaxing, or ‘disconnecting’. Seeing a therapist involved some handover of control since it implied a level of trust in the unknown person and therapy. The study demonstrated that there was a range of ways in which, as a result of complementary therapies, patients regained a sense of control or empowerment over different areas of their lives, in association with complementary therapy use, and that letting go or surrendering control was a powerful experience for some at this time.</p>
<p>While this increased patient control was often welcomed by both patients and health professionals, there was a downside when treatments seemed not to have the expected or desired effect, putting a burden of choice on the patients.</p>

<sec id="section11-1363459310371081">
<title>Complementary therapies as a way of connecting (Concept 2)</title>
<p>In the context of feeling isolated after a diagnosis of cancer, many participants experienced a sense of connecting as an important factor in their complementary treatment. There were three main aspects of feeling connected through complementary therapy use.</p>
<sec id="section12-1363459310371081">
<title>Connecting with care provider/a therapeutic relationship</title>
<p>Some articles found that a major weakness within biomedical treatments mentioned was the personal care aspect and hospital setting, which was viewed as depersonalized. People turned to complementary therapies for more personal care:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had such a lot on my mind – I just talked which was also very helpful (the reflexologist) was so very helpful and caring. She not only made my feet comfy and my mind more calm, but she helped with advice. (First order construct from woman having reflexology in palliative care setting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459310371081">Gambles et al., 2002</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sometimes the time taken engaging in the complementary therapy was the factor which led to stronger relationships and better communication than with the often rushed biomedical system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1363459310371081">
<title>Connecting mind and body</title>
<p>A facet of connectedness which was regularly identified by participants and authors was the idea of connecting, or reconnecting, between mind and body, or body and spirit. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459310371081">Astin et al. (2006)</xref> noted that movement therapies were used to reduce stress and connect with the mind and body, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459310371081">Moore and Speigel (2000)</xref> suggested that complementary therapies were helping cancer patients to re-connect with their bodies. A number of authors made links between well-being and Connecting relating to the physical and emotional connection between one’s mind and body, or a healthy and sick body, or between body and spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459310371081">Angen, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1363459310371081">
<title>Connecting with others in a social group</title>
<p>A recurring theme was that participants valued their complementary treatment as a means of connecting with others, especially in a group therapy situation. For some, this chance to meet and socialize with others in the same situation was the primary benefit of their complementary treatment, and a way of reducing feelings of isolation and depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459310371081">Walker et al. (2007)</xref> found that mutual support in a group context was an important aspect of auriculo-therapy treatment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I thought it was beneficial actually because the cancer tends to cut you off you see people in the clinics, and on the wards, but here it was just so nice to know that these are people that are leaving little drips everywhere.

<title>Changes in well-being and quality of life: pragmatic benefits and downsides of complementary therapies (Concept 3)</title>
<p>People sometimes used complementary therapies in a very pragmatic way – in the hope of possible specific and tangible benefits. Important outcomes (from the patient perspective) of using complementary treatments after a diagnosis of cancer include the local, perhaps short term benefits of pain relief, time to talk to a therapist and better social relationships. Complementary treatments enhanced ‘well-being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459310371081">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459310371081">Walker et al., 2007</xref>) and current ‘quality of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459310371081">Correa-Velez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459310371081">Evans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459310371081">Ribeiro and Harrigan, 2006</xref>) for patients struggling to cope with both the symptoms of cancer and relief from the symptoms of conventional treatment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I found that, on the days when I had my acupuncture, right after my treatment I had less nausea; I had less fatigue. I had less of a problem with constipation. I was much more relaxed’ (First order construct from woman with advanced cancer, having acupuncture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459310371081">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>: 34).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants viewed complementary therapies as a treat or reward, rather than a treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459310371081">Dunwoody et al. (2002)</xref> highlighted the concept of aromatherapy as a reward, with participants having time for themselves without the demands of others; while the hands-on approach gave a feeling of worth and being cared for. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459310371081">Angen (2003)</xref> found that deep relaxation and meditation could be antidotes to the anxiety of tests, treatments and awaiting results.</p>
<sec id="section16-1363459310371081">
<title>Negative effects on well-being: sense of failure or guilt</title>
<p>There appeared to be two particular ways in which use of complementary therapies could foster a sense of failure. In some cases, relevant to most forms of complementary therapies, if the cancer recurred or spread, the participant sometimes felt that the complementary therapy had failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459310371081">Markovic et al., 2006</xref>). This may be related to an often unstated hope that it would effect a cure. The other type of sense of failure highlighted in these articles was the sense of personal failure or inadequacy if a person felt incapable of succeeding with a therapy; this was particularly so concerning the mind–body therapies. Patients blamed themselves for being unable to visualize, be positive or stick to a regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459310371081">Humpel and Jones, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459310371081">Moore and Speigel, 2000</xref>). Guilt and sense of failure were therefore negative outcomes of an approach based on taking control or thinking positive. Often unable to discuss their treatments with biomedical professionals, some patients felt left alone to deal with issues arising from complementary treatments.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1363459310371081">
<title>Transformation (Concept 4)</title>
<p>Cancer itself is often seen as a transformational experience. The notion of complementary therapies as transformative experiences in themselves, and/or a means of personal or spiritual growth, was explicitly identified in several of the articles, and implicitly in others, though in some articles the two were not differentiated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459310371081">Mulkins and Verhoef (2004)</xref> looked specifically at the nature of transformation: ‘Participants’ stories revealed that transformation involved learning about themselves: becoming more aware of who they are and how they relate to the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459310371081">Mulkins and Verhoef, 2004</xref>: 232). This concept encompassed the notion that change was not just about the illness or treatment or response, but about changes to one’s whole outlook on life and practices.</p>
<p>Some participants underwent a transformative experience through their use of complementary therapies. It is important to note that participants, when asked about the experiences of complementary therapies, talked more about immediate benefits and quality of life (as first order concepts), rather than in terms of transformation (a second order concept). This may be partly a way of talking; participants typically used everyday language, not abstract concepts. It is also likely that, for many participants, the benefits were at the level of improving immediate quality of life, which they felt had substantial intrinsic value.</p>
<p><italic>Spirituality</italic> was an emerging first and second order construct in many articles. Our understanding of spirituality in this context draws on recent theorization of the concept’s use in cancer research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459310371081">Koffman et al., 2008</xref>), and is closely linked to our definition of Transformation. This is exemplified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459310371081">Mackenzie et al. (2007</xref>: 67) while evaluating a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme: ‘Despite the programme’s secular stance, the development of spirituality may be an inevitable outcome of the practice, as one becomes aware of the intricate interconnections among themselves, other individuals and eventually all aspects of nature through direct experience.’</p>
<p>Participants regularly mentioned spiritual aspects of their complementary therapy experience; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459310371081">Astin et al. (2006)</xref> found that the majority of their participants considered psychosocial and spiritual activities to be linked and crucial in treatment and recovery:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Support groups [are part of complementary medicine] because your mind and spirit have a huge amount to do with healing for anything … knowing you’re not alone’ (First order construct from woman with breast cancer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459310371081">Astin et al., 2006</xref>: 166).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1363459310371081">
<title>Polarization (Concept 5)</title>
<p>The most notable barrier to patients reporting a satisfactory experience was the perceived polarization of complementary therapies and conventional biomedicine (for more details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459310371081">Smithson et al., 2010</xref>). Many authors noted that participants experienced complementary therapies and biomedicine as opposing and polarized approaches to health and disease. It was rare for the two to be experienced in an integrated system. Many patients found it hard to talk to their biomedical practitioners about their decisions to use, or experiences of, complementary therapies, and consequently, they worried about the compatibility of treatments, and about incurring the disapproval of their biomedical practitioners. A common theme in many articles was of experience of hostility from biomedicine towards complementary therapies. Moreover, the difficulties in openly talking about complementary therapies with biomedical practitioners is probably a significant deterrent for many patients in their wish to experiment with complementary therapies, as the articles in this study mainly reflect the views of those who overcame this barrier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1363459310371081">
<title>Integration (Concept 6)</title>
<p>Integration was explicitly identified as a concept in several of the articles, and implicitly in others. The explicit mentions were mainly in studies of integrative health care by Mulkins and Verhoef. Some participants had had positive experiences of some level of integration of complementary therapies and biomedical treatment (either in the same location, or provided by a united team), and others wished for better integration between the two. Participants felt that having the chance to explore and find the right fit of practitioners and modalities helped to create an optimal environment for getting the most out of the available treatments. Experience of integrated systems, or of a unified health service offering biomedicine and complementary therapies options, was almost universally appreciated, and these services facilitated a positive experience for participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1363459310371081">
<title>Composite narrative</title>
<p>The overall ‘story’ of the experience of complementary therapy use after a diagnosis of cancer was notably consistent, despite the articles having been conducted in a variety of countries, and encompassing a wide range of treatments. The composite story in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459310371081">Figure 1</xref> presents the findings in narrative form as an individual person’s experience.

<p>A model of the synthesis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363459310371081">Figure 2</xref> and mainly represents the perspective of the study, which focused primarily on the patient experience.

<title>Systematic variations and individual differences</title>
<p>Within the consistent overall ‘story’ of the experience of using complementary therapies after a diagnosis of cancer, there were variations which are associated with stage of illness, type of treatment and individual preferences. Systematic differences for each key concept due to context, treatment type, and illness stage are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459310371081">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459310371081">Markovic et al. (2006)</xref> explored four different types of ways in which women with gynaecological cancer used complementary therapies, and linked this, provisionally, to stage of cancer. Few articles compared gender differences, as many of the articles had predominantly or totally female samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459310371081">Evans et al. (2007)</xref> looked specifically at men’s experiences, finding that men were keener on ‘anti-cancer’ or health maintenance remedies in the form of ingested tablets or preparations, as opposed to ‘touch therapies’, which other articles showed to be more popular among women. Their article suggested that complementary therapies provided a powerful vehicle for men to communicate need for support.</p>

<sec id="section23-1363459310371081" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study demonstrates that for many patients, using complementary treatments after a diagnosis of cancer was a very positive experience. Participants particularly liked having time to develop a relationship with a therapy or treatment provider, and with other therapy users, and to feel listened to. Many people appreciated the complementarity of biomedicine and other therapies – different approaches, different carers and (for some) different locations. The different patient expectations from complementary therapies have been noted in other studies: participants in a study of the meanings of complementary therapy use for people with HIV stressed the importance for participants of healing, as distinct from curing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459310371081">Pawluch et al., 2000</xref>). Most patients used ‘alternative’ treatments after a diagnosis of cancer as complementary, not alternative, and often to deal with non-medical aspects of the disease – taking control, relieving symptoms, social interaction, having a ‘treat’ rather than treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459310371081">Bishop et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings suggest that people with cancer not only ‘<italic>desire</italic> elements of the therapeutic process that currently are not adequately acknowledged and promoted by existing biomedical measures of effectiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459310371081">Broom and Tovey, 2007</xref>: 1023, emphasis added), but that their experience of care leads to them <italic>valuing</italic> these elements at different stages of their journeys with different types of cancer. Evaluations of effectiveness should, therefore, consider how to encompass all of the concepts in our model, specifically including control/empowerment, the different aspect of connecting, and transformation/spirituality alongside the more accepted outcomes of symptom relief and improved well-being. Our findings suggest that some of these elements may be more important in some types or stages of cancer than others – an area where our model could usefully form the basis for further research.</p>
<p>The experience of complementary therapies as a means of gaining control over their life, health or treatment was portrayed, by both participants and authors, as a positive benefit, and reflects a wider discourse of actively fighting cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459310371081">Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 2000</xref>), and also a shift of responsibility from health professionals to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459310371081">Sinding and Gray, 2005</xref>). While this increased patient control was often welcomed by both patients and health professionals, there was a downside when treatments seemed not to have the expected or desired effect – this put a burden of choice on the patients, both at the stage of choosing treatment options, when the onus was on the patient to make safe and informed decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459310371081">Öhlén et al., 2006</xref>), and accounting for a sense of failure or guilt. The concept of control, a theme that is also common in the decision-making literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459310371081">Bishop et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459310371081">Verhoef et al., 2005b</xref>), was used in many different ways in the articles we studied and was often ill-defined. Further work in this area could usefully unpick the different meanings associated with this concept. For example, the concept of surrendering control as a point along the way to ‘re-gaining control’, or of gaining empowerment through complementary medicine use, was also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459310371081">Pawluch et al. (2000)</xref> in their study of people with HIV.</p>
<p>Although our focus was on experiences of individual patients, several contextual factors were an important part of patients’ accounts. Consequently our synthesis model includes a practitioner level and an organizational level that are spanned by two of the key concepts: polarization and integration. The most notable barrier to patients reporting a satisfactory experience was the perceived polarization of complementary therapies and conventional biomedicine. At the professional level the notion of medical dominance was evident in the descriptions of biomedical hostility to complementary therapies that limited patients’ ability to choose and manage their own care in ways which seemed appropriate to them. As participants viewed complementary therapies as ‘complementary’ and not impacting on their desire for biomedical care, this hostility appears misplaced. At the organizational level our findings confirm those from recent studies elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459310371081">Shuval et al., 2002</xref>), that even when complementary therapies were tolerated or included in mainstream health care, the dominance of biomedicine and push towards polarization was always in the same direction. It appears that the integration called for in the National Health Service (NHS) guidelines <italic>Improving Supportive and Palliative Care for Adults with Cancer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459310371081">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2004</xref>) is an important area of care for many people with cancer. Our synthesis highlights a need for increased opportunities for cancer patients to feel they can discuss alternative treatment options with biomedical practitioners, and experience integrated health care, in terms of collaboration between practitioners, and sharing knowledge between sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459310371081">Cant and Sharma, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The strengths and limitations of the study relate to those of the primary studies that we synthesized as well as those of our own methods. Previous experience of conducting meta-ethnographies suggests that although quality appraisal of eligible articles is helpful in guiding their interpretation, ‘poor quality’ on check-list criteria should not be seen as a reason for exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459310371081">Atkins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459310371081">Britten et al., 2002</xref>). Many authors of the articles in this study were new to analysing and writing about qualitative research – weaknesses compounded by limited word counts in many medical journals. Inclusion of articles with small sample sizes limited data and inadequate contextualization might lead to the concepts developed becoming less grounded in the participants’ experiences. We employed a number of strategies to minimize this limitation, including regular discussions of method and findings in a multi-disciplinary team that included patient, biomedical, complementary and social science perspectives of cancer and its treatment. The synthesis was carried out by experienced qualitative researchers, including a social scientist with no previous experience in complementary therapies who worked full-time on the project for 12 months. The experience of cancer – diagnosis, treatment choices and experiences, outcomes – is often conceptualized as a journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459310371081">Reisfield and Wilson, 2004</xref>), a long term experience, including cancer survivorship. Most research articles tend to be snapshots of participants at a particular stage of the journey; in contrast a meta-ethnography provides a fuller picture of the experiences of people at a range of stages, with different types of cancer, using different therapies. Despite the diversity of patient populations and complementary therapies, the method enabled us to identify key concepts common to these diverse experiences. Future research in this area could focus on the nature of treatment and stage of the disease, and their relevance to the experience of complementary therapies. The study also highlights the need for longitudinal studies of the journey through complementary therapy use from diagnosis of cancer to long term effects.</p>
<p>In addition, a clearer understanding of what elements of the therapeutic process are important to people at the individual level and how these elements are affected by factors at the professional and organizational levels, can guide both the evaluation and the provision of such services in the future.</p>
