<abstract>
<p>In ethnographic research, expectations and guidelines presented in textbooks often differ from the practice of researchers in the field. This is especially true when studying criminals in general and drug dealers in particular. Based on qualitative interviews with 15 ethnographers studying drug dealers, we discuss seven important methodological issues that emerge when doing this type of research. These issues include approach/recruitment, enticing consent/payment, drug use of both participants and researchers, the use of audio recorders, physical and legal security, ethical dilemmas, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) problems. We argue that ethnographers need to make “standing decisions” about how to address issues about recruiting participants, enticing them to consent, recording interviews, consuming drugs or alcohol, addressing ethical dilemmas, and dealing with IRBs. Having these standing decisions will facilitate more methodologically rigorous and ethically sound decisions, and produce higher quality research.</p>

<body>
<p>The value of ethnographic research for understanding the social worlds of offenders is undeniable. The insights gained from seeking the perspective of offenders about the way they make sense of their lives have guided much contemporary criminological and sociological research on crime. Ethnographic research involves a multitude of complex designs and seldom plays out as originally constructed. Inevitably, ethnographers will be faced with a number of practical, methodological, and ethical issues. Although those who engage in quantitative research can consult guidebooks about proper sample sizes and survey construction, ethnographers often do not have such luxuries. They are often left to make their own decisions about the best way to collect data or to deal with practical and ethical issues such as how to approach participants, whether to pay them, drug use of both participants and the researcher and physical and legal security. Such blind spots make it difficult for those embarking on ethnographic research to know what to expect and to be prepared to make sound ethical and methodological decisions when problems emerge. Although there is an ethnographic narrative that is a part of casual banter among ethnographers, much of what we do remains hidden.</p>
<p>Although it is true that much can be learned about doing ethnographies from textbooks and method sections, such sources seldom tell the whole story. Often, they describe the normative expectations of ethnography and not how ethnographers carry it out in practice. Occasionally, although increasingly common, ethnographers have reflected on their own projects to offer insights into how their work was done (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612465275">Adler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612465275">Dunlap &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612465275">Jacobs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612465275">Librett &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>). This body of literature has revealed a “hidden ethnography” where researchers use drugs, engage in sexual relationships, and participate in various legal indiscretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612465275">Blackman, 2007</xref>). These are the issues that ethnographers are reluctant to explore or write about for fear of legal or professional repercussions. Such idiographic approaches are valuable, but we believe that a more nomothetic approach is also valuable as it minimizes the idiosyncrasies of individual researchers. Specifically, we believe that much can be gained by speaking with ethnographers about their experiences.</p>
<p>In this study, we shed light on the methodological backstage of ethnographies by presenting the stories and opinions of researchers who study drug dealers. We will go into details on this particular kind of research, but our perspective is broader than that. Our aim is to provide general insights into the potential issues that researchers may face when studying offenders and discuss the decisions and rationales made by those ethnographers we interviewed. In line with the modus operandi of qualitative research, we move from the particular to the more general. We believe that the insights and discussions in this article will allow new ethnographers to develop a plan (i.e., standing decisions) so they can act more quickly and more effectively when problems emerge.</p>
<p>We begin by reviewing the ethnographic literature on drug dealers with a focus on methodological approaches. The studies reviewed are on a continuum from extensive ethnographic fieldwork and observation to in-depth interviews, either on the streets or in correctional institutions. Because these methods involve leaving the office, interacting with people, and seeing them in their social surroundings, we consider them to be ethnographic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612465275">1</xref></sup> The examples we provide are intended to give an idea of the different ways to study offenders and will be used as a starting point for discussing the limits and possibilities of ethnographic research on these populations. After discussing our methodological approach, we turn to seven methodological issues ethnographers faced during their research (some hidden and some not). These include approach/recruitment, enticing consent/payment, drug use of both participants and the researcher, practical issues (e.g., using audio recorders), physical and legal security, ethical dilemmas, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) issues. We believe a discussion of these issues will help future scholars to better design their projects and give a more realistic glimpse into how scholars conduct ethnographic research on offenders.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022042612465275">
<title>From Extensive Fieldwork to Interviews</title>
<p>We have learned a great deal about the social worlds of those who use and deal drugs by seeking their perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612465275">Carlson, Singer, Stephens, &amp; Sterk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612465275">Moore &amp; Maher, 2002</xref>). Those who choose to collect data directly from drug dealers have numerous options for doing so. In the broadest sense, these strategies can be divided into two categories—fieldwork and interviews—but such divisions are ideal types as much research blends the two. Studies based on extensive fieldwork use a method most often associated with anthropology. Here, researchers spend a great deal of time in the field with the hope of understanding the social system or culture. The researchers often live in the same area as the group under study and develop personal friendships with members of the group. Such research is typically well written, often reading like journalism or exciting novels, and offers insights and understanding of people who are largely unknown to the general public. Data from fieldwork include informal interviews, direct personal observation, and personal experiences. Some studies combine long fieldworks with interviews collected from a sample of dealers as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612465275">Bucerius, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612465275">Lalander, 2003</xref>). Fieldwork is thought by many to be the ideal ethnographic approach because researchers get access to a multitude of data and interact with members of a community over an extended period and in different settings.</p>
<p>Patricia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612465275">Adler’s (1985)</xref> study of an upper level drug dealing and smuggling community typifies fieldwork on active drug users. During postgraduate studies, Adler and her husband befriended a neighbor (who was a drug dealer) and nurtured the friendship with him for 6 years. In this way, they reached a group of drug dealers and smugglers who are seldom studied through direct observation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612465275">Phillipe Bourgois’ (1996)</xref> study of crack dealers in New York is another celebrated fieldwork study. Bourgois spent more than 5 years living (with his girlfriend and child) in one of the more dangerous ghettos in North America. Through his emerging friendship with this group of dealers, he learned how a crack house was managed and organized, and developed the concept of street culture. Contemporary contributions based on fieldwork include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612465275">Bucerius (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612465275">Hoffer (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612465275">Lalander (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022042612465275">Venkatesh (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022042612465275">2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612465275">Ward (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022042612465275">2010</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022042612465275">Zaitch (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>At the other end of the ethnographic spectrum is research based on ethnographic interviews. Studies with interviews as the primary source of data typically have a higher number of research participants (from 20 or 30 to several hundred) than do studies using fieldwork (which often focus on a few participants). A typical example of this style of research is Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612465275">Jacobs’s (1999)</xref> study of street corner crack dealing. For weeks, Jacobs walked or drove slowly through an area known for crack dealing to capitalize on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612465275">Goffman (1971)</xref> described as “second seeings” among the street dealers. The approach was unsuccessful initially, as the dealers believed he was an undercover police officer. A few weeks later, he decided to get in direct contact with dealers. At first he was often told to get “the hell out of here,” but after appearing repeatedly, being stopped by police, and offering money for interviews, he collected 40 interviews with active street-level crack dealers.</p>
<p>Other examples of interview-based drug dealer ethnographies include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612465275">Caulkins, Johnson, Taylor, and Taylor (1999)</xref>, who observed more than 1,500 crack sellers and interviewed 300 dealers, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612465275">Waldorf, Reinarman, and Murphy (1991)</xref>, who interviewed more than 267 cocaine users and dealers. Interview-based studies with smaller samples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612465275">Jacques and Bernasco’s (in press)</xref> study of street dealers in Amsterdam and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612465275">Sandberg and Pedersen’s (2009)</xref> study of street cannabis dealers in Oslo. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612465275">Mohamed and Fritsvold (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612465275">Sandberg (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612465275">Sandberg and Pedersen (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612465275">Jacques and Wright (2008b)</xref> used similar approaches to study middle-class dealers.</p>
<p>Probably, the leading method in qualitative drug research today is to interview participants where they are permanently stuck or have plenty of time to spare. A benefit of this research is that data can be collected quicker than when doing fieldwork. Such places include prisons, drug treatment centers, youth homes, and youth clubs. Although recruitment through institutions can be time effective, one should never underestimate the extra time involved when collecting data in bureaucracies. In the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612465275">Dorn, Murji, and South (1992)</xref> interviewed 80 people who, in the past, had been active in illegal drug markets. Research participants were contacted through drug and enforcement agencies and in prisons. Others have also used prison-based samples to study drug smugglers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612465275">Decker &amp; Chapman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612465275">Desroches, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612465275">Fleetwood, 2011</xref>), crack “hustlers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612465275">Copes, Hochstetler, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>), and female drug dealers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612465275">Denton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612465275">Grundetjern &amp; Sandberg, 2012</xref>). Some of these studies combined interviews with fieldwork inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612465275">Fleetwood, 2009</xref>) or outside prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612465275">Denton, 2001</xref>). By interviewing offenders in institutions, one can do several interviews a day.</p>
<p>Getting research participants is time-consuming, especially in research on drug dealers. To save time, some ethnographers have hired others (typically people with connections to drug dealers) to recruit and interview. Volkan Topalli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612465275">Topalli, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612465275">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612465275">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612465275">Topalli, Wright, &amp; Fornango, 2002</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612465275">Jacques and Wright (2008b)</xref> have used the aid of recruiters to study drug dealers. Topalli managed to get in contact with an impressive 101 drug dealers in this highly systematic manner as well as 200 other offenders (carjackers, robbers). Using recruiters gives fast access to active offenders without going through institutions or officials. Others, most notably those affiliated with the National Development and Research Institutes (NDRI), have hired insiders to conduct interviews (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612465275">Dunlap &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612465275">Johnson, Dunlap, &amp; Benoit, 2010</xref>). NDRI have systematized the interview style approach in a series of studies over a long period, and typically use trained ethnographers (many with useful personal experiences and social backgrounds) to get in contact with and interview drug dealers.</p>
<p>It is clear that much can be learned from using ethnographic methods to study drug dealers. Although many of those who engage in this research discuss various issues and dilemmas with the method, our own experiences suggest that the full stories of how research is conducted in practice are often left untold. This is likely due to space limitations and the assumption that the day-to-day problems of research are not worth including in final reports. Researchers may also leave such information out because they believe this information is too sensitive to share. Many of our interviewees, for example, wanted assurances that their responses would be kept confidential when controversial issues emerged. Such issues included their personal use of drugs and victimization, their truthfulness with and opinions about ethics committees, and their handling of ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>Scholars have written much about using the ethnographic method to study offenders, drug users, and even drug dealers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612465275">Dunlap et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612465275">Dunlap &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612465275">Fleetwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612465275">Page &amp; Singer 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612465275">VanderStaay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612465275">Ward, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612465275">Williams, Dunlap, Johnson, &amp; Hamid, 1992</xref>). However, previous contributions are typically self-reflections based on the authors’ research experiences. In this study, we take a different and more general approach by interviewing drug dealer ethnographers. By applying qualitative method to qualitative researchers, we describe the “uncensored” experiences and “hidden rules” of ethnographic research, in the same way as we study other aspects of social life. As such we offer a more generalizable portrayal of practical issues that face those engaging in ethnographies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for the current project come from semistructured interviews with 15 individuals who have engaged in ethnographic research with drug dealers. We sought out researchers from various backgrounds and methodological approaches. Some used extensive fieldwork, some used ethnographic interviewing, and many used a combination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612465275">2</xref></sup> Although 8 were from the United States and 7 were from Europe, several conducted research internationally. These ethnographers have interviewed middle-class social network dealers, high-end dealers or smugglers, street drug dealers, and socially marginalized dealers. In all, 5 were women and 10 were men. We used a purposive sampling strategy to locate participants. We sought to include participants from various stages in their ethnographic careers. We thought it important to include those who were novices (i.e., those who recently completed their first ethnographic project) and those who were experienced. We did so because we wanted a range of responses and perspectives. We contacted these individuals through email or by phone. No one we contacted declined to participate.</p>
<p>We conducted interviews either by phone (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or in person (<italic>n</italic> = 9); we recorded all interviews. Some may question the value of telephone interviews over face-to-face interviews; however, recent evaluations of research using telephone interviews suggest that this style of interviewing is advantageous, especially when interviewing “elites” such as college professors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612465275">Holt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612465275">Stephens, 2007</xref>). Our experience with the interviews is that conducting them on the phone had little effect on the quality of them. We developed the interview guide based on insights gained from interviewing drug dealers for our own research and from a review of drug-dealer-related research. The interviews lasted approximately 30 to 40 minutes and focused on such issues as recruitment, rapport, recording and interview locations, and ethical dilemmas that emerged during the research including drug use by participants and researchers.</p>
<p>Once we completed the interviews, we transcribed them for analysis. We did not use qualitative analysis software. Instead, we analyzed the interviews manually. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the questions (e.g., their own drug use), we do not provide the names of those we interviewed. In addition, because the location of the research may reveal the researchers, we disguised this information when necessary to maintain confidentiality. We also changed gender pronouns on occasion to further protect participants’ confidentiality. Finally, we asked six of the interview participants to read over drafts or quotes to ensure that confidentiality was maintained and revised based on their comments.</p>

<title>Challenges in Ethnographic Research on Offenders</title>
<p>Doing ethnographic research on drug dealers is not essentially different from doing any other kind of ethnographic research. In any ethnographic study, the researcher must gain access to the field, establish rapport with the research participants, understand hidden codes, and balance the roles of insider and outsider to get interesting data and be able to write about them. However, some of these issues, which are vital for sound ethnographic research, are intensified when the subject of study is illicit drug dealing. Here, we elaborate on the decisions ethnographers made to the practical and ethical issues that emerged during their research and their rationales for their decisions.</p>
<sec id="section4-0022042612465275">
<title>Approaching Participants</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612465275">Jacques and Wright (2008a)</xref> suggested that “success in recruitment will increase in tandem with the quantity of social interaction between researchers, recruiters, and criminals” (p. 35). Most ethnographers would agree. Gaining the first contact can be difficult, however. Approaching strangers and initiating dialogue about their illicit behaviors is difficult with drug dealers. But as illustrated by many studies, with some patience it can work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612465275">Jacobs, 1999</xref>). Ethnographers must anticipate rejection and be aware that contact gets more difficult the further up the criminal hierarchy the researcher aims. After all, we should not expect to be welcomed in a social context where we ask for much and have little to offer in return. Fortunately, there are few examples of researchers being physically injured when seeking access to drug dealers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612465275">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although those we interviewed were engaged in quite different styles of ethnography, they discussed many of the same recruitment issues. Many emphasized that skills for approaching participants and convincing them to consent could not be learned easily. They believed success depended on personality, intuition, and the “need to be the right person.” Others thought personal characteristics could be overcome by being adaptable. One interviewer said that it was important to “adapt to [participants’] rhythm; you can’t work from nine to five.” If someone wanted to talk, the interview had to be done on the spot as appointments were seldom held, and delaying interviews could risk losing respondents because they went to prison or changed their mind. Many discussed the inconvenience of this and the numerous interviews they lost due to not acting quickly.</p>
<p>Others believed that good fortune and coincidence played a more important role in recruitment than personality traits. This was the case for both interviews and extensive fieldwork. Many agreed that more training would be a good idea, but they were vague when describing the kind of training this should be. The consensus among them was that ethnographic research is learned mainly by doing and lessons on how to approach potential research participants are hard to generalize. They believed that making mistakes and adapting to the particular study and settings was a part of the research experience that could not be taught.</p>
<p>When seeking participants, many ethnographers said they simply went to and lingered where dealers hung out. Although this approach is mentioned in textbooks, they acknowledged that it was difficult to break the ice and to convince dealers that they were not undercover officers. Many had to spend considerably more time gaining access than they had anticipated. When asked whether she anticipated staying in the field as long as she did, one field-worker said,
<disp-quote>
<p>No, I thought it’s gonna take me a couple of weeks to get to know them and to do my research and that was just not the case. I naively thought it’s going to be a much quicker process . . . It took me 8 months for them to allow me to be with them in the streets when they actually did business. . . . So it took me very long to establish this kind of like trusting relationship that I would be allowed to negotiations and business transactions and these sort of things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612465275">Jacobs (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612465275">Sandberg and Pedersen (2009)</xref> recruited in similar ways and found that they needed to be at the scene for quite some time before potential participants would agree to do the interview.</p>
<p>To hang around and recruit in this manner was difficult, but some participants found numerous personal and practical advantages to this approach. Many simply found it exciting. A field-worker who had done both prison-based and street research commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I prefer the freedom of the street life. The people are more vibrant. It’s a hustle and a bustle, the life of the street is exciting to me. . . . And it was new, it was something I wasn’t familiar with. . . . And I liked the experience and I liked learning about the lifestyle. I liked the people and I liked the context in which things took place.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some found it effective to use recruiters to locate participants. Using recruiters can give a “sense of the street,” but it presents some challenges that the other approaches do not. Namely, success depends heavily on the recruiter. One researcher who used a recruiter thought it was more efficient and less dangerous than locating them himself. He described the difficulty in getting a good recruiter:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Being a good recruiter] requires a couple of things, and they’re often mutually competing factors. One is you need someone who has real credibility on the streets and somebody that’s got real connections. The problem is that credibility and those connections tend to not be compatible with being on time, being responsible, and telling the truth. . . . So they tend to be mutually exclusive concepts.</p>

<title>Enticing Consent</title>
<p>Although one may expect getting drug dealers to discuss their illegal activities would be difficult, those we interviewed found it surprisingly easy. One interviewer/field-worker explained why dealers were open to being interviewed:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you’re a criminologist you sit around at cocktail parties and talk about your methods and your theories and those sorts of things, right? Well drug dealers have the same sort of a professional life (a beginning, an initiation, and then a continuation); the same sort of career but they don’t have the same sorts of opportunities to talk about those sorts of things in that framework.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being allowed to talk about their life and skills was an important incentive for many research participants, and this often came up when researchers ended the interviews (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612465275">Copes, Hochstetler, &amp; Brown, in press</xref>). Some ethnographers believed that giving dealers an opportunity to present their own version of their lives played a part in their decision to consent. Many ethnographers used flattery to encourage them: “I always tell participants in any study that we need to have their voice and that I’m not going to present the story that usually the police presents, or the media present.” There were of course also other incentives, such as “offers of friendship” in extensive fieldworks and offers of money in interview-based studies.</p>
<p>Many believed it was important to offer economic incentives to entice participation. Ethnographers were not of like opinions regarding the importance, ethics, and rationale of paying participants. Although it appears that it is the norm for those who conduct one-shot interviews with drug dealers to offer some form of payment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612465275">Copes, Brown, &amp; Tewksbury, 2011</xref>), those who advocate payment do so for differing reasons (both pragmatic and philosophical). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022042612465275">Wright and Decker (1997)</xref> argued the pragmatic reason for paying participants, stating, “It is a cardinal rule of streets life that one should never do anything for nothing” (p. 19). Many interviewees shared this belief and experience. Without money, the famous snowball may melt before it can accumulate in this kind of research.</p>
<p>Money was a strong incentive, but many argued that offering money was more than a practical issue. They saw it as symbolic of the importance of the research and of the respect for participants’ time and insights (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612465275">Dunlap &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). As one interviewer said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that it’s important to compensate them for their time. They are sharing information with us and sometimes I’m amazed at what people tell us. Most of our research is with low-income communities of color. So people who aren’t listened to a lot anyway. They often tell their ethnographers at the end of an interview that they found it very therapeutic. That they were just happy to have someone listen to them. But, we do ask them to spend an hour or an hour and a half talking with us and so we do design the incentive on an hourly basis.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such claims about the therapeutic value of interviews are common in ethnographic research in general and in drug research in particular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612465275">Copes et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Others argued that providing financial incentives reflected the legitimacy of the research; it showed that researchers were not social workers or police but professionals seeking their expertise. As one ethnographer we interviewed stated, “In recent years, we’ve realized that when you’re talking to people like this, about these kinds of serious issues, I think the amount of money you give them serves as a signal to them of how legitimate you are.” Another participant said “that the payment in some way honors them as an expert.”</p>
<p>For those who have decided to pay participants, it was necessary to determine an appropriate fee. How much is enough to show “respect” for their time and expertise, but not so much as to be coercive? Like most aspects of qualitative research, the answer to this question is unclear and often situational. In general, those doing single interviews (with active dealers) offered approximately US$50 per hour of interview. One interview participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Fifty dollars an hour seemed like a professional amount of money. . . . They are consultants to the project and so we were able to get away with $100 as sort of standard amount of money that you pay.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another interviewer echoed this statement,
<disp-quote>
<p>And there’s a certain extent to which anything less than $50 is seen as insulting. I have no problem going to $50 to $75 or even $100 for an interview if it’s for somebody who’s going to give me really good data.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although most who paid participants pointed to overarching philosophies about payment, several acknowledged they paid this amount because that was what others had done in the past; it was the amount they could get through IRB with, or it was the amount they had in the budget. When asked why they chose their amount, they answered with responses such as, “I think that was the going rate for offenders on [my mentor’s] projects.” Echoing this, another said, “To be honest with you it was an amount that we’d been using when I was working with [my mentor].”</p>
<p>A few of those we spoke with said that they did not pay all participants the same amount; a fact not always mentioned in method sections or to ethics committees. Sometimes this occurred because the researcher relied on friendships with some of the participants. Two ethnographers, who were in graduate school at the time they did their interviews, said that they asked some of those they had good rapport with to do the interview for free. Many participants obliged. As one explained, “There were a couple of guys I just said, ‘It would help me out because I’ll be able to get more people if you let me just do you for free.’ And they’re cool with it.” Another ethnographer said her team paid one dealer considerably more than others to gain his consent. The rationale for doing so was that this dealer was the drug supplier for the other dealers in the study; thus, his higher position warranted higher compensation.</p>
<p>Those who use recruiters to locate suitable participants always paid for their services. Much like participants, there was considerable variation in how much researchers paid them. The majority of ethnographers paid recruiters less than they paid participants. This was because they did not want to create the impression that the recruiter was more important to the process than were the participants. However, several did pay recruiters more. They argued that “in many respects the recruiter is more important than the participants because the recruiter comes before them. For some studies, no recruiter, no dealers.”</p>
<p>Despite claims about the necessity of paying participants, it is possible to recruit active and incarcerated drug dealers without remuneration. This is especially true when one has established rapport with participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612465275">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2008a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612465275">Evans, Forsyth, and Gauthier (2002)</xref> were able to interview 23 crack users/dealers without offering them incentives (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612465275">Copes, Brunson, Forsyth, &amp; White, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612465275">Copes, Forsyth, &amp; Brunson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612465275">Decker and Chapman (2008)</xref> interviewed 34 federally convicted drug smugglers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612465275">Sandberg and Pedersen (2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612465275">Sandberg, 2012</xref>) interviewed 25 cannabis dealers without payment of any kind. As mentioned previously, several of the interviewees recruited friends with no compensation.</p>
<p>Some of the ethnographers believed that paying participants can lead to problems, which is especially true for those engaged in long-term field research. They argued that money could destroy the relationship between the researcher and the participant. One field-worker argued that researchers should be able to find more effective ways of enticing cooperation than paying for it. Another said, “I’m always leery of paying people for interviews ’cause then it makes it a transaction, rather than a conversation. . . . I think it’s a more natural conversation when money is not part of the equation.”</p>
<p>The basic assumption for field-workers was that establishing relationships with participants offered greater data than simply paying for it. Once relationships were established, offering money was thought to create awkwardness between parties or could be seen as insulting. One ethnographer supported the notion that the researcher should be “more of a friend than a researcher.” She added, “I was a friend who was doing research rather than a researcher.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612465275">Hoffer (2006)</xref> described how the two main heroin dealers in his study declined to take money after personal bonds had become closer. He interpreted this as a sign of an emerging friendship. Such claims are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612465275">Jacques and Wright’s (2008a)</xref> theory that the price of interviews can be less if drug dealers are close in “relational distance” to the researcher. If the relationship is too close, offering money could be seen as awkward and potentially offensive for some, for example, when interviewing friends of friends or dealers situated in the same social context as the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612465275">Sandberg, 2012</xref>). The offer of money could potentially make the interview less legitimate and be associated with “snitching.” One of those we interviewed did say that some of the friends he interviewed refused the money initially. It was not until he told participants that the money was not coming from his pocket that they agreed to accept the payment.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022042612465275">
<title>Drug Use of Participants and Researchers</title>
<p>When doing ethnographic research on active drug dealers, it is possible that participants will be under the influence of legal and illegal drugs. Although many outside the drug research field consider this a threat to validity (i.e., how can we trust what they are saying?), none of those we interviewed believed this to be true. As one pointed out, “[Dealers] were so accustomed to being high that it was just their normal state of being anyway.” Some reasoned that it would be impractical to insist that participants be “clean” during all interactions, especially if the aim was to get information about their social milieu and culture. Another emphasized the practical problems, and seemed perplexed that we asked about drug use: “I mean, if [they] stay out all the time, how am I going to interview [them] sober?” Several claimed that frequent drug users were more stressed and harder to interview when they were not using drugs. Thus, much of what is learned about drug dealers comes from those who are intoxicated, a fact seldom mentioned in research products.</p>
<p>Of course, research participants could not be overly intoxicated and had to be able to give clear accounts for an interview to be worth the time and effort. Supporting this claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612465275">Jacobs and Wright (2006)</xref> reported that “one person we were supposed to interview got so high on drugs before coming to speak with us that he could not climb the hill that leads to our office (we interviewed his associate instead)” (p. 22). One interviewer commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember one time a guy came in and was just nodding out. And I knew what drugs they used ’cause they were telling us. The guy came in and started nodding out, took his shoes off, started nodding out and I mean, he answered my questions but I said, “We can do this tomorrow if you want.” He said, “No, no, no, let’s finish it now.” So it’s difficult. I think I was getting good information from him but it was tough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In such circumstances, interviews may introduce errors because the respondent simply cannot stick to the point or put the details of the narrative together in a consistent and coherent manner. The pressure to get data may have led many to overlook or downplay problems with participants being intoxicated. Nevertheless, if the point of ethnography is to see the life as it is lived and made sense of by participants, the costs of inebriation may be offset by witnessing this bit of their lives.</p>
<p>Many said that the value of interviews with intoxicated participants depended on the drug being used. Many believed that alcohol and methamphetamine were the more problematic drugs and cocaine and pharmaceutical amphetamines were less problematic. Opinions were split about heroin and marijuana. Some commented that interviewees using marijuana or heroin could easily “disappear.” Reflecting on her interviews with drug smugglers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612465275">Adler (1990)</xref> stated that trying to get information from those who were high on marijuana was often ineffective because these people were “confused, sleepy, or involved in eating” (p. 105). She believes some even exaggerated symptoms of intoxication to avoid answering questions. One interviewer we spoke with believed that she could make sense of one participant despite him being high on heroin:
<disp-quote>
<p>The only time I had to interrupt was when an interviewee was on heroin. But sometimes I’ve been surprised. They have almost passed out, I’ve asked a question, and it has been silent for a long time, but then there has come a really good answer. So they’re a lot more on than you would think sometimes. But it takes more time when they’re on heroin, yes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The researcher’s use of drugs is also an important issue to consider and one that is often downplayed in the writings of ethnographers. This is probably because researchers fear it would question the “objectivity” of their research and make them susceptible to critique. Indeed, discussing drug use while in the field places researchers’ careers at risk. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612465275">Smallwood (2002)</xref> detailed the case of one ethnographer who used heroin and wrote about the experience in his field diary. This led to his suspension and eventually to his tenure being stripped.</p>
<p>It is still a fact that many ethnographers use drugs with their participants, especially in extensive fieldworks. Illegal drug use was also part of the picture for some of those we interviewed. One field-worker smoked cannabis and experimented with cocaine, and said it was important to “get a feel of what you’re talking about.” Another had research participants put rolled up, readymade joints into her bag, but she seldom smoked with them. One field-worker would “pay” research participants by giving them cannabis. The context was one of normal social interaction, where marijuana was shared, but he would normally wait until the interview was over before he joined them smoking. One had even used “harder” drugs with participants. In the fieldwork, he said that he would use only the drugs he used on other occasions. When asked whether it was good for his fieldwork, he replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>That’s a good question. I probably couldn’t have managed without that. I was only a part of those groups really because, what they were doing, that’s what I was doing. We had something in common. . . . I was very much a part of their group. I did not have to do anything to make myself to seem a part of their group. I just was. I think that was probably because I was also consuming the drugs. . . . I couldn’t have sustained field work like that over that period without being a part of it. It was very much, this is my life, this is the culture I’m immersed within, and I can study this from an academic framework as well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Researchers’ use of drugs was most typically an issue in fieldwork studies. Those doing fieldwork believed it was important to be something more than a researcher. It was necessary to establish social bonds. Consuming drugs signaled distance to social workers and police, and closeness with research participants.</p>
<p>Drug use with participants was clearly the exception though; even though some used illegal drugs privately, they usually avoided it in a research context. However, drinking alcohol was common among field-workers, but less so among interviewers, although some drank a beer or two during or after the interview. This was especially true if doing so was a natural part of a social situation, for example, when interviewing in bars. One of them commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was sometimes drunk with participants, but only with my best contacts. Sometimes in a family setting, and at a barbeque for example. Not like I was rambling around. More that you were in a good mood with them. . . . It’s a way of confirming each other as people. That you do the same thing, drinking, cheering. Then you’re not a researcher anymore.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One field-worker, who avoided using illegal drugs with participants even though he used these drugs privately, said that he could easily drink alcohol with a research participant: “I’m not the kind of ethnographer that, you know, drinks coffee for seven hours.”</p>
<p>The widespread use of alcohol would likely surprise outsiders and, together with the use of illegal drugs (for more obvious reasons), it often is toned down or not mentioned in research publications. For ethnographers in this field, drug and alcohol use makes sense. They are trying to participate in a social context where drugs play a crucial part of everyday life, and they try to make “friends.” Although using all kinds of drugs indicates intimacy, solidarity, and in-group identification, alcohol has the obvious advantage that it makes the researcher able to “join the party” without breaking the law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022042612465275">
<title>Recording Interviews</title>
<p>After locating participants, researchers confront a variety of practical issues about how best to collect data. The decision to record interviews with electronic devices or to simply take field notes is a central issue that all who use ethnographic methods must address. When looking at the broader ethnographic research published in criminology and criminal justice journals from 2000 to 2009, it appears that recording interviews is the norm. In nearly 90% of research published in the top criminology and criminal justice journals, researchers used recording devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612465275">Copes, Brown, et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the widespread acceptance of recording, not all agree with the value of doing so; this is especially true among those who interview drug dealers.</p>
<p>Again, the issue of whether to record largely fell along methodological lines. Those who sought to become insiders and friends with participants typically avoided recording interviews, except for special situations. Those who opposed using recorders suggested that doing so disrupts rapport and creates overly formal setting. One field-worker opted to not record any interviews because, “I think my relationship with them would have started closing down.” He further added,
<disp-quote>
<p>If they are friends from the beginning it’s difficult to certainly start tape recording a conversation that you’ve had for years. But if you go in as an outsider, as a very obvious researcher and maybe if you pay them, using a tape recorder is more natural in a way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still others who were opposed to recording interviews suggested that doing so was simply impractical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022042612465275">Williams (1989)</xref> argued that many of the events he participated in were too noisy for taping. One of the ethnographers we interviewed said that she typically used recorders (especially when in private settings), but in some situations, doing so was impractical. In her words, “If I’m out there and I’m sitting on the park and whole bunch of dealers are going by and we walking talking to each other . . . when I go home I write everything up.” It was also a question about ethics and safety. Not only is it difficult to get consent from everyone involved but also walking around with audio recorders is potentially dangerous. Others chose not to record due to concerns of inducing fear and suspicion among the participants. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612465275">Jacobs (1999)</xref> and Williams rejected recording because they thought drug dealers may link recording devices with undercover police. This is especially a problem in chaotic settings, when new people are being introduced to the researcher.</p>
<p>Those who argued for recording suggested that it was difficult to underestimate the value of transcriptions of interviews for data analysis. They argued that recording interviews allowed them the ability to devote more attention to the participant during the interview. Instead of taking notes, they could listen actively. One of our study participants said she would explain the rationale for recording to interviewees in this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>We can’t depend on memory. And I don’t wanna take notes through the whole thing ’cause how the hell are you going to be able to talk to me if I’m not even looking at you? I value what you have to say and the way you say it. And that’s why we use a tape recorder.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the process of analyzing and writing up the research later would have been very different had it not been for having the interviews transcribed. This goes for all kinds of analysis but is especially the case for detailed studies of language use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612465275">VanderStaay, 2003</xref>). Having to rely on field notes and notes from interviews makes the researcher more dependent on having made all the interesting observations in the first place. It also risks presenting people and cultures more in accordance with researcher’s preconceptions, rather than how they see themselves and their social worlds.</p>
<p>Interviewers also claimed that generating consent to record was easy, which they believed indicated that recording did not hamper rapport. In fact, those who engage in one time interviews said that it was rare for dealers to not consent to being recorded. One ethnographer, who had been involved in several projects with hundreds of participants said, “We haven’t had really anybody object to that except for once or twice.” When asked what he would do if a participant objected to being interviewed, one ethnographer said, “I think I’ve only had that happen once or twice in the whole 11 years I’ve been doing this.” It appears that in private settings, interviewees can overcome the barriers of recorders and act as if the recorder does not exist. When asked whether participants were skeptical of having the interview recorded, one ethnographer stated, “It’s not an issue because it’s a private thing. It’s always a private setting.” In closed setting, with persons who trust researchers and where people are not coming and going, recording was not viewed as a problem. In short, those who relied on interviews argued that recording was essential for gathering the specific words and rhythm of participants. Because they spend less time with participants, it was seen as necessary for them to not miss any words or stories as these accounts are their primary source of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022042612465275">
<title>Physical and Legal Security</title>
<p>Security and legal responsibilities are important methodological issues for those studying illegal drug dealers. Many ethnographers have given concrete advice about how to protect personal safety, including how to avoid or handle criminal, violent, and sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612465275">Williams et al., 1992</xref>). Still, it is fascinating to note how drug dealer ethnographers downplay the risk of this type of research. When asked about physical security precautions, most said they had none: “Nothing. Just these guns I call my arms,” one joked. Another said abruptly, “[Security] really wasn’t an issue.” Several mentioned that they trusted their instincts, and one field-worker/interviewer even spoke about a sixth sense:
<disp-quote>
<p>In my head, I have a sixth sense. I think we all do. If I feel that I shouldn’t go somewhere today, I don’t have a word for it, I can’t tell you something tells me this. Nothing never speaks to me or tells me anything. But it happens, I know this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of them portrayed ethnographers as the “tough guys” of criminological research, often self-presenting as fearless and unconcerned about their own safety. Risk and danger is part of the fascination with this kind of research, and ethnographers—the authors of this article included—enjoy and play on this appeal when presenting their research.</p>
<p>Still, although it is often exaggerated, a general requirement in this kind of research is courage. One interviewer commented, “There were suggestions from the IRB [Institutional Review Board] that I should put on a bullet proof vest and things like that. But of course, that’s just ridiculous. That would just completely ruin the interview.” A field-worker added, “If you’re like, ‘Oh, this is so dangerous,’ then it won’t work.” Still ethnographers working with offenders should be prepared to deal with threats of violence and sexual harassment, and should have strategies in place to minimize their risk.</p>
<p>Despite the general lack of concern about safety, those we spoke with did engage in measures to protect themselves and their teams. Many told colleagues or family where they went and asked them to call at some point and send help if no one answered. Others would only conduct interviews in public places. One especially warned against females going alone with men to their houses. Many of the field-workers could not avoid people’s home but were cautious and had certain people or places they avoided or at least checked out carefully beforehand. Moreover, one interviewer/fieldwork said he did not work after dark and tried to avoid interviewing groups of dealers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612465275">3</xref></sup> Some had strategies based on the types of dealers they interviewed: “Like the street level heroin dealers, I would always go to their houses at 9 o’clock in the morning because you wanted to go before all the other bad guys in the neighborhood were awake.”</p>
<p>It was also important to stay on good terms with interviewees, to be open about what they were doing, avoid lying, and “never underestimate their intelligence.” Some admitted to being nervous sometimes, and said that concealing this feeling was important: “The environment is so volatile you never know what’s going to happen. And so you’re always just kind of looking around but trying to be cool about it ’cause you don’t want to seem like you’re nervous.” Being perceived as fearful can put researchers in a “victim” role, making them easier targets for assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612465275">Williams et al., 1992</xref>, p. 350). Drug dealer ethnographers did much to ensure their safety, but the steps taken were flexible, varied tremendously, and depended on the different social contexts where they conducted their research. Nevertheless, our interviewees told us about being threatened with violence and rape, being robbed (with and without weapons), and being sexually harassed at times during the research. One was even beaten, but he partly blamed himself, because he was “drunk and stupid” during the incident.</p>
<p>Protecting the anonymity of research participants is of course crucial in this kind of research, maybe even more than in other kinds of ethnographic research. Researchers often ask participants to avoid talking about specific persons, giving out real names, or discussing future events. Avoiding such actions helps prevent situations where researchers are obliged to pass on information to the police or research participants later regretting having given certain information. This was often an important part of the introduction to interviews, and some argued that it also engendered trust because, “No undercover cop would ever tell an offender don’t tell me about a murder.” This interviewer added that he had heard about several murders, and other crimes, but it was always in such a general fashion that it would not be of use for the police.</p>
<p>A general rule was that if researchers learned information about a serious crime being planned (e.g., rape or murder) or if children or other innocent “third parties” may be harmed, then researchers should be obliged to tell the authorities. None regarded drug dealing or smuggling to be in this category, no matter the quantities involved. One field-worker said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I had more problems with violence I knew about and was witnessing than with the drugs. I’m of course totally aware that cocaine can ruin someone’s life and all these things. And that it’s sad, but violence was the aspect I was most struggling with.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many admitted to getting information in the “gray zones,” for example, witnessing gun trading, violence, or burglaries (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612465275">Dunlap, Johnson, &amp; Randolph, 2009</xref>). Still, even though everyone we interviewed referred to an obligation to report certain incidents, there were no examples (in these interviews or in the literature we know) of any ethnographer going to the police. It was even rare for them to inform police about their own victimization that occurred during research.</p>
<p>Researchers’ confidentiality is not protected legally in the same way as, for example, doctors, lawyers, and psychologists. Some mentioned a certificate of confidentiality they brought with them, whereas others just showed their business card if the police stopped them. In one case, this even held up in court, and in the same way as with there being few cases of ethnographers having gone to the police, there were fewer examples we know of where ethnographers were forced to turn over their data to the police or testify in trials. First, handing over information would put an effective stop to the fieldwork and be dangerous for the ethnographer. Second, to enter the field with this as an option would make this kind of research difficult and pose ethical problems for the researcher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612465275">
<title>Potential Ethical Dilemmas</title>
<p>When doing ethnographic research on offenders, there is the possibility that researchers will face ethical dilemmas (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612465275">Dunlap et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612465275">VanderStaay, 2005</xref>). Some interviewers said they had problems when interviewees used drugs openly during interviews. Despite the nature of the research, they believed open drug use crossed a line for what they could accept in an interview setting. It also somehow involved the researcher in the drug use and made her or him partly accepting it. Although field-workers had much fewer concerns about this, none we interviewed ceased their research for these potential ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Quite a few, both field-workers and interviewers, found it hard not to indicate some kind of disapproval when research participants talked about particular instances of brutal violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612465275">Sandberg and Pedersen (2009)</xref> communicated their disapproval through body language and sometimes by following up with questions such as, “But aren’t you afraid that they will get serious injuries?” (pp. 11, 14). An interviewer similarly said that one should not be judgmental in these interviews but added that
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t believe in the objective, neutral position as a researcher either. It can be destructive. You have to reveal who you are in interviews, show emotions, to get a confidential, true and honest relation, which is important in these interviews. You can’t be a “stoneface.” If you react on something, it’s better to say it. It will give you a better relation, better interview.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In interviews, research participants enact narratives and construct themselves as particular moral agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612465275">Presser, 2004</xref>). Clearly, interview questions and probing style influence answers that participants give. Whereas some probing may inspire neutralization or justification of crime and conventional values, other questions may inspire exaggerated claims to street values. The risk of the former is that interviewees become concerned about presenting a “moral self.” The risk of the latter is that research participants become convenient stereotypes of a violent street culture. There is also a risk of reactive effects and indirect contributions to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612465275">Taylor 1987</xref>). None of the strategies are objective or only present the world as it is. Determining what kind of stories we would listen to without signaling any kind of disapproval is often difficult and context specific. Despite the impact both approval and disapproval has on interviews, it was rare that scholars acknowledged the impact of their own responses. Leaving this information out can create the impression that it was not important, and did not involve ethical considerations.</p>
<p>Although interviewing comes with potential ethical dilemmas, fieldwork comes with more. In many ways, the ethical problems of research rise “in proportion to the success of the fieldwork” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612465275">VanderStaay, 2005</xref>, p. 379). Field-workers told us about how they intervened in fights, unknowingly helped transport drugs, kept small amounts of cannabis for dealers, and transported dealers to meet other dealers. Their participants offered them the opportunities to participate in large-scale dealing (none admitted to accepting such offers) and in one case offered time with a prostitute (he also did not accept the offer). In short, many witnessed and heard about incidents that raised questions about their involvement in potentially unethical behavior. Of course, much of this never made it to reports. One field-worker said she had many sleepless nights: “Especially when I knew that they were to retaliate against someone and I didn’t always know whether or not that would include weapons. And I witnessed some really serious violence.” She sometimes tried to talk to the dealers out of fighting but did not like doing so because she did not want to interfere too much. She summarized, “As a researcher I guess I should have not tried to talk them out of things, but as a human being I sometimes tried to, which wasn’t always successful.” Others commented that violence was part of the “street game,” and it was thus easier to accept here than in other social settings. Feminist scholars have argued that emotional engagement and involvement is necessary for ethnographic fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612465275">Coffey, 1999</xref>), but this can be problematic in ethnographic research on offenders. Based on fieldwork experiences in prison in Ecuador, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612465275">Fleetwood (2009)</xref> argues that “becoming empathetic with serious professional criminals might not always be possible, personally desirable or ethically justifiable” (p. 46).</p>
<p>One researcher mentioned an ethical dilemma that emerged during the later stages of his research. He had a friend who became a useful source of information, but this friend did not know he was part of the research:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was obvious to me that I could use some of this material. And there was no way I was going to contact him and say, “Can I use it?” So yeah, I don’t feel good about that when I’m reminded of it. But at the time, it didn’t bother me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ethnographers often try to break down the boundaries between researcher and participants, and sometimes they do research on people in their own social networks. This makes it difficult to decide when they are doing research and when not, when to get consent, and what parts of the lives and conversations the consent applies to.</p>

<title>IRB</title>
<p>Countries vary considerably in their formal (and informal) practices regarding research ethics committees. Universities in the United States, for example, have highly institutionalized and formalized ethics committees, known as IRBs. In other countries, ethics committees vary on their demands and procedures. Some European boards are organized by the government, some by the university, and some do not have them at all. In fact, many European field-workers we interviewed had never reported their research to institutional or research ethics committees. Thus, the experiences and opinions of those we interviewed with ethics boards varied tremendously. Several told us that they had few problems with ethics boards, either because there was a long tradition for ethnographic research at their institutions or they or the project leader was a respected figure and established academic. Having ethnographers who were familiar with ethnographic research on ethics boards was thought to be helpful. Several expressed that review boards filled an important function. One commented, “Often we can be kind of cynical as principal investigators saying, ‘It’s a pain in the ass.’ But [they’ve] raised issues that I didn’t think about or I had to in fact say you got a point here.” But most found them impractical and simply tried to get through them, even if it meant withholding information.</p>
<p>Ethnographers claimed that ethics committees frequently commented on the practice of paying participants (interfering in the amount paid due to concerns about coercion) and raised concerns about the security of the researcher. In several cases, IRBs had demanded signed consent forms from the drug dealers participating in the research. In the eyes of the ethnographers, this practice—or rule—jeopardized the safety and anonymity of the participants they were supposed to protect. Another problem ethnographers had with these committees was the general standardization of methodological approach, which seldom fits the realities of ethnographic research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612465275">Librett &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>). Such approaches were difficult to enforce in ethnographic research. One interviewer commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>You could start a conversation with somebody and practically get into doing an interview just while you’re getting to know someone and screening someone to see if he or she is eligible and then before you know it, you’re talking and talking and talking and you’re in total violation of the IRB rules.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The flexibility of ethnographic research made it difficult to decide when an interview started, when it ended, and who was participating in the research. Technically, such issues should be brought to IRBs as reportable incidents, but none we interviewed did so.</p>
<p>The most common complaint about the review boards, however, was that gaining approval required a great deal of time. One commented, “It’s a lot of extra paper work.” Another said that it was “tedious.” Frustrated another said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It took me a good year to get my IRB approval and it was a process of kind of going back and forth and I would get questions and get more questions and then respond to questions and get more questions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the end, he claimed that nothing substantive changed. In other cases, IRBs have changed research design for the worse, placed research participants and researchers at risk, and made decisions outside their mandate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612465275">Librett &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Several told us about their strategies to get approval quicker. Ethnographers who collaborated with people at different universities were strategic about which school to go through to gain IRB approval first. Others provided only general information about recruitment, interviews, themes, and methodological approach. Details in research proposals were sometimes left out. One field-worker said, “If you basically tell them that you’re interested in these aspects of their lives, and give them interview prompts as opposed to structured interview, you get ethical approval much more easily.” The fact that semistructured interviews varied and changed throughout the study was difficult to accept for many review boards. Thus, many of those we spoke with did not “tell them all the details.” Details he left out included the fact that he may observe illegal activities, the places he would go to interview participants, and the activities he would be involved in. He claimed the strategy has been successful as he had no problems with the review board.</p>
<p>Several were more fundamentally critical of IRBs. An interviewer stated, “Everybody talks about protecting the integrity and the interest of the human subject, but it’s about not getting the university sued. I think that’s a real problem with social science research now.” One European field-worker was grateful that there was no research committee when she did her research. She believed that she could not have done her research if there had been any. As a result of overly cautious ethics committees, she argued, studies of illegal behavior were becoming thin on the ground. In her own research, the problems would have been getting an “arm’s length” from her participants: “They are paranoid about illegal behavior, which is you’re recording illegal behavior. And then, I think some of it isn’t really thought through and they really are just jumping on the health and safety, illegal behavior bandwagon.”</p>
<p>Many viewed ethnographic research as less dangerous than the kinds of research IRBs usually get involved with. “We’re not testing drugs on people, we’re just talking to people,” one said. Another suggested that ethnographers should discuss the ethical aspects of their research with other ethnographers who had similar experiences, not with “general committees.” They complained that general committees did not know the intricacies of ethnographic research and that it was difficult to evaluate ethnography and more structured research designs using the same set of criteria (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612465275">Librett &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>). The sentiment was that crime would take place anyway and the presence of a researcher would not make much difference. Moreover, the most important ethical decisions were not related to the research design—unless one would prohibit ethnographic research on offenders—but were context specific and often had to be taken on the spot by the ethnographer (see “Potential Ethical Dilemmas” section). The review boards were thus considered unnecessary, costly, and bureaucratic by many. Such mind-sets allowed ethnographers to more easily justify their decisions to withhold information from IRBs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because of the inherent difficulties in studying offenders in particular, and other hidden and marginalized populations in general, our aim was to provide those who embark on such research insights into the practical and ethical issues they will likely confront but that are seldom written about. Here, we focused on drug dealers and relied on available literature and on interviews with scholars who have successfully completed ethnographic research on such offenders. Our aim was to provide general insights into the potential issues that emerge when studying offenders and to describe and discuss the decisions and rationales of ethnographers. By seeking the insights of a group of ethnographers, we provided a peek at the methodological backstage of this type of research. Specifically, we have discussed issues such as approaching and recruiting participants, enticing them to consent, drug use by both participants and the researcher, addressing practical issues (e.g., using audio recorders), ensuring physical and legal security, addressing ethical dilemmas, and dealing with IRBs. Such issues are a part of the hidden ethnography because ethnographers often downplay them in research reports or completely leave them out. Scholars often exclude this information because they do not think it is important or because of the “fear of losing legitimacy, or being discredited” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612465275">Blackman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although many have provided insights into the promises and pitfalls of ethnographic research from personal experiences, few have sought to synthesize the insights and perspectives of other ethnographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612465275">Dickson-Swift, James, Kippen, &amp; Liamputtong 2007</xref>). We believe that by drawing on interviews with 15 drug ethnographers, we can provide more depth on these issues than if we had based them primarily on our own research. The anonymous interviews have made it possible to discuss issues that would likely not come up if we only reviewed what ethnographers write in their methods sections. Although we have elaborated on these issues, we do not want to present any definitive conclusions or give any authoritative advice about how ethnography should be conducted. We believe that ethnography does not lend itself to many hard rules. The flexibility of the design is one of its strengths. Thus, many of the answers to the issues are situational and dependent on the nature of the research, the characteristics of the researcher and participants, and the direction of the research question. Our goal was to present some of the issues that ethnographers face and show how others have handled these decisions so that ethnographers can consider and contemplate them before beginning their projects.</p>
<p>We believe that thinking about these issues and developing “standing decisions” about how to proceed or handle emerging problems will make it easier for ethnographers to collect the best data in the most methodologically sound and ethical manner. These standing decisions will reduce the time needed to act when faced with problems or questions. Although some decisions will not require immediate answers, some may. For example, ethnographers will have an easier time deciding whether they should drink alcohol with participants or introduce recorders to the interviews if they have contemplated the pros and cons of each beforehand. As such we believe that developing standing decisions is vital for the continued success of ethnographic research.</p>
<p>Based on our interviews with ethnographers, we recommend that those embarking on a project develop their own standing decisions for the following issues. First, when seeking to locate suitable participants and entice them to be a part of the study, ethnographers should decide how long they should stay in the field, including how long they should seek out participants before they give up. As we have shown, it often takes researchers longer than they expect to develop rapport and get participants to invest in the project. But there is also a point where staying longer is futile. Ethnographers should consider the nature of their research, the type of offenders they are studying, and their relational distance when deciding appropriate time limits. In addition, if choosing to use recruiters, ethnographers should consider how they will evaluate the quality of the recruiter. All recruiters are not the same; thus, it is necessary to evaluate them and release them if necessary. Ethnographers need to decide at what point they seek out new recruiters. Finally, ethnographers should consider whether they will offer financial compensation to those they interview. When making this decision, they should consider the possibility of reducing rapport or being coercive. Their decisions should include whether they will have varying payments based on the characteristics of the participants. They must decide whether some participants deserve to be paid more or whether some can be asked to do it for free.</p>
<p>When studying deviant groups, it is likely that the researcher may be exposed to drugs and alcohol; this is especially true when studying offenders. Ethnographers should decide on whether they will collect data on those who are under the influence. If they will collect data from intoxicated participants, at what point does the intoxication interfere with the data? Probably more importantly, ethnographers should make standing decisions about whether they will use drugs or alcohol when in the field. They should have decided beforehand how they will respond if offered alcohol or drugs. Making decisions on the spot can be unwise and may lead to poorly thought out choices. Although such decisions are likely situational, we support the claim that ethnographers should not consume any substances that they would not normally take just for the sake of research.</p>
<p>Finally, ethnographic research on drug dealers can pose a number of physical and legal risks to all those involved. Thus, ethnographers need to have thought about and made decisions about how to protect their own safety and the safety of others (including the participants and third parties). Developing a plan for maintaining their own personal safety is often overlooked by ethnographers. Although only a few were harmed during their research, many were threatened. Thus, having a plan in place to let others know where they are and who they are with is good practice. Thinking about the locations they may go and who they will go with will likely help to ensure their safety. Just as important is ensuring the safety of others. Ethnographers should have standing decisions for when to go to police if they hear or witness dangerous or illegal behavior by participants. Ethnographers should decide what behaviors cross the line and demand calls to authorities. For example, if they hear stories of child abuse or planned murders, they should have plans of action about whether they will ignore it or call police. If they are around to witness the victimization of others, they should have thought about whether they will intervene, seek help, or do nothing. Perhaps more than any other decision being made, ethnographers should have thought about such scenarios and develop clear standing decisions. Trying to make such decisions while they are happening could lead to ethnographers regretting their decisions.</p>
<p>Although ethical questions in ethnographic research tend to be situational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612465275">Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, 1995</xref>), a reflexive familiarity with ethical dilemmas can be helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612465275">VanderStaay, 2005</xref>). IRBs and ethics committees can thus play an important role. Ethnographers have the tendency to be vague with IRBs because they fear members of the boards will slow their research or block it all together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612465275">Katz, 2006</xref>). We believe this does not have to be the case. If ethnographers think of these issues beforehand and articulate their decisions to ethics boards, then members will be better informed of the nature of the research and can then offer solutions amenable to all involved. Doing so can help establish a methodological literature for ethnographic research on offenders so that review boards will not need to treat every concern as if it is the first time it occurs. When it comes to the issues discussed above, for example, the present study will potentially make it easier not only for researcher to design their project but also for review boards to evaluate them. Thus, standing decisions can lead to more methodologically rigorous and ethically sound ethnographies.</p>
