<abstract>
<p>Some previous studies have suggested that patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have a hypoactive central dopaminergic system. Supporting this there have been reports from neuroimaging studies of reduced striatal D2 receptor binding in subjects with SAD. The aim of this study was to investigate D2 receptor sensitivity in patients with SAD compared with a group of matched, healthy controls using a neuroendocrine challenge with the selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride. D2 receptor function was assessed in 23 subjects with generalized SAD and 23 matched, healthy controls using a challenge with 400 mg of a selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Response to sulpiride was measured by the change in prolactin level and changes in self-rated measures of social anxiety, mood and the ability to experience pleasure. There was no significant difference in prolactin response to sulpiride between the two groups. Sulpiride resulted in no effect in either the SAD or healthy control group on measures of social anxiety, mood or the ability to experience pleasure. Contrary to our hypothesis, in this study we found no evidence of reduced D2 receptor function in subjects with SAD compared with healthy controls.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is a common and disabling psychiatric illness. Interest in the treatment of this condition has increased recently, and there has been a corresponding growth in work looking at the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved in this disorder. In particular, an amygdala-based fear conditioning neurocircuitry model has been postulated, with interactions between neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112450778">Argyropoulos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450778">Mathew et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the dopaminergic system is abnormal in patients with SAD is supported by a combination of clinical evidence and preclinical human and animal studies. Early clinical observations suggested similarities between social anxiety and atypical depression (in particular the symptom of hypersensitivity to rejection) and a preferential response to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) rather than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112450778">Liebowitz, 1987</xref>). As MAOIs increase synaptic levels of DA in addition to 5HT and noradrenaline (NA) (in contrast to TCAs which predominantly act on 5HT and NA), this was thought to suggest a role for DA in SAD. There has also been a case report and small open study reporting benefits of dopaminergic drugs such as the DA, NA-reuptake blocker, bupropion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112450778">Emmanuel et al., 1991</xref>). Conversely, drugs that reduce DA function, such as DA antagonists, have been reported to be associated with SAD symptoms in patients treated for Tourette’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112450778">Mikkelsen et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112450778">Scahill et al., 2003</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112450778">Pallanti et al., 1999</xref>). There has also been a report of chronic amphetamine abuse (resulting in DA depletion) leading to the onset of social phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112450778">Williams et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the use of animal models to study the role of DA in social anxiety has inherent problems because of the interactional nature of the disorder, several studies have suggested that reduced DA function is associated with increased anxiety. There is a strain of timid mice with reduced DA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112450778">Mayleben et al., 1992</xref>), and DA depletion in rats results in increased anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450778">Espejo, 1997</xref>). The most convincing findings have come from neuroendocrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112450778">Shively, 1998</xref>) and neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112450778">Grant et al., 1998</xref>) in subordinate primates (monkeys) which both reported reduced dopamine (D2) receptor function.</p>
<p>Human studies investigating DA function have reported reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) levels (the metabolite of DA) in patients with panic disorder with comorbid social anxiety compared with panic disorder patients without social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112450778">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>), as well as correlations between low CSF HVA and measures of introversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112450778">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>). Previous neuroendocrine studies in humans investigating D2 receptor function in SAD compared with controls have used dopamine agonists and measures of prolactin (PRL) concentration or eye blink response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112450778">Condren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112450778">Tancer et al., 1994</xref>). These have not reported significant D2 receptor abnormalities in SAD. The most convincing evidence for reduced DA function in humans has been shown by SPECT neuroimaging studies which reported reduced striatal DA reuptake sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112450778">Tiihonen et al., 1997</xref>) and, like the subordinate primate study, reduced D2 receptor striatal binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112450778">Schneier et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112450778">2008</xref>). It has been suggested that these findings reflect a reduced number of DA synapses as a result of reduced expression or degeneration. A recent functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) study also reported striatal dysfunction in generalized social phobia, supporting abnormal dopaminergic functioning because DA is the key neurotransmitter in these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112450778">Sareen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate D2 receptor sensitivity in patients with SAD compared with a group of matched healthy controls using a neuroendocrine challenge with the selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride. The choice of a D2 antagonist was based on the neuroimaging findings and positive neuroendocrine findings from preclinical studies which used DA antagonists (despite the previous negative findings from neuroendocrine studies that used DA agonist challenges). Sulpiride is a selective D2 antagonist which has been repeatedly reported to produce an increase in PRL as a result of D2 antagonist effects in the tuberoinfundibular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112450778">de Koning and de Vries, 1995</xref>). It has been used as a neuroendocrine challenge to investigate DA function in studies of patients with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112450778">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112450778">Verbeeck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112450778">Willner et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that D2 receptor function would be reduced in subjects with SAD compared with the healthy control group, which would be reflected by a reduced PRL response to sulpiride. We also hypothesized that the D2 antagonist effects of sulpiride would result in changes to ratings of social anxiety, mood and the ability to experience pleasure (because of the involvement of dopamine in the brain reward system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112450778">Tremblay et al., 2005</xref>), and that reduced D2 receptor functioning would be reflected by a reduced response to sulpiride on these measures.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881112450778">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>For this study, 23 patients with generalized SAD were recruited by advertisements in a social phobia support group newsletter, and an article in a free local newspaper describing the symptoms of social anxiety. They were diagnosed with SAD according to DSM-IV criteria assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112450778">First et al., 1998</xref>) which was administered by experienced clinicians (CB, HC, FC). This group had no other current Axis I conditions, no neurological disorder and no history of head injury or any serious physical illness that would contraindicate the use of sulpiride. They could be on medication for the SAD but continued to have symptoms related to this disorders and fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for the condition.</p>
<p>In addition, 23 healthy controls were recruited through advertisements. They were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112450778">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>). Subjects were excluded if they met criteria for any current or past psychiatric condition, had a history of head injury, neurological disorder, or any serious physical illness, or if they had a first-degree relative with a history of any Axis I disorder. Healthy controls were matched as closely as possible to the social phobia group on measures of age, sex, ethnicity, and years of education.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Upper South B Regional Ethics Committee, Christchurch, New Zealand. All subjects were informed about the potential side effects of sulpiride such as drowsiness, unhappy mood, tremor, rigidity, muscle spasms and an inability to sit still, and gave written informed consent before participation in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112450778">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The study took place at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the Department of Psychological Medicine in Christchurch, New Zealand. It involved two test days at least 1 week apart, and followed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Each subject received the selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride, on one test day and placebo on the other. The order in which subjects received the sulpiride or placebo was randomly allocated using unweighted blocking. Both test days occurred at the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (days 3–12).</p>
<p>Subjects arrived at the CRU at 09.00 having fasted from midnight the previous day. They were given a standardized breakfast consisting of toast, spread, jam and decaffeinated tea or coffee. During this time subjects were asked to complete the self-rating scales described below. An anticubital catheter was then inserted to take blood samples and kept patent using heparinized saline. Subjects rested in a semi-supine position on a bed in the test room, where they remained for the duration of the study. They were allowed to watch neutral-content videos and television or to read, but were not allowed to sleep. They were not permitted to eat and were permitted to drink only water during the study period. At 09.30 a blood sample was taken for baseline PRL. They were then given 400 mg of sulpiride or placebo orally. Previous studies have shown that peak plasma concentrations of sulpiride are reached 1 h after ingestion, and the half-life of the drug is around 12 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112450778">von Bahr et al., 1991</xref>). Studies have also shown that oral sulpiride (400 mg) produces a profile of a peak PRL level about 1 h after it is taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112450778">de Koning and de Vries, 1995</xref>). In view of this, blood samples for PRL levels were taken every 30 min after the sulpiride was given for the next 3 h. At 10.30 the rating scales were completed again (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112450778">Figure 1</xref>). At 13.00 subjects were allowed to go home, and were provided with access to medical cover, if required over the following 24 h.</p>

<title>Prolactin</title>
<p>The primary neuroendocrine measure was the plasma PRL level in response to the sulpiride challenge. PRL concentrations were measured using the Beckman Coulter Access analyzer and Prolactin assay, which is a one-step, two-site immunoenzymatic assay with chemiluminescent detection. The between-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.5% at 150 mIU/L and 6% at 620 mIU/L.</p>

<title>Psychological self-rated measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0269881112450778">
<title>Measures of anxiety and mood</title>
<p>Changes in symptoms of social anxiety in response to the sulpiride challenge were measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112450778">Liebowitz, 1987</xref>) and Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112450778">Watson and Friend, 1969</xref>) questionnaire. Anxiety symptoms were rated using the Spielberger Trait (STAI) and State (SSAI) Anxiety Inventories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112450778">Spielberger et al., 1970</xref>). Changes in mood symptoms were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112450778">McNair et al., 1971</xref>) in which patients rated on a scale of 0–4 how strongly they felt certain emotions, grouped into five subscales (tension/anxiety; depression/dejection; anger/hostility; fatigue/inertia; confusion/bewilderment). The scores in these five subscales were added to give a score for ‘total mood disturbance’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881112450778">
<title>Measures of the experience of pleasure or anhedonia</title>
<p>In view of the hypothesis that anhedonia is associated with a dysfunction of the DA reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112450778">Heinz et al., 1994</xref>), a measure of the ability to experience pleasure was used: the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112450778">Snaith et al., 1995</xref>). Patients rated 14 statements describing their ability to experience pleasure in common potentially pleasurable situations (e.g. ‘I would be able to enjoy my favorite meal’) with one of four responses: strongly disagree; disagree; agree; strongly agree. Responses were assigned numeric values and added to give a total score for hedonic tone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881112450778">
<title>Measures of extrapyramidal side effects</title>
<p>Extrapyramidal side effects as a result of the sulpiride were rated using the St Hans Rating Scale for extrapyramidal syndromes (SHRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112450778">Gerlach et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881112450778">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The primary outcome measure was the effect of sulpiride on the PRL response. This was calculated as the difference in the PRL response to sulpiride compared with placebo (PRL response to sulpiride minus the PRL response to placebo).</p>
<p>Baseline measures of the basal PRL level, mood, anxiety, the ability to experience pleasure and extrapyramidal symptoms were compared between groups using <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p>
<p>The PRL response to sulpiride and placebo was measured as both the maximum PRL increase and the area under the curve (AUC) of the graph of PRL level over time, calculated using the trapezoid rule (as has been the convention in neuroendocrine studies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112450778">de Koning and de Vries, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112450778">von Bahr et al., 1991</xref>)). Both measures were calculated relative to the baseline level.</p>
<p>The PRL responses to sulpiride and placebo were normally distributed, therefore parametric tests were used. The difference between the PRL response to sulpiride and placebo was evaluated using a paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test. As described above, the effect of sulpiride was calculated as the difference in the PRL response to sulpiride compared with placebo (PRL response to sulpiride minus the PRL response to placebo). Differences in the effect of sulpiride between the SAD group compared with the healthy control group were tested using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
<p>The effect of sulpiride and placebo on rating scale scores was determined by calculating the difference in scores 60 min after the drug to 30 min before (which were the two time points when the scales were completed by subjects). Rating scale scores were normally distributed on both test days and were therefore analyzed with parametric tests. The effect of sulpiride was calculated as the difference in the rating scale scores to sulpiride compared with placebo. Differences in the effect of sulpiride between the SAD group compared with the healthy control group were tested using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
<p>The effect of gender on rating scale responses to sulpiride was tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with gender as a between-subject factor. Similarly, the effect of antidepressant treatment on rating scale responses to sulpiride was tested with ANOVA with antidepressant treatment as a between-subject factor.</p>
<p>A <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Taking into account the 23 subjects in each group, the study could detect a true difference of 25% in prolactin levels at a 5% significance level (power 80%).</p>

Six patients with SAD were on antidepressants for treatment of their social phobia at the time of the study. These subjects had had no change to the antidepressant dose over the 6 weeks prior to the study and had ongoing symptoms of SAD. Two of these patients were also taking beta blockers, and one patient was solely taking a beta blocker. One subject with SAD was on an ACE inhibitor, and one was taking a calcium channel blocker for treatment of hypertension. Two patients with SAD and one healthy control were taking an oral contraceptive pill. Two controls were on asthma inhalers, one control was on thyroxine, and one control took antihistamine tablets.</p>

<p>As expected, the patients in the social phobia group had higher scores on measures of social phobia as rated by the LSAS and the FNE compared with the control group. The range of LSAS included six subjects with mild forms of generalized SAD, i.e. LSAS under 60. Ratings of anxiety by the STAI and SSAI were also higher in the social phobia group compared with the controls, again as expected. Ratings of depression as measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were also higher in the social phobia group compared with the control group but not in the range of patients with major depression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate D2 receptor sensitivity in patients with SAD compared with a group of matched healthy controls using a neuroendocrine challenge with the selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride. We hypothesized that D2 receptor function would be reduced in SAD subjects compared with healthy controls, which would be reflected by a reduced PRL response to sulpiride and a reduced response to sulpiride on measures of social anxiety, mood and the ability to experience pleasure. Our findings do not, however, support this, in that no differences between the groups were observed on either of these measures.</p>
<p>There was no difference in the PRL response to sulpiride in the SAD group compared with controls. Given that PRL secretion from the pituitary lactotroph is primarily under dopaminergic control, this finding would suggest that the tuberoinfundibular D2 receptors were of similar sensitivity or availability in both groups. These findings replicate the negative findings of two previous neuroendocrine studies in SAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112450778">Condren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112450778">Tancer et al., 1994</xref>) and are different from a previous study in depression which reported an enhanced PRL response to sulpiride (25 mg IV) in subjects with depression compared with healthy controls.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a significantly increased PRL response to sulpiride was seen in females compared with males, reflecting greater sensitivity of tuberoinfundibular D2 receptors in females than in males in this study. This finding was not reported by a previous neuroendocrine study in social phobia using a DA agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112450778">Condren et al., 2002</xref>). There have, however, been reports in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment of females having greater elevations in PRL levels than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112450778">Kuruvilla et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112450778">Smith et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>No effect of sulpiride was seen on measures of anxiety, mood or the ability to experience pleasure in either the SAD or control group. These findings are in contrast to results from one study of depressed patients which reported a mood-improving effect of sulpiride (400 mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112450778">Bell et al., 2008</xref>) and one which reported mood worsening with sulpiride (200 mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112450778">Willner et al., 2005</xref>), but are similar to other studies which have reported no effect of sulpiride (200 mg and 400 mg) on mood or anxiety in healthy male volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112450778">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>). There has been debate about the interpretation of these findings which may relate to the dose of sulpiride used. At lower doses (50–100 mg) sulpiride has effects at the presynaptic D2 receptor, effectively increasing DA transmission, whereas at higher doses its effects are predominantly postsynaptic D2 blockade.</p>
<sec id="section21-0269881112450778">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It is possible that this study failed to detect a true difference in D2 receptor function in SAD (Type II error). However, as described in the statistics section, the study was adequately powered to detect a difference in PRL levels between the patients with SAD and healthy controls. The concentration of sulpiride in the blood was not measured to control for differences in bioavailability between groups, which may have introduced another source of potential bias. The timing of the administration of the psychometric scales may have been too short to detect effects, although they were timed to follow the peak sulpiride concentration after oral consumption. A previous study in depression only showed effects on measures of mood 2–3 h after ingestion of sulpiride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112450778">Willner et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The subjects in our study were recruited through advertisement and the range of the SAD reflects this. Although all subjects had the generalized form of SAD, some subjects had a mild form of this disorder which was typically less severe than seen in clinical populations. This may limit the generalizability of the findings. Similarly, the exclusion criteria for the study of patients having no other Axis I disorders may also have limited the generalizability of these findings, because in clinical populations comorbidity is common.</p>
<p>The final limitation applies to the use of neuroendocrine studies in general, and whether findings in the tuberoinfundibular system reflect similar changes in other DA regions, for example the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study, using a neuroendocrine challenge with the selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride, identified no differences in D2 functioning (as measured by the PRL response and effects on psychometric measures) in subjects with SAD compared with healthy controls.</p>
