<abstract>
<p>In this descriptive study, we examined the influences and experiences motivating students to enter college-level music schools as reported by a population of precollegiate students auditioning (but not yet accepted) to music education degree programs. As a follow-up to a published pilot study, this research was designed to quantify the various experiences respondents had as part of their precollege school and community programs that related to teaching and music. Results indicate a strong connection between respondents’ primary musical background and future teaching interest. The top three influential experiences were related to high school ensemble membership (band, choir, orchestra), and the most influential group of individuals in the decision to become a music educator were high school ensemble directors. Respondents from all four primary background groups (band, choir, orchestra, and general or other) rated private lesson teaching as their second strongest future teaching interest, just behind teaching at the high school level in their primary background. Respondents rated parents as moderately influential on their desire to become a music teacher.</p>

<p>The strategic plan adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022429412474896">MENC: The National Association for Music Education (2007)</xref>, now the National Association for Music Education (NAfME), identifies music teacher recruitment as a primary area for resources and focused efforts, including research. The Society for Music Teacher Education (SMTE) has created 12 “Areas of Strategic Planning and Action” (ASPA) to facilitate efforts among music teacher educators and researchers, with Teacher Recruitment being one such group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smte.us/aspa/">http://smte.us/aspa/</ext-link>). Beginning in 2005, the Teacher Recruitment ASPA has engaged in concerted efforts toward a better understanding of how the profession can recruit quality music educators. In particular, this ASPA has provided a gathering place for researchers interested in a sustained line of inquiry studying the influences that may affect an individual’s decision to elect a career in music education. This study represents the most current outcomes of those continuing efforts.</p>
<p>Previous studies regarding influences on music teaching career selection have yielded several common and consistent findings. Major studies on music education career choice were summarized in detail in the authors’ pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022429412474896">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond music education, the topic of teacher recruitment has been a concern to the broader education field. Research on teacher recruitment in general teacher education offers potential theoretical models for music education, and a summary of this work follows. In addition, due to the unique professional roles of music educators, previous research on the identity formation of music teachers also provided a foundation for the current study.</p>
<p>Students who desire to become teachers in any field share common characteristics. Entering teacher candidates had a high level of involvement in extracurricular activities, with considerable interaction with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022429412474896">Marks &amp; Gregory, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022429412474896">West &amp; Brousseau, 1987</xref>), they often had family members in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso &amp; Pigge, 1986</xref>), and most were certain about entering teaching as a career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>). While a large majority planned to teach at least 5 years, many did not plan to teach for their entire career and preferred to teach in traditional classroom settings with middle-income children of average ability in suburban or rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022429412474896">West &amp; Brousseau, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Prospective teachers appear to share common motivations, influences, and beliefs about teaching, with notable differences associated with gender, race, background, and specialization. For decades, much of the research regarding selection of teaching as a career has shown the decision to be influenced highly by former teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474896">Fielstra, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022429412474896">Richards, 1960</xref>). In the 1960s and 1970s, job security was documented as an important influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429412474896">Haubrich, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022429412474896">Wright, 1977</xref>). Enduring influences on the decision to become a teacher appear to include more self-fulfilling and altruistic reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022429412474896">Wood, 1978</xref>), such as helping children to learn and grow, a sense of vocation and honor of teaching, working conditions and calendar, valuing of subject matter, and beliefs about finding enjoyment in teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso &amp; Pigge, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022429412474896">Richards, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022429412474896">Watt &amp; Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender and teaching specialization appear to affect motivations of aspirant teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso and Pigge (1986)</xref> found that male students reported reasons of professional standing, social prestige, love of subject, and teaching as a stepping stone to other careers significantly more often than did females. Females reported liking children as a reason for becoming teachers at almost a 2-to-1 ratio over male students. Elementary education majors reported more precollege experiences with children and were more child centered than their secondary counterparts, who were more subject centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412474896">Book, Byers, &amp; Freeman, 1983</xref>). Responses of specialized majors, such as music, resembled secondary major responses, while special education major responses paralleled those of elementary majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso &amp; Pigge, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite sharing many common motivations for pursuing a teaching career, aspirant teachers have characteristics that contrast with students who plan to pursue other careers. A large majority of aspirant teachers were White females from small towns or rural or suburban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022429412474896">Richards, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022429412474896">Roberson, Keith, &amp; Page, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>) and typically had a lower socioeconomic status than other college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412474896">Brookhart &amp; Freeman, 1992</xref>). In a longitudinal study of 90 institutions, researchers found that minority enrollment in teacher education remained low compared to the general student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>). Similar to the general student population, three fourths of aspirant teachers were enrolled in higher education institutions 100 miles or less from their homes, and most of the remaining one fourth lived within 500 miles of their higher education institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022429412474896">Roberson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022429412474896">Zimpher, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022429412474896">Roberson et al. (1983)</xref>, those who reported a strong family orientation also reported influence by parents on career choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429412474896">Kniveton (2004)</xref> found that high school students choosing any career were influenced more by their parents than by teachers; however, correlations between parental influence and the decision to become a teacher were not substantial. Elementary majors were influenced by having educators in the family, liking children, and prior experiences with children; however, former teachers were more influential than parents if the student’s parents were not educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso &amp; Pigge, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings of research in music teacher education have been similar in many ways to those of general teacher education research. Music teachers consistently have been cited as a primary influence in individuals’ decision(s) to pursue a music teaching career. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412474896">Bergee (1992)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474896">Bergee, Coffman, Demorest, Humphreys, and Thorton (2001)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412474896">Bergee and Demorest (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474896">Bright (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474896">Cox (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412474896">Gillespie and Hamann (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412474896">Hamann and Cutietta (1996)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022429412474896">Hamann and Walker (1993)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429412474896">Madsen and Kelly (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022429412474896">Rickels et al. (2010)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022429412474896">White (1967)</xref> all have identified classroom and private music teachers as the individuals who most often influence students who become music teachers. Many researchers have noted that early experiences in teaching music appear to be influential in the career decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474896">Bergee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474896">Bright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412474896">Gillespie &amp; Hamann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429412474896">M. Jones, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429412474896">Madsen &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412474896">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022429412474896">Thornton &amp; Bergee, 2008</xref>). Such experiences often take the form of individual tutoring; private lessons; small-group rehearsals, such as sectionals; and even rehearsing a large ensemble. Researchers also have cited other influences, such as love of music, enjoyment of teaching, a desire to work with young people, and family support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474896">Bates, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474896">Bergee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474896">Bright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412474896">Brumbaugh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412474896">Gillespie &amp; Hamann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022429412474896">Thornton &amp; Bergee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022429412474896">White, 1967</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022429412474896">McClellan (2011)</xref> recently documented that parental beliefs in their children’s ability to become a good music educator and to complete their education successfully explained approximately 30% of the variation in students’ self-concept as a music educator.</p>
<p>In revealing influences on high school students’ choices to pursue careers as music educators, research on occupational role identity and socialization into the music education profession can provide a subject-specific perspective. Early role-identity and socialization studies in music education, which appeared as isolated dissertations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429412474896">Krueger, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022429412474896">L’Roy, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022429412474896">Wolfgang, 1990</xref>), have led the way to frequent dialogues regarding the development of music teacher identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474896">Conkling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412474896">Dolloff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022429412474896">Paul, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022429412474896">Pellegrino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022429412474896">Woodford, 2002</xref>). Much of this research has been founded on sociological principles associated with symbolic interactionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412474896">Cooley, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022429412474896">McCall &amp; Simmons, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022429412474896">Mead, 1934</xref>). Within the field of education, music teachers occupy a unique space that brings together roles of both musician and teacher. Results of previous research on music teacher identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022429412474896">Pellegrino, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022429412474896">Scheib, 2007</xref>) suggest that music teacher role identity is bound in a conflict between musician identity and teacher identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412474896">Bouij, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412474896">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022429412474896">Mark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022429412474896">Roberts, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022429412474896">2000</xref>). Other researchers have posited that music teacher identity emerges during progressive teaching experiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412474896">Brewer (2009)</xref> suggested that teacher identity is “layered onto or integrated with an already legitimized musician identity” (p. 370). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474896">Isbell (2006)</xref> noted, “There is evidence that teacher identity becomes strengthened with age and field experience while musician identity remains stable throughout undergraduate training” (p. 177). Debate continues regarding prospective teachers’ efforts to develop both musician and music teacher role identities and the degree to which these identities are developed through either conflict or convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412474896">Bernard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412474896">Bouij, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412474896">Dolloff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022429412474896">Paise, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022429412474896">Regelski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022429412474896">Roberts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022429412474896">Stephens, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412474896">Austin, Isbell, and Russell (2010)</xref> suggested that institutional context and degree program differences have a significant influence on both secondary socialization and occupational identity, reflecting “how performance and education ideals may or may not be reconciled” in any given music teacher preparation program (p. 14). They also presented evidence that both performance and education majors’ occupational identity, if not challenged, may change very little during their college years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022429412474896">Parkes and Jones (2011)</xref> found that music performance majors were motivated highly by a love of music and performing as well as by the desire to communicate with an audience through music. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412474896">B. Jones and Parkes (2010)</xref> report that music education majors were motivated most strongly by a desire to be a role model for their future students, with approximately equal emphasis on enjoyment of music, enjoyment of teaching, and an intent to make music fun for others.</p>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022429412474896">Rickels et al. (2010)</xref>, the majority of research on prospective music educators’ identity development and their reasons for choosing a career in music education has focused on undergraduate music educators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412474896">Miksza and Austin (2010)</xref> provide one of the limited numbers of studies focused on precollege students. They studied the effects of a 12-week guided teaching experience on high school students’ teaching concerns and sense of teacher identity. They also documented growth in the participants’ self-assessments of their teaching. Seven of the 11 study participants enrolled or planned to enroll as college music education majors. The results of Miksza and Austin’s study suggest, along with prior research, the power of precollege music teaching experience on students’ decisions to elect a college music education major. The present study adds to the very limited work seeking the perspectives of aspiring precollegiate music educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474896">Bates, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412474896">Brumbaugh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412474896">Councill, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429412474896">M. Jones, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412474896">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For the authors’ pilot study, we surveyed prospective undergraduate music education majors to ascertain influences and motivators for aspiring to a career in music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022429412474896">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>). Results indicated that school music teachers and private lesson teachers continue to be cited as highly influential in motivating students to become music education majors. Furthermore, in the pilot study, we sought to quantify the types of teaching experiences participants had prior to seeking admission to a music education program. Results indicated that respondents had previous teaching experiences that included rehearsing sectionals (67.5%), tutoring individuals in music (56.1%), rehearsing the entire group (48.2%), giving private lessons (43.4%), and conducting performing groups (39.0%). Suggestions for further research included refinement and expansion of the study in order to better identify the types and amount of previous teaching experiences.</p>
<p>To recruit highly qualified music educators, there continues to be a need for in-depth exploration of the factors influencing a decision to major in music education. As a follow-up to the pilot study, the current research project was designed to allow us (a) to learn more about the influences and experiences motiving students to enter college-level music schools as a music education major, as reported by a broader population of precollegiate students auditioning (but not yet accepted) to such degree programs; (b) to further quantify the various experiences precollegiate students already may have had as part of their precollege school and community programs that relate to teaching and music; and (c) to situate the survey results within the existing literature on career choice of music educators, with populations that have included college music majors and precollegiate students.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The current study was expanded from the published pilot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022429412474896">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>) to include eight universities. Additionally, the process for ensuring privacy of each participant through extensive institutional review board (IRB) procedures was clarified, ensuring that audition results were not influenced by participation (or nonparticipation) in the study and that participant names were coded at each site before being added to the central anonymous database for this study. Information and conclusions from the pilot study were used to refine and focus survey questions for use in this study. Refinements included clarification of the subgroups for the grade level at which teaching experiences occurred and modification of the sampling procedures to ascertain an exact response rate of participants versus nonparticipants. We obtained demographic background information in order to determine specific characteristics about the candidates for music education degree programs.</p>
<p>The data collection instrument for this study was a six-page survey given to candidates auditioning for entrance as music education majors at selected colleges and universities across the United States between January and April 2010. Five institutions were selected originally on the basis of music education faculty who expressed initial interest in participating in data collection. Three additional institutions were added by invitation in order to broaden the sample through inclusion of a diversity of institutions, from small private colleges to large, research-focused, public universities. The survey consisted of scale response or item-select questions, utilizing topics addressed in the pilot study, with additional demographic questions and questions regarding participant attitude toward various statements concerning future musical endeavors. Each of the authors had input on several drafts of the survey before we determined the final version, and we pretested the survey form with a small group of current music education majors to gather feedback on clarity and usability.</p>
<p>At each site, auditionees were given the option to participate in the study while waiting their turn in the audition process. The participating institutions varied widely in audition procedures, with auditions held on as few as one to as many as nine different dates at each institution. Music education faculty were heavily involved in the auditions process in some cases (for example, interviewing prospective music education majors), while in other cases, music education faculty were not present on the audition dates. Due to this variation in procedures, researchers chose a passive strategy for data collection, soliciting responses through one or more of the following means: placing surveys and consent forms in an audition registration packet and having them returned to marked bins, placing surveys and consent forms on some type of marked kiosk near a critical event in the audition process (e.g., a music theory exam) and having them returned to marked bins, and/or making a reference to the survey in written or verbal instructions to all participants at the audition site.</p>
<p>Site contacts at each institution were asked to track and count the number of music education auditionees and the number of survey participants so that we could determine a response rate. Any student who expressed an interest in a music education major was counted as a potential participant, even if the student simultaneously expressed interest other majors. The eight universities contributing to data collection included four state universities (<italic>N</italic> = 328; <italic>n</italic> = 157), one conservatory within a state university (<italic>N</italic> = 76; <italic>n</italic> = 40), and three private universities (<italic>N</italic> = 155; <italic>n</italic> = 53). A combined total of 250 valid surveys were returned, for a response rate of 44.72%. A common desire for response rates above 50% is typically attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412474896">Babbie (1990)</xref>, who stated, “A response rate of at least 50 percent is generally considered adequate for analysis and reporting” (p. 182). Babbie also noted that researchers “should bear in mind, however, that these are only rough guides; they have no statistical basis, and a demonstrated lack of response bias is far more important than a high response rate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412474896">Babbie, 1990</xref>, p. 182). In the case of this study, the 44.72% response rate was considered acceptable when bolstered by evidence of a representative sample that avoided response bias by acceptance status, age, and background. Acceptance rates varied from 50% to 100% by institution and closely paralleled each institution’s overall music education major acceptance rates. The IRB reviewers for this study had granted an exemption to allow students age 17 to participate without parental consent to remove potential age response bias between 17-year-old students and those age 18 or older who would not require parental consent. The breakdown of participants by music background (band, orchestra, choir, or general music) also generally mirrored the overall distribution of auditionees at each institution.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample of respondents was 118 male (47.2%) and 131 female (52.4%), with 1 participant (0.4%) not reporting gender. Ethnicities reported were overwhelmingly White (<italic>n</italic> = 202, 80.8%), with 23 Hispanic (9.2%), 13 Black or African American (5.2%), 7 Asian (2.8%), 3 Other (1.2%), and 2 not reporting ethnicity (0.8%). The mean age at the time of audition was 17.86 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.11), with some positive skew due to the presence of a small number of outliers whose age was more than four standard deviations above the mean. The median age was 17 years.</p>
<p>Of the survey respondents who auditioned at the participating institutions, 168 were admitted as music majors (67.2%) and 77 were not admitted (30.8%). Surveys could not be matched to admission records for 5 respondents (2.0%). While the majority of students likely entered as music education majors, it should be noted again that the survey method included all students who expressed any interest in music education. Because students could express an interest in multiple areas, it is possible some students elected majors in other music fields (such as performance) after being admitted.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these data reflect only instances where respondents were admitted to the institution where the survey was given. The scope of this study does not account for respondents who may have auditioned and were accepted at institutions outside of those collecting data, individuals who were accepted but may have chosen another institution or another major, or the remote possibility of participants who may have auditioned at more than one institution collecting data.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked two questions regarding the timing of their decision about a college major. When asked at what grade the respondent made the decision to major in music, the median value was 9th grade, with an interquartile range of three grades. When asked at what grade the respondent made the decision to major specifically in music education, the median value was 11th grade, with an interquartile range of two grades.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to report their primary background in music and a secondary background if desired. The overwhelming majority of the sample (92.4%) reported a primary background in one of the three traditional performance areas of band (48.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 120), choir (32.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 81), or orchestra (12.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 30), while 2.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) reported a primary background of general music (defined on the survey form as “other than band, choir, or orchestra,” which could include other forms of school-based music or nonschool music experiences). Secondary backgrounds reported were 14.0% band (<italic>n</italic> = 35), 18.4% choir (<italic>n</italic> = 46), 12.8% orchestra (<italic>n</italic> = 32), and 22.0% general music (<italic>n</italic> = 55). Percentages do not sum to 100% due to missing responses, particularly in the optional secondary background variable. The respondents’ primary background was used as a grouping variable in examining future teaching interests, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412474896">Table 1</xref>. As expected, the levels of future teaching interest were highest for like areas (i.e., students with a band background show the highest interest in future band teaching). Very few respondents reported a primary background in general music (<italic>n</italic> = 5), limiting the usefulness of interpreting their data. Backgrounds in general music therefore are not reported as a separate breakout group in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412474896">Table 1</xref>. It is notable that future like-area teaching at high school grades showed the highest level of interest among the band, choir, and orchestra groups. Interest in future private lesson teaching and college-level teaching was high for all respondents.</p>

<p>Teacher communication about careers in music education was assessed with a series of statements pertaining to types of teachers and grade levels, with responses on a scale of 5 = <italic>very frequently</italic> to 0 = <italic>never</italic>. Respondents appeared to have received the most communication from high school teachers (“A high school music teacher talked to me about becoming a music teacher”; <italic>M</italic> = 3.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.39), while the frequency of communication reported from junior high or middle school and elementary music teachers was progressively lower (<italic>M</italic> = 2.31 and <italic>M</italic> = 1.13, respectively). As with influential experiences and individuals, certain items were calculated within groups by primary background (band, orchestra, and choir) to eliminate bias. Within groups, band, orchestra, and choir teachers appeared to be communicating career information with students at similar frequencies (scale means ranged from 3.72 to 3.83). It should be noted that these data might have been impacted by imperfect recall by respondents, which could affect the reported means for junior high or middle school and elementary school. In addition, the data do not provide any information about the content or quality of that teacher communication.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked about the frequency, degree of influence, and relative age of students for 10 potential teaching scenarios they might have experienced during high school. Results appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429412474896">Table 3</xref>. Frequency was measured on a 6-point scale of 5 = <italic>very frequently</italic> to 0 = <italic>never.</italic> Influence was measured on a 6-point scale of 5 = <italic>extremely influential</italic> to 0 = <italic>not at all influential.</italic> To measure the relative age of the students when the respondent was teaching, we had respondents select from three items: “Students were younger than me by two or more grades” (value of −1), “Students were near my same age/grade” (value of 0), or “Students were older than me by two or more grades” (value of 1). On this scale, tendency of the mean toward +1.0 or −1.0 indicates the average strength and direction of the relative age differential. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429412474896">Table 3</xref>, means for influence scale and age of students represent only respondents who had each experience; respondents with no experience with a particular item were not included in the influence and student age means.</p>

<p>Rehearsing small sections (sectional rehearsals) during high school was the most frequent experience (<italic>M</italic> = 3.85) and most influential (<italic>M</italic> = 4.19). Teaching individual lessons or tutoring in music was the second most frequent (<italic>M</italic> = 2.74) and second most influential (<italic>M</italic> = 3.93). Private lessons and tutoring also appeared to provide the most opportunity to work with younger students among music items (<italic>M</italic> = −0.53), although teaching nonmusic subjects as a camp counselor had a lower student age difference mean.</p>
<p>To explore teaching experiences prior to high school, we asked respondents the same 10 items in regard to their junior high or middle school years and their elementary school years. Data indicated these teaching experiences to be much less frequent than during the high school years, and further data on degree of influence and student relative age were unrevealing. For junior high or middle school teaching experiences, all frequency scale means were below 1.0 except “Rehearsing a small section of an ensemble (sectionals)” (<italic>M</italic> = 1.17). For teaching experiences while an elementary student, all frequency scale means were below 0.5. These data appear to indicate that the great majority of experiences and the perceived influences of those experiences were concentrated in the high school years. These data also may indicate that the survey was longer than needed, as several respondents marked a single line through the two pages devoted to experiences prior to high school. This did not seem to influence participation, however, as participants who marked through those two of three pages of experience-related items generally did complete the final page of the survey.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022429412474896" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a strong connection between respondents’ primary musical background and future teaching interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412474896">Table 1</xref>). For example, current band students tended to see themselves teaching high school band (4.44 on a scale of 0 to 5). This relationship is strong across all three traditional high school performance ensembles (band, choir, and orchestra) and suggests a possible explanation for the underrepresentation of the fourth category (general or other music). Individuals identifying a primary musical background outside of the three traditional ensemble areas may identify with private lessons or small-group music-making inside or outside of school settings (such as piano, guitar, or popular music ensembles). These individuals may not perceive themselves in the role of a school music educator, and consequently, these individuals are largely absent from the population of auditionees for traditional music education degree programs. The connection to the three traditional ensembles is consistent with reported influence of experiences and people (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022429412474896">Table 2</xref>). The top three influential experiences all relate to high school ensemble membership, and the most influential group of individuals were high school ensemble directors.</p>
<p>While this connection and personal identification may serve to prompt the young musician to seek a college degree in music education, the current realities of public school music teaching include the need for good teachers in elementary, middle school, and combined grade-level teaching positions and for good teachers at all levels for music courses that serve all students—not only those enrolled in traditional ensemble programs. Indeed, the salient interest of this study’s participants in teaching upper grades and ensemble paradigms stands in contrast to a noticeable disinterest in elementary general music. It is perhaps noteworthy that individuals with a vocal background reported the highest interest in general music teaching, although statistical tests of significant differences were not part of the scope of this study—an area for potential further research. An argument also could be made for promoting increased teacher communication about careers in music education in earlier grades as a way of combatting a potential overfocus on high school–level teaching. However, the content and quality of this communication, including the guidance offered in helping students prepare and apply for a music education major, is even more important than the frequency of that communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412474896">Miksza and Austin (2010)</xref> provided one example of research into the quality of such a program, although they reported the prospective teachers’ experiences of working in a university-based program rather than a public school. Authors of future research could explore the ways the in-service teachers provide information and encouragement to their students about careers in music education.</p>
<p>For music teacher educators, facilitating the sorting process that leads future teachers from being focused primarily on high school band, choir, or orchestra to the full spectrum of public school music teaching possibilities deserves further attention, both in research and in preservice teacher preparation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022429412474896">Robinson (2010)</xref> suggested that various factors, including personality type, eventually prompt some former band students to become elementary general music teachers. His participants’ purposeful shift, from intending to teach band to accepting jobs teaching general music, suggests the power of university course work in broadening students’ awareness of areas beyond high school ensembles. Focusing early field experiences away from future teachers’ primary background might begin this process early in their major.</p>
<p>Data from this study suggest that prospective educators may be most interested in teaching similar courses to those they participated in during high school; therefore, it is possible that students with a background other than band, orchestra, or choir could be recruited to teach music courses outside those traditional three areas. Documentation of the college experiences of the few music education majors whose primary background and teaching interests are other than band, orchestra, or choir, such as piano, guitar, mariachi, or digital media, might provide models of alternative teacher education curricula. A task force of the National Association of Schools of Music, in a move toward encouraging increased curricular flexibility for individual music departments based on their specific contexts, has posted documents intended to stimulate such discussions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=Local_Reviews_UG_Music_Programs">http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=Local_Reviews_UG_Music_Programs</ext-link>). Authors of future research could explore efforts of in-service teachers of school-based instruction in courses such as African drumming or computer-based composition to encourage their students to consider music education as a career, particularly, ways in which these students are prepared (or not) to enter music education programs. University music program admissions criteria and curricula also warrant sustained examination and discussion. Studies that track music education graduates’ actual teaching assignments could provide valuable insights for music teacher educators, as they balance admissions and curricular decisions with state mandates and institutional constraints.</p>
<p>There is also a strong connection indicated between the current participants and private music study. The second most influential individual reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022429412474896">Table 2</xref>) was a private lesson teacher. The fourth most influential experience reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022429412474896">Table 2</xref>) was important performance(s) as an individual. Respondents from all primary background groups (band, choir, and orchestra) rated private lesson teaching as their second strongest future teaching interest, just behind teaching in their primary background at the high school level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412474896">Table 1</xref>). This is consistent with data that indicate that the majority of college music majors, across degree levels (bachelor, master, doctoral) and programs (education, performance, etc.), either plan to teach private music lessons or already do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474896">Fredrickson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022429412474896">Robinson (2010)</xref> reported that former instrumentalists who found general music to be a better professional “fit” often taught private lessons on their instrument to stay connected to the early musical experiences that had influenced them. Current music teacher educators might consider using the strength of this influence to develop field experiences that pair college students with younger children. Music education students could teach private music lessons to children in the college’s surrounding community who cannot afford to pay for lessons and could partner with applied faculty or graduate students to help act as mentors for occasional observation and feedback. This would provide a community engagement opportunity for the music department, another supervised teaching opportunity for music education students, and a way for music education faculty to create a pathway to working with students younger than the high school population desired by most future teachers. The National String Project Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stringprojects.org/">http://www.stringprojects.org/</ext-link>) provides one model for this type of teaching experience for undergraduates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022429412474896">Miksza and Austin (2010)</xref> took the idea of structured field experiences one step farther, to provide teaching opportunities for selected high school students. This approach is supported by the data from this study on the influence of teaching experiences during high school (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429412474896">Table 3</xref>). While there is no direct causal evidence provided from these data, it is worth noting that the experiences reported as most frequent by respondents (leading section rehearsals and teaching private lessons) also were reported as the most influential. These opportunities to assume a teaching role may help reinforce the development of a teacher identity in students who already have begun to develop a stable musician identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412474896">Brewer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474896">Isbell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this study focused on precollege students, the results are not dissimilar from prior studies reporting the recalled influences of college students or in-service teachers (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474896">Bergee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474896">Isbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429412474896">Madsen &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022429412474896">White, 1967</xref>). Music education career aspirants repeatedly cite individual music teachers, teaching role experiences, and the high school ensemble setting as influential factors. Taken together, the consistent evidence of common influences across different populations serves to support an identity formation model of career choice. Influential music educators appear to play an important role in shaping not only the musician identity of their students but also their identity as future teachers. Music educators should be cognizant of this dual role when structuring experiences for their students, particularly because the data suggest that the teacher identity is less stabilized than the musician identity during the primary socialization period prior to college entrance.</p>
<p>Although parents were rated by respondents as moderately influential on their desire to become a music teacher (<italic>M</italic> = 3.30), parents were rated immediately lower than their middle school, junior high, or elementary band, choir, or orchestra teachers (<italic>M</italic> = 3.37) and were rated above professional (<italic>M</italic> = 3.24) and community musicians (<italic>M</italic> = 2.95) in strength of influence. Given the influence of parents on the general population of precollegiate students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429412474896">Kniveton, 2004</xref>), especially those parents who are educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429412474896">Marso &amp; Pigge, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022429412474896">Roberson et al., 1983</xref>), the role of the parent in recruiting aspirant music educators may deserve additional consideration. Ensemble directors and other music educators provide an important connection to parents. When music educators meet with their constituent parent organizations, these and other venues may provide an opportunity to discuss career opportunities in music education with parents who otherwise might not consider these career paths for their precollegiate students. In addition, music teacher educators can more directly encourage preK–12 music educators to use concerts and other parent communication to increase parents’ understandings of the values and benefits of a career in music education.</p>
<p>Although 80.8% of the participants in the present study were White, it is encouraging to note that nearly 20% self-identified as non-White. This suggests that perhaps minimal progress is being made toward diversifying the music education profession. Further research could document the ethnicity of auditionees actually accepted to music education programs, of those who persist to successful degree completion, and of those who actually accept a teaching job following college.</p>
<p>Another area for future research is the examination of the college students who initially elect a major in music education, are accepted by the college or university, but do not finish that degree. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429412474896">Gavin (2010)</xref> conducted in-depth interviews with students who had changed their major out of music education (<italic>N</italic> = 14), he found a small subset who continued their college education in another music degree (<italic>n</italic> = 3). These students reportedly decided that they were just not as interested in teaching as they were in music. For those who did not remain in music, the most common cause was a failure to succeed in their applied lessons either alone or in combination with other music academic activities. This raises questions about the focus and quality of music experiences prior to college compared to music expectations in higher education settings. Gavin suggested that even for students who took private lessons and participated in preteaching experiences in high school, translating those experiences into the successful completion of a bachelor’s degree in music education by no means was guaranteed. If a student who played a successful audition, participated in an acceptable interview with faculty, and had good grades in high school still fails to meet university program goals, it indicates that there are still variables left to explore or intangibles left to identify.</p>
<p>Authors of future studies on this topic might employ more aggressive data collection methods in order to raise the response rate as well as include a broader range of subsamples by institution type and participant musical background. The purpose of this study was limited to presentation of descriptive data. Researchers could employ factor analysis, scale validation techniques, and other inferential tests to draw more overarching conclusions from the individual items presented in this analysis. Further study is needed particularly on interactions between identity formation and career selection, given the role that identification with music performance appears to play in the decision to select a career in music education. While some researchers have begun examining the parallel impact of this identity on students’ consideration of career options in music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412474896">B. Jones &amp; Parkes, 2010</xref>) and in music performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022429412474896">Parkes &amp; Jones, 2011</xref>), it may prove revealing to collect comparative data that could be analyzed for potential discriminant factors between students electing majors in music education and music performance. Future research also might focus on students who share backgrounds and experiences similar to the population of this study but who do not choose to audition as music majors in college, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474896">Bates (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474896">Bright (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412474896">Brumbaugh (2003)</xref>. Such research might yield a deeper understanding of which influences identified in this and other studies are truly unique to the students who choose to pursue careers in music education.</p>
