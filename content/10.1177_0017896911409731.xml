<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regular physical activity substantially reduces the risk of dying from coronary heart disease and decreases the risk of colon cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911409731">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911409731">5</xref></sup>. Specific diseases related to regular physical activity in prospective, observational studies include cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, breast cancer, anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911409731">6</xref></sup>. Physical activity helps to control weight, contributes to healthy bones, muscles, and joints, and helps to relieve the pain of arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911409731">7</xref></sup>. In general, those with moderate to high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness exhibit lower mortality and morbidity that those leading sedentary lifestyles or who have low cardiorespiratory fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911409731">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the proven benefits of physical activity, more than 50% of American adults do not get enough physical activity to provide health benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911409731">7</xref></sup>. Physical activity participation is low and physical inactivity is high among the United States (US) adult population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911409731">8</xref></sup>. The latest statistics report that less than half (49.1%) of US adults met the Centers for Disease Control/American College of Sports Medicine (CDC/ACSM) physical activity recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911409731">9</xref></sup>. In 2008 almost 24% of adults reported no leisure-time activity. Because a majority of adults in the US are not sufficiently active, physical activity promotion is relevant and important. In response to the current situation, there has been a growing call for population-wide interventions aimed at improving exercise involvement and commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911409731">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The worksite has been suggested as an important setting for the promotion of exercise because of the established channels of communication, existing support networks and opportunities for developing corporate norms of behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911409731">11</xref></sup>. Most adults spend up to 50 hours a week at work, and the workplace has a significant environmental influence on employee health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911409731">12</xref></sup>. A fundamental problem encountered by worksite exercise programmes is that they tend to attract individuals who are already physically active. This situation provides support for employees that are active but fails to reach sedentary employees who can benefit most from exercise programmes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911409731">13</xref></sup>. One way to target sedentary and insufficiently active employees is to develop educational programmes designed to teach them the skills necessary to implement exercise programmes in their own homes or neighbourhoods. An advantage of this approach is that worksites do not have to provide onsite fitness facilities. By incorporating self-regulation constructs into exercise interventions, employees can learn how to design personally-tailored programmes of self regulation to become regular exercisers.</p>
<p>Social cognitive theory (SCT), developed by Albert Bandura<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409731">14</xref></sup>, addresses both the psychosocial dynamics motivating health behaviour and methods for promoting behavioural change. The theory references the individual’s capabilities to symbolize the meanings of behaviour, their ability to foresee the outcomes of given behaviour patterns, to learn by observing others, to self-regulate behaviour, and to reflect and analyze experiences among the critical personal factors that help determine whether or not a particular behaviour will occur in a particular situation. Personal change is affected by whether people even consider changing health habits, whether they can enlist the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they choose to do so, and how well they maintain the changes they have achieved. Action, cognition and environmental factors operate interactively to produce and maintain behavioral changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409731">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An important feature of SCT is the central role it assigns to self-regulatory functions. People’s behaviours are motivated and regulated by internal standards and self-evaluative reactions to their own actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409731">14</xref></sup>. Self-regulation for exercise involves developing a set of skills, including self-monitoring, goal setting or supportive feedback, to promote regular exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911409731">15</xref></sup>. Self-regulation has been moderately correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .39) with self-regulation and exercise maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911409731">16</xref></sup>. Exercise self-efficacy is a personal judgement about the ability to overcome barriers to exercise. Self-efficacy is an important prerequisite for behaviour change because it affects how much effort is invested in a given task and what level of performance is attained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911409731">17</xref></sup>. Rhodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911409731">18</xref></sup> reports that self-efficacy has adequate stability. Social support is a person’s perception of the instrumental and emotional help to exercise that is received from their social environment. The social environment includes both family and social acquaintances. Social support during early periods of personal change and maintenance increases long-term success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911409731">19</xref></sup>. Outcome expectations are beliefs that a person holds about the personal rewards that will be produced by exercise, and outcome expectancies are the values a person places on the results of exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911409731">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although there is evidence supporting the relationship between SCT constructs and exercise adherence, worksite theory-based exercise behaviour change interventions have produced modest results at best. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a SCT-based, educational, exercise, behaviour change programme designed to increase insufficiently active, adult, employee’s self-reported duration and frequency of exercise. Specifically the SCT constructs of self-regulation, self-efficacy, social support, and outcome expectations and expectancies will be targeted by the intervention.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0017896911409731">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A quasi-experimental, separate-sample, pre-test–post-test group design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911409731">20</xref></sup> was employed in the current study. This design is recommended when random assignment of subjects is not possible. In this design all participants enrolled in the study received the intervention. The investigator then randomly assigned participant scores to either a treatment group or comparison group after the treatment had been delivered. Comparisons were then made between the post-test treatment group scores and the pre-test comparison group scores. Furthermore, one- and three-month follow-up measures (hereafter called follow-up one and follow-up two, respectively) were also compared to the pre-test comparison group scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911409731">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The project was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided informed consent. To recruit subjects, an introduction letter was sent to 17 local area corporations, each with more than 250 employees. Four companies agreed to participate in the study. Three of the four worksites had onsite fitness facilities, while the fourth paid employees up to US$300 per year to join an off-site fitness facility. Participants were recruited via onsite flyers and posters, as well as in monthly company newsletters, staff emails, and daily, company email news briefs. Subjects that were recruited ranged from 20 to 47 among the four worksites, making randomization at the organizational level not feasible.</p>
<p>Several worksite exercise studies have been criticized for having a high percentage of physically-active subjects at pre-test. Responding to this concern, the current study targeted insufficiently active employees. The intervention was tailored to inactive employees. Recruitment messages were geared towards those individuals. Only those who classified themselves as insufficiently active or sedentary were eligible for the study. Potential subjects were pre-screened for study inclusion. Volunteer employees completed the Stage of Change for Exercise Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911409731">21</xref></sup>. Employees who categorized themselves as in the contemplation or preparation stages of change were eligible for the study. According to the stage of change classifications, these individuals are either inactive or do not regularly meet the current exercise recommendations. Eligible employees were enrolled on a first reply basis if they met the inclusion criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896911409731">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>All of the instruments used in this study were developed in earlier studies and had established validity and reliability. The Stage of Change for Exercise Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911409731">21</xref></sup> describes an individual’s stage of exercise readiness. Individuals chose one of five categories that best described their current level of exercise participation. The stages are: pre-contemplation (individuals are inactive and do not intend to initiate an exercise programme within the next six months); contemplation (individuals are inactive and intend to begin regular exercise within six months); preparation (individuals are irregularly active below the ACSM criterion level of three or more times per week for at least 20 minutes); action (individuals have been consistently active for the past six months); and maintenance (individuals have sustained regular exercise for at least six months). Subjects were eligible for the study if they chose the contemplation or preparation stage of change, meaning they were currently inactive but intended to begin exercising within six months, or they were insufficiently active.</p>
<p>The seven day recall of exercise questionnaire was originally developed as the seven day physical activity recall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911409731">22</xref></sup>. It was first used in the Stanford Five City Project in 1984. It has been widely used to document physical activity levels and has been refined and modified over the years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911409731">23</xref></sup>. In the current study, the seven day recall of exercise questionnaire (7DRE-Q)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911409731">15</xref></sup>, a variation of the seven day physical activity recall, was used. It is a self-administered survey that examines participant exercise levels over the previous seven days. It was developed to capture participant’s self-reported, planned, moderate and vigorous-intensity duration and frequency leisure time exercise.</p>
<p>As defined by Bandura<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911409731">24</xref></sup>, self-directed behaviour change requires the development of self-regulatory skills and operates through a set of sub-functions that must be developed and mobilized. Self-regulation for exercise involves developing a set of skills, such as self-monitoring, goal setting or supportive feedback, to promote regular exercise. Petosa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911409731">16</xref></sup> developed a self-regulation scale to assess to what degree self-regulation strategies are used to support the acquisition of regular exercise. The 52-item self-regulation instrument contains items that are thought to be related to exercise participation. Items include self-monitoring, goal setting, outcomes of physical activity, reinforcements and environmental aid. Participants rate their use of these techniques over the previous four weeks, from 1 (never) to 4 (often).</p>
<p>Self-efficacy, which is referred to as perceived self-efficacy, is a self-evaluative judgement about one’s abilities related to performance attainments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911409731">25</xref></sup>. The self-efficacy instrument, developed by Garcia and King<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911409731">25</xref></sup>, is a 14-item instrument that measures an adult’s confidence that they could exercise in the face of common barriers. Participants rate their confidence for exercise in the face of barriers, on a scale of 0–100% (positively could not to positively could exercise).</p>
<p>Treiber et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911409731">26</xref></sup> social support instrument assesses a participant’s perception of their social support for exercise (friends and family). Social support and modelling of active lifestyles by family members and friends contributes to perceived self-regulatory efficacy to remain physically active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911409731">27</xref></sup>. Participants rate a series of statements, from 1 (no support) to 5 (very often), about their family and friend’s support for exercise during the previous three months.</p>
<p>Outcome expectations are the anticipated results from participating in the behaviour, and outcome expectancy is the value a person places on the anticipated outcomes of the behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911409731">17</xref></sup> The 25-item outcome expectations and expectancies scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911409731">28</xref></sup> combined the Benefits of Physical Activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911409731">10</xref></sup> and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) instrument to assess both the negative and positive outcomes of physical activity and exercise, and the value associated with each. Respondents indicate their level of agreement with positive and negative statements regarding the possible effects of regular exercise (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely likely). Participants indicate the value of each outcome by rating the personal importance of each of the statements, ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important).</p>

<sec id="section6-0017896911409731">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The educational components and attributes of the intervention were developed by the investigators based on results observed in the literature. Self-regulation, self-efficacy, social support, and outcome expectations and expectancies each had positive outcomes related to exercise adherence in the theory-based, worksite, physical activity literature. The constructs were chosen to enhance the purpose of the study. The programme length and follow-up time-frame mirrored what has been conducted in similar studies. The current investigation was a pilot study.</p>
<p>The treatment condition consisted of six one-hour classroom-based sessions. The intervention was educational in nature. Classes were held on company grounds in a classroom or lecture-type hall. Class sessions included PowerPoint presentations, in-class work, group work, and a weekly take-home assignment. Exercise was to be done in the participant’s own time, outside of class. Participants could choose what type of exercise they wished to perform; however, the instructor highlighted the importance of choosing activities that were appropriate for individuals new to an exercise programme and provided them with multiple examples.</p>
<p>In the first month the instructor met with the participants four times, one day per week. In the second month the instructor met with the participants twice every other week. The pre-test assessment was completed during the first class session, before the intervention began. The post-test assessment was completed at the last class session, after the intervention had been concluded. The intervention taught subjects self-regulation skills (self-monitoring, goal setting, time management), self-efficacy skills (overcoming barriers, exercise preferences), social support for exercise, outcome expectations and expectancies (reasons to exercise, value) of exercise. It was anticipated that the intervention would increase exercise participation through the development of self-regulation skills, improved self-efficacy, the use of social support, and a positive outcome-expectancy value.</p>
<p>The contents of the first class session included introducing the programme and explaining the purpose of the study. The pre-test questionnaire was completed. Self-regulation was briefly introduced to the subjects highlighting the concept of exercise self-monitoring and the physical activity recommendations were discussed as well. For their homework assignment participants were asked to identify locations in their environments where they could exercise (at home, at work).</p>
<p>The second class session provided in-depth instruction on self-regulation detailing exercise self-monitoring, time management and goal setting. The use of activity logs to monitor activity was promoted. Participants learned about SMART goals (specific, attainable, measurable, realistic), and how to develop exercise goals. In-class and group-work consisted of identifying incorrect and correct exercise behaviour goals. Time was spent on how to evaluate goals. As a homework assignment participants had to formulate one long-term and one weekly, short-term exercise-related goal.</p>
<p>The third session focused on self-efficacy, defined as overcoming barriers. The class identified common exercise barriers and discussed strategies to overcome them. In small groups subjects identified one to two additional strategies to overcome those barriers. These strategies were shared with the rest of the class. As a homework assignment the participants had to identify at least one personal exercise barrier and develop a way to overcome it. Additionally, participants were asked to develop one weekly, short-term exercise goal for the upcoming week and to monitor their exercise.</p>
<p>The fourth class session highlighted the importance of exercise enjoyment. The instructor taught the class the importance of enjoying exercise for adherence purposes, and discussed ways in which subjects could make choices that enabled them to enjoy their exercise. As a homework assignment the participants selected their exercise preferences from a list of choices. In doing so it helped them to determine what they enjoyed and did not enjoy about exercise, enabling them to then determine activities they could engage in. Additionally, reasons for exercising were discussed in this class. Participants provided examples of the reasons why people exercise (risk of disease, personal choice, social component). This concept can also be a motivating factor to increase adherence. Participants were also reminded to develop one weekly, short-term exercise goal and to monitor their exercise.</p>
<p>The fifth class session was held in the sixth week of the programme. The purpose of this was to wean subjects off the programme and hold them more accountable to their exercise programmes. The fifth class focused on the importance and utilization of social support to help subjects adhere to their exercise programmes. Different types of social support examples were discussed and the group learned how to identify and evaluate social support. As a homework assignment the participants identified different types of social support they could employ to adhere to their exercise programmes. Participants were again reminded to develop one weekly short-term exercise goal and to monitor their exercise.</p>
<p>The final (sixth) class session, which was held in week eight, introduced the concept of outcome expectations and expectancies. The investigator discussed the importance of identifying the outcomes of exercise and how the person needed to place a value on it. Examples of exercise outcomes were given and the investigator explained that the value associated with the outcome is different for everyone. The class also identified, discussed and developed strategies to overcome some of the negative outcomes of physical activity (physical exertion, time away from family). To conclude the intervention the investigator summarized the purpose of the programme, all of the strategies they had learned in the programme, and reminded participants how important and useful the skills they had learned were to help them adhere to their individual exercise programmes. Participants completed the post-test questionnaire. Participants were also reminded one last time to create one short-term exercise goal for the upcoming week, and to monitor their exercise. Additionally, participants who had completed the programme successfully were given incentive prizes, as a thank you for participating in the study (pedometer and a cafeteria gift certificate).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Subjects were excluded from the analyses if they did not complete a pre-test questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 6), they did not attend more than three class sessions (n = 63), or they did not complete a post-test (<italic>n</italic> = 59), follow-up one questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 85) or follow-up two questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 99). Means and standard deviations were calculated for each moderate and vigorous exercise variable. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze differences between groups for moderate and vigorous exercise duration and frequency. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS, version 15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911409731">29</xref></sup>. Effect sizes were calculated for all exercise variables. The a priori alpha was <italic>p</italic> = .05, and a Bonferroni alpha correction was made due to the multiple analyses.</p>
<p>In keeping in line with the study design, the between-group analysis was the correct statistical analysis test to use because of the comparisons that were made. Analyses could not occur at the worksite level because attendance ranged from low (20) to moderate (47). There were no co-variates used in the analysis, so the analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) method was not used to determine the impact of the intervention. The between-group ANOVA analysis provided the investigators with the type of results required of the study design.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Demographic information on the entire sample is presented because the sample was not analyzed at the organizational level. Prior to the intervention all subjects classified themselves as in the contemplation or preparation stage of change. A majority of subjects were female (83%). A majority of subjects had obtained a bachelor’s or post-bachelor’s degree (61%). Nearly all subjects were married (77%). A majority of the study sample was Caucasian (84%).</p>
<p>There was a 43% attrition rate at post-test, a 65% attrition rate at follow-up one and a 76% attrition rate at follow-up two. Pre-test moderate and vigorous exercise means and standard deviations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911409731">Table 1</xref> and the post-test and follow-up treatment group means are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911409731">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0017896911409731">3</xref>.

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations to the current study, and the results should be interpreted with caution. The study design used in the investigation introduced several uncontrollable threats to internal and external validity. Regression, testing and selection are the only threats to internal validity that are controlled for; therefore, this weakens the design of the study and introduces multiple rival explanations when interpreting the results. Maturation and mortality are two rival threats that could have impacted the results of the study. Multiple sub-class analyses were used to determine if mortality and maturation affected the outcomes. For moderate exercise, the results signified that they did not impact exercise at any time frame. For vigorous exercise, it appeared mortality played a role in the results at follow-up.</p>
<p>Self-regulation scores were positively impacted by the treatment, as evident from the sub-class analyses. Rival threats did not impact the results and scores increased as a result of the treatment. For self-efficacy, social support and outcome expectations it was clear the intervention did not produce the desired results because scores remained unchanged or decreased throughout the investigation.</p>
<p>Similar to most interventions conducted at the worksite, the current study had a high mortality rate. By follow-up two, 76% of the sample had dropped out of the study. Loss of subjects can result in non-significant findings because of the reduced power of statistical tests. In addition, the study design dictated that only half of the sample was used to make comparisons. Post-test and follow-up scores were compared to pre-test scores, therefore decreasing the sample even more. This too has implications for reduced power of statistical tests and insignificant findings.</p>
<p>Because of the study design there are multiple interactions that may have occurred during the intervention since a random sample was not used. Interactions such as testing and regression were not controlled for, and the generalizability of the results was greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the programme took place in January the time of the year in which the intervention was conducted was a confounder to the study. The intervention began immediately in the New Year. Many people make New Year’s resolutions and are motivated to ‘get in shape’, to lose weight or to start exercising. This may have increased interest and enrollment in the programme.</p>
<p>Self-reported measures are a limitation of the current study. Although all of the instruments used in the present study had established validity and reliability, self-report measures rely upon the participants to accurately recall their exercise and use of social cognitive theory skills. Self-report instruments are less reliable than objective measures of exercise because they are subject to biases such as the over- and under-reporting of information and socially acceptable answers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911409731">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, an implementer effect may have influenced the study results. The investigator controlled the high level of programme fidelity and programme implementation, but it may have created a level of demand characteristics that affected the participants. The investigator could have positively influenced participant’s dedication and level of commitment to the intervention, as well as to their own exercise programmes, because they knew the value of the programme to the investigator.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the current study suggest that exercise behaviour can be improved during a two-month, theoretically-based, educational intervention. A strong case can be made to include individuals who are insufficiently active as it targets those who can benefit most from exercise interventions. Additionally, the use of self-regulation skills and enjoyment of exercise can help individuals begin and maintain an exercise programme. Although there are instances in the literature where self-efficacy and social support have shown to be an important piece to exercise adherence, the results of the current study mirror half of the literature which suggests more time be spent on self-efficacy skill building and social support identification. For health promotion specialists at the workplace effective, efficient and safe educationally-based, exercise interventions are needed to successfully promote and encourage employee exercise participation. Attributes of an intervention, such as skill building based on theoretical constructs, documenting attendance, providing homework assignments and having participants complete weekly activity logs and set weekly goals can positively contribute to improved exercise adherence.</p>
