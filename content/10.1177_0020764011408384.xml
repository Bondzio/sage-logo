<p>It is generally accepted that mental disorders are most effectively treated by a team effort, with contributions by people from a wide variety of disciplines. It is obviously desirable for this to be reflected in the scientific literature. Those of us who are involved in the production and dissemination of scientific literature will know that this, however, is not the case: some parts of the team are considerably more productive than others. Psychiatrists produce research papers at the drop of a hat. Clinical psychologists are scarcely less active, and nurses have begun to realize the importance of an evidence base. On the other hand, getting occupational therapists, drama therapists or social workers to contribute research can be a heartbreaking task. What those groups tend to do instead is to produce small, cheap paperbacks full of semi-fictitious single case studies and vague personal reminiscences.</p>
<p>Such books are important and useful, in that they can provide solace and encouragement for specialists working in relative isolation, and can be a fruitful source of tips, suggestions and stimulating ideas. They are not, however, a substitute for research.</p>
<p><italic>Creative Arts in Dementia Care</italic> is an excellent example of this genre, produced by Jessica Kingsley, a profuse publisher of such works. I have often thought that the literature would be improved, and a few trees saved from pulping, if Jessica Kingsley published only half the number of books but put twice the effort into editing and reviewing them. Parts of this book look superficially like an evidence-based report: ‘…movement and dance stimulate the immune system (Hartley 2004), reduce anxiety (Payne 2006), enhance co-ordination (Payne 2006) and build relationship (Hayes 2004). Creativity has been said to “cure the soul” (McNiff 2004)…’ It is only if you take the trouble to check up on all these references that you discover that they all simply lead on to very similar books, or even in one case to a novel on the theme of dementia.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the authors are right in their judgements. Povey’s single-case descriptions of music therapy with elderly patients with dementia match my own experience, when my poor mother could still enjoy poetry and song long after losing coherent speech. I only hope that, when my time comes, I will find someone as sympathetic as Povey, with the time to sing with me through the hymns that I learned in primary school assembly. However, the evidence of my own eyes is not enough – after all I also have personal knowledge of a heavy smoker who lived well into his 90s and of a fit non-smoking jogger who dropped dead in his 50s. It takes statistical research to really prove the effectiveness of lifestyles and treatments. I would recommend <italic>Creative Arts in Dementia Care</italic> as a source of comforting and encouraging ideas on the use of dance, drama and music, within its limits. However, it is important to remember what these limits are.</p>
<p><italic>Introduction to Art Therapy Research</italic> is a welcome text designed to counterbalance these limitations. In fact it almost leans the other way. For no apparent reason all the chapters are headed up with lengthy and obscure quotations about hunting. Apart from these oddities, this is a good basic textbook of research methods in general, with chapters on tools, steps and processes, including literature reviewing and identifying research questions, quantitative modelling, outcomes research, participant observation, and researching the phenomena of conscious experience – broadly speaking, qualitative research. The final part of the book takes us through research proposals, institutional review boards and other ethical safeguards, reading and evaluating research reports, and finally, on writing for publication. The author has been the editor of <italic>Art Therapy Research &amp; Evidence-Based Practice</italic> for some years and clearly has had considerable experience in coaxing reluctant art therapists into publishing. There is, quite rightly, more emphasis on qualitative research than might be the case in some other fields of endeavour, but apart from that this is a good basic introduction to standard research methodology. There are, of course, a great many basic introductions to research methods on the market, but this would be a useful addition to the armoury, and the titular emphasis on art therapy might encourage some of the more reluctant members of the mental health team to make use of it.</p>
<p>Music and the use of habit-forming substances are curiously intertwined. Musicians, from Beethoven’s sizeable alcohol intake to Siberian shamen getting high on the urine of reindeer fed on fly agaric, are notoriously heavy users. The audiences for different genres are associated with different intoxicants – as a folk singer/songwriter myself, I find the activity inseparable from beer. Modern jazz is epitomized by the cigarette smoke curling up above Mile Davis’s trumpet. The psychedelic sounds of my youth were supposedly triggered by LSD, though in my recollection marijuana was in more frequent use; and grunge was, more tragically, heavily linked with heroin. These topics are mentioned in <italic>Music Therapy and Addictions</italic>, but the book is rather more concerned with the use of music to bring about therapeutic change. Contributors come from various countries, ranging from an Iranian study of music therapy in helping addicts (which sounds like a fairly risky business, given the official Iranian attitude both to music and to substance abuse) to a Finnish study involving allowing gambling addicts to use a ‘physioacoustic chair’ – an improbable-looking apparatus like a dentist’s chair with huge bass woofer speakers embedded in it. The majority of the contributors have taken on board the fact that bald assertions backed up by references to other bald assertions are not enough, and have endeavoured to show that they have carried out serious research. None of them, of course, can claim that music therapy is the answer, or even a major contributor. Between them, however, they manage to demonstrate that music therapy can play a measureable minor but useful role in the treatment of addicted individuals.</p>
<p>Three books then. <italic>Creative Arts in Dementia Care</italic> is worth considering as a source of inspiration, though it lacks an evidence base. <italic>Introduction to Art Therapy Research</italic> can be recommended as a clear, concise but rather dry guide to the mechanics of producing such an evidence base: describing techniques that ought to be understood by all therapists. <italic>Music Therapy and Addictions</italic> is, perhaps, less inspiring than <italic>Creative Arts in Dementia Care</italic> but does use some of these research techniques to demonstrate that therapies based on one of the creative arts can make a modest contribution to treatments in a complex and controversial field. All in all, an interesting weekend’s reading.</p>
