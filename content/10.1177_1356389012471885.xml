<abstract>
<p>This article identifies pathways through which impacts from the 2014 Commonwealth Games might arise. It also assesses the likelihood of positive impacts and considers how best to evaluate the games. The pathways identified are: economic growth; increased sports participation; increased pride and sense of identity; volunteering; improved environment; and legacy programmes. There is little or no evidence from previous major multi-sports events to suggest that any of these pathways are likely to generate meaningful positive outcomes although there is an absence of evidence for some. The available evidence could be improved if the 2014 Games were to be evaluated using: retrospective cohort analysis for discrete interventions; theory-based comparative cohort analyses, which includes an assessment of opportunity costs for effects that are intrinsic to hosting the event; and a realist evaluation of ‘catalytic impacts’.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major sports events such as the Olympic Games and Football World Cup are increasingly being viewed as interventions to enhance health, wealth and a plethora of social outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389012471885">Horne and Manzenreiter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389012471885">Preuss, 2007</xref>). A trend is emerging where the most deprived areas of large cities are utilized as event locations, largely because of available ‘brownfield’ land and the perception that the event will bring social and economic regeneration to a blighted city area. London chose to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Stratford (an area in the east of London with a large amount of derelict land, relatively high deprivation and a concentration of health and social problems) and Glasgow has chosen Dalmarnock (a sub-area of east Glasgow that is the poorest area in the UK and the area with the lowest life expectancy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356389012471885">Shaw et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government justified their decision to bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games by suggesting it would generate a positive legacy for health and the socio-economic determinants of health for the deprived community in the east of Glasgow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012471885">Glasgow City Council, 2007</xref>). The Scottish Government proposed that these positive impacts would arise principally through: increased physical activity (arising due to an ‘inspiration effect’ from the athleticism hosted in the community); volunteering (where members of the community would gain new skills and confidence by being valued for the voluntary input during the event); new sports infrastructure (although less new infrastructure is to be built in Glasgow to host the Games, new facilities such as an indoor badminton arena, a cycling velodrome and a new hockey facility are to be built); improved catering within existing sports facilities, which will benefit regular sports spectators and improve their diet; economic growth and increased employment (and the consequent income, status, skills and social networks which can arise from this) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389012471885">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>). A participatory Health Impact Assessment (HIA) performed on the Games plan confirmed that these were the most likely mechanisms through which impacts might arise, although an additional mechanism involving civic pride was also identified as well as some concerns about potential adverse consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012471885">Booker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>The anticipated positive impacts by the Scottish Government and City Council were not, however, reflected in recent systematic reviews looking at previous major multi-sport events. These reviews found that evaluations of previous events were very limited (especially for health outcomes) and that there was a lack of evidence of positive impacts (even where a greater quantity of evidence was available, as was the case for economic outcomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed et al., 2009</xref>). If claims of positive impacts are to continue to be made by Governments, organizing committees and sports governing bodies without better justification, the credibility of their claims is likely to be diminished. This article discusses how likely positive impacts are to arise from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and how we can best evaluate them. This work is likely to have relevance in other host cities.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The methodological approach for this study was to uncover all the available legacy theories using a range of available sources. This included the Scottish Government’s and Glasgow City Council’s legacy documentation; the participatory public engagement exercise that was undertaken as part of a Health Impact Assessment (HIA); and two systematic reviews of the academic and grey literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012471885">Glasgow City Council, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389012471885">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012471885">Glasgow City Council, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012471885">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356389012471885">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012471885">Booker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012471885">Hexagon Research and Consulting, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012471885">McCartney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>). The HIA involved an initial scoping phase with a large group of key stakeholders and experts, the use of the same systematic reviews (these synthesized all available data on the impact of major sports on health, social and economic outcomes and included information on the proposed mechanisms linking the events and the outcomes) and an extended community engagement exercise. No other reviews of the literature focusing on the mechanisms linking the intervention and the outcomes were available.</p>
<p>The identified theoretical mechanisms between the intervention and outcomes were then overlaid and interrogated. The purpose of this was to uncover whether there were ‘critical pathways’ that would be required to witness change if impacts were to be realized. In this way, several different mechanisms might pass through a single critical pathway. For example, if economic growth and improved health were theorized to occur as a result of increased employment, the critical pathway that would need to change for these outcomes to be seen would be increased employment. This process generated a series of very complex diagrams (nicknamed spaghettigrams), which exposed all of the proposed mechanisms of action (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012471885">Figure 1</xref> for an example) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012471885">McCartney, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Having identified all of the mechanisms proposed in the Government reports and HIA, a smaller number of critical pathways were identified that were common to multiple mechanisms and through which all mechanisms passed (i.e. all routes between the intervention and the health outcomes passed through one of the critical pathways). The likelihood of change in these critical pathways was then critically appraised using the evidence from previous events (using the systematic reviews) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed, 2009</xref>). The mechanisms were divided into three types (direct, project and catalytic), which allowed evidence from similar interventions to be generalized to assist in predicting the impact of the event.</p>
<p>In this article we use ‘mechanism’ to describe a specific component of an overall critical pathway. For example, the creation of jobs is a mechanism but it is part of an overall critical pathway that links employment levels, the economic benefits of employment, the social benefits of employment (and much else) to health outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section3-1356389012471885" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Six critical pathways were identified through which almost every proposed mechanism passed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389012471885">Table 1</xref>). Critical pathways 1−5 are ‘direct effects’, and cannot easily be disentangled from hosting an event and are likely to be present in all host cities. Critical pathway 6 is best described as a ‘project effect’, since it is not integral to the hosting of the event and tends to vary between host cities. There is a further category for which there is no critical pathway illustrated: the catalytic effect. This is said to arise in host cities without any particular intervention and is poorly defined. The catalytic effect, and its poor definition, is covered further in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Critical pathway 1: Economic growth</title>
<p>For a positive legacy to arise from economic growth, the Games need to generate an increase in tourism, increase inward investment and increase exporting of goods and services (trade) such that: taken together, they offset the opportunity costs of investment in Games-related infrastructure and other Games-related spending (such as policing); or the investment in Games-related infrastructure has to have a greater ‘multiplier effect’ (i.e. the impact on the rest of the economy resulting from the investment being spent numerous times as it transfers between suppliers, workers, shops, etc.) than the multiplier effect that would have been seen with investment in other public sector projects and policies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012471885">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012471885-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>A systematic review of previous events suggests that these assumptions are not robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>). From studies examining these, the impacts on tourism (both during and after the event) and economic growth are at best unclear, and at worst negligible or even negative. The opportunity costs have not been accounted for in the economic evaluations of previous events. Furthermore, the ‘dose’ of the 2014 Games is less than many of the events included in the systematic review (e.g. Olympic Games attract a much larger number of athletes and tourists) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>A wider debate is taking place within public health about whether the benefits of economic growth on health and social circumstances seen in the last 150 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012471885">Fogel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389012471885">McKeown, 1976</xref>) are now unlikely to be associated with future health and social gains because of the dangers of climate change, resource scarcity, obesity, inequalities and consumerist-driven mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012471885">Hanlon and McCartney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012471885">Homer-Dixon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389012471885">Jackson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012471885">McCartney and Hanlon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356389012471885">Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009</xref>). Further economic growth in the current mode is therefore likely to intensify these problems that arise from this market-orientated and consumerist mindset. Despite this, it is very likely that economic growth, were it to be realized, would increase employment, income (although income inequality may increase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012471885">Murphy and Bauman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389012471885">Preuss, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1356389012471885">Vila and Gavalda, 2006</xref>) and service provision. However, economic growth driven largely by public sector investment in event infrastructure is likely to have a large opportunity cost elsewhere in the public sector − a phenomenon witnessed in Sydney following the 2000 Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356389012471885">Searle, 2002</xref>). In Glasgow’s favour, there is less investment in infrastructure required to host the event as many existing venues are being utilized or refurbished (in contrast to other events such as the 2012 Olympic Games).</p>
<p>On balance, there is little or no evidence to support the assertion that the Games will generate increased economic growth because of the opportunity costs, but there is a possibility that the Games will increase inequalities or reduce public spending on other policies and programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356389012471885">
<title>Critical pathway 2: Increased sports participation</title>
<p>A systematic review focusing on this critical pathway identified two mechanisms through which such impacts might occur: a ‘festival’ effect and a ‘demonstration’ effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed et al., 2009</xref>). The ‘demonstration’ effect relates to the ability of events to increase the physical activity of people already participating in sport − largely through the influence of role models. The evidence in the review suggests that the impact of this effect is likely to be marginal and tempered by individuals switching between sports rather than increasing their total physical activity. The ‘festival’ effect relates to the possible increase in sports participation for those not currently participating. The review suggests that this effect is also likely to be limited (probably confined to an ability to increase the contemplation of physical activity in non-participating individuals) and dependent on: general support for the event; that the route into physical activity is not sport-based; and that the event or intervention is rooted in the local community. There are two other possible mechanisms that might lead to increased sports participation: the provision of new infrastructure and the ‘project effects’ from sports participation legacy programmes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012471885">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012471885">1</xref></sup></p>

<caption>
<p>The sports participation critical pathway.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012471885-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>There has been little evidence of physical activity impacts from previous events. There was a steady increase in Barcelona in the decade before and two years following the Olympics and there was a mean decrease in physical activity following the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002 (a decrease that was also associated with increased inequalities in participation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>). The quantity of new sports infrastructure being built in Glasgow is relatively modest in comparison to previous events, and some of the infrastructure is not designed to maximize sports participation (e.g. the cycling velodrome is a facility most likely to suit existing sports participants and elite cyclists, and the new 50m pool at Tollcross will be adjacent to the existing pool and will therefore not provide much additional access). At best, this critical pathway is likely to have a very modest positive impact and probably only on individuals who already participate in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed et al., 2009</xref>). There is also a possibility that inequalities in physical activity may increase. The question of whether the construction of these facilities has created an opportunity cost to other community facilities is also pertinent given that a swimming pool and community centres elsewhere in the city have recently been earmarked for closure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356389012471885">
<title>Critical pathway 3: Increased pride and sense of identity</title>
<p>There is somewhat of an evidence gap for this critical pathway, although less is expected of it in terms of direct impacts described by decision-makers. It was, however, repeatedly identified in the community engagement of the HIA by the general public (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1356389012471885">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012471885-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>The likely effect of this critical pathway is largely unknown and in need of thorough evaluation. However, there is certainly an opportunity for the event to recast and rebrand the City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012471885">Ashworth and Voogd, 1990</xref>). During the 1980s, Glasgow was marketed, both to its people and to the rest of the world, as ‘Glasgow’s Miles Better’ − branded on a ‘Mr Happy’ as a kind of friendly face with a confidence beyond the reality in the City during this decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012471885">Devine, 1999</xref>). This evolved into the era of the Glasgow Garden Festival, the City of Culture, the City of Architecture and, eventually by the late ‘noughties’, to, ‘Glasgow: city with style’. This was an attempt to market Glasgow as a consumer paradise, criss-crossed with the biggest and best shopping arcades and all the services that accompany them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012471885">Garcia, 2005</xref>). In common with the growing public health analysis of economic growth, an overwhelming concern and identity with consumerism is unlikely to be helpful for public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012471885">Carlisle et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012471885">2008</xref>). If Glasgow was to use this opportunity to reframe its identity, then a net positive impact might be expected (and this may happen independently of policymakers, for example, if the media were to identify new narratives for the city). However, a reframing of the city’s identity does not look likely to be pursued by decision-makers; the potential for the critical pathway to generate positive impacts is therefore likely to be muted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389012471885">
<title>Critical pathway 4: Volunteering experience</title>
<p>It is estimated that 15,000 volunteers will be required during the 11 days of the Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389012471885">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>). Volunteering is said to bring a variety of benefits both to the community at large and to the individual volunteers. In the context of major sports events, the best researched event was the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester where a series of qualitative studies suggested that some volunteers perceived that they had enhanced their skills as a result of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389012471885">Lumsdon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356389012471885">Ralston et al., 2004</xref>). From these studies it appears the experience was varied with some enjoying the experience and gaining skills and new social networks (without any specific patterning in the demographics of those who felt that they benefited); with others not enjoying the experience at all, feeling ‘used’ by the event, being underutilized or badly treated. The evidence for longer-lasting impacts either on the volunteers or the community that might benefit is missing (although much discussed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012471885">Burrows, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012471885">Chalip, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012471885">Kemp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356389012471885">Theodore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012471885">Lynch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389012471885">Preuss and Kebernik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356389012471885">Reeser et al., 2005</xref>). There is no evidence that the Manchester volunteers were more likely to volunteer after the event, even among the select group of study participants that were followed after the Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356389012471885">Ralston et al., 2004</xref>). Given that there is a lack of a large positive change in these short-term outcomes, it is implausible to expect long-term benefits to accrue. Therefore, a large or widespread positive impact arising from this critical pathway cannot be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1356389012471885">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Critical pathway 5: Improved environment</title>
<p>There is a much more robust evidence base for the impacts of improved housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356389012471885">Thomson et al., 2001</xref>), regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1356389012471885">Thomson et al., 2006</xref>), transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012471885">Douglas et al., 2007</xref>) and urban planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012471885">NHS Health Scotland, 2008</xref>) on health and well-being. This evidence isn’t unequivocal and contains many nuances, but it suggests that improvements in each of these domains may well have important health impacts. What is much less clear is that major sports events are likely to create the kinds of improvements in housing, transport and urban environment that might benefit health and social outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1356389012471885">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012471885">Holland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012471885">COHRE, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389012471885">Newman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356389012471885">Raboy, 1978</xref>).</p>

<p>Glasgow has just completed a major road-building programme (including the M74 motorway and the East End Regeneration Route). A small area at the new Games village is planned on the basis of being car-free during the Games. This potential positive legacy requires to be embedded into the future plans for this urban village if host population impacts are to be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010a</xref>). The Games’ village being built to house the athletes during the event is planned to be converted into a mix of social and private housing at the conclusion of the event, the proportion of social housing having increased recently as a result of the recession-induced drop in private sector house prices, but at the time of writing the design is not yet clear. The bid document and the Government plans suggest that the new housing will be of a high environmental standard and will incorporate many of the ‘healthy urban design’ principles. Concerns have been raised that a housing demolition programme adjacent to the Games village is directly associated with the Games. Furthermore, if there is a high proportion of the new homes sold privately, it would suggest that gentrification is more likely than benefits for the existing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012471885">Gray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012471885">Dowding, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012471885">Glasgow City Council, 2009b</xref>). Other than the Games village, there is little or no regeneration planned as part of the 2014 Games that was not already planned before Glasgow won the right to play host.</p>

<title>Critical pathway 6: Legacy programmes</title>
<p>For legacy programmes to be an important mechanism for generating positive benefits, either the programmes or policies need to be effective in their own right, or they must be effective in the context of a Games host city. The Weed review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356389012471885">Weed et al., 2009</xref>) suggests that there is a small possibility of generating an improvement in physical activity through legacy programmes, with several important caveats (see critical pathway 2). The evidence for cultural or arts programmes is suggestive of some net positive impacts, but is largely limited to qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012471885">Garcia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012471885">Langen and Garcia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356389012471885">Ruiz, 2004</xref>). Critically, the reach of most legacy programmes is limited to those who actively engage with them. This means that the prospect of generating a whole population impact is likely to be limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1356389012471885">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the rhetoric from Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government, there is little or no evidence to support the idea that hosting the 2014 Games will generate positive impacts for the health or socioeconomic determinants of health of the host population. Furthermore, an analysis of the theories of change for the event suggests that the impacts in the ‘critical pathways’, common to almost all the proposed mechanisms, are unlikely.</p>
<sec id="section11-1356389012471885">
<title>Strengths and limitations of the analysis</title>
<p>This analysis is dependent on an accurate depiction of the theory of change. The theories were generated inclusively using Government and City council documentation, the academic literature, the perceptions of experts and the views of the local community. Although not an infallible process, it is difficult to see how further theories could have been identified in advance of the event.</p>
<p>The evidence base from previous events is of low quality and covers a narrow range of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>). Furthermore, the context of the City of Glasgow is very different to that of previous cities (although the focus on a deprived area of the City is common in the recent era of major sports event planning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012471885">McCartney, 2010</xref>). This means that there is an absence of evidence for many mechanisms and there are questions about how generalizable the available evidence is to the 2014 Games. However, the most important critical pathways discussed here are those for which the evidence base is stronger (e.g. the economic critical pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>) and a combination of existing evidence with the theories of change allows for informed comment on the likelihood of impacts arising. There is also an assumption that the 2014 Games will be essentially the same as previous events (i.e. that there is intervention fidelity). Although there will clearly be some differences between events, they share the same critical steps that allows the transfer of knowledge from one event to another. There is most scope for change where there are ‘project effects’ (i.e. sub-interventions that could occur independently of the event). However, for there to be a true Games impact, the outcomes from these project effects need to be greater than the opportunity costs and catalyzed in some way by the Games.</p>
<p>The critical pathways analysis assumes that emergent impacts will not arise from the Games through small changes in features not included in these pathways. A longer discussion of this possibility is published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012471885">McCartney, 2010</xref>), but such effects are unlikely given that the nature of the possible changes are not dissimilar to the pattern of regeneration activities already prevalent within Glasgow. However, the recent economic crisis in Greece followed a debt-fuelled public investment in sports infrastructure for the Athens Olympic Games. Although no causal association has been demonstrated, it is possible that playing host to the Games made an important contribution to the economic woes currently being experienced in Greece.</p>

<title>Implications for evaluation of the 2014 Games</title>
<p>It is possible to create a framework for evaluating the Games that builds on the theories of change developed by the Scottish Government and the HIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389012471885">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012471885">Glasgow City Council, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010a</xref>). The ability to attribute effects to the intervention is limited because the Games cannot be randomized, staggered or repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012471885">Craig et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012471885">2008b</xref>). Indeed, some have argued that, instead of aiming to know the overall impact, it might be more important to know <italic>why</italic> effects arise from complex interventions (to enhance the generalizability of any learning), for whom and in what contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012471885">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). However, some simple principles should allow for a reasonably robust and comprehensive evaluation of the overall impact to be ascertained.</p>
<p>The impacts of the legacy programmes, or project effects (those aspects that are not integral to the event and could occur independently), are the simplest to evaluate since they are amenable to a ‘theories of change’ approach as the underlying logic is usually relatively linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389012471885">Mackenzie and Blamey, 2005</xref>). Although it is possible to randomize these aspects of the event, there is no indication that this is being considered. In the absence of randomization, the best quality evidence for project effects would be obtained from a cohort study (with a process and qualitative evaluation built into the design) if a pre-intervention sample frame (and sufficient funding) was available. Most of these project effects are, however, unlikely to fit this mould (e.g. ‘come-and-try’ sports events) and instead involve a small proportion of a large population. Thus, the most suitable design is likely to be a retrospective cohort study where a sample of individuals exposed to the intervention can be compared with others that have not been (with recall bias minimized by keeping records of who engaged with the projects).</p>
<p>Direct impacts (those impacts arising from the aspects of the event intrinsic to playing host, such as tourism and the construction of sports infrastructure) require a different approach because of their complexity and distant relationship between the intervention and the outcome of interest. A recent systematic review highlighted that the quality of previous research on direct impacts was poor, but that some simple methodological improvements could make a difference (using routinely collected survey and administrative data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012471885">McCartney et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1356389012471885">Wellings et al., 2011</xref>). These included:</p>
<list id="list1-1356389012471885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>longitudinal studies of groups of individuals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>contemporaneous comparison groups of individuals who are not exposed to the intervention (although this may be particularly difficult for some direct impacts such as ‘national pride’);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of a theory of change to identify intermediate measures in the mechanisms of impact;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an appropriate time frame for the study;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>accounting for opportunity costs;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of actual, rather than estimated, data;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>measurement of outcomes over a longer time frame.</p></list-item></list>
<p>There are two additional aspects to the evaluation of the direct impacts. First, an evaluation of the overall economic impact requires an additional methodological approach using retrospective routine data. Input-output (IO) studies do not account sufficiently for the complexity of the economy and the computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is vulnerable to the narrative fallacy (i.e. the model is based on assumptions of how the economy will react based on past experience) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012471885">McCartney, 2010</xref>). A regression analysis comparing the Glasgow economy with others has less danger of creating spurious results but may only detect a large economic impact from the event. It is probably the most valid methodology but may not fulfil the requirements of the organizing committee to precisely evaluate the net economic impact. Second, previous event evaluations of major sports events evaluated only a limited number of outcome measures for the possible range of direct impacts. Using a theory of change and the HIA the full range of important and likely impacts can be identified in advance and allow appropriate evaluation to be designed.</p>
<p>Catalytic impacts (those said to arise from existing resources without any other change than host status)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012471885">2</xref></sup> are difficult to evaluate because it is not clear who or what is exposed and it is difficult to delineate exactly what the expected impacts might be or when they may occur. However, if elements of a realist approach are adopted, including a constant dialogue with those involved in the intervention and continuous qualitative study to help explain the direct and project mechanisms at play are likely to identify any catalytic impacts that arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012471885">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>). This can then be used as a springboard for further quantitative study based on the newly identified theories to capture the extent to which any such impact is realized.</p>

<title>Are the Games a health improvement intervention?</title>
<p>To consider whether hosting the Commonwealth Games represents a health improvement intervention, there is benefit in using or reflecting on the ‘wicked issue’ formulation that has been used by public health academics as a means of describing the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the potential policy solutions to some of the most difficult public health problems. It is implicitly argued that it has allowed academics the space and confidence to discuss policy matters that would otherwise be ‘out of bounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389012471885">Hunter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389012471885">Petticrew et al., 2009</xref>). If this is true, then it is a welcome advance. However, it may also be that the wicked issue formulation is being used as a way to package some of the most important public health problems as being apolitical and non-ideological for the consumption of policymakers. This has very important implications if it were to prevent academics from questioning the very fundamental causes that generate such problems (albeit through a plethora of mechanisms in a complex system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012471885">Link and Phelan, 2002</xref>). Many of the critical pathways identified for the impacts of the 2014 Games adhere to a particular ideological approach to how health and social problems should be addressed. There is also a strong public discourse that questions the whole philosophy of bidding for major sports events, although this debate is not yet prevalent in Glasgow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012471885">Eisinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012471885">Murphy and Bauman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389012471885">Preuss, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356389012471885">Prickett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>On balance, the ‘wicked solution’ that is the Commonwealth Games is unlikely to generate net health or socio-economic benefits beyond its opportunity costs, with the possible exceptions of improving citizens’ pride and identity in their city. There is also a real danger of unintended consequences of increased inequalities, increased consumerism, gentrification and public sector cutbacks.</p>
<p>It therefore does not seem appropriate to attempt to justify hosting the Games as anything other than a celebration of athleticism and entertainment (i.e. a circus). It is not appropriate, however, to justify the resources invested in the event in terms of wider social benefit (i.e. ‘bread’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012471885">Murphy and Bauman, 2007</xref>), particularly when the event may draw resources and focus away from activities more likely to address the fundamental causes of Glasgow’s higher mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012471885">Link and Phelan, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results. (attributed to Albert Einstein)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The cost of hosting major sporting events such as the Olympic and Commonwealth Games has increased over the last three decades to the extent that it has become difficult to justify the expenditure on the basis of entertainment or national showcasing alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389012471885">Preuss, 2004</xref>). There is no evidence from previous events that supports there being large or important positive impacts for host populations. Furthermore, the theory for positive impacts depends on a small number of ‘critical pathways’. These pathways have little or no evidence to support their impact, and are similar to many of the previous health and social interventions that have been tried in Glasgow. There is also a real danger of unintended consequences of increased inequalities, increased consumerism, gentrification and public sector cutbacks. The intervention is in-keeping with the current dominant neo-liberal ideologicy.</p>
<p>Given that the Games will be coming to Glasgow in 2014, and that the decision to bid and award the event has been taken, it is reasonable to attempt to maximize the benefits and mitigate the negative impacts that are likely to arise from the event. The health impact assessment has made over 150 recommendations to attempt to influence policy-makers to this effect. The Games has a better chance of generating positive benefits if the legacy planning process adopts these recommendations.</p>
<p>If the actual impact of the Games is to be identified, there will need to be a carefully planned package of studies including: a prospective cohort study or retrospective cohort study for the project effects; a cohort study and ecological study for the direct impacts; an economic model; and a series of qualitative studies to understand why various outcomes are observed and to allow planning of quantitative studies of any catalytic impacts.</p>
<p>A common saying is: ‘If you do what you always did you will get what you always got’. So it is with the 2014 Games. Those responsible for the event should take heed of the recommendations make in the HIA report as a route to minimizing the negative impacts of the Games and maximizing any positive impacts. Future event organizers in cities around the world should consider major multi-sport events as a risky investment if health or socio-economic legacy benefits are the main justification for playing host.</p>
