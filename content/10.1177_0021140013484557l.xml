<p>Catholic catechisms can sometimes be regarded as among the humblest of publications, being designed, as many of them were, to impart the most basic of Christian essentials to individuals who would otherwise be barred from sacramental participation owing to their languishing in a kind of doctrinal desert. And yet, as Karen Carter successfully reminds us, knowledge of the role of these publications themselves is absolutely essential if we are to understand why Catholicism continued to thrive in the post-Reformation period in so many jurisdictions. Her monograph, treating of the role of children’s catechisms in early modern France, begins with the question of why Catholic peasants, for instance, continued to attend Mass on Sundays and have their children baptized in the period after the religious wars and, indeed, right up to the eve of the French Revolution. For Carter, this is not simply a result of the great shake-up of Confessionalization from the top down, but more fundamentally, owes a great deal to children’s religious education in the 17th and 18th centuries, a process which involved the compilation and use of humble (and sometimes not so humble!) catechisms, which become the heretofore largely underestimated centrepiece of the movement of Catholic Reform. This process worked at a local level, the bishop’s educational strategy being delivered and adapted to local needs by curés, parents, and village teachers.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. Part I (consisting of chapters one and two) broadly examines the place of catechisms in the work of Catholic Reform and the catechetical method itself. Part II (consisting of chapters three through six) re-focuses the lens to examine in greater detail the business of primary education in three regions: Auxerre, Châlons-sur-Marne, and Reims, dealing in turn with the Curé and the Catechism (chapter three), the village schoolmaster (chapter four), the growth of the <italic>petits écoles</italic> (chapter five) and the role of the <italic>petits écoles</italic> in the Catholic Reformation (chapter six).</p>
<p>Carter points out that in an age which has become inextricably linked in the minds of historians with the process of dechristianization in France (the 18th-century Enlightenment coupled with the Scientific Revolution), paradoxically, the use of the catechism to inculcate religious doctrine was never more regularly or more systematically employed. Of course this is not so surprising when one approaches the so-called ‘Enlightenment’ from the bottom up rather than from the top down. Studies such as Carter’s are important reminders that for most people in most places in Enlightenment Europe, life continued in much the same way as it always had done.</p>
<p>Early modern catechisms for children tended to prioritize orthopraxis over orthodoxy, i.e. they were far more interested in influencing behaviour than in ensuring that they imparted large chunks of religious knowledge. In fact, in the minds of many prelates too much doctrine could, indeed, be a dangerous thing for peasants. This had been a concern especially in the Reformation period when poorly educated Catholics were warned against entering into disputes with their more theologically primed Protestant interlocutors. What was most urgently required was for children to know enough to fulfil their sacramental obligations. In one place, Carter uses the example of the doctrine of the Trinity to illustrate her point. While the theology of the Trinity (<italic>orthodoxy</italic>) was glided over in most catechisms for children, it was nevertheless crucial that children properly learn the manner in which to express this doctrine through the ritual of the Sign of the Cross (<italic>orthopraxis</italic>). Likewise, it was considered far more important that children learn the correct dispositions for partaking in the Eucharist than grasp in any comprehensive sense the theology behind the sacrament. Here again, properly <italic>doing</italic> precedes the act of properly <italic>believing</italic>, and copper-fastens the dictum that <italic>lex orandi</italic> leads to <italic>lex credendi</italic> and not the other way round. For Bishop Bossuet of Meaux, outward behaviour was, in fact, a sign of inward belief. The heavy emphasis on memorization was also significant. The cultivation of a good memory was understood as indicative of the moral character of an individual; thus the instruction of children in catechetical material, which was expected to be learnt by heart, was thought to mould and form the behaviour of children and would, indeed, function as a very effective mode of social discipline during the period.</p>
<p>While Carter’s text for the most part reads well, there are some stylistic lapses and occasionally poorly expressed sentences; for instance, one would have liked to see some more precise wording to describe ‘the prayers and recitations used in the Mass’ (p. 35). There is also the curious use of the modifier ‘only’ in Carter’s explanation that ‘God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit were three distinct beings yet <italic>only</italic> one God’ (my emphasis). The most egregious of these, however, must be the sentence which runs ‘No child could truly understand that three separate <italic>people</italic> made up <italic>only</italic> one God’ (my emphases) (p. 46). One wonders also whether Carter intended the pun in the line ‘Even catechisms devoted solely to confession and communion tended to give the doctrine of the Eucharist short shrift’! (p. 49).</p>
<p>These observations aside, Carter’s study is to be warmly welcomed as an important contribution to the history of early modern French Catholicism but, also more widely, to the study of 17th- and 18th-century catechisms in general and should inspire similar works for other geographical areas.</p>
