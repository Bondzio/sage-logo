<p>I have never forgotten the taxi driver’s comment as he drove me to the airport from the International Baccalaureate (IB) office in Cardiff. ‘I see a lot of you Interbac (sic) people and do you know what?’ I waited with some trepidation to find out what … ‘You’re always so cheerful! My daughter’s teachers are a miserable lot, so why are you so different?’</p>
<p>This book goes quite a long way towards answering that question. It is an account of a style of learning that is derived from a clear set of values; an international education that has changed many peoples’ lives. Here we have a collection of stories recounted by grateful students, teachers, parents and graduates describing what the IB has meant to them. But before we probe more deeply, let us ask if that cab driver had a question worth taking seriously. Does it really matter if teachers are a cheerful or a miserable lot, so long as they are doing their job? After all, most governments do not seem to care very much whether their teachers are happy.</p>
<p>At a superficial level, life at school is clearly more agreeable, and the task of learning more effective, when carried out with a smile, but I think we are looking for something rather deeper than that. We are looking for the motivation, participation and self-criticism that add up to a professional commitment that earns the public’s trust, something that is under threat in many state systems of education, which depend too heavily on monitoring, measuring and minding. The IB owes allegiance to no government; its teachers, students and parents are out there on their own, and during the past 40-plus years they have designed a system that has grown with remarkable success from its early niche position to become a mainstream global influence.</p>
<p><italic>Journeys</italic> is a celebration of that success: an anthology of 75 quite brief contributions, grouped into 11 chapters, describing what the IB has meant to its different stakeholders. The message is unashamedly up-beat. These are stories of achievement, so do not expect to hear from the boy who failed his IB diploma, or the girl who wasted her time on a poorly supervised personal project, or the head teacher who can no longer find funds from a tightening budget to meet the IB’s substantial fees. No: here we have the IB at its most bushy-tailed and many of the stories are powerfully moving. Take Jessica Kahkoska, for example, who is 11 years old in Colorado Springs and asks how American students should apply the IB learner profile to the events of 9/11; or Marie-Claude Lauzon who left Québec with her 15-year-old daughter to teach in Cairo to find that ‘our disorientation is complete’; or Frida Widjaya who ‘never dreamed of travelling outside Surabaya’ but now represents the Asia Pacific region at meetings in Europe; or Leah Kelley, now a surgeon, who moved from Dallas to Paris at the age of 15 and realized ‘I was “swimming” in something I couldn’t quite see or feel. As I got deeper into the DP curriculum the following year I realized what it was: culture.’ My favourite comes from Diego Luna-Victoria in Peru who writes about the tension between an IB student’s social and academic lives: ‘It may not sound like much, but being able to forget about that huge report that is due in two weeks while you play your weekly tennis match with your friend is a rare and an incredibly valuable gift.’ My disappointment is the small number of contributions from parents of IB students – the real heroes in my view – and most of those included are from teacher-parents, hardly a representative sample.</p>
<p>But is this book more than a collection of personal testimonies? Clearly the editors think so because they have used a series of ‘strategy’ windows to sum up the lessons learned, but I find these unconvincing in their simplicity; for example ‘In crisis situations, maintain communication with all members of the school community, scoping out their needs and ways to help.’ (I also find them hard to read: is it only my ageing eyes that find white text on a grey background difficult to decipher?) No: I think we need to look into the contributions themselves to identify some unifying concepts and two, in particular, jump out at me. The first is the way the IB learner profile has slowly seeped into the fabric of the organization. Since its introduction in 2006, it has become much more than just a checklist, more like a framework for building the ten qualities that describe the IB learner – both student and teacher. It is currently under review after a widespread process of consultation.</p>
<p>The second feature is the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) course, best summed up in a contribution from Tina Thuermer, a teacher at Washington International School, which is ironically entitled ‘TOK has ruined my life’ – the words of one of her students who returned from college complaining that he could ‘no longer hear anything, see anything, watch anything or talk about anything without blurting out that old TOK maxim, “How do you know?”… he worries about sources, justification, reliability and all such words that haunt the dreams of TOK teachers everywhere.’</p>
<p>The worldwide growth of the IB has been remarkable, especially in recent economically challenging times, but even so 3500 authorized schools is a drop in the global education ocean. Can we find any clues here about other ways of spreading the IB’s influence? Arguably the most challenging chapter is entitled ‘Crossing frontiers to learn and serve’. Here we have examples from around the world of how service can go far beyond ‘doing good’ and become the medium for social action. ‘As a teacher,’ writes Lauren Hildebrand in Minnesota, ‘I feel I am part of a profoundly moral activity. I teach as a form of service; service is the rent I pay for living.’</p>
<p>And Peter Kenny, who led the Schools to Schools initiative after the devastating tsunami of 2004, writes ‘What inspires me is that the journey of many people in 2004–5 has continued, even though it is not part of the IB anymore.’ Indeed there are several examples in this book of projects that are ‘not part of the IB anymore’ where the IB took the initiative, pointed the way, provided a resource and became a temporary partner. This, surely, is one important way ahead.</p>
<p>Let me give an IB graduate the last word. Lorena Sander-Gonzalez, a Mexican lawyer, remembers how ‘As an IB student, I learned the value of camaraderie. There was a silent pact among teachers and students: to give and receive; to expect and strive; to pressure and react; to discover for ourselves what we loved and what we were good at. There was a palpable excitement that manifested itself in all sorts of weird ways: inside jokes, formidably creative approaches to stress management, and the understanding that we were all in this together…’</p>
<p>No wonder it still puts a smile on all those Interbac faces.</p>
