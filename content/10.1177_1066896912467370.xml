<p><italic>Background</italic>. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether breast carcinoma biomarkers vary among separate tumor foci of multifocal/multicentric (MF/MC) breast carcinomas and whether this variation correlates with morphological features and tumor grade. <italic>Design</italic>. We reviewed the biomarker profiles of MF/MC invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed between January 2001 and June 2010 at our institution. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal receptor protein (HER2) results were classified as positive or negative. <italic>Results</italic>. Out of the 51 patients included in the study, 6 cases had 2 tumor foci with different morphologies, 7 cases had 2 foci with similar morphology but different grades, and 38 cases had 2 tumor foci with similar morphologies and grades. Out of the 38 patients who had MF/MC tumors with the same morphology and grade, only 1 patient had a difference in ER and PR status between foci. Out of the 7 patients who had morphologically similar tumors with different grades, 4 had similar results in both tumor foci, 3 had different results for ER and PR, and another had differing results for HER2 between the foci. All 6 patients who had MF/MC foci with different morphologies exhibited similar ER, PR, and HER2 results between the foci. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Regardless of the similarity in tumor morphology or grade, a small number of cases included foci that exhibited different tumor marker expression, which might affect the treatment strategy. Therefore, our results suggest that the evaluation of tumor markers in different foci should be considered in MF/MC tumors for accurate treatment strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Approximately one-third of breast carcinomas are associated with multiple synchronous tumors, which are referred to as <italic>multifocal</italic> (MC), if they reside in the same part of the breast, or <italic>multicentric</italic> (MC), if they are found in separate parts of the breast. Despite this effort for classification, the definition of MF/MC breast carcinomas remains controversial. Currently, it is not clear whether these tumors represent separate tumors with different genetic features and prognoses, multiple foci of a single tumor because of seeding through ducts and the lymphatic system, or a mixture of both. There is also an ongoing debate regarding the staging, treatment and prognosis of MF/MC breast carcinomas. Furthermore, the relevance of multifocality versus multicentricity or monoclonality versus polyclonality to prognosis and treatment is still unclear.</p>
<p>Despite the controversies surrounding MF/MC breast carcinomas, breast cancer in general is one of the best examples of a cancer where antibody-defined tumor markers are used as both prognostic and predictive factors. For example, estrogen receptor (ER) expression is a positive prognostic marker of outcome and a strong predictive marker of response to hormone-based therapies such as tamoxifen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912467370">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912467370">2</xref></sup> Similarly, progesterone receptor (PR) expression is correlated with better prognosis and higher response to hormone-based treatments as well as an increase in the predictive power of ER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912467370">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912467370"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912467370">5</xref></sup> Another important test in the evaluation of breast cancer is the human epidermal receptor protein-2 (HER2 or c-erbB-2), which is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification have been shown to be poor prognostic factors in breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912467370">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912467370">7</xref></sup> HER2 status is also predictive for sensitivity to anthracycline-based chemotherapies and relative resistance to cytoxan- and tamoxifen-based chemotherapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912467370">8</xref></sup> Moreover, the determination of HER2 status is essential for therapeutic decisions regarding the use of agents targeting the HER2 receptor such as trastuzumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912467370">9</xref></sup> As a result, the current standard of care for breast cancer includes the assessment of ER, PR, and HER2 status.</p>
<p>Because the ER, PR, and HER2 markers have prognostic and predictive value for breast cancer, it is of utmost importance to determine how they can be informative for the prognosis and treatment of MF/MC breast carcinomas. In fact, during pathological evaluation of the MF/MC breast carcinomas, hormone receptor expression and HER2 status can be analyzed either in 1 focus or in all the tumor foci. Currently, we do not have enough data in the literature to justify or reject the utility of analyzing these biomarkers in multiple foci. In addition, some contradicting studies have suggested differing conclusions regarding the receptor status of foci. For example, one study reported variable immunohistochemical profiles of 2 tumor foci in some cases, despite the similar morphology of the tumor foci, whereas another study reported identical ER, PR, and HER2 results in different tumor foci for all their cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912467370">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912467370">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the receptor status of different tumor foci and to determine whether there is any variation within each patient sample. We also looked at whether other histological features, such as tumor type, nuclear grade, and Ki-67 proliferation index vary between 2 foci of tumors with different receptor status.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>After Loyola University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approval, we conducted a pathology database search for patients with MF/MC invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed at Loyola University Medical Center between January 2001 and June 2010. MF/MC breast carcinoma was defined as the presence of more than 1 distinct invasive tumor identified by the clinician, radiological imaging, or the pathologist. Only cases that had biomarker analysis performed on more than 1 focus were included in the study. Cases with neoadjuvant treatment were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Data regarding the tumor type and morphology, size, Nottingham grade, Ki-67 proliferation index, and ER, PR, and HER2 status were retrospectively collected. Lobular carcinoma diagnoses were verified with a negative staining with e-cadherin. Results of ER, PR, and HER2 immunohistochemical stains were interpreted as positive, negative, or equivocal according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists guideline recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912467370">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912467370">13</xref></sup> HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results were provided as negative, positive, or equivocal by an outside lab in concordance with the above guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912467370">12</xref></sup> All Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides were re-reviewed by a single pathologist (CE) in a blinded fashion, and results were reported according to percentage of cells positive for Ki-67 as low (&lt;10%), moderate (10%-20%), and high (&gt;20%). In cases where more than 2 foci were evaluated, the largest 2 were included in the analysis.</p>
<p>IHC analyses were performed on the Benchmark XT staining module (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Paraffin sections were cut at 5 µm and placed on positively charged slides. Slides were incubated at 70°C for 2 hours for ER and PR and air dried at ambient temperature overnight for HER2. CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1, 1 µg/mL) and anti-PR (1E2, 1 µg/mL) and PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5, 6 µg/mL) rabbit monoclonal antibodies, VENTANA anti-E-cadherin (36, 0.314 µg/mL) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Ventana Medical Systems), and Invitrogen anti-Ki-67 (7B11, 30.8 µg/mL, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) mouse monoclonal antibody were used as primary antibodies. Deparaffinization, epitope retrieval via cell conditioning (CC1, Ventana) for 90 minutes, antibody incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes, and counterstaining with hematoxylin were performed according to the automated slide stainer protocol. Unstained slides were sent to an outside laboratory (Genzyme Genetics, Esoterix Genetic Laboratories, Orange County, CA) for detection of HER2 gene amplification by FISH.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS statistics software (v 19.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Fisher’s exact test was used when comparing frequencies between groups. Descriptive data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. <italic>P</italic> values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 159 cases with MF/MC invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed between January 2001 and December 2010, 51 cases fit the inclusion criteria of the study. 32 patients (62.7%) had undergone mastectomy and 19 patients (37.3%), lumpectomy. The mean age at the time of surgery was 59.8 ± 14.4 years. It was found that 43 patients (84.3%) had 2 tumor foci, 7 patients (13.7%) had 3, and 1 patient (2%) had 4. The average sizes of the first and second largest foci were 20.5 ± 12.4 and 11.2 ± 7.9 mm, respectively. Also, 17 cases (33.3%) had evidence of lymphovascular invasion.</p>
<p>There were 6 patients (11.8%) with 1 focus of ductal and 1 focus of lobular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896912467370">Table 1</xref>). All 6 of these patients had the same grade and similar ER, PR, and HER2 results in both foci. The remaining 45 patients had the same histological type of tumor in both foci, including 39 ductal, 5 lobular, and 1 micropapillary carcinoma.</p>

<p>Of these 45 patients, 7 (13.7%) had invasive ductal carcinomas with foci of different Nottingham grades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896912467370">Table 2</xref>). Despite the difference in the Nottingham grades, the foci of 3 patients had similar ER, PR, and HER2 status. Three patients had ER and PR expression in the lower-grade focus, yet no expression in the higher-grade one. Another patient had ER- and PR-positive foci; however, the lower-grade focus was negative for HER2, whereas the higher-grade focus was equivocal for HER2 status by both IHC and FISH analysis.</p>

<p>In summary, a total of 4 out of 51 patients (7.8%) exhibited different ER and PR statuses in the 2 foci. There was only 1 patient out of 50 (2%) who had variable HER2 overexpression status between the 2 tumor foci. Among the 45 patients with the same histological tumor types in both foci, 37 had the same grade and hormone receptor status, 1 had the same grade with different hormone receptor statuses, 4 had different grades but the same hormone receptor status, and 3 had different grades and hormone receptor statuses (<italic>P</italic> = .009).</p>
<p>Ki-67 results exhibited more heterogeneity between the 2 tumor foci. Overall, 49 out of 51 patients in the study had Ki-67 data for more than 1 focus, and 11 patients (22.4%.) had variable proliferation index results. There was 1 patient with a focus of grade-2 ductal carcinoma with a moderate proliferation rate, and the other focus of grade-2 lobular carcinoma had a low proliferation rate. Out of 7 patients who had 2 foci of invasive ductal carcinoma with different Nottingham grades, 5 (71.4%) showed different proliferation indexes. As expected, in all cases, the tumor focus with a higher grade had a higher proliferation index than the tumor focus with a lower grade. Of the 36 patients with uniform tumor morphology and grade, 5 (14.9%) showed variation in Ki-67 proliferation index between the foci.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The presence of multiple synchronous tumors in a breast is not uncommon, with an incidence rate of 4% to 49%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912467370">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912467370"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912467370">16</xref></sup> This variation can be explained by both the controversies in defining these tumors and the changes in imaging modalities over time. The distinction between MF and MC tumors has been typically based on the anatomical quadrant of the breast. Multicentric breast carcinoma, as defined by Fisher et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912467370">14</xref></sup> represents a clinically or mammographically separate tumor focus in a quadrant different from that of the index tumor. On the other hand, multiple tumors in the same quadrant were described as MF. Multicentricity was also defined by the presence of a certain amount of uninvolved breast tissue between the tumor foci.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912467370">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912467370">18</xref></sup> However, for many practitioners, both definitions have their flaws, and distinguishing between these 2 types of carcinoma is impractical. As a result, in our study, we did not attempt to differentiate MF and MC tumors and instead grouped them together as MF and/or MC. We defined MF/MC tumors based on the clear description of multifocality by a clinician, radiologist, and/or a pathologist and did not use strict criteria of quadrant or distance between tumor foci.</p>
<p>A critical, yet challenging, task is to evaluate the clonality of MF/MC carcinomas. Multiple tumor foci may represent synchronous yet separate tumors, a single tumor seeded through ducts and lymphatics, or both. Several studies have evaluated the genetic makeup of these tumors and reported that the majority of the ipsilateral multiple tumors represent intramammary spread of a single tumor rather than separate tumors from unrelated clones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912467370">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912467370"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912467370">21</xref></sup> Another study reported 10% to 25% polyclonality within an individual patient among the MC breast cancer foci using TP53 mutation, which is an early marker of malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912467370">22</xref></sup> However, the majority of these studies did not report the morphological features of the tumors. Despite continuing efforts to classify these tumors, the role of the genetic features being explored in the therapeutic management or prognosis of a given patient remains unclear.</p>
<p>Some investigators have investigated the clonality of MF/MC breast carcinomas by using immunohistochemical analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912467370">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912467370">11</xref></sup> Dawson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912467370">10</xref></sup> reported that 5 out of 15 cases with identical histology showed variable IHC results in 2 foci. In addition, IHC results showed a difference between 2 foci in 7 out of 9 cases with different tumor types or grades. However, in the same study, only 1 out of 15 cases with identical histology and 1 out of 9 cases with different tumor types or grades showed difference in SP-1 expression. Middleton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912467370">11</xref></sup> evaluated the ER, PR, and HER2 status in 2 separate tumor foci in 32 MC breast carcinomas and reported identical IHC results in both foci for all cases. They concluded that phenotypic similarities support the clonal proliferation of a single-tumor hypothesis. In addition, they advocated the performance of immunohistochemical studies on a single focus in MF/MC carcinomas. A more recent study analyzed 65 MF/MC invasive ductal carcinomas and reported heterogeneous ER, PR, and HER2 status in 3%, 11%, and 6% of the cases, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912467370">23</xref></sup> All heterogeneous cases had variable histological features or a heterogeneous in situ component. They concluded that if MF/MC tumors are of high grade, have different histological features, or exhibit different overexpression/amplification patterns by FISH, the biomarkers of multiple foci should be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that 4 out of 7 cases with the same histological type but variable tumor grade in multiple foci showed variable ER, PR, or HER2 results in different foci. In addition, the presence or absence of ER and PR expression was correlated with tumor grade. Therefore, variable tumor grades among multiple tumor foci should prompt the pathologist to evaluate hormone receptor and HER2 status in more than 1 focus. The frequency of hormone receptor expression varies between different tumor subtypes and grades. Although not exclusive, well-differentiated tumors with lower grades are more likely to be positive for hormone receptor expression than poorly differentiated tumors with higher grades. It is still unclear whether these 2 classes of tumors represent 2 separate de novo tumors or dedifferentiation of a single, low-grade tumor.</p>
<p>Unlike prior studies, we also reported a case with similar tumor morphology and grade but variable ER and PR status in 2 foci. This patient also had a third tumor in the contralateral breast with different ER, PR, and HER2 expressions compared with these 2 foci. As a result, this patient might represent a true example for multiple de novo tumors with different tumor-marker expression. The possibility of having a false-negative result in one of the foci was also considered; however, the same results were confirmed with new staining experiments. Tumor heterogeneity may be considered as a possibility to explain the variation within multiple foci in tumors with otherwise identical morphological features. However, the strong expression of ER and PR in an entire focus and their complete absence in the other cannot be explained by mere heterogeneity of expression.</p>
<p>The variation we observed in Ki-67 levels of tumors with different Nottingham grades was expected because Nottingham grade includes frequency of mitotic figures. The variation of the Ki-67 results in tumors with the same morphology and grade might indicate a heterogeneous distribution for the proliferating cells. Other parameters that we examined were classified as positive or negative; however, a 3-tier system was used for Ki-67 grading, which might account for the classification variability. Although the evaluation of Ki-67 status is not standard among pathologists, Ki-67 indexes reported in the same specimen by the same pathologist should be relatively error free and informative.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that failure to evaluate each tumor focus for biomarkers in patients with variable ER, PR, and/or HER2 results could lead to suboptimal treatment protocols for these patients. Missing ER or PR positive cells or a focus with HER2 overexpression can potentially cause failure to treat these patients with hormone-based chemotherapies, including tamoxifen and trastuzumab. Similarly, missing an ER- or PR-negative focus when a second focus is positive for ER and PR can potentially cause incomplete treatment of these patients because of failure to offer additional non–hormone-based chemotherapies. Variation in tumors at different foci also raises the possibility that their gene expression profiles may show some variability as well. We did not perform gene expression analyses in our study; however, future studies specifically analyzing this aspect of MF/MC invasive breast carcinomas would be helpful in the clinical decision-making process.</p>
<p>In summary, there was variability in hormone receptor expression and HER2 overexpression in 7.8% and 2% of the MF/MC invasive carcinomas, respectively. Most of the cases with variable ER, PR, and/or HER2 have heterogeneous morphology or grade in different foci. Therefore, our results suggest that heterogeneous tumor morphology and/or grade among multiple tumor foci warrants the analysis of hormone receptor and HER2 status in more than 1 focus. However, regardless of the morphological tumor similarity or grade, different foci may show different tumor marker expressions. Because these tumor markers are directly involved in tumor identity and progression, their differential expression in distinct foci might affect treatment strategy. Therefore, the evaluation of tumor markers in different foci should be considered in MF/MC tumors as a part of standard patient care.</p>
