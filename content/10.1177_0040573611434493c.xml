<p><italic>Faith, Hope and Poetry: Theology and the Poetic Imagination</italic></p>
<p>Malcomb Guite</p>
<p>Cambridge: Ashgate, 2011. 257 pp. $99.95</p>
<p>Malcomb Guite is a priest, poet, and scholar whose writings focus on the theological analysis of literature, its inspiration, composition, and performance. In <italic>Faith, Hope and Poetry</italic>, he demonstrates the power of the poetic imagination to catch hold of reality rather than evade it, to join apprehension to comprehension, and to bridge the gap between immanence and transcendence. For Guite, study of the poetic imagination inevitably leads to theological reflection, to grasping the multiple meanings embodied in finite works, and to understanding in fresh ways what Guite regards as the prime embodiment of all meaning in the Incarnation. Guite vividly asserts what others in a variety of fields also have asserted, namely, that the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment project, whether by intention from the outset or not, eventually reduced what can be known and rationally understood to material reality, observable, quantifiable, and technologically manipulable. This result, anticipated early on by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and labeled by him the “despotism of the eye,” among other unhappy outcomes often has led theology to move toward an ever-more vague, indeterminate liberalism, prone to never-ending reinvention of the faith, or toward a fundamentalism that regards Scripture as a scientific treatise, every word of which must be considered literally and <italic>only</italic> literally true.</p>
<p>In a most remarkable and compelling way, Guite pursues his thesis regarding the powers of the poetic imagination by engaging in what literary critics call a close reading of poetic texts. Guite’s close readings, brilliantly detailed and insightful, range from works in the Old English (Saxon) tongue through Shakespeare (excerpts from <italic>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</italic> and <italic>The Tempest</italic>). Guite then moves to Sir John Davies, a younger contemporary of Shakespeare. After that, he treats selected poems of John Donne and George Herbert, then John Milton and Henry Vaughan. An especially strong chapter on Coleridge, both his poetry and his philosophical writings on the poetic imagination (which reveal Coleridge’s move from Unitarian to Trinitarian faith), prepares the way for a treatment of twentieth-century figures Thomas Hardy, Phillip Larkin, and Geoffrey Hill. These poets’ verse reflects what Guite aptly calls “doubting faith” and “reticent hope.” Their poetic efforts, Guite convincingly shows, implicitly call into question their apparently committed philosophical agnosticism, or even atheism, and hint at a transcendence Hardy, Larkin, and Hill would either question or deny. As Guite himself put it in commenting upon Larkin’s poems, “Church-going” and “For Sidney Becket,” the “surface teaching of the philosopher is shaken by depth-charges dropped by the poet” (187).</p>
<p>The final chapter of <italic>Faith, Hope and Poetry</italic> is titled, “The Replenishing Fountain: Hope and Renewal in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney.” Here Guite returns to the place from which he started in his extended introduction. Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney’s poetry, as both gift and task, finds light piercing the darkness of failing vision (“Exposure”), the eternal spring gushing in the fall of dry seeds through a cactus (“The Rain Stick”), and that disgust and self-disgust redeem nothing until they are transfigured by repentance (“Station Island”). Just so, Guite makes it clear that fallen imagination, like fallen reason, can be rehabilitated by divine inspiration and can be made capable of apprehending transcendent truth in mundane events, actual or even fictional. In fact, poetic imagination, often beyond and contrary to the conscious intention of certain poets, can serve as an extraordinary means of grace. Therefore, creation once again can be read in Pauline terms as evidence of God’s “power and divine nature” (Rom 1:20), and Holy Scripture can be read as a divine <italic>poesis</italic> attesting all that life and truth, which coming into the world in Christ, “enlightens everyone” (John 1:9). At last even the meanest elements of nature and of human nature can be made to bear an unnatural and unmerited weight of glory.</p>
<p><italic>Faith, Hope and Poetry</italic> provides a treasury of insights for poets, and critics of poetry, for priests and preachers, for theologians and philosophers, including those studying the philosophy of science. Guite’s prose is poetic, luminously clear, and often deeply moving. This book deserves the widest audience that it can find.</p>
