<p>There is no such thing as a free market. Bernard E. Harcourt makes this point twice. First, he illustrates how those markets heralded as “free” are as heavily regulated as so-called disciplinary regimes. The term “free” is therefore misleading as it is used to protect some forms of regulation from a discussion of their distribution effects. Second, “free” markets have led the US to a curious amalgam between the freest of market domains and excessive incarcerations in the penal sphere, a tension Harcourt terms neoliberal penality. With the first point, Harcourt provokes some debate aimed at a core belief of western societies. While he may not be the first to make this observation, he does so showing considerable proficiency both in history and economics. Also, the timing for this book could not have been better, a short time after the global financial crisis. His second point leads into a compelling genealogy of the idea of natural order of markets from the early physiocrats via Adam Smith to the Chicago School. This genealogy is the true heart and soul of the argument. Ultimately, some methodological concerns, an excessive mass of detail and an, at times, strangely uneven narrative do not allow the book to live up to its potential. However, this does not stop it from being thought-provoking, timely and important.</p>
<p>In the lengthy introduction, Harcourt sets the scene by describing in considerable detail two very different arenas. First, he shows the detailed and minute regulation of the 18th-century Parisian grain and bread markets. Myriads of rules and regulations were used to make sure that the market price would be respected. We also learn that the markets and police were closely aligned concepts. In some of his late lectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612443465">Foucault (2009)</xref> had himself used the <italic>police des grains</italic> as an example for a nearly perfect disciplinary regime. In an ostensibly sharp contrast to historic France, Harcourt retells a story of a post-deadline sale of wheat at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1996. Again, a myriad of rules and regulations are employed. However, over the past two and a half centuries the rhetoric has changed and the CBOT is now widely considered as a prime example of a free market. Challenging this rhetoric, Harcourt points out that both instances were equally heavily regulated. Somehow the notion of free markets has obscured our view of markets as what they are: always in need of regulation. A market ordering itself is a myth. The problem with this myth is, according to Harcourt, that it prevents us from properly scrutinizing “how the administration of the markets actually distributes wealth”. Therefore, the first conundrum the book is trying to address is how this obscuring notion of free markets has been cemented in our contemporary societies. For Harcourt, “free” is a useless and misleading term and so is “discipline”, as it suggests markets in the <italic>ancien régime</italic> were so different from their contemporary pendants. In a short subsection on method this leads him to accuse Foucault of nominalism, something which I will pick up again at the end of this review. The second conundrum the book addresses is: how has the same genealogy that led to the dominance of the liberal free market idea also led the US to record numbers of incarcerations? How was direct governmental intervention driven out of the market and into the penal sphere? How was neoliberal penality spread? He uses this combination of free markets and mass incarceration to organize his genealogy of free markets.</p>
<p>In the first chapter Harcourt starts his genealogy by discussing Cesare Beccaria’s <italic>On Crimes and Punishment</italic> (1764) in some detail. He contrasts the readings of the text by the philosophes as a landmark of enlightenment, by Jeremy Bentham (and in spirit Gary Becker) as a very early rational choice theorist and by the early physiocrats as opposing truly free markets. Chapter 2 presents Harcourt’s own position, which is derived from a close reading of some of Beccaria’s “practically forgotten” other texts. In this reading, Beccaria advocates state intervention as “a form of enlightened despotism”. Order is, for Beccaria, not a natural effect of the market but the product of state regulation. Finally, Foucault is cited as offering a disciplinary reading of Beccaria, precisely because of the interventionist aspects of his work. So the question arises: how can Beccaria equally be heralded as an early advocate of liberal economics (free markets) and a disciplinarian (mass incarceration)?</p>
<p>Chapter 3 introduces an important aspect of Harcourt’s genealogy: the construction of the concept of natural order of markets. François Quesnay and Adam Smith are placed at the start of this part of the genealogy. Despite Smith’s criticism of Quesnay in <italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612443465">2007/1776</xref>), Harcourt shows how both men shared common experiences which bonded them and infused Smith with the physiocrat Quesnay’s ideas of natural order, who had in turn built his ideas on earlier scholastic philosophers. The next chapter discusses an aspect of Quesnay’s work which provides a first hint towards explaining neoliberal penality: Quesnay promoted a form of legal despotism in which the legal despot was necessary but should respect the natural order of the market and restrict her rule “to penal sanctions against those who deviate from the natural order”. Harcourt provides interesting evidence on what this theory meant in practice when he describes the physiocrat Mercier’s rule over Martinique, which was marked by excessive police intervention in order to ensure the natural order.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter is dedicated to Jeremy Bentham. As famously shown in Foucault’s <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612443465">1995/1975</xref>), Bentham was concerned with the penal sphere and questions of efficiency – an important combination for Harcourt’s argument. Bentham’s writings provide evidence of a strange alchemy of a cameralist reading of Beccaria and what we might today regard as a moderate reading of Smith’s <italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>. Bentham thus reproduced and diffused the physiocrats’ mix of natural order in the economic sphere and legal despotism in the penal realm. For Harcourt, Bentham’s rejection of naturalism is only rhetoric and his practices point directly towards an ideology of natural order.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 marks a distinct shift in the tone of the argument when the much more contemporary Chicago School is discussed. The focus of Harcourt’s analysis here rests on the wide-spread Coase theorem which suggests that a market is, given no transaction costs, the most efficient mode of allocation. Also, according to the theorem, government intervention is even in the case of considerable transaction costs not desirable, as it is nearly impossible to acquire the information necessary for sound decision-making. Harcourt reveals a natural order bias in this concept as it does not rely on empiricist individual case assessment of how high transaction costs actually are and then determining the mode of allocation, but advocates the market as more efficient <italic>tout court</italic>. Harcourt then continues his genealogy of the idea of natural order which he finds at subtle work in the Coase theorem, infused into Coase’s thinking via Bentham and von Hayek. This genealogy is associated with the evolution of a definition of crime which finds its most recent incarnation in Richard Posner’s work, who, tellingly, defines crime as concerning only those who bypass markets. In this view, rape is a problem only because it bypasses the market for sex. This firmly divides the good, natural and free market from the crime, which is the one sphere where intervention is still needed from the outside, effectively producing the combination of free markets and mass incarceration that Harcourt looks into.</p>
<p>Chapters 7 and 8 aim at deconstructing the terms “myth” and “freedom”. Here the author revisits the illustrations with which he started this book: the <italic>police des grains</italic> of the <italic>ancien régime</italic> (Chapter 7), which he shows was not put into much practice. He presents a large and detailed amount of historical evidence questioning the disciplinary power in the case. According to Harcourt, the market was de facto barely regulated. On the other hand, the genesis of the Chicago Board of Trade (Chapter 8) is portrayed as a story of politics and favoritism in which the rules of the game determine the winner. Harcourt thus challenges the notion of freedom and natural order in this institution.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter focuses on the downside of neoliberal penality in the form of mass incarceration. Again, a wealth of data is presented to provide observation of the explosion of size and cost of the US penal system. In the final chapter Harcourt pre-emptively addresses some criticisms of his argument. Most notably, he acknowledges that only the US penal system has risen in numbers, in contrast to western European countries. However, he sees the growing use of mental institutions in Europe at the same time as an equivalent which, if taken into account, put the US and the EU on the same development path.</p>
<p>Harcourt’s argument is diverse and important. He makes a compelling case against the ostensible freedom of markets. While others have made this point before (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612443465">MacKenzie, 2006</xref>) Bernard E. Harcourt combines this insight with a detailed genealogy with historic, philosophic and economic proficiency. His genealogy of the natural order which is supposed to underlie markets provides important insights into the curious combination of free markets and mass incarceration as well as their co-evolution. However, there are some drawbacks to his argument. At times, his narrative is somewhat oddly paced, as he provides an excessive amount of detail about certain aspects, which are no doubt interesting but make the book lengthy to read. The attention that the various aspects of his argument receive is varying, so, for example, if you expect a lot about the penal sphere – beyond statistics on its expansion in the US – you are likely to be disappointed. More importantly, however, questions regarding his methodology need to be raised. In order to avert nominalism, Harcourt discards terms such as “free” and “discipline” altogether, while at the same time adopting the vocabulary of economists (“distribution”, “wealth”) and Foucault, to whom he owes more than he is ready to acknowledge. And while he tries to avoid the term “free” he strongly suggests that markets are not as free as they seem. As we learnt from philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612443465">Adorno (2006/1966)</xref>, calling something not-something is not transgressing the term but sticking firmly to its system of thought. And, questioning Foucault’s analysis of discipline because the blueprints of disciplinary power were not put into practice in their totality is an empiricist’s argument. In all fairness, Harcourt seems to have a weak spot for them; however, it misses Foucault’s point a bit. Not many panopticons were actually built. Still Foucault’s analysis of panopticism is a landmark in social sciences. After all, Foucault’s last position in academia was a professorship in the “history of systems of thought”. So, perhaps, not completely discarding the terms “free” or “discipline” has some legitimacy after all. Then again, these issues cannot detract from the timeliness and importance of the argument made by Harcourt and one can only hope that organizational scholars will use this springboard to (re)engage with (not so) free markets and the penal sphere, both often strangely neglected fields of investigation in organization studies.</p>
