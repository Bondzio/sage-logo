<p>How should suffering, loss, and pain be understood? And I mean here not just personal pain, but societally and religiously inflicted pain, that pain and suffering that’s most within our control. Can the lives broken on the shores and smashed against the rocks of social sin be redeemed? In short, is a just society possible? Which is to ask (and here I allude to ole Jimmy—Jimmy Baldwin, that is), can injustice be checkmated?</p>
<p>Professor James H. Cone in his latest book <italic>The Cross and the Lynching</italic> takes up these questions at a double-scene of subjection, which by the time he’s done in this quite readable and well-paced work proves to be really one scene of subjection. This is the scene of the old rugged, Christian cross, or the doctrinal site of Jesus’ death, on the one hand, and the lynching tree, or at the numerous fields of blood that have marked the history of the United Stated with a crimson stain, on the other. If Professor Cone’s basic concern when he published <italic>Black Theology and Black Power</italic> a little over 40 years ago in the wake of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination was to diagnose the religious dimensions of the American sickness unto death that lead to King’s assassination and that has afflicted America’s soul since its inception, then with this book Professor Cone provides his latest statement on the contorted Christian imagination that produced America’s societal sickness. The problem lay with the Christian symbol of the cross of Jesus Christ. More specifically—and this is what Professor Cone in effect calls us to think about in this book—it is with the way social sacrifice has been ideologically deployed right next to, indeed right inside of, talk of a “Christian America,” rhetoric about “a city on a hill,” and language about “saving America,” language that closely echoes language about death in the Christian traditions, the death of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> is a book about what the Christian cross and lynching have had to do with each other in the making of American society. And at the same time, it is a book about how black folks in their diasporic wanderings in America (and I would argue by extension, their wanderings in the wilderness of the Americas and throughout the modern world) have, as it were, bent how we think about the Christian cross, despite its oppressive uses, in the direction of social justice and in the direction of hope for a just society.</p>
<p>As just mentioned, in examining the social uses to which the cross has been put in American society, Cone turns to the history of lynching in the United States, a history that despite all of the ways in which it echoes Jesus’ crucifixion has gone unexamined by America’s greatest theologians and clergypersons. Put differently, there has yet to be in the United States anyone like the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who after his encounter with black folks in the United States in the late 1920s and the early 1930s returned to Germany with new eyes to understand and interpret how Christianity was being oppressively used in the name of a “Nazi theology” and a “Nazi Christianity” and in order to justify a society purged of Jews and other undesirables. Bonhoeffer was given eyes to understand the German situation in significant part because of what he learned about lynching in the United States. America’s “greatest” theologians and churchmen—from Jonathan Edwards to D.L. Moody (key figures of American evangelicalism) to Walter Rauschensbusch and Reinhold Niebuhr (key figures of American liberalism and religious progressivism)—have not engaged the analogical and material connections between the cross and the lynching tree and other forms of social sacrifice. They have failed, committing theological malpractice. They have failed, Cone helps us understand, to think through the links between the cross on which Jesus was sacrificed by the Roman Empire, on the one hand, and the lynching trees, on the other, on which both told and untold numbers of blacks were sacrificed and in relationship to which others still (those not lynched) were confined to what Orlando Patterson has called “social death.” They failed to address the links between the cross and the lynching tree and how their connection worked in the interest of American (racial) governance and popular sovereignty. In chapters dealing with figures as wide-ranging as Richard Wright, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others, Cone chronicles this American, which at the same time is a Christian, failure, a failure that has legitimated designating some as citizen-saints or as subjects of life while designating others as improper citizens, the wretched of the earth or as bounded on all sides by death. In fact, the chapter dealing with Reinhold Niebuhr’s time at Union Theological Seminary New York (“‘The Terrible Beauty of the Cross’ and the Tragedy of the Lynching Tree: A Reflection on Reinhold Niebuhr”) is not only a meditation on the failure of Niebuhr, who was “America’s Theologian” in his day, to address theologically or ethically the carnage of black lynching in his day. It reads equally as a meditation on the failures of theological education today to come to terms with black and other crises of social death.</p>
<p>And yet, for the depth of its critique, it must nevertheless be stressed that <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> is in the end neither an anti-Christian nor defeatist nor tragic book. Indeed, against currents in African American theology today, it is a book that does not advocate abandoning the cross, given its oppressive uses. In other words, this is not a post-Christian text. As a work of constructive Christian theology, or what I would like to call a work of black Christian artistry, the art of Christian theology, it looks not only at the lynching tree: <italic>it looks through it.</italic> Better still, it invites a reading of the Christian cross in its ideological deployments against itself, indeed, as the enactment of an Afro-modern blues song. As such, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> invites a habitation of and habituation by the cross predicated upon a re-envisioning of it, an uncoupling of the cross as a sign of salvation from its “American incarnation,” to take a phrase from literary theorist Myra Jehlen, as the barbaric lynching tree and towards a different envisioning of incarnation or embodiment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573613485527c">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here it becomes clear that Cone’s approach to the cross is more in keeping with the style of womanist theology articulated, for example, in the work of theologian M. Shawn Copeland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573613485527c">19</xref></sup> In contrast to the work of earlier womanist theologians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573613485527c">20</xref></sup> Copeland argues that the cross, as a sign of hope, healing, and light in the face of suffering, is a hermeneutic or a lens of interpreting black suffering even as it also suggests ways of redirecting black diasporic wanderings in the wilderness of America and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573613485527c">21</xref></sup> And as it is with Copeland’s work and the work of similarly minded womanists, so it is with <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>. Here Cone resuscitates, to use the Pauline language, “the scandal of the cross,” as now nothing less than the scandal of the lynching tree (and related technologies of terror in their coupling with peoplehood) in modern America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573613485527c">22</xref></sup> Reinterpreted as scandal, indeed as an anti-disciplinary (in Foucault's sense) and ultimately therefore as that anarchic scandal, the scandal of a stateless mode of life (according to the epistle to the Hebrews, Jesus was crucified outside of the city), a mode of life that we might say is beyond or over the edge of both personal and political sovereignty, the cross now tethered to Jesus Christ functions against itself. That is, it functions against the grain of all histories (including even the Christian histories) of its ideological deployments, its insinuations into the capillary structures of domination, and thus against the grain of its theo-political collusions with (racial) governmentality.</p>
<p>In this respect, Cone’s theological ruminations are in keeping with a point Judith Butler makes in noting that “democratic polities are constituted through exclusions that return to <italic>haunt</italic> the polities predicated upon their absence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573613485527c">23</xref></sup> Noting this, Butler has a follow-up question: How does this haunting occur? What are its logics? Indeed, “how does that exclusion [that enables a normalizing matrix to do just that—normalize itself] haunt [the] boundary [of the American body politic] as an internal ghost of sorts”?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573613485527c">24</xref></sup> Copeland, I think, suggests indirectly something similar in her subtle distinction between evil and suffering: “Evil is the negation and deprivation of good; suffering, while never identical with evil, is inseparable from it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573613485527c">25</xref></sup> It is for this reason that due to the space between evil and suffering, or the fact that evil does not get the better of us through suffering, that evil does not fulfill itself utterly, wholly, and completely in our suffering—because this is the case, “quite paradoxically, the suffering caused by evil can result in interior development and perfection as well as in social and cultural good.” The paradox of which Copeland speaks I want to call the paratheological paradox. “African Americans have encountered monstrous evil in chattel slavery and its legacy of virulent institutionalized racism and have been subjected to unspeakable physical, psychological, social, moral, and religious affliction and suffering. Yet, from the anguish of our people rose distinctive religious expression, exquisite music and song, powerful rhetoric and literature, practical invention and creative art. If slavery was the greatest evil, freedom was the greatest good and women and men struggled, suffered, sacrificed, and endured much to attain it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573613485527c">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cone’s text, in effect, agrees with this. Indeed, he may be read as gesturing as well toward answering the Butlerian query. In his own way, his concern is also with the question of how and towards what end does suffering, in this case lynching as a historic, post-slavery disciplinary technology of subjection and as a site of exclusion, return ghost-like to the scene of the crime. How does lynching return spectrally, not unlike the return of Beloved to 124 Bluestone Road (an American haunted house, or America as a haunted house) in the Toni Morrison novel that bears this character’s name, as a ghostly and scandalous haunting of the body (politic) and of citizenship, and thus as a haunting ever-poised to radicalize democracy and open up an ungraspable future, a futurity, an eschaton? For Cone, this haunting is the haunting of the cross at the very site of “death-bound subjectivity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573613485527c">27</xref></sup> This is nothing less than the scandal of the cross.</p>
<p>The scandal is that the cross as a symbol of the work of Christ discloses its meaning, for an Afro-modernist tradition of black radical thought (of which Cone is a part), “in the lived experience of the black.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573613485527c">28</xref></sup> In order to reckon with the cross as redemptive, one must look at Jesus Christ by way of black people as a crucial locus, though not the only locus, of revelation (<italic>apocalypsis</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573613485527c">29</xref></sup> In their lived experiences, black folks become spokespersons or witnesses of hope and life in the face of the void of death, the hope and life of the cross, a cross no longer over-determined by death, a cross that is the “No!” to Death. In keeping with diasporic Afro-modernism, what Cone seeks to establish is that a different kind of meaning-making, a new artistry, an avant-garde religious and theo-political aesthetic. This counter-aesthetic is operationalized precisely at the scene of death or lynching itself, indeed, as an excess to lynching. This excess to lynching—the fact that, though terrible and though it has left its scars, its wounded, and even its dead, yet it did not win—is in Cone’s text theologized in light of the excess of Jesus’ own cross, which was a technology of the ancient Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The fact of an excess to our suffering, that it though often brutal is not exhaustive, is a lesson that Emmett Till’s mother, Ms. Mamie Bradley, who photographed her son’s dead body for the world to see, understood all too well. The new artistry of the cross, disclosed in lynching as a scene of subjection, sets in motion what I would like to call the disappearance of the disappearance or the dying of (societal) death itself. It is this double-disappearance that makes possible a resurrection and therefore hope or what might be called, slightly modifying theorist Fred Moten, a soteriological “black ops” precisely at the place of suffering itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573613485527c">30</xref></sup> The cross is the scene of a “between,” the uncapturable, the in-sovereign, within the personal and political ordering of sovereignty; it is akin to the doubling in the Du Boisian “double consciousness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573613485527c">31</xref></sup> It makes possible a just society as the working through—let’s call this “confession”—of our (social) sin. Between Mamie Bradley’s sorrow and untold lynchings, there is set in motion a “black mon’in,” which entails a moaning, a groaning, and a mourning that is poised to irrupt into a new morning, a kind of sonic apocalypse at the site/sight of lynching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573613485527c">32</xref></sup> What I am calling a sonic apocalypse is both a cry and sigh for a revolutionary eschaton. Indeed, it is related to what Du Bois, mobilizing theological thought forms, announced as “one far off divine event,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573613485527c">33</xref></sup> an event that arguably led him to pen these words that come at the conclusion of his post-World War I “credo”: “I believe in Patience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573613485527c">34</xref></sup> Indeed, it is a revolutionary, which is to say, apocalyptic patience.</p>
<p>It is in the final two chapters of the book that Cone begins a meditation precisely on this new sonic and apocalyptic artistry of the cross and the lynching tree. And it is here, I would contend, that we are ushered into the constructive heart of <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, the moment, as I would like to call it, of an apocalyptic blues, a revolutionary atonement, a refracting of the work of Jesus Christ through the aurality of an avant-garde sound. Cone introduces his readers to the blues as sonic and theological blues experimentalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573613485527c">35</xref></sup> I want to stress that what Cone does in these final chapters is only a <italic>beginning</italic>, for in my view he provides us only with a prolegomena to this new artistry, this new radical, sonic or blues aesthetic of the cross or the work of Jesus Christ and its social significance at the site of death. Further theological work remains to be done.</p>
<p>In the chapter on the Harlem Renaissance and the black literary imagination (chapter 4) Cone starts to track how black artists functioned more perceptively than America’s theologians and clergymen—both white and (often) black—in considering the cross and the lynching tree. The point of the chapter is that literary artists like W.E.B. Du Bois, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, and others in their poetry and writings did not interpret black suffering only in one direction, the direction of death, damnation, and wretchedness. Understanding that suffering does not have the final word, they dramatized (and here I use language that goes beyond Cone himself) an <italic>improvisatory blackness</italic>. That is, they discerned and aesthetically dramatized how black folks have improvised their lives inside of scenes and screams of suffering. They literarily carved out zones of redemption right inside of suffering itself and from within these zones called America to account. Thus, the cross is a politics; it is a new mode of political theology. In fact, when viewed from the lynching tree, we can say that the cross signifies and enacts a counter history of political theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573613485527c">36</xref></sup> Black radical artists called America to reckon with its history of terror and as a result of this reckoning to be more than what it has been.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, which meditates on Ida B. Wells-Barnett, the journalist and lay church woman who through her journalism brought lynching out of the shadows and to national and international attention, and the blues singer Billie Holiday (“Lady Day”) with her moving song “Strange Fruit,” which is about lynching and was written by a Jewish man, Cone furthers his reflections on how the lynching tree offers a way to reimagine American society and the Christian cross. Together, Wells-Barnett and “Lay Day” represent in Cone’s imagination the taproot of an intellectual tradition that culminates both in womanist theology and in a critical black church tradition of which Cone himself is a part. Indeed, between these two figures, we might say, a Christianity of musical blackness, of the musicality of the cross, is articulated. With Wells-Barnett it’s articulated with the journalist’s pen; with Lay Day, it’s through sound and in Harlem’s clandestine cabaret that she offers up her blues screamin’ and groanin’, her mourning and mo’nin. Indeed, with Lady Day, the lynching tree (and the cross) becomes a song, a song of terrible beauty, a beauty that, reminiscent of Ms. Bradley’s photograph of her son’s dead body, must be looked at, though in the looking we sing the blues: we wince, we moan, we groan. <italic>Kyrie eleison…leison…leison, Christe elesion…leison…leison</italic>. We make music.</p>
<p>I can’t help but refer at this point once again to ole Jimmy—that is, to Jimmy Baldwin. He said somewhere that it is out of devastation, out of the hardness of being black, in the wake of the invention of “the nigger,” “that black American music springs. This music begins,” he said, “on the auction block”—or as Cone has said in this book, it begins at the cross, that signifier both of salvation and barbarity, and with the “strange fruit” of the lynching tree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573613485527c">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have offered here only a sketch of Professor Cone’s rich and provocative analysis of modern America, which is nothing less than a meditation on the contradictions of Christian identity as that identity came to be problematically collapsed into American identity. With it he extends his earlier work <italic>God of the Oppressed</italic>, in which he considered the uses of the person of Jesus Christ in the interests of black oppression. With <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> and building from womanist theology, he has considered the uses of the cross or the death of Jesus Christ in the oppressive structuring of American society. If there is fault to be had with this work, it is that, if Cone is right (and I most certainly think he’s onto something crucial), a richer doctrinal reformulation of the work of Jesus Christ is called for. <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> is suggestive of that richer reformulation, though it itself is not that richer reformulation. I prefer to think of <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> as a musical manifesto. Having played American civilization’s minor key, “in the break,” it announces and analyzes the connection between Christianity’s chief symbol, the cross, and its material connection to the history and legacies of the American lynching tree. But it’s also a call, a call to Christians—black, white, and everyone in between—throughout this country and in an age bracketed at the beginning of the millennium with a “war on terror” and at the beginning of this decade with the cries of the “occupy” movement, to reckon with America’s history of sin and social stratification, its history of cross-justified terror against black life. Such reckoning is crucial, Cone contends, to imagining and realizing a just society.</p>
<p>This is the rigorous work, the work of the Christian life, in the twenty-first century.</p>
