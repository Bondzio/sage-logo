<abstract>
<p>The rapid protein adsorption on a material surface causes blood coagulation, platelet activation, and complement system activation, which poses a risk for failure of cardiovascular devices. In this study, a chemically hydroxylated titanium surface was aminosilanized and covalently grafted with poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction conditions on the grafted quantity were studied by the respective amine and carboxyl densities. The blood compatibility of the PEGylated surfaces with different poly(ethylene glycol) densities and chain lengths was evaluated; the PEGylated surfaces with higher grafted density and longer chain length had less fibrinogen adsorption, less fibrinogen <italic>γ</italic>-chain exposed, less adherent platelets, and lower activation of the adherent platelets. In addition to the influence on blood, the longer chain PEGylated surfaces resisted, not only smooth muscle cell attachment and proliferation, but also macrophage attachment and death. This method is a good candidate for improving cardiovascular implant surfaces.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the main cause of death in seven million people worldwide annually and represents 12% of all global deaths. Many cardiovascular and other blood contacting biomedical devices have been applied, such as stents, vascular grafts, artificial heart valves, and blood pumps, and contribute significantly to the quality and effectiveness of the health-care system. However, the contact between artificial materials and body fluids induces a variety of biological responses, including adsorption of proteins and activation of complement and coagulation systems. The interaction of plasma proteins with artificial materials initiates a series of events, which may lead to thrombus formation or induce inflammatory responses, that could cause failure of the whole treatment. Surface modification with antithrombotic agents has been frequently applied to reduce coagulation activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461108">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461108"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512461108">3</xref></sup> However, the prevention of nonspecific adsorption of blood proteins is desirable to improve surface characteristics and enhance the biocompatibility of implanted biomedical materials.</p>
<p>Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a nontoxic and nonimmunogenic polymer that is soluble in aqueous solvents, as well as many organic solvents. It has been used at the interface of body fluids and artificial materials and has promising thrombus-resistant behavior in contact with blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512461108">4</xref></sup> The hydrophilicity, high mobility, large excluded volume, and steric hindrance effects contribute to the protein resistance of surface-immobilized PEG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512461108">5</xref></sup> Previous studies indicate that, the ability to resist protein adsorption is proportional to the polymer chain length and surface density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461108">6</xref></sup> PEG has been immobilized onto material surfaces via self-assembly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512461108">7</xref></sup> physical adsorption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512461108">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512461108">9</xref></sup> formation of surface physical interpenetrating networks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512461108">10</xref></sup> or covalent grafting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512461108">11</xref></sup> Covalent bonding of PEG to substrates is the most effective way to prepare a stable, PEG-modified surface. However, direct coupling requires functional groups or coupling agents on the substrate surface with which a derivatized PEG can react. The interfacial coupling reaction limited the applicability of the technique to certain substrate materials.</p>
<p>The commonly applied metals have low chemical reactivity, generally preventing covalent functionalization. Silane coupling agents have been used to bond biomolecules onto different materials that have hydroxyl groups on their surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512461108">12</xref></sup> An amine-terminated silane with good biocompatibility has been successfully introduced for biomedical device treatment (BPS215; Thoratec Corporation [(Pleasanton, CA, USA]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512461108">13</xref></sup> The primary amie groups allow chemical grafting by conventional carbodiimide chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512461108">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Titanium (Ti) and titanium alloys have desirable properties, such as relatively low modulus, good fatigue strength, formability, and corrosion resistance. Therefore, they are used in biomedical devices and components, especially as hard-tissue replacements as well as in cardiac and cardiovascular applications. However, due to the insufficient blood compatibility, titanium and its alloys do not meet all clinical requirements in cardiac and cardiovascular applications.</p>
<p>PEG-modified surfaces are known to resist protein adsorption and platelet adhesion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512461108">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512461108">16</xref></sup> but the effect of surface PEGylation on platelet adhesion and activation is not well known. In the present study, PEGylated titanium surfaces with different chain lengths and chain densities were prepared as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461108">Figure 1</xref>, and their blood compatibility and cytocompatibility were also studied.</p>

<p>We found that higher chain density and longer chain length of the PEG on the surface allowed less fibrinogen adsorption, less fibrinogen <italic>γ</italic>-chain exposure, less platelet adhesion, and less platelet activation. In addition, the longer chain PEGylated surfaces resisted smooth muscle cell (SMC) attachment and proliferation as well as prevented macrophage attachment and death, thus reducing the risk of restenosis in the case of application on vascular stents.</p>

<p>The reactions were carried out as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461108">Figure 1</xref>. Pieces of titanium (1 × 1 × 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup>) were polished to a mirror-like finish. The specimens were ultrasonically cleaned in a detergent solution, then in acetone, then in ethanol, and finally in deionized water. The cleaned specimens were soaked in 5 M NaOH solution at 60°C for 24 h, followed by deionized water at 80°C for 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512461108">Figure 1(a)</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461108">1</xref></sup> and, subsequently, were immersed in a 5 wt% solution of 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane in anhydrous toluene.

<title>Fourier transform infrared spectra</title>
<p>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR; ST-IR20SX; Nicolet Co., Ltd., Madison, WI, USA) spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance (DR) mode. FTIR spectra in the range 4000–400 cm<sup>−1</sup> were recorded in order to investigate the nature of the chemical bonds formed.</p>

<sec id="section9-0883911512461108">
<title>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
<p>The surface composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PerkinElmer 16PC [Eden Prairie, MN, USA]) with an Al K-alpha X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons). A wide-scan survey spectrum over a binding energy (BE) range of 0–1400 eV was recorded at pass energy of 80 eV for estimation of the chemical elemental composition and 10 eV for highly resolved C1s peaks. The system was calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. All spectra were recorded at a take-off angle of 15°. The maximum information depth of the XPS method is not more than 10 nm. Spectrum background was subtracted according to the Shirley method. The parameters of the component peak fitting were their BE, height, full width at half maximum, and the Gaussian–Lorentzian ratio.</p>

<title>Quantification of amine groups</title>
<p>Density of surface amine groups (primary, secondary, and ternary) of samples was measured using a modified AO II assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512461108">17</xref></sup> Samples were immersed into a 500 µmol L<sup>−1</sup> AO II solution dissolved in water at pH 3 (adjusted with HCl). After shaking at least for 12 h at RT, samples were washed five times with dilute HCl. In order to release the adsorbed AO II, they were shaken for 30 min at RT in water at pH 12 (adjusted with NaOH). The AO II concentration of the solution was colorimetrically determined with an optical spectrometer at 485 nm with a microplate photometer (µQuant, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The amount of surface-grafted amine groups was then calculated from a calibration curve generated with AO II solutions of known concentrations and under the assumption that AO II was complexed to equivalent moles of amine groups.</p>

Excess dye was rinsed off with pH 10 sodium hydroxide solution five times and transferred to 50% acetic acid solution to desorb the complexed dye. After 30 min, the concentrations of the desorbed dye were measured at 633 nm in a microplate photometer. The amount of surface-grafted carboxyl groups was then calculated from a calibration curve generated with TBO solutions of known concentrations and under the assumption that TBO was complexed to equivalent moles of carboxyl groups.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>A chemically hydroxylated titanium surface was aminosilanized and covalently grafted with PEG. The reaction conditions on the grafted quantity were studied by the respective amine and carboxyl densities. The FTIR spectra of the different surfaces at various stages of surface functionalization are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512461108">Figure 2</xref>. The spectrum of the material treated with NaOH (TiOH) is the broad, weak band at 3375 cm<sup>−1</sup> attributed to hydroxyl groups, which facilitated the binding of the aminosilane as coupling agent. A previous study has demonstrated the requirement of hydroxyl groups on the surface for silanization, showing a dependency of immobilized molecules of the concentration of hydroxyl groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512461108">23</xref></sup> The broader, stronger band at 3375–3235 cm<sup>−1</sup> of the aminosilanized surface is attributed to hydroxyl groups coming from methoxysilyl group hydrolysis and amino groups coming from 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane. The new bands at 2918 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to C–H stretching and at 2848 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to NH<sub>2</sub> group and vibrational bands at 1651 and 1030 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to Si–O, indicating that the aminosilane coupling agent was immobilized on the titanium surface. During PEG immobilization, the methoxysilyl group hydrolysis and the condensation reaction between NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH led to weakening of peaks at 1450 and 1420 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which contribute to CH<sub>3</sub>-deformation from methoxy group and primary amide III, respectively. In the IR spectra of the PEGylated surface, the presence of new bands at 1080 cm<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to stretching of the C–O–C, indicate that PEG was immobilized onto the surface of titanium.</p>

<p>Toluidine blue method was used to determine the amount of carboxyl groups on the PEGylated surface.

The effects of solution concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(a)</xref>), reaction temperature, and reaction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(b)</xref>) on the grafted amount of PEG<sub>600</sub> were measured. With the concentration of PEG<sub>600</sub> solution increasing from 1 to 10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, the grafted amount increased from 1.8 ± 0.3 to 3.8 ± 0.5 chains/nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(a)</xref>). With the concentration increasing from 10 to 100 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, the grafted amount of PEG increased from 3.8 ± 0.5 to 4.5 ± 0.5 chains/nm<sup>2</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(a)</xref>), but lower than the estimated upper limit of 5.8 chains/nm<sup>2</sup> for the fully extended PEG chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512461108">30</xref></sup> Because of efficiency and economical factors, the PEG solution concentration of 10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> was adopted. The effect of reaction temperature on the PEG grafted, amount as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(b)</xref>, was far greater than effect of reaction time. When reaction temperature was below 60°C, the PEG graft increased with temperature. At RT and 37°C, the grafted amount increased with reaction time within 8 h. At 60°C, the PEG graft in 4 h was higher than that in 8 h. The PEG graft increased with reaction time and/or solution concentration because of the increased probability of coupling reactions between PEG chains and reactive pinning sites on the surface. Under elevating temperature, PEG undergoes a reversible phase change due to disruption of the hydration shell surrounding the PEG chains, which results in reduced interchain repulsion distances and association between PEG molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512461108">26</xref></sup> As a consequence, the PEG chains are no longer well solvated as individual random coils. As the hydrodynamic volume of individual chains is much reduced, denser packing of grafted chains is possible if sufficiently dense reactive pinning sites are available on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512461108">26</xref></sup> However, higher temperatures (60°C) and longer time (8 h) did not provide the most grafted PEG. It seems that at higher temperatures, the rate of hydrolysis of the silanized layer is faster in the acidic solution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911512461108">31</xref></sup> thus more PEG was grafted after 4 h than after 8 h at high temperatures. The relationship between the graft density and MW, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461108">Figure 5(c)</xref>, that the short chain could obtain a higher grafting density in the same reaction condition, is probably due to the increase in steric hindrance associated with the incorporation of longer chains into the developing layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512461108">30</xref></sup> Based on these results, the PEG concentration, PEG MW, reaction temperature, and reaction time could potentially regulate the amount of grafted PEG.

<title>Quantification of adsorbed fibrinogen on the surfaces</title>
<p>When a cardiovascular and other blood contacting biomedical device is implanted in the human body, the adsorption of plasma proteins to the surface of the implant is one of the first events that happens, which subsequently influences the cellular response to the biomedical device. Generally, cells do not have receptors that are able to recognize synthetic materials, but they adhere to the surface of the implant via interactions with bioactive sites presented by the layer of adsorbed proteins.</p>
<p>Fibrinogen, one of the most important proteins in the blood coagulation, has several cell adhesion and protein interaction domains. The data of the fibrinogen adsorption on the various surfaces, normalized to the amount on titanium, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512461108">Figure 8(a)</xref>. Compared to Ti, the amount of fibrinogen adsorption on other surfaces decreased. Fibrinogen adsorption increased in the order: TiOH–Sil &lt; Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–H &lt; Ti–S–P<sub>600</sub>–H &lt; Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–L &lt; Ti–S–P<sub>600</sub>–L &lt; Ti. The aminosilanized titanium surface resisted fibrinogen adsorption. One explanation is that albumin has more negatively charged amine residues on their surface than fibrinogen. This would cause the positively charged amine surface (surface pK 8.9) to have a stronger electrostatic interaction with albumin than fibrinogen, thus adsorption of albumin and other acidic proteins would exceed the fibrinogen adsorption onto the aminosilanized surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911512461108">33</xref></sup> The fibrinogen adsorption was reduced on the various PEGylated surface by ~50%–75% compared to the titanium surface.</p>

<p>The quantitative analysis of platelet adhesion on the different surfaces was performed, by determination of the LDH release after lysis of the adherent blood platelets. The adherent platelets on the PEGylated surfaces decreased with MW and chain density increase and were far less than that on the titanium surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512461108">Figure 8(c)</xref>). The adherent platelets on Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–H was less than that on Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–L, but there was no significant difference for the high- and low-density grafted PEG<sub>600</sub> surfaces. A speculation why the long-chain surfaces were more effective in resisting platelet adhesion than the short-chain surfaces is that the long-chain surfaces possess higher mobility and larger excluded volume than the short-chain surfaces, which lead to platelet desorption in dynamic conditions, such as in a blood stream and in the PBS rinsing process.</p>
<p>Thus, the ability to resist platelets adhesion increased with increases in the PEG chain density and MW. These results are in agreement with the amount of fibrinogen <italic>γ</italic>-chain exposure and not the amount of fibrinogen adsorption, indicating that the amount of fibrinogen-exposed <italic>γ</italic>-chain on the surface could predict platelet adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512461108">20</xref></sup> Conventional thinking is that surfaces that adsorb the least amount of plasma proteins support less platelet adhesion, and thus, exhibit less surface thrombogenicity. However, other studies and our results indicate that the critical determinant of the hemocompatibility of a surface may actually be the conformational state of the adsorbed protein rather than the total amount of adsorbed protein on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883911512461108">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEM imaging was preformed to visualize platelet adhesion and activation on the various surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911512461108">Figure 9</xref>). The number of adherent platelets on Ti was much greater than on the PEGylated surfaces. Long-chain surfaces (Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–L and Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–H) were more effective in preventing platelet adhesion than short-chain surfaces (Ti–S–P<sub>600</sub>–L and Ti–S–P<sub>600</sub>–H). The platelets on Ti–S–P<sub>4000</sub>–H were generally singular with the round shapes typical of an inactivated state; no pseudopodia or deformation was observed.</p>

<title>In vitro testing of SMCs compatibility</title>
<p>When cardiovascular devices are placed in a blood environment, complications, such as thrombosis and restenosis, could lead to the failure of the treatment. Therefore, the antifouling character of PEG-modified surfaces on SMC attachment and proliferation was examined at 24 and 48 h by MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512461108">Figure 11</xref>). The SMC population on the PEGylated titanium was significantly lower than on the unmodified titanium and the aminosilanized titanium surface for all time points. The adhesion values of the unmodified titanium and adhesion on the aminosilanized titanium surface significantly increased over time, while they increased only a little on the PEGylated surfaces. Reason is that the high flexibility of the PEG chains prevents the deposition and organization of the cells’ extracellular matrix, which prevents cells spreading. The adsorption of high MW PEG/polylysine copolymers onto endovascular stents is known to reduce restenosis after implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883911512461108">38</xref></sup> In addition, the high-chain-density surface was less efficient to resist SMC attachment and proliferation compared with the low-chain-density surface. This may be attributed to the high COOH density, which to some extent promotes SMC attachment and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883911512461108">39</xref></sup></p>

<title>In vitro testing of macrophages compatibility</title>
<p>A pivotal factor to consider in the development of biomaterials and biomaterial coatings is the inflammatory responses to these materials. Macrophages orchestrate the activation of numerous cell types and are considered key regulators of the intensity and duration of inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883911512461108">40</xref></sup> Macrophages were stained, and the fluorescence was analyzed: green for viable cells and red for nonviable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0883911512461108">Figure 12</xref>). The macrophage population on the PEGylated titanium was significantly lower than on the unmodified titanium and the aminosilanized titanium surface; however, the PEG<sub>4000</sub> surfaces prevented macrophage death. The macrophage population and cell viability were similar on both the surfaces with different PEG density; no morphological differences were observed between macrophages cultured on the various surfaces. It has been reported that the grafted PEG inhibited the immune responses by lymphocytes and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0883911512461108">41</xref></sup> due to the flexibility of the PEG chains, which prevent the protein deposition, organization of the cells’ extracellular matrix and cell attachment. Fewer nonviable cells were found on the PEGylated surfaces than others, which could reduce local inflammation reaction and restenosis after implantation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>PEGylated titanium surfaces were prepared by aminosilylation and subsequent PEG immobilization. The PEG concentration, PEG chain length, reaction temperature, and time were used to regulate the grafted amount of PEG. The blood compatibility of the PEGylated surfaces was improved by increasing the graft density and MW. The PEG surfaces resist SMC and macrophage attachment prevented macrophage death. Therefore, this method is a viable candidate for further development of cardiovascular implant surface.</p>
