<p>This four-volume set is part of the publisher’s continuing commitment to produce substantial collections of transcribed extracts from printed primary sources about topics in social, cultural and medical history; other sets complement it (one on suicide is forthcoming). In this case, each volume uses a broad type of (mostly British) literary output – religious, medical, autobiographical, and popular-cultural writings – which are arranged chronologically. Volume 1 has a general introduction and each volume has a short overview and select bibliography; a brief biography or explanation prefaces each extract (some texts are produced in full); there is a useful set of notes to each extract, collected at the end of each volume; and an index to the whole set is in volume four. Five of the six editors work in the English Literature Department of the University of Northumbria; the sixth (Faubert) is in the same discipline at the University of Manitoba. Their approach is an extension of Robert Burton’s famous <italic>Anatomy of Melancholy</italic> (1621), which celebrated the multiple valencies of a subject known by a variety of words and phrases, of which his was the most descriptively powerful. Modern views of depression are shaped by its nineteenth-century medicalization, and ‘melancholy’ now has specific interest for historians of medicine. In contrast, the topic concerned not only Renaissance and Enlightenment physicians, but also theologians, moral philosophers, poets, dramatists, and (eventually) novelists.</p>
<p>The first volume examines the enduring relationship between religion and melancholy, especially the conversion and religious experience of what contemporaries called ‘the warmer sort of Protestant’. Volume 2 focuses on changing medical understandings, as iatrochemical and mechanical interpretations of the body came gradually to replace Galenic humoral theory. Many early modern autobiographies were spiritual testaments and Volume 3 explores the experience of melancholy in ‘ego-documents’. For all their esoteric appearance, religious and medical writings were part of an accessible educated culture shared by sufferers, healers and observers. To gauge even broader understandings within ‘popular culture’ (or perhaps ‘the low-life of literature’?), the fourth volume brings together broadsides, songs, plays, poems and essays.</p>
<p>The strength of the volumes lies in explicating the remarkable varieties in the experience of depression and the ways in which pre-modern understandings of a condition, broadly identifiable by modern physicians, were shaped by powerful and distinctive components of early modern culture, most notably religion. Thus the Baptist Anne Dutton portrayed her sad yearning for salvation as love melancholy. Pre-modern contexts were distinctive in other ways. Images of isolation are a common component of depression, but where and from what? The answer is at sea or on islands, remote from sociability and civilization. The editors’ approach is profoundly humane and sympathetic, their analysis wide-ranging. The texts draw on both English and Scottish authors and contexts. The introductions afford a useful survey of melancholy’s literary field, even if they contain much familiar material (not least from Ingram’s important contributions over the last 30 years).</p>
<p>One thing they lack is a specialist medical historian’s approach. There is a tendency to see the best of early modern medicine – its concentration on the individual patient ‘in the round’ and its discursive use of ‘cognitive’ therapies – and side-line its shortcomings, while at the same time embracing the long eighteenth century as somehow particularly hospitable to the complex experiences of melancholy. For example, a medical historian might object to the argument that pre-nineteenth-century melancholy was not medicalized (or at least was much less so than it would later become), pointing to the integration of medicine into all sorts of early modern discourses. A social historian, too, might question aspects of the explanatory framework, such as the apparent secularization of understandings of melancholy. Did ‘fathers’ really displace ‘God the Father’ as a source of stress and despair? S/he might also have chosen more documents written by lawyers and generated by the processes of law (another deeply embedded discourse) to show additional forms of representation.</p>
<p>One might wonder, in conclusion, why the publisher has chosen to pursue this format. The texts are available online from JISC Historic Books or elsewhere and many of the biographies (especially in the first three volumes) rely on the <italic>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</italic>, also readily accessible. It is, of course, valuable to have the readings selected, introduced, and given scholarly annotation by accomplished academics, but modern search tools allow lecturers (or any interested reader) to make their own selections, based on their specific research or teaching goals. Some of the texts from which extracts are reproduced can also be found (with glosses) in <italic>Three Hundred Years of Psychiatry, 1535-1860</italic> (London, 1963), edited by R. Hunter and I. Macalpine, though there are many others in the present volumes, the extracts are much longer, and the editing is in no sense so cavalier and prone to mislead. For background and interpretations, the ‘do-it-yourself’ reader can get (at a much lower cost) the multi-authored volume (including three of the present editors) <italic>Melancholy Experience in Literature of the Long Eighteenth Century: Before Depression, 1660-1800</italic> (Basingstoke, 2011); two special issues of <italic>Studies in the Literary Imagination</italic>, 44, 1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Fall 2011) around the theme ‘Depression in the Enlightenment’ complement this.</p>
