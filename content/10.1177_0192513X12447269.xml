<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether stigmatization was associated with psychological adjustment in adolescents from planned lesbian families and, if so, to examine whether individual and interpersonal promotive factors influenced this association. Seventy-eight adolescents (39 girls, 39 boys; mean age = 17.05 years) completed an online questionnaire about psychological health problems and life satisfaction. In addition, information was obtained about androgynous personality traits (an individual factor) of the adolescents. The adolescents were also queried about family compatibility and peer group fit (two interpersonal factors). Hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that stigmatization was associated with more psychological health problems and less life satisfaction, but family compatibility and peer group fit ameliorated this. These findings suggest that stigmatization has a negative impact on the psychological adjustment of adolescents with same-sex parents. Interpersonal promotive factors decrease the strength of this association.</p>

<p>Prior to the 1980s, lesbian mothers had little chance of rearing their children if they had been conceived in the context of a heterosexual marriage, because the courts were generally opposed to granting custody to lesbians during divorce proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12447269">Blumenfield &amp; Raymond, 1988</xref>). In the mid-1980s, sperm banks opened their doors to lesbians seeking to conceive children through donor insemination (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12447269">Gartrell et al., 1996</xref>). By 2005, an estimated 270,313 American children were living in same-sex-parent households, and nearly twice that number had single lesbian or gay parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12447269">Romero, Baumle, Badgett, &amp; Gates, 2007</xref>). These numbers may even be conservative, because estimates suggest that the number of American same-sex couples is 10% to 50% higher than the census figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12447269">Gates &amp; Ost, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the increasing number of children living in same-sex-parent households, this family type is not yet fully accepted within American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12447269">Rosato, 2006</xref>). For example, same-sex marriage has been legalized in relatively few states; fostering and adoption by same-sex parents is prohibited in some states and complicated in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12447269">Rosato, 2006</xref>). Also, public opinion still holds that the traditional mother–father family is the ideal environment in which to raise children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12447269">Cantor, Cantor, Black, &amp; Barrett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, opposition to same-sex parenting has been reflected in various forms of stigmatization against lesbian mothers and their offspring. Stigmatization is an outcome of negative societal attitudes toward those who are different in some way from culturally agreed-upon norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X12447269">Goffman, 1963</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12447269">Morris, Balsam, and Rothblum (2002)</xref> found that the children of nearly 25% of the mothers participating in a nationwide American survey had experienced rejection by peers because their mothers were lesbian. The self-reports of American children and adolescents corroborate that they have been exposed to homophobic stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447269">Bos, Gartrell, Peyser, &amp; van Balen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447269">Gartrell, Deck, Rodas, Peyser, &amp; Banks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon, Tschann, &amp; Jemerin, 1999</xref>). Studies conducted in countries other than the United States (e.g., the Netherlands) have reported similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12447269">Bos &amp; van Balen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of stigmatization on the psychological adjustment of children and adolescents in lesbian families has been investigated in few studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12447269">Bos and van Balen (2008)</xref> showed that higher levels of stigmatization were associated with more problem behavior and lower self-esteem in a group of 63 Dutch children in planned lesbian families. The relationship between experiences of homophobic stigmatization and psychological adjustment was also shown in a sample of 78 American 10-year-olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447269">Bos et al., 2008</xref>): children who reported that they were treated unfairly because they have lesbian mothers had more problem behavior (as reported by their mothers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447269">Gartrell et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al. (1999)</xref> examined the relationship between adolescents’ self-esteem and their perceptions of others’ attitudes toward lesbian families. The researchers found that adolescents who perceived more negative reactions on the part of others had lower self-esteem in five of seven self-esteem areas than adolescents who perceived fewer. These studies suggest that stigmatization based on homophobia can be a risk factor during psychological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12447269">Masten, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, research comparing children in lesbian families with their counterparts in heterosexual families has found few differences in psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12447269">Anderssen, Amlie, &amp; Ytterøy, 2002</xref>). This is noteworthy, since children and adolescents with lesbian mothers are likely to experience stigmatization based on their mothers’ sexual orientation, which in turn can influence their psychological well-being in a negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447269">Bos et al., 2008</xref>; Bos &amp; van Balen; 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447269">Gartrell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>), whereas children and adolescents in the comparison groups—typically from traditional families—are not subjected to such stigmatization. These findings suggest the possibility of mechanisms that promote resilience in children and adolescents with lesbian mothers who experience stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X12447269">Van Gelderen, Gartrell, Bos, &amp; Hermanns, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to cope with distress can be derived through personal strengths as well as influences of family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12447269">Bowman, Prelow, &amp; Weaver, 2007</xref>) and peers. Influences that promote healthy development are considered promotive factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X12447269">Van der Laan, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X12447269">Youngblade et al., 2007</xref>). An example of an individual promotive factor is having personality traits that enable one to regulate one’s emotions and to develop coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12447269">Bem &amp; Lewis, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X12447269">Masten &amp; Powell, 2003</xref>). Having a warm and supportive relationship with one’s parents is an example of an interpersonal promotive factor, in that such a relationship has the potential to minimize the destructive psychological impact of negative life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12447269">Frosch &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12447269">Golombok, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X12447269">Hetherington &amp; Stanley-Hagan, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Very few studies on planned lesbian families have investigated factors that could alleviate the negative impact of stigmatization on the offspring of lesbian mothers. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12447269">Bos and van Balen (2008)</xref> found in a study of Dutch children that having frequent contact with other children who have lesbian or gay parents (an interpersonal factor) alleviated the negative influence of stigmatization on self-esteem, much less is known about how adolescents in lesbian families cope with discrimination. During adolescence, the beliefs and attitudes held by individuals outside the family unit—especially those of peers—become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12447269">Rivers, Poteat, &amp; Noret, 2008</xref>). Since adolescents might be especially vulnerable to social stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12447269">Baumrind, 1995</xref>), it is important to investigate how adolescents with lesbian mothers fare.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al. (1999)</xref> conducted the first American study to focus on resilience in adolescents reared by lesbian mothers (primarily in stepfamilies after the mothers divorced and identified as lesbian). The researchers looked for factors that decrease the negative psychological impact of stigmatization (a risk factor). Their results showed that among adolescents who reported stigmatization, those with effective decision-making coping skills (a subscale of the Wills Coping Inventory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X12447269">Wills, 1986</xref>)—in other words, adaptive coping skills—had higher self-esteem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al. (1999)</xref> also found that adolescents who disclosed their mothers’ sexual orientation to more people had higher self-esteem in the area of close friendships than those who were less open about their mothers’ lesbianism, even though the former group reported more stigmatization. In sum, individual factors helped adolescents in Gershon’s cohort cope with stigmatization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447269">Bos and Gartrell (2010)</xref> investigated the influence of interpersonal factors that promote resilience (family connection and compatibility) on American adolescents in planned lesbian families, and were the first to do so. Using data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS) that had been collected when the offspring were 17 years old, these researchers found that experiences of stigmatization were associated with more adolescent problem behavior, and that close, positive relationships with their lesbian mothers neutralized this negative influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447269">Bos &amp; Gartrell, 2010</xref>). These data were obtained primarily from parental reports. The NLLFS also contains data on the adolescents’ psychological adjustment and possible sources of resilience, based on their own self-reports. An analysis of these data forms the basis of the present investigation.</p>
<p>Previous studies on the role of promotive factors in the psychological development of adolescents in planned lesbian families focused only on negative aspects, such as problem behavior. Also, these studies considered promotive factors within only one context (e.g., the individual). The aim of the present study is to assess whether psychological health problems (a negative dimension of psychological adjustment) and life satisfaction (a positive dimension of psychological adjustment) differ in adolescents who experienced stigmatization and those who did not. If differences are observed, the subsequent question is whether promotive factors from different contexts, namely, individual and interpersonal factors, account for these observed differences after controlling for experienced stigmatization.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional data for the current investigation were derived from the fifth wave of the NLLFS, which was initiated in 1986 to provide both descriptive and quantifiable longitudinal data on the first generation of American lesbian families in which the children were conceived through donor insemination. We hypothesized that the NLLFS adolescents who had experienced stigmatization (a risk factor) would have more psychological health problems and indicate less satisfaction with their lives. We also expected that three promotive factors (one individual factor and two interpersonal factors) would explain the differences in psychological health problems and life satisfaction after controlling for the negative impact of stigmatization on the NLLFS adolescents. The individual factor that we studied was demonstrating high scores on androgynous personality traits reflecting both feminine-typed traits (such as warmth and caring) and masculine-typed personality traits (such as competence and rationality). The two interpersonal factors assessed in this study were family compatibility and experiencing a favorable connection to peers. We included androgynous personality traits as an individual promotive factor because various studies have shown that offspring of lesbian mothers are less bound by societal gender constraints (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X12447269">Sutfin, Fulcher, Bowles, &amp; Patterson, 2008</xref>) and that having an androgynous personality gives one the opportunity to choose between stereotypically masculine behaviors (such as competence and rationality) and feminine behaviors (such as warmth and caring)—depending on the situation one is in at that moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12447269">Bem &amp; Lewis, 1975</xref>). This strength of androgony lies in its interactive nature: femininity compounds the positive effect of masculinity and vice versa. Androgynous adolescent girls and boys are expected to have the greatest behavioral flexibility and therefore are considered most adaptive to negative experiences such as stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12447269">Bem &amp; Lewis, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12447269">Bun Lam &amp; McBride-Chang, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Seventy-eight adolescents (of whom two were twins) participated in the study. The group consisted of 39 girls and 39 boys, with a mean age of 17.05 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.36). Most adolescents were White/Caucasian (87.1%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447269">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-eight (36%) had been conceived using a known sperm donor and 50 (64%) using an unknown donor. Of the unknown donors, 31 (62%) were permanently unknown and 19 (38%) could be identified when the adolescent reached the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12447269">Table 1</xref>, most adolescents came from middle- or upper-middle-class families and resided in the north eastern and western regions of the United States. Fifty-six percent of mothers who had been part of a couple when their adolescent was born had since separated; the mothers had been together on average for 12 years before separating (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.88).

<title>Sampling Procedures</title>
<p>Between 1986 and 1992, prospective lesbian mothers were recruited via announcements distributed at lesbian events, in women’s bookstores, and in lesbian newspapers throughout metropolitan Boston, Washington DC, and the San Francisco Bay Area. This resulted in a group of 84 planned lesbian families. Data were collected during insemination or pregnancy (T1) and when the children were 2 (T2), 5 (T3), 10 (T4), and 17 years old (T5). Before data collection, all participating mothers gave their consent, and the offspring assented. At T5, 93% of the families were still participating in the study. One family was excluded from the T5 data analyses because not all parts of their T5 survey instruments were returned. Approval for the NLLFS has been granted by the Institutional Review Board of the California Pacific Medical Center.</p>

<sec id="section4-0192513X12447269">

<title>Outcome Variables</title>
<sec id="section6-0192513X12447269">
<title>Psychological health problems</title>
<p>To measure the adolescents’ psychological health problems, a mean score of the items of three scales (trait anxiety, trait anger, trait depression) of the State–Trait Personality Inventory (STPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X12447269">Spielberger et al., 1995</xref>) was calculated if no more than 5% of the items were missing. Each scale consists of 10 items; examples are “I feel anger” and “I feel gloomy” (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 4 = <italic>very much so</italic>). Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale was .76.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0192513X12447269">
<title>Life satisfaction</title>
<p>Information about the life satisfaction of the 17-year-olds was obtained by using three items of the Youth Quality of Life Scale–Research Version (YQOL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12447269">Topolski, Edwards, &amp; Patrick, 2002</xref>). The mean score of the three items was calculated and used for further analyses. The items were “I enjoy life,” “I am satisfied with the way my life is now,” and “I feel my life is worthwhile” (0 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 10 = <italic>completely</italic>). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was .82.</p>

<title>Androgynous personality traits</title>
<p>To measure androgynous trait scores in NLLFS girls and boys, the short version of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X12447269">Bem, 1978</xref>) was used. The inventory consists of 10 items, such as “sensitive to the needs of others,” that were defined as feminine-typed personality traits, and 10 items, such as “having leadership abilities,” that were considered masculine-typed traits. The NLLFS adolescents rated themselves on each item, using a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>almost never true</italic>, 7 = <italic>almost always true</italic>). Cronbach’s alpha was .89 for the feminine-typed personality traits scale and .77 for the masculine-typed personality traits scale. To calculate the androgynous personality trait score, the formula (BSRI Trait Masculinity + BSRI Trait Femininity) − (BSRI Trait Masculinity − BSRI Trait Femininity) was used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X12447269">Heilbrun &amp; Pitman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X12447269">Strough, Leszczynski, Neely, Flinn, &amp; Margrett, 2007</xref>). Continuous scores were used in the analyses instead of classifying the adolescents as androgynous or not androgynous.</p>

<p>Compatibility with the adolescents’ parents was measured by a question derived from the Youth Quality of Life Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12447269">Topolski et al., 2002</xref>): “I feel I am getting along with my parents or guardians” (0 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 10 = <italic>completely</italic>).</p>

<title>Peer group fit</title>
<p>Among questions about the adolescents’ high school experiences, they were asked whether they felt that they fit in well with other teenagers (“How well do/did you feel that you fit in with the other kids?” 1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>okay</italic>, 3 = <italic>well</italic>); this question was used to measure peer group fit.</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>To examine whether stigmatization was related to more psychological health problems and less life satisfaction, two separate 2 (stigmatization; 1 = <italic>no</italic>, 2 = <italic>yes</italic>) by 2 (1 = <italic>girl</italic>, 2 = <italic>boy</italic>) ANOVAs were conducted, with psychological health problems and life satisfaction as dependent variables. We also assessed whether androgynous personality traits, family compatibility, and peer group fit were related to problem behavior and life satisfaction by calculating Pearson correlations between the outcome variables and the promotive factors. To identify the factors that were responsible for the observed differences in psychological health problems and life satisfaction, hierarchical multiple-regression analyses were conducted. Experienced homophobia was entered in Model 1. The factors that predicted psychological health problems and life satisfaction were entered in Model 2.</p>

<title>Hierarchical multiple regression analyses</title>
<p>A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to establish whether the assumed promotive factors could ameliorate the positive relationship between stigmatization and psychological health problems. We only included those factors that were correlated with psychological health problems, that is, stigmatization, family compatibility, and peer group fit.</p>
<p>Model 1 showed that the risk factor “experienced stigmatization” accounted for 12% of the variance in psychological health problems: adolescents who reported stigmatization had more psychological health problems than those who did not report stigmatization. After including family compatibility and peer group fit, a significant change in the coefficient of determination, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>(2, 68) = .167, <italic>p</italic> = .001, was found. Model 2 accounted for 29% of the variance in psychological health problems. In this second model, family compatibility and peer group fit contributed significantly to the percentage of explained variance in psychological health problems, whereas stigmatization did not. Those NLLFS adolescents who evaluated their relationship with their parents more positively had fewer psychological health problems. In addition, the adolescents who were more positive about their peer group fit had fewer psychological health problems (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X12447269">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>We also conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analyses with life satisfaction: the risk factor “stigmatization” was added in Model 1 and the promotive factors that were related to life satisfaction (androgynous personality traits, family compatibility, and peer group fit) added in Model 2. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X12447269">Table 5</xref> shows that experienced stigmatization (a risk factor) explained 11% of the variance in life satisfaction: the adolescents who reported stigmatization had less life satisfaction than those who did not report stigmatization. The inclusion of androgynous personality trait, family compatibility, and peer group fit in Model 2 produced a significant change in the coefficient of determination, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>(3, 67) = .251, <italic>p</italic> = .000, for the dependent variable. The second model accounted for 37% of the variance in life satisfaction and showed that compatibility with parents and peer group fit were significantly related to life satisfaction, whereas stigmatization and the individual factor “androgynous personality traits” were not. In other words, after controlling for stigmatization, adolescents who reported that they got along well with their parents and fit in well with peers were more satisfied with their lives than those who were less satisfied with those relationships.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, our results show that experienced stigmatization (a risk factor) was positively associated with psychological health problems and negatively associated with life satisfaction for the NLLFS adolescents in planned lesbian families. Our second hypothesis—namely, that individual and interpersonal promotive factors would ameliorate the association between psychological health problems and life satisfaction—was partly confirmed. Regarding psychological health problems, positive relationships with parents and fitting well within peer groups were most strongly associated with psychological health problems after controlling for stigmatization. Androgynous personality traits were not related to psychological health problems. Concerning life satisfaction, the interpersonal promotive factors (having favorable relationships with parents and peers) predicted the observed differences after controlling for stigmatization. The individual promotive factor “androgynous personality traits” did not significantly account for the association relation between stigmatization and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>That stigmatization was related to more psychological health problems is not surprising: earlier studies have shown that the offspring of lesbian mothers experience stigmatization and that such exposure is associated with more problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12447269">Bos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447269">Gartrell et al., 2005</xref>) and lower self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>). The relationship between stigmatization and life satisfaction has not been investigated previously. However, since satisfaction with life is often used as a measure of psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12447269">McDowell, 2010</xref>), as is problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12447269">Gartrell &amp; Bos, 2010</xref>), this not altogether unexpected finding underscores the importance of developing strategies to help the offspring of lesbian mothers deal with negative reactions to their family type.</p>
<p>Important to note is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X12447269">Gartrell, Bos, and Goldberg (2010)</xref> have shown that when the NLLFS adolescents were asked to identify their sexual identity on the Kinsey scale (between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual), 0% of the girls and 5.4% of the boys indicated that they are predominantly-to-exclusively homosexual. In addition, 18.9% of the adolescent girls and 2.7% of the adolescents rated themselves in the bisexual spectrum. Other studies have also shown that a majority of offspring with lesbian mothers identify themselves as heterosexual, as do a majority of those reared by heterosexual parents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X12447269">Tasker &amp; Golombok, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X12447269">Wainright, Russell, &amp; Patterson, 2004</xref>). However, it would be interesting to investigate whether adolescents with a sexual minority identity are more vulnerable to stigmatization if their parents also identify as lesbian or gay.</p>
<p>Prior to our current study, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12447269">Gershon et al. (1999)</xref> had studied the effect of individual promotive factors on adolescents with lesbian mothers. The results of their study showed that having effective decision-making coping skills and disclosing one’s mother’s sexual orientation were associated with higher self-esteem in adolescents who had experienced stigmatization. Based on the literature concerning androgynous personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12447269">Bem &amp; Lewis, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12447269">Bun Lam &amp; McBride-Chang, 2007</xref>), we expected that high scores on this personality trait would explain differences in psychological health and life satisfaction among NLLFS adolescent girls and boys, after controlling for experiences of stigmatization. However, we did not find evidence to support this. Our study found that factors within their environments (their relationships with parents and peers) were more important than individual characteristics of the adolescents.</p>
<p>Various studies have shown that closeness to parents is beneficial for children in traditional families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12447269">Luthar &amp; Lantendresse, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X12447269">Vanderbilt-Adriance &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>), as well as for adolescents in households headed by lesbian mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12447269">Golombok, 2000</xref>). Our study confirms this by showing that a favorable relationship between adolescents and their mothers promoted adolescent psychological health and life satisfaction, despite stigmatization. These results are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12447269">Bos and Gartrell (2010)</xref>, who found that adolescent reports of positive relationships with their mothers were associated with a diminution in problem behavior among those who experienced stigmatization.</p>
<p>The results of our study show that peer group fit is associated with positive psychological well-being. According to some researchers, peers may play an even more important role than parents in adolescent adjustment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X12447269">Harris, 1995</xref>). We found that peer group fit not only ameliorated the negative impact of stigmatization on a negative aspect of well-being (psychological health problems), but it also diminished the association between experienced stigmatization and a positive measure of well-being (life satisfaction).</p>
<p>Our study has several strengths. First, it was based on the reports of adolescents themselves. Thus far, most studies about planned lesbian families, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12447269">Gartrell et al. (2005)</xref>, are based primarily on parental reports. Because adolescents can be secretive as they strive for emotional autonomy from their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12447269">Finkenauer, Engels, &amp; Meeus, 2002</xref>), adolescent self-reports offer a more nuanced window into their psychological functioning. In addition, our study focused not only on problem behavior but also on life satisfaction—a more positive formulation of psychological well-being. It is worth noting that promotive factors affect not only the relationship between stigmatization and problem behavior but also between stigmatization and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>This study also has several limitations. In socioeconomic status (SES), this cohort of first generation planned lesbian families is primarily middle to upper-middle class. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X12447269">Tasker and Golombok (1997)</xref> reported that children of lower SES lesbian families were even more likely to experience homophobic stigmatization. The sample is also limited in their ethnic backgrounds; 87.1% of the adolescents reported having a White/Caucasian background. Also, we asked the adolescents whether they were treated unfairly because they have lesbian mothers; we did not ask whether this unfair treatment occurred in a particular time period. As attitudes toward lesbian and gay people are generally more positive than they were when the NLLFS adolescents were younger, it is possible that our stigmatization rate would have been lower had we asked about stigmatization experiences in the previous year. Moreover, stigmatization and two of the three promotive factors were measured by a single item. The use of more extended instruments to assess stigmatization and to measure promotive factors on the interpersonal level might have given us a deeper understanding of the association between risk and promotive factors, and their effects on adolescent well-being. In addition, more information about the adolescents’ openness about their mothers’ sexual orientation is needed, since that would have implications for their exposure to stigmatization. Therefore, it is important that future studies focus on the relation between openness of the adolescents and their experiences with stigmatization. Finally, all information was obtained during one measurement and therefore is it impossible to test causality. The NLLFS is an ongoing longitudinal study, with a design that calls for the offspring to be surveyed again when they are 25 years old. Data collected at that time (T6) are expected to provide further (longitudinal) insight into the contributions of promotive and risk factors to adult mental health.</p>
<p>Previous studies on adolescents reared by lesbian mothers investigated whether these adolescents differed from their counterparts in heterosexual-parent families. Such studies also provide an opportunity to assess whether restrictions on custody, adoption, and foster care by same-sex parents are supported by empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12447269">Blumenfield &amp; Raymond, 1988</xref>). To date, there are no data to substantiate these restrictions: research has found that adolescents in lesbian families function as well as, or sometimes even better than, their counterparts in heterosexual families (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12447269">Gartrell &amp; Bos, 2010</xref>). The current study focused on differences within a cohort of adolescents growing up in planned lesbian families, specifically concerning the experience of stigmatization. Our results demonstrate that although adolescents who have been reared by lesbian mothers may experience stigmatization that will have a negative impact on their psychological health and life satisfaction, having a favorable relationship with parents and fitting well with peers can promote a healthy development. Our findings suggest that queries about relationships with parents and peers are an important part of the clinical assessment of adolescents in same-sex parent families.</p>
