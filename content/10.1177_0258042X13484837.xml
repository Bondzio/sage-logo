<abstract>
<p>The study is conducted to examine the main effects of personality of faculty members of technical educational institutes of India on their turnover intentions. Five antecedents of personality were identified using Personality Big-Five Factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484837">Goldberg, 1981</xref>). 13-item instrument was generated using Turnover Intention Scale and Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). Questionnaire was designed and administered online to collect data from sample of 261 faculty members using non-probabilistic convenience sampling method. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine construct validity and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha to determine the scale internal consistency. Regression analysis was used to determine the causal relationship between the antecedents of personality and turnover intention. The results revealed that both extraversion and agreeableness has inverse significant impact on turnover intention. The study suggest management should adopt appropriate strategies and enhance human resource practices that lead to positive personality traits which lead to increased retention of faculty members.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Employee turnover has always been a matter of great concern for today’s organizations. A large degree of employee turnover is highly detrimental to both the organization as well as the employees. So it is mandatory for organizations to identify the factors affecting turnover intentions, which compel them to leave the organization. Those factors may be either of individual level or organizational level. One of the most important individual factors of turnover intention is the individual personality traits of the employees, which is the area of study of this research paper.</p>
<p>Personality traits concern human attributes which encompass biological, social, and cognitive factors that make a person different from others. Personality traits influence both individual and organizational behaviour. Barrick and Mount (2005) accepted that behaviour at work is influenced by personality. Furthermore, self-esteem, self-efficacy, job performance and job satisfaction are all areas that have been linked to personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0258042X13484837">Judge and Bono, 2001</xref>). Generally speaking, personality traits are believed to be stable over time and unaffected by environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0258042X13484837">Hofstede and McCrae, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0258042X13484837">Mooradian and Swan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Intent to leave refers to the voluntary intention of individuals to leave their current organization or job. The cost of an employee leaving the organization is not fixed, depending on his or her skill level. In fact, the cost of an individual quitting the organization and the organization getting a replacement for him may include direct costs as advertising, recruiting and training as well as indirect costs, such as, lost work hours, cost of overtime and cost of errors made by the new replacement. At the same time, the evidence suggests that it is proving difficult for organizations to find suitably qualified and experienced replacements for employees who leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0258042X13484837">Shields and Ward, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Faculty turnover is a serious issue in the field of education. Turnover costs can be as much as six months to three years’ pay and benefits depending on job types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0258042X13484837">Fitz-Enz, 1998</xref>). Many researchers try to understand the major determinants of turnover intention and develop some managerial implications to deal with the problem of high turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0258042X13484837">Tuzun, 2007</xref>). This paper is attempted to identify the individual personality traits of faculty members of technical educational institutes of India and their impact on turnover intention.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Faculty turnover is a serious issue in the field of technical education. Technical educational Institutes must pay more attention to this phenomenon and must not be overlooked, as human resource is the most important asset of any organization. As far as education industry is concerned, faculty members act as mediators between knowledge and students, so are considered as the most important resource to retain and develop to gain competitive advantage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0258042X13484837">
<title>Turnover Intention</title>
<p>Employee turnover intention may be understood as the employee leaving the organization or profession voluntarily. It has been observed that voluntary turnover is an interdisciplinary and multidimensional construct. The problem of voluntary turnover stretches beyond the scope of employee and organization. The concept of voluntary turnover can be explicated only when it is accepted as a combination of social, economic and psychological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484837">Udechukwu and Mujtaba, 2007</xref>). Further, studies indicate that voluntary turnover is an upshot of employee initiating the termination of their employee–organization relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0258042X13484837">Lambert, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Early literature on turnover behaviour indicated that the employees would initiate the process of termination of their relationship with their employee/organization/profession only when there is perceived desirability to do so and there is a perceived possibility of such ease of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0258042X13484837">March and Simon, 1958</xref>). This perceived desirability of termination of employee–employer relation is known as turnover intention. Turnover intention may be defined as the individual’s intention to voluntararily quit the organization or profession. Intentions are important to study as they predict an individual’s perception and judgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484837">Mobley, Griffeth, Hand and Meglino, 1979</xref>). As such, intentions are the most immediate determinant of actual behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0258042X13484837">Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980</xref>). Researchers have testified that turnover intention comprises a sequence of processes, viz. thinking of quitting, intentions to search and intention to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484837">Mobley 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0258042X13484837">Mobley, Horner and Hollingsworth, 1978</xref>). Thus, proactive measures may be adopted by the organization to control the actual turnover, if it is aware of the turnover intentions of its employees.</p>
<p>Mobley et al. (1979) observed that the intention to quit is influenced by a series of factors, namely organizational factors, individual factors, job-related and labour-market expectations, and individual values. The intention to quit then ultimately influences the actual quitting behaviour. The present paper intends to study the individual factors influencing turnover intentions among faculty members, especially focusing on the personality characteristic from various individual factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0258042X13484837">
<title>Individual Factor: Personality Traits</title>
<p>Individual factors leading to turnover intentions refer to the personal characteristics of an individual. These characteristics could be those which are inbuilt in the individual, such as personality, or those which are learnt, such as skill, ability, etc. Studies indicate that various cognitive and non-cognitive factors do influence, directly or indirectly, an individual’s intention and then finally the decision to actually quit the organization. The purpose of this study is to identify the personality traits of faculty members as an individual factor affecting turnover intention.</p>
<p>Stagner (1948) defines personality as the organization, within the individual, of those perceptual, cognitive, emotional and motivational systems which determine his or her unique responses to the environment. Friedman and Rosenman’s (1959) theory of Type A and Type B personality motivated researchers to unearth the relationship between personality and turnover intentions among individuals. However, no significant relationship between personality and turnover intentions could be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0258042X13484837">Dole and Schroeder, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Personality has been conceptualized from a variety of theoretical perspectives, and at various levels of abstraction or breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0258042X13484837">John, Hampson and Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484837">McAdams, 1995</xref>). Each of these levels has made unique contributions to our understanding of individual differences in behaviour and experience. However, the number of personality traits, and scales designed to measure them, escalated without an end in sight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484837">Goldberg, 1971</xref>). The study provided evidence indicating that positive affectivity is negatively associated with turnover intention whereas negative affectivity is neither positively nor negatively associated with turnover intentions. Many researchers have suggested that individual attributes such as personality may affect turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0258042X13484837">Hom and Griffeth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484837">Mobley, Griffeth, Hand and Meglino, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0258042X13484837">Steers and Mowday, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Antecedents of Personality: Big-Five Factors</title>
<p>After decades of research, the field is approaching consensus on a general taxonomy of personality traits, the Big Five personality dimensions. These dimensions do not represent a particular theoretical perspective but were derived from analyses of the natural language terms people use to describe themselves and others. Rather than replacing all previous systems, the Big Five taxonomy serves an integrative function because it can represent the various and diverse systems of personality description in a common framework. It thus provides a starting place for vigorous research and theorizing that can eventually lead to an explication and revision of the descriptive taxonomy in causal and dynamic terms.</p>
<p>The current study concentrates on ‘The Personality Big Five Factor Model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484837">Goldberg, 1981</xref>) for the purpose of proving that the hypothesis drawn in the study as the Big Five Locator is a useful tool for measuring personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0258042X13484837">Howard, Medina and Howard, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Consensus is emerging that a five-factor model of personality, often termed the ‘Big Five’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484837">Goldberg, 1981</xref>), can be used to describe the most salient aspects of personality. The Big Five can be found in virtually any measure of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0258042X13484837">McCrae and John, 1992</xref>), including the analysis of the trait, factor reanalysis of existing multidimensional measures, and decisions made by expert judges based on existing measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0258042X13484837">Mount and Barrick, 1998</xref>). Three meta-analyses have specifically included the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and turnover with conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484837">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). Barrick and Mount (1991) concluded that no significant relationships existed. Salgado (2002) and Zimmerman (2008) found much more significant relationships; regardless of the conflicting results which have been observed, one common theme seems to be repeated in these studies: the relationship between personality and turnover should continue to be studied. Moreover, none of these studies focused on samples of faculty members of technical educational institutes in their analyses.</p>
<p>The dimensions comprising the five-factor model are extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience, which are considered as antecedents of personality in order to generate the research instruments.</p>
<list id="list1-0258042X13484837" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Extraversion:</bold> Extraversion is a trait characterized by interest in other people, and trusting them. It is seen as a positive quality since it concerns the general sociability and includes traits such as human contacts, attention, active participation and assertiveness. Extraverts are predisposed to experience positive emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484837">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>). Extraversion has significant inverse impact on turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>H1: Extraversion has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Agreeableness:</bold> Agreeableness measures how able individuals are to get along with others. Agreeable individuals are generally decent and cheerful and therefore tend to be more involved in their tasks. They are friendly, courteous, altruistic, helpful, and they attempt to compromise their personal interests with others. McCrae and Costa (1991) argued that agreeableness should be related to happiness because agreeable individuals have greater motivation to achieve interpersonal intimacy, which should lead to greater levels of well-being. Agreeableness has significant inverse impact on turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>H2: Agreeableness has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Conscientiousness:</bold> Conscientiousness is associated with being dependable, organized, punctual and strong-willed. People with conscientiousness personalities plan ahead and they direct their impulses toward achievement (McCrae and Costa, 1991). Conscientiousness has significant inverse impact on turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>H3: Conscientiousness has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Neuroticism:</bold> It represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative effects such as anxiety, insecurity and hostility. It includes traits like being tense, moody and anxious. The opposite of emotional stability, neuroticism, is commonly associated with being anxious, depressed, angry, embarrassed, emotional, worried and insecure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484837">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>). Emotional stability (low neuroticism) has significant inverse impact on turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0258042X13484837">Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp and McCloy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>H4: Neuroticism has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Openness to Experience:</bold> It is the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional and autonomous. Includes traits like having wide interests being imaginative and insightful. Openness to experience is related to scientific and artistic creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484837">Feist, 1998</xref>). Openness to experience has significant inverse impact on turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484837">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>H5: Openness to experience has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</bold></p></list-item>

<sec id="section6-0258042X13484837">
<title>Research Objectives</title>
<p>Increasing competition and the growth in business, juxtaposed with constant and increasing rates of change, place new demands on employees to enhance their personality traits. Therefore this study proposes to explore the various individual personality traits and their impact on turnover intention of faculty members with the following objectives:
<list id="list2-0258042X13484837" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To identify the various antecedents of individual personality among faculty members.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To analyze the impact of antecedents of individual personality on turnover intention of faculty members of technical educational institutes of India.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To describe the importance of personality traits and developing strategies to enhance retention practices through developing personality traits.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Thus, the study attempts to uncover the self-directed learning readiness among faculty members in technical educational settings of India.</p>

<sec id="section7-0258042X13484837">
<title>Independent and Dependent Variables</title>
<p>An appropriate instrument is required to formulate the questionnaire. The instrument needs some base and background of independent and dependent variables. Personality is the independent variable, which has an impact on the turnover intention of faculty members acting as a dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0258042X13484837">Chiu and Francesco, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0258042X13484837">Jenkins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484837">Salgado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484837">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). Further, the Big Five personality traits, that is, from X<sub>1</sub> to X<sub>5</sub> are independent variables, which have an impact on personality acting as independent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484837">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0258042X13484837">Goldberg, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>The conclusive design was applied in this study to analyze the impact of the antecedents of personality on faculty members’ turnover intention. Non-probabilistic convenience sampling method was adopted for data collection. The data was collected after formulation of structured questionnaire with the help of research instrument generated. The questions were asked on seven-point Likert scale from the respondents. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, that is, turnover intention, the antecedents of personality and respondents’ demographic characteristics. It was distributed online to 1000 faculty members of India. The country was divided into five zones, viz. East, West, North, South and Central, targeting sample size of 200 from each zone of India. The response rate was 26 per cent (n = 261 [‘n’ stands for sample size of the study]). The data were collected from faculty members of all cadres, viz. assistant professors, associate professors and professors.</p>

The result of factor analysis shows that Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub> and Z<sub>3</sub> items of turnover intention are loaded under third component with high loading values of 0.842, 0.921 and 0.875. X<sub>11</sub>, X<sub>12</sub>, X<sub>21</sub> and X<sub>22</sub> items of both extraversion and agreeableness are loaded under first component, so all the four items can be merged to a single item X, moreover the trait characteristics are also similar. X<sub>31</sub> and X<sub>32</sub> items of conscientiousness are loaded under second component with high loadings of 0.792 and 0.830. X<sub>41</sub>, X<sub>42</sub>, X<sub>51</sub> and X<sub>52</sub> items of neuroticism and openness to experience will not be considered for further analysis due to scattered loadings. Therefore, after factor analysis, turnover intention (Z) will be considered as dependent variable whereas four items of both extraversion (X<sub>1</sub>) and agreeableness (X<sub>2</sub>) are considered as single antecedent X and two items (X<sub>31</sub> and X<sub>32</sub>) of conscientiousness (X<sub>3</sub>) are considered as independent variables for further multivariate analysis. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha to determine the scale’s internal consistency, that is, reliability of instrument, was measured for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and turnover intention, which are loaded properly and considered for analysis after validity test, and are also internally consistent as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0258042X13484837">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Interpretation</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 17) was used to facilitate analysis. The psychometric properties of the instrument were analyzed using principal component analysis with varimax rotation to determine construct validity and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha to determine the scale’s internal consistency reliability. Finally, the regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of five antecedents of personality on turnover intention. The value of R Square is 0.748, that is, 74.8 per cent, which reveals that data collected is reliable as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0258042X13484837">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Among all the three antecedents of personality, that is, extraversion (X<sub>1</sub>), agreeableness (X<sub>2</sub>) and conscientiousness (X<sub>3</sub>), two antecedents, viz. extraversion (X<sub>1</sub>) and agreeableness (X<sub>2</sub>) have significant impact on turnover intention with <italic>p</italic> values of 0.001 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0258042X13484837">Table 5</xref>. Therefore research hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> is accepted whereas alternate hypothesis is accepted for other three antecedents, viz. conscientiousness (X<sub>3</sub>), neuroticism (X<sub>4</sub>) and openness to experience (X<sub>5</sub>), that is, H<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>5</sub> are rejected.</p>
<p>The beta coefficients for significant antecedents of personality, that is, extraversion (X<sub>1</sub>) and agreeableness (X<sub>2</sub>) are –0.409 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0258042X13484837">Figure 2</xref>. The negative sign indicates the inverse relationships between personality and turnover intention among faculty members. Therefore, if extraversion and agreeableness trait of personality of faculty members increases, the turnover intention will decrease, where major contribution in enhancing the personality will be of extraversion and agreeableness trait of faculty members.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The study set out to develop a theory-driven multidimensional measure of individual personality and then its impact on turnover intention of faculty members of technical educational institutes of India. The result of this empirical investigation supports the studies of Salgado (2002) and Zimmerman (2008), that individual personality has a significant impact on turnover intention of faculty members.</p>
<p>The study also revels the result in line with the studies of Salgado (2002) and Zimmerman (2008), that extraversion and agreeableness are the antecedents of personality, which has an inverse significant impact on turnover intention, that is, if faculty members have quality of general sociability and display traits such as human contacts, attention, active participation and assertiveness (extraversion trait) and if they are friendly, courteous, altruistic, helpful and they attempt to compromise their personal interests with others (agreeableness trait), then it is less likely for the them to quit the institute.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0258042X13484837">
<title>Suggestions</title>
<p>In this competitive world, technical educational institutes require satisfied and committed faculty members to generate value for the institution. The result of this study was in the hypothesized directions in which faculty members with good extent of extraversion and agreeableness trait are less indented to leave the institute. This relationship was in line with previous findings reported and thus this study managed to validate the results obtained by past researchers.</p>
<p>Extraversion is a trait characterized by interest in other people, and trusting them. It is seen as a positive quality since it concerns the general sociability and includes traits such as human contacts, attention, active participation and assertiveness. Agreeableness measures how able individuals are to get along with others. Agreeable individuals are generally decent and cheerful and therefore tend to be more involved in their tasks. They are friendly, courteous, altruistic, helpful and they attempt to compromise their personal interests with others.</p>
<p>Therefore, management of the educational institutes needs to formulate strategies enhancing the positive climate of being social, making more friends and spending more time in social situations. Management should motivate their faculty members to behave in a more friendly, courteous and helpful manner, and have pleasant and satisfying relationships with others.</p>

<sec id="section15-0258042X13484837">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>This study has three main potential limitations of its findings. First, the study relied on the self-reported questionnaire to collect data on all indicators. To overcome this limitation, future research needs to be based more on objective measures. Second limitation is the dearth of current literature in the area of personality traits in relation to turnover intention in educational settings.</p>
<p>The third major limitation of this study is the population factor. Only faculty members of technical educational institutes of India were used, leaving out students and non-academic staff. This poses a threat to generalizability of the study in relation to prediction of personality traits in Indian technical institutes—the study may not be generalized for the entire academic community. It is not certain that similar results would be obtained when a study is conducted using all the subgroups (academic, non-academic and students) for analyzing the impact of personality on faculty’s decision to quit the institute.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Employees are assets to an organization who can actually make all the difference as far as a firm’s competitive edge is concerned. Employee turnover to some extent is desirable and accepted as it brings about a constructive change in the organization. However, too many employees intending to leave the organization is undesirable. Voluntary quitting of performers is dysfunctional turnover which the firms always want to stop. Intentions reveal a lot about an individual’s perception, judgment and behaviour. Studies show that turnover intentions precede the actual turnover behaviour of employees. If the organizations want to reduce turnover, then it is imperative for them to understand the factors which trigger turnover intentions or quitting intentions in employees.</p>
<p>In this review paper, various personality traits contributing to faculty’s turnover intentions have been analyzed. Whereas no single factor can be attributed to turnover intentions, it is advisable to take a holistic approach towards handling employee turnover issue in any organization. None of the factors can influence turnover intentions in isolation. Hence remedial measure should also have a composite framework.</p>
<p>Despite the above-mentioned limitations, this study provides greater understanding of the influence of personality traits on the intent to leave.</p>
