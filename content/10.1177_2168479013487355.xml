Several proposals have been advanced to devise a more flexible, sustainable approach to pharmaceutical development and licensing, aimed at providing timely patient access to new products and ensuring product safety and effectiveness while maintaining and restoring public trust in the industry and government regulatory agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013487355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013487355"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013487355">9</xref></sup> One proposal, adaptive licensing, is characterized as “an acknowledgement that evidence development is a continuum—regulatory approval would come in stages. Market access and use in practice would be restricted in a manner commensurate with the current level of knowledge, and evidence development would continue in parallel with marketing, using evidence from clinical practice as well as randomized trials.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013487355">10</xref></sup></p><p>Despite a consensus that global reform is needed, there is general agreement that several potential roadblocks and various practical issues must be addressed before adaptive licensing will be broadly adopted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013487355">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013487355">10</xref></sup> Two issues are invariably raised. First, given the inherent complexities and interdependencies of the adaptive licensing approaches and the absence of real-world evidence on outcomes, the more gradual and restricted entry to market envisioned with these approaches may reduce return on investment for pharmaceutical developers and may become a deterrent to industry adoption. In addition, the tangible benefits of the new pathway, such as early access and a more thorough understanding of the medicinal product, must outweigh the potential harms and greater level of uncertainty at the time of a product’s initial authorization. This latter consideration will critically affect whether all health care stakeholders are willing to adopt the use of medicinal products developed and licensed using the new paradigm.</p><p>We attempt to address these issues using a simulation tool to analyze the effects of various modeled adaptive licensing scenarios, comparing the advantages and disadvantages across various stakeholder groups—the pharmaceutical developer, regulators, patients, and prescribers. The potential advantages and disadvantages for public and private payers are not addressed in this work.</p><p>We consider 3 case studies: an oncology drug, an oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, and an anti-obesity drug. Each has a base case scenario, that is, the actual or modeled “traditional” development pathway and 1 or more adaptive scenarios. Outcomes from each adaptive scenario are compared with the base case for a given case study on the basis of its “adaptiveness” and relative stakeholder metrics. Metrics included are net present value (NPV) and expected NPV (eNPV), to assess outcomes from the perspective of the pharmaceutical developer, and “appropriately treated patients” (a surrogate for quality-adjusted life-years) and “patient access years” to assess outcomes from the perspective of regulators, patients, and prescribers.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013487355" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Each scenario used a discounted cash flow Excel spreadsheet developed by one of the authors (M.R.T.).

The inputs for one of the case studies are provided in Supplementary Figure S1, available online. The spreadsheet for the same case study is presented in Supplementary Table S1.</p><p>In addition to the economic model, an adaptiveness scoring algorithm was developed to compare base case and adaptive development approaches. An optimal adaptive approach is presumed to vary depending on the specifics of the particular medicinal product (ie, therapeutic area, drug class, availability of biomarkers, etc). The adaptive elements that were included in the scoring system were those that were expected to expedite access to patients with superior benefit/risk characteristics, control the appropriateness of usage, and contribute to continuous learning about the product. The one extreme of the adaptiveness continuum would be the “all or none” patient access that occurs at a binary, single moment of licensure signaling the end of active learning and transition to more passive learning in the postmarketing period. At the other extreme of the continuum is a flexible future approach based on continuous, rapid learning defined by early patient access, well-controlled appropriate usage with balanced risk sharing across stakeholder groups at the time of initial authorization, and balanced cost/time sharing of postauthorization monitoring and controls. Existing narrowly applied regulatory processes, such as accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization, would fall somewhere between the extremes. The scoring algorithm allows the rank ordering of the adaptiveness of various scenarios, with the total adaptiveness score for each scenario being the summation of the input elements and output requirements/effects. The adaptiveness scoring system is a directional, semiquantitative framework for broad characterization of the multiple forms of adaptive license. Binary scores of 0 or 1 were selected to emphasize distinctions and reflect the coarse precision of the current approach. With refined methods and data collection, each element might be converted to a continuous score to better reflect nuances with each element and among scenarios. The score is simply derived by assigning 1 for each adaptive element that is present or 0 when it is missing. Adaptiveness scoring details for each scenario are provided in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2168479013487355"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2168479013487355">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2168479013487355">2</xref> summarize the development scenarios compared for each case study and the modeled stakeholder metrics, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2168479013487355" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Description of case studies and development and licensing scenarios used in the research.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-2168479013487355" xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013487355-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th>Case Study (Manufacturer), Scenario No.</th><th>Therapeutic Area (Disease/Condition)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zelboraf (Roche)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Scenario 1</td><td>Oncology (melanoma)</td><td>Traditional (modeled after original agreement with FDA)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 2</td><td/><td>Actual (Fast Track, priority review, orphan designation)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 3</td><td/><td>Adaptive (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td>Gilenya (Novartis)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Scenario 1</td><td>Neurology (multiple sclerosis)</td><td>Actual (including postmarketing commitment for observational study, REMS, and enhanced safety monitoring instituted 1.5 years post marketing due to safety signal)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 2</td><td/><td>Staged adaptive (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia (Sanofi)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Scenario 1</td><td>Metabolic (obesity)</td><td>Actual (with license withdrawal after 2 years)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 2</td><td/><td>Adaptive due to closely managed postmarketing utilization, surveillance, and scheduled reassessments that were relaxed after first review (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 3</td><td/><td>Adaptive due to closely managed postmarketing utilization, surveillance, and scheduled reassessments that were maintained after review (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 4</td><td/><td>Adaptive due to closely managed postmarketing utilization, surveillance, and scheduled reassessments but controls ineffective (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 5</td><td/><td>Staged, controlled adaptive (modeled)</td></tr><tr><td> Scenario 6</td><td/><td>Restricted adaptive with closely managed postmarketing utilization, surveillance, and scheduled reassessments (modeled)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2-2168479013487355" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Summary of stakeholder metrics by scenario.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table2-2168479013487355" xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013487355-table2.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th>Case Study, Scenario No.</th><th>NPV, US$<sup>a</sup></th><th>eNPV, US$<sup>a</sup></th><th>Change in Adaptiveness Score From Base Case</th><th>Change in Patient Access Years Over Product Life</th><th>Appropriately Treated Patients<sup>b</sup></th><th>Inappropriately Treated Patients</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zelboraf, Scenario 1</td><td>$133M</td><td>$23M</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>Zelboraf, Scenario 2</td><td>$225M</td><td>$34M</td><td>5</td><td>9100</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>Zelboraf, Scenario 3</td><td>$208M</td><td>$30M</td><td>10</td><td>9100</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>Gilenya, Scenario 1</td><td>$633M</td><td>$127M</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>Gilenya, Scenario 2</td><td>$869M</td><td>$169M</td><td>12</td><td>41,000</td><td>ND</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 1</td><td>($106M)</td><td>($73M)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>0.45M</td><td>0.9M</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 2</td><td>$138M</td><td>($18M)</td><td>13</td><td>9.2M</td><td>10.5M</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 3</td><td>$25M</td><td>($43M)</td><td>13</td><td>11.5M</td><td>11.2M</td><td>1.7M</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 4</td><td>($75M)</td><td>($66M)</td><td>9</td><td>4.8M</td><td>4.4M</td><td>1.7M</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 5</td><td>$295M</td><td>($16M)</td><td>16</td><td>10.1M</td><td>11.4M</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Acomplia, Scenario 6</td><td>($161M)</td><td>($84M)</td><td>12</td><td>ND</td><td>1.0M</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-2168479013487355"><p>Abbreviations: eNPV, estimated net present value;

It was selected as a case study because its actual development pathway was highly “adaptive” and was agreed upon by the regulator and the sponsor midway during development. This allowed us to use an adaptive approach that was factual and model a “traditional” pathway. A third scenario was modeled to illustrate an even more adaptive approach than the factual.</p><p>In Scenario 1 (traditional), approximately 850 patients are enrolled in 3 clinical trials leading to a full approval 7.5 years from the initiation of a Phase 1 trial. The submission of final safety results from the single Phase 3 study is a postmarketing commitment.</p><p>In Scenario 2 (actual), FDA accepts the new drug application for priority review and grants Fast Track designation on the basis of Phase 1 and 2 results, which show very significant improvement compared with existing treatments. Full (not accelerated) approval for this product is obtained after 4.5 years and is based on complete data from approximately 164 patients from Phase 1 and 2 trials and partial data on a subset of 675 additional patients in the Phase 3 trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013487355">12</xref></sup> An expanded access program is established at FDA’s request to treat new patients between the completion of Phase 3 enrollment and approval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013487355">12</xref></sup> Postmarketing commitments include the submission of safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 trial and the establishment of a communication plan for patients and prescribers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479013487355">13</xref></sup></p><p>Scenario 3 (fully adaptive) is identical to the actual scenario up to time of initial authorization, although the development plan is prospectively planned rather than serendipitous as in Scenario 2. The initial authorization occurs in 4.5 years. Data, including final safety analysis and overall survival results, are submitted for full authorization after 7.5 years of clinical development. The continuous collection of data in Scenario 3 leads to increased regulator and payer confidence that new data will be available for prospectively scheduled reassessments. In addition, there is a progressive reduction of uncertainty across the product life and the timely communication of the resulting information.</p><p>A 6-year simple linear clinical dissemination is assumed after approval and initial authorization, resulting in peak usage in 40% of 11,400 eligible patients at a drug cost of US$56,000 per patient year.

The initial authorization is based on data from approximately 1100 patients; full authorization, approximately 2.5 years later, is based on data from the remaining 1800 patients. As a result, the label is expanded to allow treatment of patients with MS of any severity. Between initial and full authorizations, subjects are followed in a patient registry to collect safety and efficacy data in clinical practice. Monitoring and controls after the initial authorization consist of scheduled periodic benefit/risk assessments, REMS-restricted prescriber/facility access to control off-label use, and a REMS-imposed communication plan.

The adaptive modifications are designed to manage postmarketing outcomes and use patterns and include enhanced postmarketing surveillance of efficacy and safety with planned periodic (3 and 6 years post approval) regulatory reassessments, patient support (educational information and direct communication of new and emerging product information with patients and prescribers), and access control elements (strict control of off-label use, monitoring for patient adherence, and access restriction to qualified prescribers and/or facilities). In these scenarios, the product is not withdrawn from the EU market, and an approval is obtained in the US 2 years following EU approval.</p><p>All 3 scenarios are identical for the first 3 years post approval. In each, controls are relaxed at the first reassessment due to a positive benefit/risk profile and appropriate patient and prescriber utilization. Over the next 3 years, the scenarios diverge. In Scenario 2 (controlled, relaxed) appropriate utilization is maintained, unlike in Scenarios 3 (controlled, maintained) and 4 (controlled, withdrawn). At the 6-year review, Scenarios 3 and 4 diverge: Controls are reinstituted in Scenario 3 while the EU license is withdrawn in Scenario 4. In this scenario, the US license is withdrawn 6 months later.</p><p>Scenarios 2, 3, and 4 result in considerably more appropriately treated patients (10.5 million, 11.2 million, and 4.4 million, respectively), defined as those treated according to the label, compared with the less than one half million (0.45 million) in Scenario 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2168479013487355">Figure 3</xref>, B-D). In contrast, the number of inappropriately patients is 0.9 million in Scenario 1, zero in Scenario 2, and 1.7 million in both Scenarios 3 and 4.</p><p>If costs of enhanced surveillance and periodic reassessment, patient support, and access control are kept low (US$200 per patient per year), the pharmaceutical developer can absorb the cost and obtain an improved lifetime NPV increase ranging from 30% (Scenario 4) to 230% (Scenario 2). However, if the postapproval costs are initially high ($2000 per patient year) but fall to $200 per patient year with time, and low patient adherence occurs, then the NPVs of all scenarios fall below that of the actual case (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="section9-2168479013487355"><title>Staged Adaptive, Controlled Approach for Acomplia</title><p>Scenario 5 (fully adaptive) models serial authorizations at 6, 8.5, and 9.5 years of development. In this scenario, the indication is progressively expanded from the treatment of obese or overweight patients with treated Type 2 diabetes to the treatment of overweight and obese patients with treated Type 2 diabetes or treated dyslipidemia, and then to the treatment of obese or overweight patients with treated Type 2 diabetes or treated dyslipidemia or obese patients without cardiac risk factors. Patients with psychiatric conditions are excluded from clinical trials and from access to the marketed drug. The initial authorization is based on data from approximately 2200 patients, the second authorization on approximately 1000 additional patients as well as patients enrolled in a registry, and full authorization on approximately 1000 additional patients as well as patients enrolled in the registry. The postmarketing monitoring and control elements are identical to Scenarios 2 through 4 except that post–initial authorization data reviews occur as part of the second and full authorizations rather than as periodic reassessments.</p><p> The effects on patient treatment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2168479013487355">Figure 4</xref>. Due to monitoring and access controls, 11.4 million eligible patients receive appropriate treatment over the modeled life with no inappropriate usage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2168479013487355">Table 2</xref>). The sponsor’s NPV increases by 376% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2168479013487355">Table 2</xref>), the most favorable of the Acomplia scenarios. The NPV increase is driven less by an increase in treated patients and more by the lower development costs and shorter development time incurred before initial revenues (US$64 million in development costs over 5 years vs US$189 million over 7.5 years) are realized.</p><fig id="fig4-2168479013487355" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Acomplia patients treated (Scenario 5).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013487355-fig4.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section10-2168479013487355"><title>Restricted Adaptive Controlled Approach for Acomplia</title><p>In Scenario 6 (restricted adaptive), Acomplia is initially authorized for the treatment of obese or overweight patients with treated Type 2 diabetes. However, the pharmaceutical developer decides not to expand beyond that subpopulation. The initial authorization is based on data from 2200 patients, while full authorization is based on a confirmatory study in 600 additional obese or overweight patients with treated type 2 diabetes. The post–initial authorization monitoring and control elements are identical to Scenario 5. This scenario results in an extremely unfavorable NPV of –US$161 million (50% worse than the actual scenario) due to the restricted distribution and the cost of postauthorization controls. In this scenario, the license is withdrawn by the pharmaceutical developer, patients and prescribers lose access to the drug, and public health confidence in the health care delivery and regulatory systems is lost.</p></sec><sec id="section11-2168479013487355"><title>Impact of Adaptive Development Approaches</title><p>From a stakeholder perspective, the 3 case studies suggest that a fully staged adaptive approach or the addition of adaptive control elements may result in certain advantages, including earlier patient access, greater assurance in the progressive reduction of uncertainty across the product life, greater confidence that the benefits and harms at any time are understood and can be acted upon, and mitigation of inappropriate use in patients and/or prescribers. The model suggests that in many, but not all cases, increased adaptiveness leads to better outcomes for patients, prescribers, regulators, and pharmaceutical developers. However, the costs of surveillance, access control, and patient support may overwhelm stakeholders’ potential advantages.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2168479013487355">Figure 5</xref> portrays the results of the economic analysis plotted as the change in NPV versus the change in total adaptiveness score. The base case for each case study is set at the origin while each adaptive scenario is plotted as the terminal vector change. For example, the best Acomplia scenario (Scenario 5) is the vector increasing the sponsor NPV by 376% and an increased total adaptiveness score compared with the base case of 16 points.</p><fig id="fig5-2168479013487355" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Change in adaptiveness score.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013487355-fig5.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the economics for the pharmaceutical developer of an adaptive approach, we conclude the following. Higher scoring adaptive licensing scenarios generally lead to greater levels of appropriately treated patients and increased sponsor financial returns. However, if patient access control, surveillance, and support costs are high, products with lower revenue per patient (eg, Acomplia) may experience negative financial impacts even though more patients may be appropriately treated.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section12-2168479013487355"><title>Discussion</title><p>We quantitatively evaluated stakeholder metrics of adaptive licensing to inform possible future regulatory policy changes by conducting simulations of real-world, retrospective case studies, comparing outcomes of conventional development and adaptive approaches on public health measures and sponsor NPVs. Results generally support the conclusion that adaptive licensing may yield favorable outcomes for both public health and the sponsor. The Zelboraf scenarios demonstrate the value to the pharmaceutical developer and regulators of using currently available regulatory procedures in an adaptive way to accelerate patient access to life-extending treatments with appropriate oversight by regulators. As seen with this case study, some products are already approved using adaptive approaches and elements. Therefore, the adoption of adaptive approaches more broadly in the future should be viewed as evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes to existing policies.</p><p>The Gilenya scenarios demonstrate that an adaptive approach can both reduce the number of patients exposed to an early safety signal and simultaneously increase the number of patient years of treatment during its exclusivity period. The Acomplia scenarios demonstrate that postmarketing controls can have both positive (significantly increase in the number of appropriately treated patients) and negative (market withdrawal) consequences.</p><p>Surprisingly, a licensing pathway accepting a higher level of initial uncertainty may yield positive outcomes on public health in many scenarios. Adaptive licensing should not be solely focused on the marketing authorization process; it requires a “systems approach” for the most beneficial introduction of new medicines to the market. This broader concept encompasses stringent prescribing controls and effective monitoring of treatment experiences post initial authorization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013487355">8</xref></sup>; new methods may be needed to address stakeholder concerns and facilitate broad adoption.</p><p>Increases in NPVs of adaptive approaches are driven primarily by earlier revenue streams, even absent changes to patent life or current market exclusivity provisions. The benefits of exclusivity periods are mitigated by the erosive power of discounting more distant events in NPV calculations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2168479013487355">25</xref></sup> However, the cost of postlicensing monitoring, a critical component of adaptive licensing, may have a decisive impact on whether pharmaceutical developers embrace adaptive licensing, as illustrated by the decrease in NPV in Acomplia Scenario 6. The costs of postlicensing monitoring may be determinative for low-priced drugs rather than, for example, some highly priced oncology or orphan drugs. However, future advances in electronic health records and related remote monitoring may mitigate this concern.</p><p>Several study limitations merit explicit discussion. The analysis of economic value for pharmaceutical developers uses a straightforward discounted cash flow model based on publicly available information. While the factors included could be decomposed into greater detail and the precision of the input assumptions undoubtedly refined, the outcome effects observed appear significantly large that the broad outlines of the core findings appear robust. Replicating the analysis across a broader range of therapeutics and indications would help inform the generality of findings and would likely identify additional conditions under which adaptive licensing may not benefit pharmaceutical developers.</p><p>The analysis of potential health benefits uses changes in appropriately treated patient numbers as a surrogate for health outcomes such as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved. Our analysis could have been expanded to incorporate such metrics, by extrapolation of results from relevant clinical trials and by incorporation, for example, of published QALY weights. However, we believe this would convey an unjustified level of precision of the hypothetical scenarios in our analysis; it would also add questionable value in light of the lack of a universally agreed metric for health benefits.</p><p>We implicitly presumed that patient, provider, and regulator desires and incentives are aligned. Due to lack of access to reimbursement and patient outcomes information, we exclude consideration of payers’ perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2168479013487355"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Even absent payers’ perspectives, this initial analysis suggests that an increasingly adaptive development and licensing environment as proposed by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013487355">8</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013487355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013487355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013487355"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013487355">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013487355">9</xref></sup> may indeed improve outcomes for all key stakeholders, a rare piece of good news in health care policy. Although it is unlikely that public health and/or economic gains for the sponsor from an adaptive development and licensing pathway can be realized in all circumstances, these findings support the initiation of prospective pilot studies of the adaptive licensing concept in order to expand and refine our thinking.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2168479013487355"><p>Supplementary material for this article is available on the journal’s website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tirs.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://tirs.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn2-2168479013487355"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-2168479013487355"><label>Funding</label><p>L.G.B., M.R.T., and G.H. received financial support for this work from MIT’s Center for Biomedical Innovation (CBI) NEWDIGS initiative.
