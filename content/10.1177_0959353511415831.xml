<body>
<p>Although women have increasingly become a large proportion of migrants within and across national borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415831">Ghosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353511415831">Massey et al., 2006</xref>), migration research and policy has largely focused on male migrants or has lacked a gender perspective. This article will argue that the feminization of the migration circuit and the failure on the part of home and host countries’ governments to protect migrants from exploitation and abuse disproportionately places women in an extremely vulnerable situation. Migrant sending countries stand to gain the most from the work and remittances of their emigrants and, as such, should protect the human rights and working and living conditions of their citizens in host countries.</p>
<p>The transnational experience of migrants and immigrants has mostly received attention within the social, economic and political sciences and remains largely overlooked by psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959353511415831">Upegui-Hernández, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959353511415831">2009</xref>). Latin American feminist psychologists are especially well positioned to ask critical psychological questions about how the experiences of immigrant women from Latin America are shaped by gender inequality and the feminization of the migration circuit. Building on the tradition of critical liberation psychology to transform social inequalities within the research process itself by emphasizing collaborative and participatory models of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353511415831">Montero, 2000</xref>), Latin American feminist psychologists should work to eliminate such inequalities and advocate for the need to ensure the rights of women, and all migrants, be recognized and ensured across borders by both sending and receiving countries.</p>
<p>This article highlights migration phenomena that make visible how gender inequality manifests itself within circles of transnational migration. It calls attention to areas of research in transnational migration that will benefit from the work of critical feminist psychologists, especially those from Latin America, such as the commodification of migrant women's social and economic remittances, the existence of violence against women in some migration settings and the continued sexual and labor exploitation of women across borders. The migration literature has focused largely on the experience of immigrant groups as aggregates and as political and economic actors without taking seriously how the experience of migration and transnational life affects and shapes their psychological and social well-being. Although these areas of study have received attention from critical feminist researchers in other disciplines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415831">Diaz and Kuhner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415831">Gold, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353511415831">Goldring, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353511415831">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353511415831">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353511415831">Mohanty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353511415831">Phizacklea, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353511415831">Plá, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353511415831">Sassen, 2002</xref>), the contribution of critical Latin American feminist psychologists who can offer a psychological lens and their experience of working with communities to change their social realities is needed.</p>
<p>The Latin American context has provided a fertile ground for critical feminist psychologists who understand that decolonizing knowledge and the research process itself is essential to the empowerment of Latin American, indigenous, afro-descendent women and oppressed groups. Today's critical feminist psychology has been influenced by their work (e.g. Paulo Freire's <italic>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic> [1970], Orlando Fals-Borda's <italic>Participatory Action Research</italic> [1985], and Ignacio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353511415831">Martín-Baró's <italic>Psicologia de la Liberación</italic> [1990]</xref>) in as much as they have committed themselves to ‘challenge systems of power and redress social injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353511415831">Lykes and Coquillon, 2007</xref>: 320). A Latin American feminist psychology should denounce social injustices and actively promote different paradigms for understanding global migration. De-ideologizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353511415831">Lykes and Moane, 2009</xref>) and de-naturalizing the gendered nature of transnational migration serves as a step towards articulating common interests among women that potentializes opportunities for collective action and social change across borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353511415831">Mohanty, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353511415831">Mohanty's feminist transnational praxis (2003)</xref> points out, the work of Latin American feminist psychologists on issues of transnational migration can contribute to frame common interests among women across borders that can foster empowerment and social action. Following in the tradition of Latin American critical activist psychologists, this article makes a call to research and action by feminist psychologists to understand the psychological experience of Latin American immigrants and their relationships to/with their countries of origin and settlement and how those experiences are marked by gender inequalities that must be acknowledged and remedied.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0959353511415831"><title>Transnational migration and gender</title>
<p>Transnationalism requires that we look at immigrants' lives as a whole, and not only at their lives in the host country. It understands that their past lives in their home countries are also part of their present social and cultural space in their new environments. It asserts that immigrants maintain ties with their home country even as they incorporate into their host country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415831">Basch, Glick-Schiller &amp; Szanton-Blanc, 1994</xref>). Within the frame of transnationalism, work that takes gender seriously as an important part of migration processes has begun to surface. The book <italic>Gender and U.S. Immigration: Contemporary Trends</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353511415831">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 2003</xref>) presents a historical recount of the development of immigration research with a gendered lens that compares the appearance of women, sex and gender as topics in social scientific research. However, psychologists have remained absent from the discussion of international migration and its gendered character, with very few exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353511415831">Espin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353511415831">Mahalingam, Balan &amp; Haritatos, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353511415831">Hondagneu-Sotelo (2003)</xref> argues that the relationship between gender and migration research has evolved in three stages. A first stage focused on remedying the exclusion of women in research. For example, pioneering research by Saskia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353511415831">Sassen (1984)</xref> explored how the relationship between changes in national and international labor markets affected women's migration from rural areas to urban cities and how this internal migration related to an increase in women's international migration. A second stage was marked by efforts to move beyond a Women and Migration focus to a Gender and Migration framework (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353511415831">Grasmuck and Pessar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353511415831">Kibria, 1993</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353511415831">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994</xref>), which examines gender as a social construct and how it operates as set of dynamics and processes that reinforce gender inequalities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353511415831">Grasmuck and Pessar's (1991)</xref> book represented an effort to understand how Dominican migration extended beyond one single generation and created the conditions for circular migration. In the process, they analyzed the role of women in these circuits of migration. A third stage embraces gender itself as a constitutive element of migration and highlights the role of transnational connections in the experience of gendered migration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415831">Gold, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353511415831">Goldring, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353511415831">Jones-Correa, 1998</xref>). For example, Sarah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353511415831">Mahler (2001)</xref> explores Central American migration, more specifically Salvadorian, and portrays the precarious situation in which wives of male immigrant Salvadorian workers found themselves upon their husbands’ emigration. Despite this research, the fact remains that studies about the intersection of immigration and gender are relatively scarce and continue to be done mostly by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959353511415831">Pessar and Mahler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353511415831">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Latin American feminists and psychologists have not been prominent in this limited but growing field of gendered migration research. Other social scientists have described the many ways in which transnational expectations of migrant women to raise their own children from a distance add to the already difficult reality of living away from their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353511415831">Salazar Parreñas, 2006</xref>). Anthropologist Patricia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353511415831">Pessar (2006)</xref> demonstrates how refugee woman are affected by gender discourses in their places of origin which they bring with them as they flee. Refugee camps represent for Pessar a space where women can begin to develop a feminist consciousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353511415831">Parella (2007)</xref> explores how Ecuadorian and Peruvian families become ‘transnational families’ and how the childrearing obligations get redistributed within extended family networks when parents migrate.</p>
<p>Recent political trends among receiving nations in Europe, the United States and Canada have criminalized undocumented migration and intensified the detention and deportation of undocumented/documented immigrants. Such political changes greatly affect Latin American sending countries where researchers are finally beginning to pay attention to the struggles and realities of an often overlooked but important part of its labor force, emigrants. Immigrant women are increasingly caught in the global labor market which reproduces many of the inequities they have grown used to in their home countries. Unfortunately as immigrants cross borders, many times undocumented, they are often not afforded the protection of their human and civil rights by sending or receiving countries.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is important for Latin American feminist psychologists to become engaged with the realities of gendered migration and contribute to the transnational migration discourse by asking critical psychological questions about the experiences and processes affecting immigrants, non-migrants and migrant workers in both sending and receiving countries. The limited input by psychologists in migration discourses has mostly centered on the experiences of national groups and generations; they have less to say about the experience of individuals and how their interpersonal relationships are affected. The following sections highlight two areas of immigrants’ lives that are in need of analysis from a Latin American, feminist and psychological analysis that illuminates and challenges social injustices and gender inequalities in the lives of immigrants that are reproduced in transnational migration circuits.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0959353511415831"><title>Remittances</title>
<p>Although there is debate among researchers about whether the feminization of migration flows is a new or old phenomenon, several studies demonstrate that it is a reality for some nationalities, occupations and sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353511415831">Oso and Garson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353511415831">Phizacklea, 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353511415831">Oso and Garson (2005)</xref>, the percentage of women who migrate to North America (Mexico, United States and Canada) from Latin American countries is one of the largest when compared to other immigrant groups. At the same time, a growing number of Latin American countries have recognized the importance of monetary remittances from citizens who emigrated to find work and send money to their families in their home country. Many of these countries now rely on remittances to cover large portions of their countries’ income. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353511415831">Escobar (2007)</xref>, the Inter-American Bank estimates that in 2006 migrants sent at least US$45 billion to their Latin American countries of origin in the form of remittances. Economists point out that the importance of remittances rests in the fact that they appear to remain constant and reliable despite changes in economic and market trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353511415831">Ratha, 2007</xref>). However, the current growing economic crisis has caused a decrease of monetary remittances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353511415831">Papademetriou, Sumption, Terrazas et al., 2010</xref>) which challenges the commonly held belief among economist and development researchers that remittances were a market-proof source of income for sending countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353511415831">Ratha, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353511415831">Terrazas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the migration literature, remittances and their impact on economic development have become the issue to study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353511415831">Robert and Lopez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353511415831">Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353511415831">Yepes, 2008</xref>). Many immigrants have organized so called Hometown Associations in order to remain connected to their home country, create a space where they can socialize with other migrants from their towns and cities of origin and contribute material support to their hometown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353511415831">Smith, 2006</xref>). Migrants’ efforts to participate in the social and structural development of their hometowns in their countries of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353511415831">Smith, 2006</xref>) through migrant hometown associations have attracted research interest. Initially these small development projects, such as the construction of a water pump in a town, were carried out with monies sent by migrants to their families and to non-governmental organizations that could carry out the logistics of the projects. Soon governments began capitalizing on these efforts in different ways. For example, Mexico offered to match funds sent by migrants for development projects. What began as a bottom-up effort to improve their communities has been co-opted by states’ desires to capitalize on the remittances of their emigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353511415831">Smith, 2006</xref>). They have done so by facilitating money transfers and devising new ventures that capture additional revenue from migrant workers, like real estate fairs that sell apartments and houses in the home country to the migrant workers for those family members who stay behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959353511415831">Yepes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353511415831">Sassen (2002)</xref> used the term ‘feminization of survival’ to refer to the connection between the feminization of migration, the labor market and the dependence of governments on women's earnings for revenue and development. Her critique evidences the inequality in the relationship of sending states and their emigrants. Although governments increasingly depend on (documented and undocumented) migrants’ remittances, sending states have not reciprocated by ensuring the protection of rights for their emigrants. Most sending states have done little, if anything at all, to ensure the protection of their citizens’ human and social rights as they reside and work in host countries. Nor have they seriously committed to fulfilling the social and political needs of their citizens living abroad, such as access to legal representation, health care and education while abroad. This trend affects women disproportionately as they have been identified as being more reliable remitters than men: women send money more regularly and for longer periods of time than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959353511415831">Robert and López, 2008</xref>). For this reason, government organizations have increasingly focused on understanding and developing efforts to enable immigrant women to continue sending remittances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415831">Ghosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959353511415831">Ratha, 2007</xref>). This practice unfairly places an added burden of state development, through the channeling of remittances and other migrant's investments into their home country economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959353511415831">Terrazas 2010</xref>), on women who are already barely able to support their families. In fact, it reproduces an unequal distribution of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353511415831">Plá, 2009</xref>), whereby women are expected to be breadwinners for their families in their countries of origin and provide emotional support and work from a distance (i.e. continue to be responsible and care for the emotional and social well-being of their children and parents who reside in their home country), as well as to indirectly support the economic development of their countries through the channeling of their remittances.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0959353511415831"><title>Violence against women, sexual and labor exploitation</title>
<p>Unfortunately, the kinds of jobs available in host countries to the growing number of migrant women are jobs that remain poorly enforced, unregulated or illegal, such as childcare, domestic and sex work among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415831">Ghosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353511415831">Salazar-Parreñas, 2006</xref>). These are likely employment options for undocumented migrant women because they can remain hidden from state officials. The need to stay under the radar is exactly what makes undocumented women in such jobs especially vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. The combination of the lack of regulation in some service industry jobs, continued criminalization of undocumented migration and increased enforcement of border restrictions create a vacuum in the rule of law that victimizes women by rendering them marketable goods devoid of human or social rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415831">Ghosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959353511415831">Mai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353511415831">Plá, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353511415831">Salazar-Parreñas 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with an increase in the migration of Latin American women to the United States and Spain, there has been an increase in poverty levels, domestic violence, rape and femicide in the sending countries (defined as ‘women-killing’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353511415831">Staud and Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415831">Hita and Gledhill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353511415831">Sanford, 2008</xref>). As a result, many women find themselves without other options but to migrate to the North (Mexico, United States, Canada). A case that has received growing attention and criticism for the inaction of local authorities is the increasing numbers of women murdered, raped and mutilated in Ciudad de Juarez, Mexico. The majority of the murdered women are young migrants that worked in <italic>maquiladoras</italic><sup>1</sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353511415831"/>close to the Mexico-United States border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353511415831">Badilla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353511415831">Staud and Campbell, 2008</xref>). These femicides have been directly linked to the globalization of markets and free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and to displacement of the labor force pushed to the North of Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353511415831">Badilla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353511415831">Staud and Campbell, 2008</xref>). More than half of the population in Ciudad de Juarez is comprised of temporary residents on their way to the United States or from the South of Mexico who came looking for work in the many <italic>maquiladoras</italic> that emerged in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353511415831">Badilla, 2008</xref>). These femicides serve to control women's behavior and solidify sexist and patriarchal gender relations by punishing those who do not follow them. Some catholic priests have gone as far as to say that the women are at fault for wearing provocative attires and behaving inappropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353511415831">Gomez and Gutierrez, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Violence against women does not restrict itself to the Mexico–United States border. The Mexican border police patrols and stops undocumented immigrants from Central America as they make their way to the United States. Migrant women are at the mercy of people they encounter and have become victims of despicable crimes on this journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353511415831">Nazario, 2006</xref>). As a result, these undocumented immigrants, especially women and children, experience more difficult circumstances and dangers in order to evade authorities and make it to the Mexico–United States border. As is the case with any illicit and prohibited market, opportunities for exploitation, abuse (physical and sexual) and violence are rampant.</p>
<p>Once migrants arrive in the country where they plan to work, they are also likely to encounter exploitation and abuse. According to a recent report, the policy of detaining migrants has become widespread among traditional receiving countries in the North (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415831">Diaz and Kuhner, 2008</xref>). As recently as June 2008, the European Union voted to begin detaining undocumented immigrants in detention centers, already common practice in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353511415831"><italic>BBC Mundo</italic>, 2008</xref>). US detention centers have been consistently criticized for deplorable physical conditions, lack of medical and mental health treatment, access to due process, violation of basic civil and human rights of detainees and physical and sexual abuse of women and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415831">Diaz and Kuhner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353511415831"><italic>FoxNews</italic>, 2007</xref>). An even more disturbing aspect of these detention centers is the growing practice of detaining entire families, including small children, for indefinite periods of time as a way to avoid separating children from their parents.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0959353511415831" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Sending state governments benefit greatly from the migration (documented and undocumented) of their citizens yet fail to protect the human and social rights of those same citizens. Given the feminization of the migration circuit, this failure on the part of home and host country governments to protect migrants from exploitation and abuse disproportionately places women in an extremely vulnerable situation. Migrant sending countries stand to gain most from the work and remittances of their emigrants. We must hold them accountable for the protection of the human rights and working and living conditions of their emigrants wherever they reside.</p>
<p>It is clear that migration represents a difficult choice for migrant women. It can be a source of trauma, loss and violence for some and/or a source of happiness, excitement and opportunity for others. Most of the research on these issues has been carried out by researchers from other disciplines or by European and North American psychologists. Latin American feminist psychologists must engage with the many ways in which transnational migration disproportionately affects women, their gender roles and gendered ideologies, both in their sending and receiving societies, through critical, collaborative and participatory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353511415831">Lykes and Moane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353511415831">Montero, 2000</xref>) that seek to create research relationships based on human dignity, safety and inclusiveness. A feminist psychology of Latin America should become more involved in denunciating these social injustices and actively promoting different paradigms for understanding global and transnational migration, i.e. the Migration Without Borders presented by the Global Commission on Global Migration which supports the free movement of people across national borders. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353511415831">Pécoud and de Guchteneire, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Documenting the role of global capital on transnational migration through the lens of gender can also uncover the capacity for resistance, solidarity and collective action of women across borders. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959353511415831">Mohanty (2003</xref>: 143) puts it:<disp-quote>
<p>Making Third World [migrant] women workers visible in this gender, race, class formation involves engaging a capitalist script of subordination and exploitation. But it also leads to thinking about the possibilities of emancipatory action on the basis of the reconceptualization of Third World [migrant] women as agents rather than victims.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>That space of possibility necessitates a reconsideration of the role of psychologists that does not end with theorizing about social injustices. It calls for psychologists to go beyond theory and embrace its praxis, to understand the social as political and even to join in social-political struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353511415831">Fine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959353511415831">Martín Baró, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353511415831">Montero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353511415831">Lykes and Coquillon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353511415831">Lykes and Moane, 2009</xref>). ‘New’ or ‘non-traditional’ methods in psychology, such as photo voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353511415831">Bacon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959353511415831">Vila and Vila, 2005</xref>), documentaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959353511415831">Portillo, 2001</xref>), participatory action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959353511415831">Women of PhotoVoice/ADMI and Lykes, 2000</xref>), memoirs, journalistic novels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353511415831">Nazario, 2006</xref>), provide alternatives for serving the needs of participants and documenting their struggles in ways that traditional research methodology does not. As we work to create spaces of possibility and agency, we should continue to explore with methods that can potentiate the capacity for marginalized groups to organize around collective efforts and to exercise agency over their life circumstances.</p></sec>
