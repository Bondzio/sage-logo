<p>An 18-month-old male with no significant past medical history was referred for evaluation of vomiting. In infancy, he fed well on a cow’s milk formula without emesis or feeding difficulties. He transitioned to pureed foods at 11 months and then was tolerating a diet of small diced table foods prior to presentation. Approximately 6 weeks prior to evaluation, he began having forceful emesis of undigested food up to 9 days after eating it. On questioning, his mother reported that several months prior he began having frequent burps and would stick his fingers into his mouth to induce vomiting. There was no history of abdominal distension and he was passing soft stools up to 4 times daily. Growth parameters were at 63% for weight and 88% for length.</p>
<p>He was referred for an upper gastrointestinal study, which demonstrated contrast holdup within a dilated duodenal bulb without subsequent transit compatible with obstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811430526">Figure 1</xref>). Because of concern over a recent fall, a computed tomography scan was performed to rule out a duodenal hematoma. The scan revealed a partial duodenal obstruction without malrotation. Esophagoduodenoscopy showed a stenosis at the level of D2 and he was referred for surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811430526">Figure 2</xref>). The decision was made to proceed to surgical resection rather than attempt to endoscopically dilate or resect the web because of technical difficulties. Intraoperatively, a windsock deformity was appreciated at the level of D2, which extended to D4 with the ampulla of Vater draining distal to the web. There was primary closure and the postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged home tolerating feeds without vomiting.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Duodenal atresia and stenosis are the most common causes of gastrointestinal obstruction in the newborn period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430526">1</xref></sup> The incidence has been reported to be between 1:5000 and 1:10,000 live births and more commonly affect males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811430526">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811430526"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811430526">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Duodenal webs are thought to form due to lack of recanalization of the duodenum after the seventh week gestation during embryologic development of the foregut. Three types of duodenal atresia have been classified. The most common, type I, is a mucosal membranous web with an intact muscle wall. This membrane may be classified as a windsock deformity, where the site of origin is proximal to the obstruction. This web usually involves the opening at the ampulla of Vater. The windsock deformity has been explained as a result of stretching of the web because of an incomplete obstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811430526">5</xref></sup> A type II deformity has a short fibrous cord connecting 2 ends of the atretic duodenum, whereas type III is a complete separation with a mesenteric defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430526">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnosis of duodenal atresia can be made prenatally, presenting with polyhydraminos and a dilated duodenum and stomach, or a “double bubble,” on ultrasound. However, stenosis may present later in life when solid foods are introduced. Stenosis commonly presents with vomiting, but failure to thrive may be present. Diagnosis is typically made by contrast gastrointestinal study. However, a sonographic windsock deformity has been described by Yoon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811430526">5</xref></sup> in an infant. Delay in solid presentation may lead to diagnosis in an older child or adult. Typically, presentation involves nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, or gastrointestinal bleeding. A perforation in the web allows for a delayed presentation whereas complete atresia is detected by vomiting shortly after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430526">1</xref></sup> Approximately 10% of cases of duodenal webs are found in association with other congenital anomalies such as trisomy 21, malrotation, congenital heart disease, or annular pancreas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811430526">6</xref></sup> Surgical resection has typically been the mainstay of therapy for webs, but endoscopic resection has become increasingly used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811430526">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we report the case of a toddler presenting with acute onset vomiting 6 months after the introduction of solids subsequently diagnosed with a congenital stenosis of the duodenum. Although growth and development never suggested a chronic etiology for his presentation, our case illustrates that acute onset vomiting of undigested food may be because of a congenital obstruction. Second, our case emphasizes the point that the diagnosis of an anatomic web or stenosis may occur beyond infancy.</p>
