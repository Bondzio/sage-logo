<abstract>
<p>This study sought to examine the effectiveness of a live case methodology for individuals engaged in executive development. In particular, the research examined whether ‘hard’ skills such as strategy could be developed by using a case study approach that is traditionally known for improving transferable or ‘soft’ skills. A three-day live case study was undertaken by 19 participants as part of an executive development programme on strategy. Through completion of both pre and post case study questionnaires, change scores on knowledge and understanding of a range of both ‘hard’ (strategy related) and ‘soft’ (transferable skills) skills and confidence to perform these skills effectively was calculated. The results clearly demonstrated that the use of the live case study was an excellent method for improving knowledge and understanding of strategy. However, the more surprising result was that with middle and senior managers on an executive education programme, the live case study did not significantly improve knowledge, understanding or confidence for transferable skills. The findings are discussed in relation to the current literature on the benefits of live cases, and the specific characteristics of the executive development cohort.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 10–15 years the field of management or executive education has led the way in a paradigm shift within approaches to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611431530">Elam and Spotts, 2004</xref>). This shift has been away from the traditional lecture-based ‘delivery’ of information towards a more student-focused approach, with the student ‘experiencing’ the learning through dialogue with the self and with the facilitator rather than ‘receiving’ the information transmitted by the expert.</p>
<p>Whilst psychologists such as Piaget and Dewey are acknowledged as the founders of experiential learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley, 2000</xref>) it was the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611431530">Kolb (1984)</xref> that placed experiential learning firmly within the realm of education. In fact, until 1980 there was little mention of the term in British educational literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611431530">Mulligan and Griffin, 1992</xref>) and even in the 1990s it was seen as ‘somewhat adventitious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611431530">Mulligan and Griffin, 1992</xref>: 16). The previous work on action learning recognized by Dewey and his notion of experience, the linking process between action and thought in learning, was distilled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611431530">Kolb (1984)</xref> in to a four-stage experiential learning cycle. The four stages can be described as experiencing (or noticing), interpreting (or reflecting), generalizing (or judging) and applying (or testing) with the process of interpreting or reflecting akin to the principle of double loop learning formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611431530">Argyris and Schön (1974)</xref>.</p>
<p>Whilst the literature on experiential learning definition is now vast (e.g. the situated approach, Boud and Walker cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611431530">Merriman et al., 2007</xref> and the influence of emotional response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611431530">Beard and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611431530">Heron, 1992</xref>), the current research, using an experiential learning framework to explain the findings, uses the key concepts of active engagement and reflection noted by researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611431530">Feinstein et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611431530">Hoover and Whitehead (1976)</xref> to define ‘experiential’ within this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611431530">Elam and Spotts (2004)</xref> note that the definition of learning given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611431530">Kolb (1984)</xref>, a process whereby the transformation of experience creates knowledge, has been built upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley (2000)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley (2000)</xref> describe experiential learning resulting from a situation where students are actively engaged with an experience and then reflect upon this experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611431530">Keeton (1976)</xref> echoes this sentiment whilst likening the process to classical experimental learning in non-human animals:
<disp-quote>
<p>the experiential learning process … does not use a symbolic medium for transmitting information, and information is in fact generated only through the sequence of steps themselves. In the first step, one carries out an action in a particular instance and sees the effect of the action.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other definitions of experiential learning can be shown to follow a similar theme and include: ‘it exists when a learner processes information in an active and immersive learning environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611431530">Feinstein et al., 2002</xref>: 733) and ‘a learning situation characterized by a high level of active involvement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611431530">Hoover and Whitehead, 1976</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>The current research focuses on two key themes to define the ‘experiential’ nature of the learning intervention under discussion—active involvement in the material and or concepts being taught and opportunity for reflection. There is common agreement within the literature that learning can be achieved through practical application and active reflection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611431530">Saunders, 1997</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611431530">Beard and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611431530">Hamilton and Cooper, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611431530">Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611431530">Meyer, 2003</xref>). The active involvement introduces an element of realism within the classroom environment allowing a significantly richer learning experience, increasing retention of the material and resulting in greater understanding. Techniques such as computer simulations, field trips, outdoor learning, internships, action learning and structured classroom exercises have all been used to actively engage the learner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry, 1990</xref>) and these methods tend to focus on the ‘softer’ or transferable skills (e.g. project management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611431530">Darian and Coopersmith, 2001</xref>), communication, critical thinking and problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611431530">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>)) often neglected in traditional teaching.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry (1990)</xref> identified a number of critical components that determine the learning success of any experiential learning exercise (which include the current key aspects: active involvement and reflection), and he went on to highlight three methodologies that successfully encapsulated these critical components: internships, computer-assisted instruction and live cases. Case studies have been widely used in education, particularly management education for a number of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611431530">Shapiro, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507611431530">Wines et al., 1994</xref>) and are claimed to be one of the best techniques for developing generic skills such as communication skills, written skills, interpersonal skills, judgement and analytical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611431530">Ballantine and McCourt, 2004</xref>). It is these transferable skills that have been labelled by researchers as ‘soft’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611431530">Andrews and Higson (2008)</xref> defined soft business-related skills as interpersonal competencies (compared with ‘hard’ business related knowledge and skills) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611431530">Laker and Powell (2011</xref>: 112) in their article on the differences between hard and soft skills and their relative impact on training transfer define soft skills as ‘intrapersonal skills such as one’s ability to manage oneself and how one handles one’s interaction with others’. This is contrasted with their definition of hard skills: ‘technical skills that involve working with equipment, data, software’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611431530">Morgan and Adams (2009)</xref> use a similar distinction between the ‘soft skill’ or process (e.g. critical thinking) and ‘hard’ technical knowledge and/or content. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611431530">Libby (1991)</xref> cites the use of case studies as good teaching pedagogy and researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611431530">Etnier (1983)</xref> highlight that the benefit of the case study is the ability to bridge the gap between theory and practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507611431530">Stewart and Dougherty (1993)</xref> identify four types of case study: real world, incident based, armchair and descriptive, with real world cases being ‘live’, the others based on written material. Within an executive education learning environment the benefit of the live case is particularly pertinent as a live case enables participants to work on a ‘real’ business issue facing an organization whilst being immersed in the organizational physical environment, context and culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611431530">Markulis (1985)</xref> notes that live cases are more realistic (thus, it is argued, falling clearly within the remit of the current definition of ‘experiential’) than written cases as they usually include participation by key decision makers within the organization and the business issue is often current and thus ‘live’. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry (1990)</xref> live cases include the following critical components: the issue to be addressed can be easily related to current business practice for the participant; there is active participation in the process; interactivity is critical (with other participants, key internal and external stakeholders of the organization and the senior management); and there is a real and variable situation where information is incomplete. These four components are postulated as key success factors for the development of the ‘softer’ skills in executive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry, 1990</xref>). However, do these factors allow the development of ‘harder’ skills such as strategy (as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611431530">Andrews and Higson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611431530">Laker and Powell, 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611431530">Morgan and Adams, 2009</xref> amongst others)?</p>
<p>Whilst there is a vast literature describing the skills and abilities that <italic>could</italic> be improved and developed through the use of the written case methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">Weil et al., 2004</xref>) very little research has been conducted on examining the skills and abilities that <italic>have</italic> been improved or developed and even less research exists on the value of live cases within business education. At this current time there are no studies in the literature that report the effectiveness of using a live case study methodology with executive education participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">Weil et al. (2004)</xref> in an evaluation study of the written case approach found that students perceive the major benefit to be in improving their ability to evaluate situations from more than one perspective and to consider alternative solutions to problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611431530">Hassall et al. (1998)</xref> also found that students perceived an improvement in ‘soft’ or transferable skills after discussing a written case, including the ability to work in a group and presentation skills. Finally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611431530">Weil et al. (2001)</xref> surveyed the perceptions of students on the usefulness of written case studies for developing 31 skills identified from the literature. They found that students believed a major benefit of the approach was the way they were exposed to real world complexity, particularly in relation to decision making. In addition, written case studies were felt to be important because they pulled together theory, practice and the real world.</p>
<p>If this bridge between theory, practice and the real world is key even within the realms of a written case as the limited evaluation literature suggests, it is perhaps surprising that there is inadequate research on the value of the ‘live’ case which encapsulates the ‘real world’ aspect of the learning environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611431530">Golen et al. (1984)</xref> examined the use of a live case but did so through the use of scenarios. They provided students with a description of one of five different teaching methodologies (lecture, case study, experiential exercises, computer simulation and a live case study), in one of four class types (marketing, management, finance and accounting), thus there were a total of 20 different scenarios, with each scenario describing the use of a teaching method within the context of the specified subject matter. Participants were given one scenario and 46 possible barriers to communication (e.g. ‘instructor’s prejudices or biases’, ‘overload or too much information to students’ and ‘students’ poor organization of ideas’), and were asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale the seriousness of each barrier to learning the subject-matter principles in the given scenario. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611431530">Golen et al. (1984)</xref> study, therefore, focused on barriers to successful implementation of a variety of teaching approaches rather than an evaluation of their effectiveness. In addition, a scenario was used to illustrate each teaching methodology rather than by asking participants who had recently experienced the particular methodology (although it should be noted that participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611431530">Golen et al., 1984</xref> research were familiar with each teaching methodology described). Therefore, due to the scarcity of true evaluation research in the field and the lack of any study based solely within the realms of executive education, this study sought to understand the effectiveness of a live case methodology with a group of individuals on an executive education programme. In addition, the research also examines whether ‘hard’, more technical skills (in this instance strategy) can be developed by using an approach traditionally known for improving transferable or ‘soft’ skills such as creativity and problem solving.</p>
</sec>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A live case study was conducted with 19 participants (17 males and 2 females) as part of an executive education programme at Ashridge Business School. The participants were drawn from a buildings material organization in the UK that is currently facing a challenge around channels of distribution, management of distributors and development of the direct route to end customers. The client organization (the ‘hosts’ of the live case study) was a major travel company based in Sweden that packages holidays and operates with its own airline and contracted hotels. This company is facing similar challenges with its channels of distribution and is seeking to build a direct relationship with the consumer market by changing the way it deals with travel agents. This ‘host’ was selected because of the similarity of challenges facing the organization albeit in a different sector.</p>
<p>The live case study was preceded by classroom-based teaching in a one-week module which included typical Business School concepts and tools concerning strategic analysis and formulation, implementation and change management, leadership, self-awareness and team work.</p>
<p>Participants were given no prior warning of the nature of the challenge and were not asked to complete any preparatory work. The live case study was completed at the ‘host’ organization in Sweden and participants travelled from the UK to take part. Prior to the start of the case individuals were given a briefing which provided details on the objectives of the exercise, advice to attend to the process along with the task and a recommendation to devise team rules. The role of the facilitator was also described (facilitators would only intervene to facilitate a process review and would not provide direction on roles, structure, application of Business School concepts or tools or timetable).</p>
<p>Once the briefing had been completed the group was addressed by a senior manager from the ‘host’ organization who provided details of a real, current challenge for which he was seeking solutions and advice. Participants were then split into two groups (a group of 10 and a group of 9), with each group tackling a different issue. They were provided with large work rooms with access to the Internet, online databases and telephone lines for research purposes and all appropriate project management and presentation-making materials and technology. The participants were also told that they were able to contact staff, customers and suppliers of the ‘host’ organization, interview them and collect other forms of data from them if required.</p>
<p>The participants had two and a half days to complete the live case study with feedback to the senior manager expected in the afternoon of Day 3. Following completion of the case, participants engaged in a detailed debrief session with the Ashridge facilitator and each individual received feedback on their performance from the rest of his/her team.</p>
<p>The research was conducted immediately prior to the start of the live case study and immediately after the final debriefing session. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire. Both pre and post case study questionnaires were identical and comprised a series of questions asking participants to rate (a) their understanding and knowledge and (b) their confidence to perform effectively in seven key areas of business (devising strategy, structuring a process to solve a strategic problem, using strategy tools effectively, making a flat team effective, personal effectiveness, analysing and devising direct distribution strategy and analysing and devising internet strategy). In addition, participants were also asked to rate their general understanding of (a) strategy tools, (b) themselves and (c) how personally they can be most effectively operate in teams. Ratings were obtained via a 10-point Likert scale with 1 = Low and 10 = High. Participants were asked to submit the questionnaires on completion so that they were unable to reflect upon their previous scoring when finishing the post case phase of the study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data was collected from participants prior to the start of and immediately after completion of the live case study. Data took the form of scores from the questionnaires described in the method section, with a 10-point Likert scale being utilized (1 = Low, 10 = High) for all items.</p>
<p>A series of paired-sample t-tests comparing pre and post scores were conducted with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The accepted level of significance, therefore, was 0.05/17 = 0.002. There was a significant difference between pre and post understanding and knowledge scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611431530">Table 1</xref>) for:</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whilst little has been written on examining skills and abilities that have been shown to improve or develop as a result of either a written or live case within business education, there is an existing literature on what are the expected benefits of such a learning vehicle, at least for the written case study domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611431530">Hassall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611431530">Weil et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">2004</xref>). The majority of this research notes improvements (or expected improvements) in ‘softer’ transferable skills such as ability to work in a group, evaluation of a situation from more than one perspective and presentation skills. The scarcity in the literature on the effectiveness of developing ‘harder’ technical business skills through the use of case studies, in particular the use of a live case, may be indicative of the failure for such methods to improve these types of skill. Additionally, it may also reflect a more general inherent belief that an experiential teaching method (as defined as such by the current research) is not appropriate for developing the harder skill set or that the division between hard and soft skills cannot hold in practice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611431530">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>)</p>
<p>Whilst it is important to note the relatively small sample size in this study and the impact this may have on the generalizability of the findings, the results of this research clearly indicate that (with the caveat of a small <italic>n</italic>) the use of a live case study is an excellent method for improving understanding of a particular type of hard skill, that of strategy. The data showed significant improvements in self-rated understanding post case study for all of the strategy-related topics and abilities. In contrast, all but one of the softer skills (making a flat team effective) showed no increase in understanding after the live case, and both making a flat team effective and personal effectiveness, the two softer skills to be included in the confidence measure, did not show increases in self-rated confidence post case. Whilst the literature is sparse on the benefit of case studies in executive education, these results are somewhat surprising if the domain of case studies per se is considered.</p>
<p>The ability of a live case study to develop the more knowledge-based and tool-based skill set is very promising and provides an important addition to the research into the benefit of experiential learning (as defined by active involvement and reflection). Even if the definition of experiential learning adopted within this study is contentious, it can still be argued that the live case as an active, problem-based learning (as opposed to ‘truly’ experiential) significantly contributes to ‘hard’ skill development. There are a number of factors which may help explain why a live case is such an excellent vehicle for this improvement. First, a live case study involves a real client with a real issue and a real deadline. The problem is not hypothetical and it is not the written word in a classroom exercise. The environment is ‘live’ and that is important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley (2000)</xref> note that experiential learning has been described as effective when students are actively involved with an experience and then have the opportunity to reflect upon this and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611431530">Feinstein et al. (2002</xref>: 733) concur, claiming that ‘experiential learning exists when a learner processes information in an active and immersive learning environment’. The ‘live’ learning environment in a live case study provides both the active and immersive environment. In addition, the live environment, the urgency and real-time problem may provide the individual learner with the motivation to genuinely engage with the material and the desire to be an active participant rather than a passive onlooker, a point reinforced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611431530">Elam and Spotts (2004)</xref>. The participant within the live case is also required to provide the ‘solution’ to the client at the end of the process. To be able to explain a strategic solution to a client (a client who knows the issues intimately), and to take questions about this solution, the individual is likely to have more than a surface level of understanding. The relationship between level of processing of material and retention (thus learning) is highlighted in the memory literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611431530">Craik and Lockhart, 1972</xref>) with recent brain imaging studies (PET and fMRI) showing greater levels of brain activity and in more dispersed regions for deeper processing of material (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507611431530">Fletcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611431530">Kapur et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611431530">Kelley et al., 2002</xref>) and exemplified by the quote attributed to Confucius—’I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand’. This final stage of the live case process also provides the opportunity for reflection noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611431530">Frontczak and Kelley (2000)</xref> as a key part of effective learning. In addition, strategy tools are designed to structure thinking and conversation around a real strategic issue. The usefulness of these tools may only really be appreciated through an application exercise. A simulation allows the user to practise applying the tools, but it is the real issue with the time pressures and the live client that allows the role and limitations of these tools to be appreciated. It is only through application in the real world that genuine engagement (rather than purely on an intellectual level in the classroom) is seen. Finally, a live case study approach requires the individuals involved to address an issue that is relevant to them, but is sufficiently distanced to require them to engage in the process rather than leaping to preconceptions. Engagement in the process rather than falling back on the ‘I do this all the time at work and so I will apply this here’ approach supports the development of the strategy skill set. Research on memory and learning has demonstrated the importance of knowledge in long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611431530">Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611431530">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611431530">Gobet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611431530">Gobet and Simon, 1996</xref>). Research in this field has also shown that when individuals perceive the information to be too familiar (such as a problem or issue they face at work) individuals disengage, make incorrect assumptions and/or become over confident in their solution. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611431530">Richardson (1992)</xref> tested individuals’ memory for the orientation of the monarch’s head on a British postage stamp and on a 20 pence piece. He found that participants had knowledge of the orientation on a postage stamp and then created a schema which was incorrectly applied to the 20 pence piece question. The knowledge of the orientation of the monarch’s head on the stamp was generalized to other related material as individuals felt familiar with the task. To maximize learning, it is postulated that the individual must have a set of prior knowledge that they can apply to the situation (as in this live case) but the situation must not be too familiar (an unfamiliar organization for the live case was chosen) so preconceptions are not adhered to and real learning can take place. As noted in the introduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611431530">Gentry (1990)</xref> notes four critical components of live cases for the development of soft, transferable, skills: relevance to current business practice for the participant, active participation in the process, interactivity and a real and variable situation. The current research has shown that these components of a live case study also explain the improvement in understanding of harder skills, in this instance, that of strategy tools. Individuals understood the relevance of the case and were immersed in a live environment, the urgency and real world nature of the issue supported engagement in the process and in use of the tools, the responsibility of the individuals to provide solutions forced activity and interactivity across the group (group rather than individual solution) and the lack of a secure teaching environment emphasized to individuals the need to engage and understand the strategy tools as the client (and not a teacher or facilitator) was requiring a solution.</p>
<p>If the use of a live case improved the harder edged abilities, why were no improvements in understanding shown for the softer skill set (personal effectiveness, understanding self and understanding personal effectiveness in teams), when the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611431530">Ballantine and McCourt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611431530">Hassall et al., 1998</xref>) suggests this would have been expected? The first possibility is that reflective practice, which may be more important for the development of the softer skills, involves direct interaction with the environment and the learning is not necessarily immediate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611431530">Schön (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611431530">1988</xref>) with his reflection in action work, Boud’s reflection in practice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611431530">Boud et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611431530">1993</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611431530">Moon’s (2004)</xref> reflective practice model all note the importance of adequate reflection time. In addition, adequate connections that are relevant to the world of the learner must be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611431530">Illeris, 1999</xref>) and the time to make these connections or transfer the learning may be longer for less tangible or softer skills. A second possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the nature of participants in the previous research. As has been noted above, the literature that does exist in this domain is largely focused on written cases with a typical undergraduate or postgraduate student population (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611431530">Weil et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">2004</xref>). The opportunity for these individuals to have practised and received feedback (either directly or indirectly through success or failure of projects) within an organizational environment in areas such as personal development, ability to work in a team and presentations skills (those areas shown to improve in a student population through a written case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611431530">Hassall et al., 1998</xref>)) is very limited. If this opportunity for personal growth and development is contrasted with the opportunity in a group of middle and senior managers on an executive education programme who may have been in industry for 20 years or more, the difference is clear. Participants in executive education are by definition, very different to a typical undergraduate/postgraduate population. As such it may be postulated that the benefit of a live case study to develop personal effectiveness and other soft skills is less important and even redundant as the live case nature is a microcosm of their daily work environment. If an individual has been working in industry for 20 years it is possible to speculate that they have had ample time and opportunity to implement self-managed learning if they felt the need and were motivated to do so. In a related point, if the participants in this study have been in previous situations that are similar to the live case, they may already possess at least one way of responding in any given situation. In this way, the individuals may have ‘already built up a series of tightly interwoven cognitive, emotional and behavioural patterns that negatively interfere with the acquisition and application of the new skills that they are being taught’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611431530">Laker and Powell, 2011</xref>: 112). Self-managed development should be distinguished from guided or facilitated self-development as there is a large body of literature documenting the improvement in personal development and other soft skills in executive education when the learning is guided, structured or facilitated (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611431530">Crosbie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611431530">Gilpin-Jackson and Bushe, 2007</xref>). In the current research, the issue is around self-motivated and self-guided personal development as a live case does not build in the structured approach. However, a third contributing factor to the failure to find a significant increase in understanding of the ‘self’-related skills may, in fact, be due to the more facilitated approach to personal development that the participants received in the taught component of the executive education module. The live case was the final section of a module that included classroom-based activities, activities which will have encouraged self-reflection and personal development opportunities. It is possible that the hard strategy skills required application in a live case study before true understanding could be achieved, whereas the more facilitated and guided approach to personal development found in the structured classroom exercises ensured that individuals had already increased their knowledge in this domain before embarking on the live case. One possible soft skill, ‘making a flat team effective’ showed a significant increase in understanding as a result of participation in the case study. Initially this may seem contrary to the explanations noted above, namely that soft skills are not developed because executive education participants have ample opportunity for this in the workplace. However, in the organization that the current participants were employed in, the hierarchical nature of line management is dominant within the organizational culture. This may be reflected in other large organizations as attempts to create open, flat structures often fail (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611431530">Siding et al., 1994</xref>) and hierarchies are argued to be the most effective way to manage large organizations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611431530">Jacques, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611431530">Marschak and Radner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611431530">Williamson, 1985</xref>). As a result, individuals do <italic>not</italic> get the opportunity to practise one particular ‘soft’ skill; that of making flat teams effective, as by the nature of the work environment, it is difficult if not impossible to create a flat team in a non-artificial way. Thus, this is the one soft skill that can be developed in a live case study environment, and therefore understanding of this ability showed significant improvements post case.</p>
<p>Even if initially surprising, the data from the current research on the distinction between development of understanding in hard and soft skill domains is clear, with the focus being a significant increase in understanding of hard strategy skills. This divide across the two skill sets is also mirrored in self-reported improvements in confidence. Whilst there is a significant and strong correlation between confidence and understanding in all but one comparison (both pre and post case study), those abilities that report significant improvements post case are undoubtedly the ‘harder’ strategy-based skill sets (devising strategy, using strategy tools and analysing and devising Internet strategy). For those areas in the results where understanding has not been improved through use of a live case then the finding that confidence has also not increased significantly is of no great surprise (particularly as there is a significant positive relationship between confidence and understanding). In addition, it may be that observation of a skill shift in the more person-related areas involves a high level of emotional intelligence and introspection, thus being more difficult to measure on a self-reported scale than the practice and observation of a skill shift in tools and techniques (plus, as noted above, the time for reflection may not be sufficient for learning to be appreciated immediately post programme).</p>
<p>Whilst the methodological limitations of this study must be acknowledged (small sample size, limited number of aspects of skills measured and the use of self-reports to measure changes in understanding and knowledge) the results of this current research clearly show the benefit of using a live case study methodology to increase understanding and confidence in hard skills such as strategy with individuals in an executive education environment. Previous research has hypothesized the perceived benefits of a live case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">Weil et al., 2004</xref>), or has used a student population and a written case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611431530">Hassall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611431530">Weil et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611431530">2004</xref>). This study has shown that the hypothesized benefit to soft skills in using live or written cases may not be valid when a specific population is employed (middle and senior managers), but that the use of a live case can support a significant increase in understanding of and confidence in harder skills, in this instance, strategy tools. In the future, research focusing on the use of live cases as a vehicle for developing a wide range of skills must examine in more detail <italic>who</italic> the participants are as well as <italic>what</italic> the skills to be developed should be. Studies comparing the efficacy of this approach with employed professionals compared to full-time young undergraduates may yield interesting differences in both the type of hard and soft skills developed. In addition, adequate time for reflection and transfer of learning should be given before administration of any self-assessed learning tool. Only then will it be possible to appreciate more fully the benefit of a live case study approach.</p>
