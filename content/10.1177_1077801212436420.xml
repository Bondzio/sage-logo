<abstract>
<p>We employ two surveys to identify similarities and differences in the risk of abuse among poor urban Mexican-origin women in the United States and Mexico. While the two surveys reveal basic structural similarity in the predictors of partner violence, the rate of violence among Mexican women is far lower than among either foreign-born or native-born Mexican origin women in the United States. While these differences may reflect reality, we argue that survey data must be interpreted cautiously and with an understanding of the cultural, economic, and political context in which the information is collected as well as methodological differences between the surveys.</p>

<body>
<p>During the 20th century increasing international migration, rapid improvements in electronic media, and the internationalization of social problems have made the world a much smaller place. The grinding poverty and serious political and social disorganization that afflicts many developing nations and that remained largely invisible to the citizens of the developed world in previous decades are today brought to their attention on a daily basis. The same is true for the serious violence that afflicts so much of humanity. Today it is almost impossible to ignore the genocide in the Sudan, sectarian violence in Iraq, or the murder of dozens of young women on the Mexican side of the U.S./Mexico border. It is also difficult to ignore the fact that in these and many other tragedies women, minority group members, and the poor are those who suffer at the hands of more powerful others.</p>
<p>In this analysis we examine the phenomenon of domestic violence among poor Mexican-origin women in the United States and Mexico to illustrate the pervasiveness of the phenomenon as well as to illustrate the complexities involved in conducting cross-national research and interpreting survey data on the extent and nature of partner abuse collected in different cultural, social, and political contexts. One of the main challenges faced by researchers conducting comparative quantitative international studies of partner violence, or any other socially conditioned phenomenon, is the development of comparable theoretical definitions as well as measurement tools that permit meaningful comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436420">García-Moreno, Jansen, Ellsberg, Heise, &amp; Watts, 2005</xref>). To illustrate the difficulties inherent in quantitative comparative research, we employ two surveys in the United States and Mexico to analyze the phenomenon of partner violence among poor women. Since complete theoretical and operational comparability cannot be attained, the use of such data requires interpretation and an understanding of the potential effects of the cultural, economic, and political contexts on the definition, conceptualization, and reporting of violent acts.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties inherent in the attempt to understand the roots of violence in different cultural, economic, and political contexts, the problem of violence against women is both universal and serious, and attempts to develop more informed ways of carrying out such research are justified. To do so we are forced to employ the data available. Carrying out new quantitative studies of any topic in several countries is a costly task that even with good translation does not guarantee comparability. At the very least, the use of two similar surveys carried out in different countries with women of similar linguistic and cultural backgrounds allows us to keep certain important aspects of culture reasonably constant. We argue that in comparative analysis the interpretation of results must be accompanied by a discussion of issues related to the meaning and validity of comparative quantitative data as well as a thorough understanding of the target cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077801212436420">Rogler, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural anthropologists who study preliterate cultures first had to learn the language and write a grammar. The same basic challenge confronts the contemporary comparative researcher. Language, with all of the subtleties of meaning and potential for confusion its use entails, remains the main barrier to, as well as the only entry way into, another culture. Even demographers, who count live births and other supposedly objective population phenomena, face serious barriers posed by the inevitable subjective and contextual nature of all human communication. One cannot simply assume that complex social phenomena have similar causes and consequences, or even that they are manifested in similar ways in different cultural and social contexts. The extent of comparability must be investigated and established, or at the very least recognized to be problematic in each case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212436420">Angel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077801212436420">Rogler, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The interpretive problem becomes immediately obvious in the data we are about to present, which show that rates of physical abuse among poor Mexican migrant and Mexican American women in three large American cities in the United States are significantly higher than rates of abuse among poor urban women in Mexico. Such differences may in fact reflect reality. On the other hand, they may represent methodological artifacts that result from different study designs, or they may be the product of different culturally based meaning systems and reporting tendencies. The core objective of this article is to use comparable survey data from the United States and Mexico to explore the correlates of physical violence among low-income women and explain the differences across countries using three potentially useful theoretical perspectives, a family violence perspective, an acculturation perspective, and a feminist perspective. We also discuss the potential impact of methodological differences in the two surveys.</p>

<title>The Universality and Cultural Meaning of Domestic Violence: Problems of Comparability</title>
<p>The capacity to engage in violence against another person may be a universal human trait, and one would certainly be hard-pressed to identify a society without some level of violence. As a social phenomenon, domestic violence is particularly useful for the illustration of the problems inherent in cross-cultural research. Although violence against women may be universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212436420">Heise &amp; García-Moreno, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212436420">Krahe, Bieneck, &amp; Moller, 2005</xref>), the ways in which it is defined, identified, and responded to are not. It is possible that what are seen as serious acts of physical or psychological abuse in one culture may be viewed as less serious or of no social significance in another, or at least not a matter of public concern.</p>
<p>The extent to which acts committed against an intimate female partner by a male are labeled as abusive or socially sanctioned are potentially influenced by general levels of violence, culturally based gender roles, and the specific context in which the potential abuse occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212436420">Levinson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077801212436420">Sagot, 2000</xref>). All of these factors are likely to confound actual behaviors with cultural norms and individual reporting tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212436420">Krane, 1996</xref>). Current conventions for the translation and validation of survey instruments cannot themselves be validated, nor can one demonstrate unambiguously that they insure true phenomenological equivalence, or in this case that similar behaviors are similarly attended to and similarly reported in a questionnaire. Although it is clearly possible to translate questionnaires, even good translations do not address the issue of normative structures and meaning. To deal with these confounding factors the cultural and structural context must be taken into consideration in all comparative studies. Cross-national quantitative research is even more complicated given potential methodological differences, such as differing contexts in which surveys are administered, interviewing practices, differences in sampling frames, the relationship of events of research interest to other local and national events, and variations in the ways violence and abuse are defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212436420">Heise &amp; García-Moreno, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077801212436420">Walby &amp; Myhill, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, the possibility of objectively measuring similar aspects of subjective reality across major cultural and linguistic barriers remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212436420">Hagemann-White, 2001</xref>). For the most part, research on domestic violence is dominated by English-language publications, and researchers in other countries tend to rely on the extensive literature on violence in the United States to motivate and frame their analyses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212436420">Krahe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212436420">Krane, 1996</xref>). In most cases theoretical paradigms as well as research instruments and methodologies are imported directly, with little consideration for the potential of significant cultural differences and the social construction of the phenomenon of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212436420">Gelles &amp; Cornell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212436420">Hagemann-White, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Partner Violence in Mexico and the United States</title>
<p>Even if establishing precise comparative risk estimates for domestic violence remains elusive, there can be little doubt that in both Mexico and the United States the home remains one of the most dangerous places for women. Theoretically, one might expect high levels of violence in Latin American cultures because of the privileging of masculine gender roles and their strong traditions of familism and patriarchy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212436420">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). The stereotype of Mexican “machismo,” a behavioral orientation characterized by an extreme form of masculinity that includes subjugation of women also adds to that expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212436420">Díaz-Olavarrieta &amp; Sotelo, 1996</xref>). Although the term <italic>machismo</italic> has different meanings and connotations in different locations, observers have noted that it is a core value in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212436420">Guttmann, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether or not they are accurate in all of their details, these stereotypes lead to a set of expectations concerning comparative levels of violence between Mexico and the United States. If the abuse of women is tolerated or even encouraged by a culture that tolerates or encourages machismo we would expect the prevalence of abuse to be lower in the United States than in Mexico, since machismo is less accepted and more likely to be socially stigmatized in the United States. Certain researchers have found that the higher ethnic identification as Mexican in the United States is associated with higher scores on scales designed to measure machismo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212436420">Abreu, Goodyear, Campos, &amp; Newcomb, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, one common stereotype holds that immigrant males from Mexico bring the culture of machismo with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212436420">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1992</xref>). The retention of this hypermasculine orientation might lead to a higher probability of abuse by immigrant males than the native born. One might even expect that the stresses of migration, the low social status that most immigrant Mexican men experience, and their minority status in the host country to increase the tendency to display machismo, especially when both genders are unable to fulfill their culturally prescribed roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212436420">Morash, Bui, &amp; Santiago, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077801212436420">Perilla, Bakerman, &amp; Norris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077801212436420">Torres, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Although machismo is a popular concept and one that is even used in scholarly discourse, it lacks theoretical precision or specificity. The definition of machismo is often tautological with an exclusive focus on violence and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212436420">Arciniega, Anderson, Tovar-Blank, &amp; Tracey, 1998</xref>). Certain conceptualizations of machismo, on the other hand, identify it as including both positive and negative characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077801212436420">Torres, Solberg, &amp; Carlstrom, 2002</xref>). Some have differentiated between traditional machismo and <italic>caballerismo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212436420">Arciniega et al., 1998</xref>), which might be translated as chivalrous behavior, and others have demonstrated the multidimensionality of the concept and its variation across Hispanic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077801212436420">Torres et al., 2002</xref>). To be useful theoretically and analytically the concept would clearly have to be better specified and dimensionalized.</p>
<p>Whether or not machismo plays a role, women in Mexico as elsewhere are at risk of victimization. In a nationally representative survey conducted in Mexico in 2003, <italic>Encuesta Nacional sobre la Dinámica de las Relaciones en los Hogares</italic> (ENDIREH, or National Survey of the Dynamics of Domestic Relations), 9.3% of Mexican women reported that they had experienced physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner during the 12 months preceding the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212436420">INEGI &amp; INMUJERES, 2004</xref>). This figure is consistent with those of other studies using national representative samples in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212436420">Castro &amp; Casique, 2006</xref>). Moreover, they are also very similar to those reported in most U.S. national representative surveys, which typically report rates of 8% to 11% (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212436420">Gelles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077801212436420">Wilt &amp; Olson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>For many years, gender-based stereotypes of macho Mexican men and submissive Mexican women led to the assumption that immigrant women were at higher risk of victimization than nonmigrant women since they are culturally closer to Mexico (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212436420">Menjívar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>). Empirical research, though, has shown this stereotype to be inaccurate. Among Mexican-origin women in the United States, those born in Mexico are at lower risk of partner violence, both during the 1-year reference period employed in most studies and over their lifetimes, than native-born Mexican-origin women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212436420">Firestone, Lambert, &amp; Vega, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212436420">Frías &amp; Angel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212436420">Kaufman Kantor, Jasinski, &amp; Aldarondo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212436420">Lown &amp; Vega, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212436420">Morash et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1077801212436420">
<title>Theoretical and Methodological Explanations for Potential Similarities and Differences in Rates of Partner Violence</title>
<p>The data we present below suggest that the prevalence of partner violence among poor urban women in Mexico is lower than the rate among Mexican migrants in the United States, and it is even lower than rates among Mexican Americans who were born in the United States. Making substantive sense of these differences is not straightforward. Theoretically, these differences might be approached from three conceptual frameworks: the family violence perspective, acculturation theory, and a feminist perspective. Before proceeding let us relate these three perspectives to the problem of domestic violence.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077801212436420">
<title>The Family Violence Perspective</title>
<p>From the family violence perspective, domestic violence is a learned behavior as well as a response by the aggressor to sociostructural and sociocultural stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212436420">Hamptom, 1999</xref>). Research informed by this perspective reveals a profile of victimization that is very similar in the United States and Mexico that suggests that violence is a learned behavior. Researchers in this tradition find that younger age and low educational levels increase the risk of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436420">Castro, Peek-Asa, &amp; Ruiz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212436420">Díaz-Olavarrieta, Ellertson, Paz, Ponce de León, &amp; Alarcón-Segovia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212436420">Heyman &amp; Smith Slep, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212436420">Oropesa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212436420">Pozo del, Castro, &amp; Ríquer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212436420">Rivera, Allen, Chávez, &amp; Ávila, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077801212436420">Weaver, Kilpatrick, Resnick, Best, &amp; Saunders, 1997</xref>). Situational or factors that are part of the immediate context in which the abuse occurs are also important. These factors include interactions with others as well as the subjective meanings assigned to those interactions. These factors interact with and reflect relationship characteristics related to the distribution of power within the household, gender ideology, and the gender role expectations of the partners that give rise to differential risk profiles among couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212436420">Casique, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212436420">Firestone, Harris, &amp; Vega, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212436420">Oropesa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212436420">Pozo del et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077801212436420">Smith, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Other system-level factors include formal and informal social structures that influence or determine an individual’s behavioral options. Violence results from elevated levels of stress and the lack of available resources to deal with it as well as the general deprivation and frustration that accompany poverty and social marginality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436420">Castro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212436420">Cunradi, Caetano, &amp; Schafer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212436420">MacMillan &amp; Gartner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212436420">Oropesa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212436420">Pozo del et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077801212436420">Villarreal, 2007</xref>). Much evidence in both Mexico and the United States supports the proposition that in the absence of material and social resources violence often represents the only means by which a male can achieve his domestic objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212436420">de Oliveira &amp; García, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212436420">Kaufman Kantor et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077801212436420">
<title>The Acculturation Perspective</title>
<p>Some observers have hypothesized that the risk of violence might be affected by the process of acculturation. The acculturation process continues beyond the experiences of the migrant generation to affect subsequent generations as they become more deeply incorporated into the host culture and society. Unfortunately, the impact of acculturation on partner violence remains unclear. Certain studies of Mexican immigrant families suggest that sex roles become more egalitarian as part of the acculturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212436420">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1992</xref>). It is possible that the migration process results in the adoption of more egalitarian gender roles that are able to coexist with elements of traditional culture. On the other hand, certain studies suggest that the mixing of cultures and contexts can result in serious stresses that lead to higher levels of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212436420">Firestone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212436420">García, Hurwitz, &amp; Kraus, 2005</xref>) although in some cases the relationship between partner violence and acculturation is nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212436420">Caetano, Schafer, Clark, Cunradi, &amp; Raspberry, 2000</xref>). The migration and acculturation processes are clearly complex and include many potentially countervailing forces, some of which may work to increase stresses and male insecurity and the risk of violence, and others that may operate to redefine gender roles and empower women.</p>
<p>Acculturation must be understood in relation to the cultural and social contexts in which migrants arrive. Even if the migration and acculturation processes erode some aspects of patriarchy and give women more power in the household, at the individual level some patriarchal beliefs and behaviors can persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212436420">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994</xref>). In the new context in which women gain more prerogatives and status both within and outside the household men may feel threatened and resort to violence as a means of attempting to maintain patriarchal control over women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212436420">Hirsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212436420">Morash et al., 2000</xref>). The process of acculturation can refer to the experiences of international migrants, or to those of more local migrants or those who move from one cultural context to another within a single nation. In addition to conceptual difficulties, the measurement of acculturation is complex since the concept includes several dimensions. For our purposes we employ language, one of the most salient dimensions of culture.</p>
<p>In Mexico between 7% and 13% of the population speak an indigenous language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212436420">Janssen &amp; Martínez Casas, 2006</xref>), reflecting the reality that the Mexican population is largely of mixed ancestry. As a consequence, the classification of indigenous or nonindigenous is not conceptually or operationally straightforward. Yet the distinction is important in terms of the risk of violence. Qualitative studies of indigenous communities suggest that violence against female partners is viewed as a husband’s right and a legitimate disciplinary mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212436420">Alberti Manzanares, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212436420">Hernández-Castillo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077801212436420">Pérez Robledo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1077801212436420">Vallejo Real, 2004</xref>). Other evidence from recent surveys suggests that indigenous women are at a lower risk than nonindigenous women of experiencing partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212436420">Pozo del et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077801212436420">Villarreal, 2007</xref>). How the assimilation of indigenous populations into the mainstream mestizo culture affects the risk of violence, then, remains unclear. We hypothesize, though, that the acculturative stresses associated with rapid and dramatic changes in culture might increase the risk of violence.</p>

<title>The Feminist Perspective</title>
<p>From a feminist perspective violence is fostered by patriarchy, a structured hierarchical relation between men and women in which men are dominant and women subordinated. This structural inequality generates a culture in which violence against women is tolerated or even considered normative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212436420">Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979</xref>). It is possible that differences in levels or the nature of patriarchy might account for cross-national differences in partner violence. Research informed by a liberal feminist perspective in the United States reveals that differing levels of patriarchy are associated with regional differences in rates of partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077801212436420">Straus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077801212436420">Yllo, 1984</xref>). The association appears to be similar in Mexico where differences in patriarchy at the state level interact with individual-level characteristics to affect the risk of victimization for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212436420">Frías, 2008</xref>). The average levels of structural equality or structural patriarchy differ in the United States and Mexico, a fact that might account for at least a portion of the differences in rates of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212436420">Di Noia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212436420">Frías, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077801212436420">Straus, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodological Explanations</title>
<p>Finally, the potential impact of the research <italic>methodologies</italic> employed to estimate the extent of violence in comparative studies may well result in artifacts or at least serious biases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077801212436420">Walby and Myhill (2001)</xref> enumerates seven methodological considerations central to comparative research focused on violence against women. These include (a) the social context in which the survey is administered; (b) the interviewing practices employed; (c) training and the degree of matching characteristics of the interviewer and interviewee; (d) the sampling frame from which the sample is drawn; (e) the mode of enquiry, which refers to the way in which the questions are asked, for example, mail questionnaires, telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews or computer-assisted self-administered instruments; (f) the operationalization of basic concepts; and (g) the necessity of situating the violent event in relation to other life events. In addition, specific historical events, such as the passage of laws penalizing partner violence or the opening of shelters for battered women, could potentially affect the reporting of violent acts by victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212436420">Hagemann-White, 2001</xref>). For comparisons to be valid or interpretable, such methodological and situational factors must be accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212436420">Krahe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212436420">Krane, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077801212436420">Saltzman, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data and Analytic Approach</title>
<p>Given the fact that the prevalence of partner violence among Mexican origin women varies both by country and, within the United States, by nativity, the following analyses begins with an assessment of gross differences in rates of reported partner abuse between women in Mexico and women in the United States, and then proceeds to an examination of the impact of nativity for those in the United States. We also examine several potential explanations that might account for cross-national differences derived from the family violence, contextual and methodological perspectives. The analyses are based on two roughly comparable surveys, one collected in Mexico and the other in three cities of the United States.</p>
<p>The survey in the United States, <italic>Welfare, Children and Families Study</italic> (WCF; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jhu.edu/~welfare/">http://www.jhu.edu/~welfare/</ext-link>) is the first wave of a study of poor families in Boston, Massachusetts, Chicago, Illinois, and San Antonio, Texas, three cities with diverse ethnic and racial composition conducted in 1999 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077801212436420">Winston et al., 1999</xref>, for further details). Boston and Chicago have large Mexican-origin populations. San Antonio is 52% Mexican origin as is 18% of the population of Chicago. Only 1% of the population of Boston is of Mexican origin. The sample consisted of families living in poor neighborhoods with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. Approximately 77% of the families, predominantly minority, had incomes below the poverty line. Around 40% of the women were receiving welfare at the beginning of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077801212436420">Winston et al., 1999</xref>). The interviews were conducted in Spanish or English and the survey collected detailed demographic, employment, and welfare program participation, information of the respondent’s experiences of partner violence, and much more.</p>
<p>The Mexican survey, the <italic>National Survey of Household Relationship Dynamics</italic> (<italic>Encuesta Nacional sobre la Dinámica de las Relaciones en los Hogares</italic>, ENDIREH), was conducted in 2003 by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica) as a response to a request of the Women’s National Institute (INMUJERES: Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres). The ENDIREH is a nationally representative sample of women 15 years and older. It is also representative of 11 states that partially financed their own state-level representative samples: Baja California, Coahuila, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Hidalgo, Michoacán, Nuevo Leon, Quintana Roo, Sonora, Yucatan, and Zacatecas. The ENDIREH collected extensive information on different forms of partner violence, decision sharing, and gender roles in Mexican households from October 20 to November 14, 2003 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212436420">INEGI &amp; INMUJERES, 2004</xref>, for more details about the sample and survey methodology). Analyses based on these data employ sample weights to compensate for the complex sampling design.</p>
<p>Interviewers, who included both males and females in the United States, but only females in Mexico, received extensive interviewer training. In both countries respondents were guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality. The domestic violence section of the WCF was self-administered using AUDIO-CASI in which the respondent read the probes on a computer screen or heard them though earphones. This method, which does not require responding to a person, results in higher reported rates when the phenomenon under study is socially stigmatized. In Mexico, respondents were asked the questions by the interviewer. Both surveys assess partner violence using a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077801212436420">Straus (1990)</xref>. The CTS has been widely used in cross-cultural research, including a 2005 World Health Organization (WHO) report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212436420">García-Moreno et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the following analyses we employ subsamples of poor urban women from both of these two surveys. Although poor women in Mexico are much poorer in absolute terms than women of Mexican origin in the United States, in both countries these women are in the lowest socioeconomic strata and are thus among the worst off economically and socially in relative terms. As we mentioned, the WCF targets poor families. For the present analysis we selected 571 Mexican-origin women in the data set. Twenty-nine percent of these women reported that they had been born in Mexico, and 71% percent reported that they had been born in the United States.</p>
<p>Our subsample from the Mexican ENDIREH includes women from the lowest socioeconomic stratum based on a classification scheme developed by Echarri (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212436420">Castro, Ríquer, &amp; Medina, 2004</xref>, pp. 159-160). This classification scheme is based on three household characteristics. The first is average years of education of the members of the household. This measure includes both those who have completed their education and those still in the educational system by imputing the expected number of years of school they will complete based on their age and gender. The second household characteristic refers to the occupational status of the household member with the highest potential income based on the average for his or her occupation. The third household characteristic consists of basic household amenities such as indoor running water and electricity, the structural characteristics of the home, the number of people per room, and the availability of a kitchen. Based on these three characteristics, households are assigned to one of four economic strata: very low, low, middle, and high. Thirty-three percent of the ENDIREH sample falls into the very low socioeconomic stratum. This proportion is similar to the estimate of 34.7% reported from the 2000 Mexican Census and is the subsample that we use in the following analyses.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>In both surveys we focus on victimization during the year preceding the interview. The dependent variable is based on a variation of the CTS. The CTS consists of questions concerning acts that typically occur in violent relationships. The CTS and its revision, CTS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077801212436420">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>) have been adapted for use in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212436420">Castro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212436420">Castro, Peek-Asa, García, Ruiz, &amp; Kraus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212436420">Peek-Asa, García, McArthur, &amp; Castro, 2002</xref>).

<p>We include several independent variables derived from the family violence and acculturation perspectives. These variables allow us to assess potential similarities and differences in the predictors of victimization between the two countries. These include demographic, socioeconomic, abuse background characteristics, as well as indicators of acculturation. Given cross-national differences in income levels, educational attainment, and other variables, exact comparability is not possible. Among the <italic>sociodemographic variables</italic>, in the ENDIREH we categorize <italic>education</italic> into three levels: (a) less than primary (which includes illiterate women); (b) primary, which is equivalent to elementary school in the United States; and (c) more than primary. For the foreign-born sample in the WCF we also divide education into three categories: (a) primary or less, (b) secondary (seventh to ninth grades), and (c) high school or its equivalent and more than high school. For native-born Mexican Americans, who tend to be more educated than their Mexican-born counterparts we categorize education as (a) less than high school, (b) high school or high school equivalency, and (c) more than high school. In both surveys, <italic>employment</italic> is coded 1 if the respondent worked for pay during the week preceding the interview and 0 otherwise. In both surveys <italic>marital status</italic> is coded 1 if the respondent is currently married and 0 otherwise. The <italic>age</italic> of the woman is a continuous variable measured in years.</p>
<p><italic>Abuse background</italic> includes measures concerning the respondent’s experience of physical violence during childhood or adolescence. It is coded 1 if any abuse was reported and 0 otherwise. Measures of <italic>acculturation</italic> are specific to each survey and subsample. In the ENDIREH, <italic>indigenous</italic> is coded 1 if the respondent speaks an indigenous language. As in the United States where many Latin-origin second-generation immigrants no longer speak Spanish, in Mexico many individuals who do not speak their native language share a great deal culturally with their native language speaking coethnics. Despite the limitations of the language-based definition, though, we employ it because it is likely to identify the most culturally ethnic individuals. Because of its centrality to cultural identity, language ability and use are major components of acculturation scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212436420">Cuellar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>For foreign-born respondents in the WFC, <italic>years since migration</italic> is a continuous measure of the number of years the woman has lived in the United States and <italic>English proficiency</italic> is an index of self-rated ability to speak, read, and write English (Cronbach’s α = .95). For native-born respondents in the WCF <italic>language</italic> is coded 1 if English is the respondent’s primary language and 0 otherwise.</p>

<title>Analysis Based on the Family Violence and Acculturation Perspectives</title>
<p>The first stage of our analysis consists of descriptive statistics for each of the samples. In the second part we estimate three sets of logistic regressions (one for each subsample) to compare the correlates of partner abuse among Mexican women and the two nativity groups in the United States. Again, in both countries our samples consist of women who occupy the lowest rungs in the system of social stratification. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212436420">Table 1</xref> presents frequencies for each type of abuse in the three subsamples. Mexican native-born women in the United States report the highest levels of each type of abuse in almost all categories, while women in Mexico report the lowest levels. Foreign-born U.S. residents fall in between. In Mexico, however, there are more women who report that their partner has used a weapon to harm them or has threatened to do so than Mexican migrants in the United States. These differences may reflect differences in the way the question concerning weapons are asked in the two surveys. In the Mexican survey a broader range of weapons (knife, pocket knife, gun, or rifle) is mentioned, while in the WCF these differences are collapsed into the category “weapon.” In the WCF sample one in five foreign-born Mexican-origin women experienced some form of physical violence during the study period. Among native-born Mexican-origin women nearly one in three women experienced physical abuse (32.6%). In comparison, only 11% of poor urban women in Mexico reported abuse.</p>
<p>The characteristics of women who suffered violence during the 1-year reference period are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212436420">Table 2</xref>. In all three samples nonmarried women and those who had experienced violence during childhood or adolescence reported higher levels of abuse than married women and those who had not been abused in childhood or adolescence. Younger women reported higher levels of abuse than older women. Speaking the dominant language in both countries is associated with a greater risk of violence. Mexican-origin foreign-born women in the United States who are not proficient in English and native-born women for whom Spanish is their first language report lower levels of violence than those who are more fluent English speakers. In Mexico, women who speak an indigenous language report lower levels of abuse than Spanish speaking women.</p>

<p>Among Mexican women, those with higher levels of education and those who are employed are more likely to report partner violence than less educated and unemployed women. Among Mexican-origin women in the United States, education and employment are not associated with partner violence for either the foreign- or the native-born. Among foreign-born women in the United States, those who have been there the longest report higher levels of abuse than those who arrived more recently.</p>
<p>In the second part of our analyses we performed several logistic regressions informed by the family violence and acculturation perspectives to assess the major correlates of having experienced any act of physical violence during the 12 months preceding the survey. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212436420">Table 3</xref> presents the odds ratios associated with each independent variable. Married women living in Mexico had 49% lower odds of experiencing physical violence during the 1-year reference period than their unmarried counterparts. Age and being married reduce the odds of experiencing violence in all three subsamples. Among women in the United States for whom the odds of violence are higher than for women in Mexico, the <italic>protective</italic> effect of being married is stronger: 82% lower odds for the foreign-born and 74% lower for the native-born. Although the risk of experiencing partner violence seems to decrease with age, the effect is greater for the foreign-born than for the native-born. Having experienced physical abuse at an early age increases the odds of partner abuse by 109% for Mexicans, and 161% for Mexican Americans. For the foreign-born Mexicans in the United States, however, the coefficient is not significant.</p>

<p>Although employment has been found to have both positive and negative effects on violence in previous research, it is insignificant in these analyses. Among Mexicans, the least educated women (illiterate and those who did not finish primary school) have 33% lower odds of experiencing partner violence than those with primary education or more. In the U.S. subsamples, education is not significantly associated with partner violence. The acculturation variables suggest that the effect of higher levels of assimilation into the mainstream culture vary between countries. In Mexico, women who speak an indigenous language are less likely to report abuse than those who do not. By contrast, among foreign-born U.S. residents, the risk of experiencing partner violence increases by 12% for each additional year the woman has been in the United States. However, with increasing English proficiency, the odds of experiencing partner violence decrease.</p>

<title>The Potential Effects of Survey Methodologies and the Sociocultural and Patriarchal Context</title>
<p>As we noted in our introduction, methodological differences and the different sociocultural contexts in which individuals are embedded are clearly potential sources of the cross-national differences we observe. In this section we focus first on the mode of inquiry employed, and then on the sociocultural and political contexts in which the surveys took place. The context in which the survey was conducted could have resulted in underreporting in Mexico. Studies focused on general crime or victimization tend to find lower rates of partner violence than studies focused more specifically on family violence or on more general and broad topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212436420">Mihalic &amp; Elliott, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077801212436420">Walby &amp; Myhill, 2001</xref>). Neither of the surveys required respondents to identify themselves as battered or abused. Rather, they were asked about specific acts that they had experienced at the hands of their intimate partner.</p>
<p>In the WCF, the domestic violence questions were part of a broader survey that had as an objective the collection of extensive information concerning the lives of poor families. The ENDIREH study was framed as a study of household dynamics. However, more than half of the questionnaire dealt with issues of domestic conflict and the incidence of behaviors that could be labeled violent. Although neither of the surveys was focused specifically on crime, the focus on domestic violence in the ENDIREH was more prominent than in the WCF. Although it is possible, therefore, that aspects of the methodology itself influenced respondents’ answers, the fact that the set of questions regarding physical violence came before questions regarding other types of abuse might have reduced this potential effect for these questions.</p>
<p>The second source of methodological variation between the two surveys is related to the data collection procedures used. In the U.S. survey, the domestic violence section was self-administered using AUDIO-CASI. In Mexico, the entire survey was administered by an interviewer. The use of a computer appears to increase the willingness of respondents to report sensitive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212436420">Hagemann-White, 2001</xref>). The use of such techniques is expensive, of course, and often requires that the respondent be literate. Since 11% of Mexican women are illiterate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212436420">Inegi, 2001</xref>) the use of AUDIO-CASI or other expensive methodologies often is not possible. The use of different methodologies for collecting the data on domestic violence might have resulted in lower reported rates in the Mexican survey.</p>
<p>The structural and sociocultural environments, which include different patriarchal norms, might explain the higher rates of reported violence in our U.S. samples. The United States and Mexico differ greatly in the enactment of legislation related to partner violence, the willingness of the police to intervene, the services available to victims of domestic violence, and the level of public awareness and the nature of the public discourse concerning the seriousness of such violence. As result, the cultural climate and the structural acceptance of violence could well influence the likelihood that women report certain behaviors as abusive, either because they are not perceived as abusive or because of the stigma associated with such behaviors.</p>
<p>Almost two decades separate the first legislative initiatives related to domestic violence in the two countries. In the United States, the battered women’s movement, which evolved during 1960s as part of the women’s movement, exerted pressure on the State to deal with the issue in both civil and criminal law. During the late 1970s, several initiatives from women’s rights groups impelled the federal government to act. In 1990, after much debate, Congress approved the first federal law dealing with domestic violence, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Among other innovations, it increased federal resources devoted to partner violence initiatives and provided grants for educational and social programs aimed at the prevention of domestic violence. It also extended law enforcement initiatives related to domestic violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212436420">Orloff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077801212436420">Tieffenthaler, Farmer, &amp; Sambira, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, it was not until 1997 that the Federal District modified its civil and penal codes to include reforms related to family violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212436420">Borjón López-Coterilla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">Frías, 2009</xref>). While the Federal District’s Ley de Prevención y Atención a la Violencia Intrafamiliar (Family Violence Prevention and Assistance Law), as well as similar legislation passed by several Mexican states, formally sanction domestic violence, few mechanisms for enforcing such laws exist, the laws themselves have little impact, and available resources for victims of partner violence are few. In addition, family violence legislation in Mexico often has two contradictory goals. On one hand, the states seek to preserve the family as a social institution. On the other hand, the stated objective of domestic violence legislation is the protection of women and other members within the family. These contradictory objectives reflect a long-standing familistic tradition, patriarchal ideology, and the paternalism of the State. The result is that despite an official ideology that condemns violence against women, inadequate resources are devoted to prevention or enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">Frías, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Mexico has not yet passed specific federal legislation related to domestic violence. Domestic violence regulations are included in other federal laws. In 2006, the Federal Congress passed the General Law for Equity between Men and Women, which assigned to the individual states the responsibility of addressing gender violence. In 2007, 10 years after the enactment of the first Family Violence Prevention and Assistance Law, the General Law for Women’s Access to a Life Free of Violence was passed. It included measures for protecting women from an array of forms of violence that include family violence, sexual harassment in the workplace and schools, community violence, and institutional violence.</p>
<p>As a result of these historical and structural differences, the legal recourses for abused women differ substantially between the two countries. In the United States, special domestic violence courts have jurisdiction over partner abuse cases; police officers enforce the law rather than acting as mediators; once brought, formal charges cannot be dropped even if the victim wishes to; and victims can request restraining orders and apply for posttrial relief aid (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212436420">Mirchandani, 2005</xref>). By contrast, Mexican legislation (in the states where it exists) tends to promote conciliation procedures and settlement agreements to be carried out by several public agencies, including the police. The procedure for requesting protective orders is lengthy and complicated and to date there is little public aid for women who bring charges against their abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">Frías, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077801212436420">Torres-Falcón, 2004</xref>). As of May 2005, four Mexican states had passed no domestic violence legislation and partner abuse was not categorized as a felony in six states.</p>
<p>The number of services available to abused women is also very different in the two countries. In the United States, domestic violence shelters have been around for several decades. As of 2000 the National Directories of Domestic Violence Programs registered 1,386 shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077801212436420">Tieffenthaler et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, it was not until 1996 that the first shelter opened its doors in the small city of Aguascalientes, Mexico. As of May 2004, the National Women’s Institute reported the existence of only 32 shelters for battered women in Mexico. While some states have additional publicly funded or nongovernmental shelters, others lack any refuge at all. Abused women in Mexico face serious difficulties if they make their victimization public. Public authorities discourage or even deny women’s rights to press domestic violence charges against their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">Frías, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212436420">Hirsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212436420">Salcido &amp; Adelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077801212436420">Torres-Falcón, 2004</xref>). In some cases, rather than serving as sources of support for abused women, families blame the victim and discourage their attempts to leave their abuser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212436420">Salcido &amp; Adelman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It also appears that as result of the different patriarchal climates the acceptance of violence against women varies between countries and possibly within each country. In some Mexican communities, wife beating is widely regarded as normal male behavior, or even as justified discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212436420">Glantz, Halperin, &amp; Hunt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212436420">Hernández-Castillo, 2004</xref>). When migrants arrive to the United States they are often surprised that domestic violence laws exist and that these laws are actually enforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077801212436420">Perilla, 1999</xref>). The cultural climate and the structural acceptance of violence may affect how women perceive violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212436420">Peek-Asa et al., 2002</xref>), again resulting in differential propensities to report certain behaviors as violence.</p>

<sec id="section13-1077801212436420">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This analysis has revealed much of substance and of method in comparative research on family violence. Among the poor women in our study, the Mexican subsample reported a far lower rate of partner abuse (11%) than either the foreign-born or the native-born U.S. subsamples (20% and 33%, respectively). Although these rates may reflect reality, both theoretical and practical considerations lead us to suspect that the reported rate of abuse in Mexico is too low. The lesson is that any estimate of the prevalence of domestic violence must be interpreted cautiously since, as we have argued, cultural, political, and even economic differences between Mexico and the United States result in important differences between countries in the framing and reporting of violence. In all likelihood, substantial cultural and social differences within nations, such as those associated with race and ethnicity, also influence norms related to gender role behavior and the occurrence and reporting of violence. Cultural, economic, and political differences among socially distinct subgroups, combined with methodological difficulties such as instrument adaptation and sample selection, may easily result in misinterpretation or artifacts when dealing with self-reported subjective information in substantially different cultural and social contexts.</p>
<p>Even when one employs the most rigorous methodological tools, interpretation is necessary and such interpretation requires knowledge of the culture and language in which studies are conducted. It also requires knowledge of the social and political context in which actions are labeled deviant and either sanctioned or tolerated. As we have described, the political and legal contexts in which domestic violence is socially and legally defined in Mexico and the United States, and the ways in which the police and other agents and agencies of social control respond to it, differ greatly. In Mexico, although public and legal discourses condemn partner violence, institutional inaction often reflects a tacit acceptance of the status quo. As we explained, contradictory policies that on one hand seek to preserve the family and on the other supposedly protect women from domestic abuse result in the ineffective enforcement of domestic violence laws. In such a context women are less likely to report victimization than in contexts in which abusive acts are officially sanctioned.</p>
<p>Despite revealing rather substantial differences in overall rates or victimization between Mexico and the United States, our data indicate that the sociodemographic profiles of the victims of domestic violence are largely similar in both countries. In both countries, marriage and being older are protective factors. Age is a protective factor even among Mexican-origin women born in the United States. These findings contradict previous reports of no association between age and the risk of partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212436420">Firestone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212436420">Harris, Firestone, &amp; Vega, 2005</xref>). The reasons for the difference between our findings and these contradictory results are not obvious and may reflect differences in samples and methodology or the other difficulties in assessing the true level of violence that we have mentioned.</p>
<p>Another of our findings that contradicts certain earlier research relates to education. In certain studies in both Mexico and the United States, higher levels of education have been associated with a higher risk of abuse (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212436420">Harris et al., 2005</xref>). Our data revealed no education effect in the U.S. subsample. Even in the United States, the sample is poor, and their limited range of education potentially explains our finding. The association between education and the risk of violence in the Mexican sample, though, is counterintuitive. In our sample of very poor urban dwellers in Mexico, those women with the lowest levels of education had a lower risk of violence than women with more education. At this point we can only resort to speculation to attempt to explain these patterns. A cultural or social class perspective might lead us to hypothesize that less educated women in Mexico are more likely than more educated women to conform to traditional gender role expectations, which might place them at lower risk of violence, or they may not report violence even if it occurs, especially since they are unlikely to have the resources to resist or escape. Given the overdetermined nature of the phenomenon of partner violence, several factors are no doubt at work, and in-depth qualitative investigations would be necessary to untangle the multiple and interrelated causes of the risk individual women face.</p>
<p>Our findings concerning the effect of physical abuse in childhood or adolescence in the Mexican sample and in the native-born Mexican-origin U.S. sample again reveal some differences among subgroups. For women in Mexico and those women of Mexican origin who were born in the United States, those who were victimized in childhood or adolescence were more likely to report abuse in adulthood. For Mexican-origin women who were born in Mexico but who are now living in the United States, there was no association between the experience of early life violence and adult abuse. This contradictory finding hints at the likely complexity of the meaning of violence and the impact of acculturation on its reporting. In the U.S. sample, acculturation, measured as the number of years since the respondent migrated to the United States, is associated with a higher risk of partner abuse, while increased English proficiency counteracts this effect.</p>
<p>Further evidence concerning the role of acculturation emerges from the Mexican sample. In Mexico, those who speak an indigenous language (7.2% of the population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212436420">Inegi, 2001</xref>), which may indicate a lower level of acculturation into mainstream Mexican culture, report lower levels of partner violence. Again, it may be the case that these women are more likely to conform to traditional gender role expectations and face a lower risk of abuse, or they may be less likely to perceive or report abusive acts by their male partners. Of course, migration and acculturation involve many other stressors associated with the experience of physical and cultural change. The effects of these interacting factors on the actual experience of abuse and on its reporting are likely complex and not easily discerned in a survey.</p>
<p>The family violence and the acculturation perspectives offer some possibilities for interpreting differences among the three subsamples. The sociodemographic characteristics of economically unprivileged women vary substantially between the two countries. Even though all of the women in our subsamples are of Mexican origin, a fact that controls to some extent for cultural factors, we cannot disregard the potential influence of the sociocultural context and the patriarchal nature of Mexican society. The association among explanatory variables, such as employment and marital status (married vs. cohabiting), and abuse could be influenced by the level of patriarchy as certain data suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212436420">Frías, 2009</xref>). These possibilities suggest the need for more sophisticated analyses, including qualitative and quantitative studies, based on theoretical models that combine micro and macro-structural analyses of partner violence. Future research instruments need to include measures of social desirability since there are cross-country variations that seem to affect the reporting of stigmatized behaviors such as partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077801212436420">Straus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077801212436420">Straus &amp; Ramirez, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study has clear limitations. The surveys are not contemporaneous, nor are they based on the same instruments. In addition, our analysis focuses on poor urban samples in both Mexico and the United States. Our specific findings cannot be generalized to other social strata or other groups. The problems inherent in assessing the levels of violence, though, probably can be generalized although the specific effects of culture, social class, and economic and political contexts are necessarily historically and locationally specific.</p>
<p>This research has practical implications for those working with Mexican-origin families in the United States or conducting research with them. Poor women with low levels of education and few occupational skills remain dependent even on an abusive partner. Poverty and patriarchal social norms clearly increase the risk of violence and undermine a woman’s ability to escape it or bring charges against the abuser. Noncitizen Mexican-origin women in the United States might fear deportation or legal problems if they report abuse. Given their marginal status, they occupy an objectively disadvantaged position relative to their male partner. Disclosing abuse might result in an increased risk of experiencing violence. Providing protection or therapy to these women requires a clear understanding of their vulnerability and the potential that efforts to assist them might make their situation worse if those who would help do not understand the situation. Some of these implications might be applied as well to other ethnic groups such as Asians.</p>
<p>This research sheds light on some of the complexities involved in conducting cross-national research and interpreting survey data concerning social phenomena that are culturally, socially, and politically embedded. It highlights the necessity of a sophisticated understanding of the political, economic, and social system differences that constrain individual opportunities for action and their observed and self-reported behavior. These objective constraints are very likely to manifest themselves cognitively and directly affect responses to survey probes. Attention to the accuracy of translation is unlikely to sufficiently account for these differences. In all likelihood, an adequate comparative methodology probably requires a qualitative component to help understand differences in meaning for which translation alone cannot account. As our analysis illustrates, understanding the cultural and social context in which survey or any research is conducted is a central consideration in comparative research methodology. The lack of such an understanding places impenetrable interpretive barriers between the researcher and the social and cultural reality under study.</p>
