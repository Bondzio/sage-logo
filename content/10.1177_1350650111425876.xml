<sec id="sec1-1350650111425876" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Athletes have experimented for years with compression garments in sports both as an ergogenic performance enhancement and recovery aid. In recent years, the interest in sports compression garments substantially increased resulting in these garments having wide application both in competitive sports as well as in sport garments used for recovery and fitness activities. Compression garments are constructed to have a negative fit, where the size of the garment is smaller than that of the body over which they are fitted. Due to this negative fit, these types of garments generate pressure on the underlying tissue of the human body. The degree of pressure produced by a compression garment is determined by a complex interrelation between the following principle factors: the construction and fit of the garment, structure and physical properties of its materials, the size and curvature of the part of the body to which it is applied and the nature of the sporting or everyday activity undertaken.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111425876">1</xref></sup> As a result of the negative fit, the inner surface of these garments is in full contact with the wearer’s skin. Same situation occurs when the athletes wear different types of non-compression garments with negative fit such as cycling shorts, triathlon suits and others. Due to the negative fit, textile fabrics comprising the garments are stretched over the body which lead to the change of their inner surface topography depending on the level of fit.</p>
<p>Sensorial or tactile comfort is an important part of an overall physiological comfort, usually described as ‘handle’ or ‘hand’ and can be evaluated in several different ways. A significant number of studies focus on the interaction between the skin and the material surface where subjective human trials are utilised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111425876">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111425876">4</xref></sup> The most commonly used is the objective evaluation of comfort in fabrics and materials by the utilisation of four modules of the Kawabata evaluation system (KES), which is an alternative objective method for measurement of a series of fabric properties used in place of the evaluation of the panel of trained experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111425876">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111425876">7</xref></sup> It has been concluded by existing research that it is possible to predict and evaluate sensorial comfort of clothing and materials by reducing the large array of sensory and mechanical properties that can be measured on fabrics to a small number of independent components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111425876">8</xref></sup> It is important to note that the assessment of fabrics using the majority of instrumental methods is comparative, with no absolute ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ attributes, and a sizable database of relevant data is required to categorise the textiles being assessed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111425876">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The friction between fabric and skin and the fabric surface roughness are two important components in evaluation of the sensorial comfort of fabrics and materials. The force required to move the fabric along the skin during the fabric–skin contact is opposed by the frictional force created by that contact. When the applied force exceeds the frictional force, movement of fabric against the skin occurs. Frictional characteristics of sliding surfaces are described by the kinetic friction coefficient (<italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic>), which is defined as the ratio of the friction force, being parallel to the surfaces in contact, to the normal force pressing on the contacting surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650111425876">10</xref></sup> Textile researchers have offered numerous theories for the deviation of frictional behaviour of textile materials from that of solid materials. Generally, the frictional properties of fibrous assemblies are ascribed to a modified adhesion model where the major factors affecting the friction between textile substrates are the area of contact, the geometry of the surfaces, applied load and in some cases, the time of contact. In addition to adhesion, ploughing or shearing of surfaces being in contact is another component that is involved in sliding friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650111425876">11</xref></sup> While the topography of the outer surface of the sports garments has been broadly investigated in relation to their aerodynamic attributes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650111425876">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650111425876">14</xref></sup> the research of tribological aspects of inner surface of these garments are mainly focused on socks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111425876">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650111425876">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the movement of the fabric along the skin, the dynamic contact of textile material with the skin increases and the perception of roughness or smoothness is then evoked. In the majority of cases, the frictional force is higher for fabrics with a rough surface and lower for fabric with a smooth surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650111425876">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Occurrence of moisture in fabric–skin contact is positively correlated with the frictional force and thus with the perception of roughness: a fabric that is perceived to be comfortable under low humidity conditions may be perceived to be uncomfortable under high humidity or sweating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111425876">18</xref></sup> The effects of fibre type and moisture on measured fabric-to-skin friction were also assessed and compared by Kenins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111425876">19</xref></sup> and it was found that presence of moisture on the skin is more critical than fibre type or fabric construction parameters in determining fabric-to-skin friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111425876">9</xref></sup> In addition, Hes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650111425876">20</xref></sup> stated that a fabric gives an uncomfortable feeling to the underlying skin over the moisture regain due to the higher friction between the fabric and the skin. In other words, skin moisture and friction greatly contribute to the sensation of the unpleasantness of clothing in hot and damp environments and therefore, the clothing used for hot and moist environments should not only be designed to minimise skin wetness but also to reduce the sensation of roughness on its surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111425876">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650111425876">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surface roughness and friction of the compression hosiery were investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650111425876">21</xref></sup> using the Kawabata KES-FB standard evaluation system. This study was carried out on dry, relaxed textile fabric surfaces, without taking into consideration the possible effect of deformation of the knitted structure during practical wear (practical extension). Authors concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in the surface characteristics of the garments under investigation.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to investigate and compare the material surface characteristics of fabrics suitable for the sport compression garments under conditions similar to those when such garments are worn. The study quantitatively examines and evaluates the effects of fabric construction, physical structural parameters and especially fabric elastic deformation on the fabric surface topography as relevant to the practical wear of sport garments with negative fit made from it. In addition, the influence of the presence of moisture in the fabrics due to the sweat absorption during strenuous physical activity on the textile surface characteristics is addressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1350650111425876"><title>Experimental details</title>
<p>The surface properties and characteristics of the fabric samples were investigated under various conditions: in relaxed state and under various elastic strains both in dry and moist conditions. Earlier research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111425876">1</xref></sup> determined the range of practical extension for sport compression garments to be within 10–70%, which determined the selection of chosen elastic strains for experimental samples.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1350650111425876"><title>Materials and sample preparation</title>
<p>Commercial knitted fabric of single jersey construction of 0.0509 mm mean thickness, composing of 65% nylon and 35% elastane, made of continuous filament textured yarns and suitable for a compression sports garment was selected. The fabric was differently treated to form two groups of experimental samples:
<list id="list1-1350650111425876" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Group 1 (1F0-1F82) are the fabric samples in their standard conditioned state where the fabric samples were conditioned for 24 h to eliminate the influence of atmospheric moisture content according to AS 2001.1-1995.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650111425876">22</xref></sup> Sample 1F0 is in its relaxed state (0% strain). To apply various elastic strains, a perspex plate with smooth edges measuring 145 mm width, 175 mm length and 2 mm thickness was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111425876">Figure 1</xref>). The circumference of the plate in its width direction, taking into account the thickness, is 294 mm. Fabric sleeves are made of the size that provides strains to fabric samples of 13%, 26%, 41%, 56%, 69% and 82% in weft direction when they are stretched over the plate. The length of 20 mm was allowed at the both ends of the plate to ensure that the sample is under no warp strain and the weft strain is evenly distributed along the width of the plate when tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111425876">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Group 2 (2F0-2F82) are the fabric samples that were treated to a developed method where they were initially dried to the moisture content of 0% to determine their dry weight and then completely wetted by immersion in water for 1 min. The excess moisture was then squeezed out by passing the samples through the squeezing rollers of the padder mechanism twice, so that the fabric felt wet but not dripping with moisture, before testing. The fabrics were weighed again to determine the moisture pick-up as a percentage of their dry weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111425876">Figure 2</xref>). After weighing, each fabric was enclosed in a polyethylene bag to avoid any moisture loss, and then tested one by one for surface properties after 4 h of relaxation to avoid any possible influence of the squeezing rollers on the surface of the samples, therefore simulating the condition when fabric is next to the wearer’s skin and is saturated with the perspiration. The natural/maximum moisture contents of the studied samples during their practical use depend on environmental conditions, which were not determined during this research and are planned to be addressed in further, broader study.</p></list-item>

<p>As the research is focused on the effect of fabric strain on its stitch geometry and surface structure, and on their influence on the resultant surface characteristics, the size and distribution of clear pores not covered with yarns in experimental fabrics, becomes more relevant. In addition, experimental fabrics are tightly knitted with filament yarns and thus the inter-fibre and inter-yarn pores were not considered, and optical porosity values were used. Optical porosity (%) for samples of Group 1 was determined by calculating the % of the fabric surface not covered by comprising yarns. Images of all the test fabric samples were captured in relaxed and extended states with a Motic microscope and Image Tool UTHSCSA, Version 3 was used to calculate the number of white (yarn) and black (pores) pixels for the calculation of optical porosity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1350650111425876"><title>Fabric surface properties acquisition</title>
<p>To measure the fabric surface properties the KESFB4-A, Kato Tech Co. Ltd. evaluation system was used. Fabric surface properties were measured on the technical back of the fabric which is next to skin when the garments are worn. The characteristics of the technical face were not investigated in this study.</p>
<p>The system acquires data from two sensors measuring the frictional coefficient and the roughness of the fabric surface simultaneously in three different areas within a fabric sample of 20 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The frictional coefficient <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is calculated by averaging the output over the distance between 0 and 20 mm and is defined as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1350650111425876"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111425876-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is the kinetic friction coefficient, <italic>F</italic> the friction force and <italic>N</italic> the normal load (0.5 N in the KESFB4-A, evaluation system). The constant <italic>N</italic> of 0.5 N is a standard set load for KES that mimics general pressure of garments against the skin and was used as constant to reduce the number of variables being studied.</p>
<p>The geometrical Surface Roughness Mean Deviation (SMD) is the value obtained by eliminating the low frequency waviness by filtering the measurement data with a high-pass filter, extracting the waviness profile of wave lengths greater than 1 mm (frequencies smaller than 1 Hz) and by numerically integrating over the absolute value of the distance moved from the standard position along the path taken by the sensor and is expressed as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1350650111425876"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111425876-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>L</italic> is the evaluation length, <italic>z</italic> the local surface height, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> the standard sensor position and <italic>n</italic> the number of <italic>z</italic> data.</p>
<p>The value of the kinetic friction coefficient (<italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic>), the mean deviation of the coefficient of friction (MMD) and the roughness signal are individually and simultaneously recorded for the ‘forward and return’ stroke. Measurements were taken on each fabric sample three times along the warp direction and then three times along the weft direction.</p>
<p>All the fabrics were tested on the side which is next to wearer’s skin during the practical wear of the garments and the evaluation of the fabrics was carried out having particulars as follows.
<list id="list2-1350650111425876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The increase in value of <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is interpreted as indication of the increasing friction between the fabric and the skin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The increase in value of SMD (<italic>Ra</italic>) is interpreted as an increase in the surface roughness and surface irregularities.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1350650111425876"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All measurements were carried out each on three samples taken out of each experimental fabric/group. Data for <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> and SMD were acquired in three different areas within a fabric sample along warp direction and three times along weft direction at different locations per sample. Mean values were calculated as well as the SD for <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> and SMD of individual fabric samples of each group were calculated to demonstrate the variation in their individual surface properties. The data of each group for <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> and SMD are presented using bar charts having error bars representing SD (at 95% confidence interval) of the individual fabrics samples.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1350650111425876"><title>Fabric samples physical parameters</title>
<p>From physical parameters of experimental fabrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650111425876">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111425876">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111425876">4</xref>), it can be seen that when the fabrics diverge from their relaxed state (1F0) to various strains along the weft direction (1F13–1F82), physical parameters such as mass, number of wales per unit length and the stitch density change ultimately affecting the optical porosity and surface characteristics. As the amount of strain increases, the fabric structure changes resulting in lower mass/unit area, wales/unit length and thus lower stitch density. The decrease in stitch density is only due to decrease in number of wales per unit area, as the warp strain of fabrics is avoided and thus the number of courses/unit length remain the same.
<fig id="fig3-1350650111425876" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Microscopic images of 1F0, 1F26, 1F56 and 1F82 – technical face (outside the garment).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111425876-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig4-1350650111425876" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Microscopic images of 1F0, 1F26, 1F56 and 1F82 – technical back (next to skin).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111425876-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Since there are less yarns (wales) available to cover the area in strained fabric, the fabric under strain becomes more porous compared to its relaxed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111425876">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111425876">4</xref>), where more pores/air gaps are available within the fabric area under strain. It is expected that this will lead to the considerable change in the fabric surface topography that will influence the surface characteristics relevant to human tactile comfort. There is a clear difference observed in the change of the fabric topography under strain on the technical back (next to skin side) and technical face (outside the garment). Due to the fabric manufacturing method, where the needles responsible for forming wales in the fabric are in the fixed position, the technical face changes its surface topography from relatively homogeneous in the relaxed state (Sample 1F0) to the ‘channelled or ribbed’ appearance in the strained state. This phenomenon was also observed in earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111425876">15</xref></sup> and mostly has effect on the aerodynamic performance of tight-fitting sport garments.</p>
<p>The topography of technical back of the samples under strain changes but remains considerably more homogeneous compared to the technical face.</p>
<p>Fabric samples were observed to decrease in stitch density under strain as expected. Stitches are approximately stretched uniformly across the surface of the sample fabric, resulting in decreasing stitch density. Stitch density appears to decrease at a rate approximately proportional to the applied strain, with a strong demonstrated correlation of −0.924. In the absence of a detailed mechanical model, we may infer comfort properties of the fabric from the approximate stitch density due to strain.</p>
<p>Optical porosity was shown to increase at a greater rate than stitch density decreased, again approximately proportional to the applied strain. It was found that there was a strong positive correlation between strain and optical porosity of 0.949. This is the expected result as loop dimensions are constrained by the mechanical properties of the sample fabric, rather than the loop count.

<p>We observe that the friction due to moisture does not appear to be related to the degree of fabric elastic deformation, and therefore we can assume that the change in mechanical properties due to moisture is due entirely to moisture-related characteristics. We observe that the introduction of moisture is statistically significant for friction under ANOVA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00227), whereas effect of fabric strain on <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is not statistically significant. The reason is that the fabrics under investigation have considerably fine micro-structure and thus its deformation due to various strains is comparatively very small, and thus its effect on kinetic friction coefficient is consequently small.</p>
<p>Fabric samples overall have low <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> (below 0.25) both in dry and wet states, with <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> slightly higher for wet fabrics. The strain imposed on fabric samples affect the fabric’s smoothness insignificantly despite the changes in the surface geometry. Kinetic friction coefficient <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> of samples under strain became lower on the skin side of the fabrics in comparison to relaxed fabric 1F0 by an average of 12%. This is due to the fact that since there are fewer yarns available per surface area, there are less contact points in the fabric surface resulting in the lower kinetic friction coefficient <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic>. Meantime, the effect of the strain increases from the 13% to 82% on <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is not significant.</p>
<p>The experimental samples, as observed earlier from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111425876">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111425876">4</xref> have quite homogeneous surface topography on the technical back resulting in low variation of their SMD recorded from both groups of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111425876">Figure 6</xref>) under varying strain.</p>
<p>As the strain is increased from the relaxed state, the asperity height of the surface of Group 1 generally decreased, with exception of 4% increase in 1F13, which is negligible. From the microscopic photos of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111425876">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111425876">4</xref>), it could be observed that the surface geometry of the technical back (next to skin side) of the fabric samples changed due to various strains along the weft direction resulting in flatter surface, reduction in irregularity and thus reduction in SMD. Surface roughness of fabric samples in Group 2 is generally lower than Group 1. This could be due to the presence of moisture in yarns between the fibres resulted in swelling of the yarns which reduced the asperity heights of the wetted fabric surface. The reasons mentioned above result in lower surface irregularity in Group 2 of samples in comparison to Group 1, by average of 9%.</p>

<p>In general practice, in order to evaluate the tribological properties of fabrics, fabric samples are tested in relaxed dry state. However, in many applications such as garments which are worn next to the skin with negative fit, the fabrics are strained over the body when garments are worn. Furthermore, in sport applications, a considerable amount of moisture from the sweat and in some cases from the environment is present in the garment. The influence of practical elastic deformation by itself, and in combination with the presents of moisture on the surface characteristics of fabrics relevant to their sensorial properties have not been considered in earlier studies and is addressed in this research. The effects of fabric construction, physical structural parameters and especially fabric elastic deformation on the fabric surface topography were studied. To reduce the number of variables at this first stage of research the experimental normal load on the fabric surface was kept constant using the standard load of the KESFB4-A, namely 0.5 N. As the normal load on the skin being in contact with fabric in garments with negative fit changes with the change of applied garment strains, further investigation of the effects of fabric parameters and variable loads on its tribological behaviour will be required.</p>
<p>The fabric samples under investigation are representative of fabrics used commercially in sport garments with negative fit. The fabric is objectively evaluated for physical properties and surface characteristics in terms of sensorial comfort. The applied strains in fabric samples have obvious effect on their basic physical parameters and structural properties: strain along weft direction causes change in mass per unit area, stitch density and optical porosity of fabrics. There is a correlation between the amount of strain, change in mass per unit area and optical porosity of fabrics. The stitch density has decreased and optical porosity has increased with increase in strain applied along the weft direction.</p>
<p>Moreover, change in structure of the fabric samples due to applied strain leads to change in the surface characteristics of fabrics resulting in wider loops and larger spaces between the vertical rows of fabric wales. This affects the amount of contact points in the fabric surface as well as its asperity height, which is demonstrated in resultant change of both the kinetic friction coefficient and SMD. The static friction coefficient was only indirectly investigated in this study.

</list></p>
<p>As the sliding of garments in this study on skin was tested at very small speeds, the conclusion of <italic>µ<sub>s</sub></italic> = <italic>µ<sub>k</sub></italic> is justified.</p>
<p>The study of effect of various strains on fabric friction suggests that the kinetic friction coefficient is lower in strained samples, which means that the fabric would feel smoother next to the skin when worn compared to when it is in its relaxed state. As the loops are widened resulting in less contact points between the fabric and the skin, the friction became lower; hence, the fabric under strain will be perceived to be smoother. As the asperity heights of the surface of fabric samples decrease, as result of the applied strain, the surface roughness decreases as well. Both kinetic friction coefficient and SMD decreased with the increase in the degree of strain.</p>
<p>The presence of moisture increases the friction and the feeling of fabric clinging to the skin. This may cause an unpleasant sensation, if the garment becomes wet when worn. However, the kinetic friction coefficient in wet samples in the study remained relatively low, which means that for these fabrics and garments their saturation with sweat will not lead to strong unpleasant sensation. Group 2 (wet) samples had a slightly higher kinetic friction coefficient than dry samples (on average by 15%). This is likely caused by the surface tension, boundary adhesion, capillary forces formation at the contact interface and, possibly to some extent, by the formation of hydrogen bonds created by the moisture present in the fabrics. This increase in friction due to moisture is expected, and confirms earlier studies and observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111425876">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111425876">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111425876">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350650111425876">29</xref></sup> regarding garment comfort under conditions of precipitation, humidity and sweat. We concluded that the friction due to moisture does not appear to be related to the degree of fabric elastic deformation, and therefore the change in mechanical properties due to moisture is due entirely to moisture-related characteristics. Effect of fabric strain on friction coefficient is not statistically significant both in dry and wet fabrics. This insignificance is due to the fine homogeneous fabric surface micro-structure, especially on the side worn next to skin, and the result of this study is indirectly in agreement with earlier research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650111425876">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the fabric under investigation has low friction and regular surface on the next to skin side in both relaxed and strained states, comparatively. It is important to take into consideration the effect of moisture presence in the fabric on the sensorial comfort of the garments with negative fit, and the particular attention has to be paid to the moisture management properties of the fabrics used.</p>
