<p>In <italic>Labour and Employment in a Globalising World: Autonomy, Collectives and Political Dilemmas</italic>, Christian Azaïs compiles 12 essays by authors from various epistemological perspectives. This book takes a multidisciplinary and multiregional approach, and endeavors to contextualize the current dynamics between labor, employment and political globalization.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts: <italic>Institutional Frameworks, Decentralisation and Specialisation of Labour and Employer Associations</italic> and <italic>Individual Autonomy vs. Collective Responsibility in a World of Flexible Labour</italic>. In each part, the authors comment on issues relating to globalized employment from both the micro and macro levels, focusing on the transformational aspects of globalized labor markets in relation to Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States, utilizing multiple disciplinary frameworks in analyzing each area.</p>
<p>Part I discusses globalized labor trends through an institutional lens, specifically focusing on public policy covering Brazil, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. The authors focus on how local actors adapt to international employment trends by comparing various regions that have been affected by globalized labor.</p>
<p>Part II focuses on two central concepts: decentralization and specialization. The former has a spatial component, the later has an organizational one. The authors focus on both the private and public institutions and the labor-management interactions between the two in the context of globalization.</p>
<p>Part III addresses the issues of autonomy in the workplace. Labor market’s flexibility has caused tensions between autonomy and the workplace, a tension which is not clearly defined. The authors also reflect on the individual’s autonomy in relation to collective responsibility, and looks at the overall meaning of autonomy in the workplace.</p>
<p>While these articles are written by scholars from various fields covering a wide range of regions, the entire book focuses on a single theme: labor and contemporary globalization. By bridging globalization as a single process that is standardized and differentiated, these essays construct a coherent view of globalized labor in the modern era. This book is important and useful for political scientists, legal theorists, economists, and sociologists concerned with the dynamics of the world of work in the context of contemporary globalization.</p>
