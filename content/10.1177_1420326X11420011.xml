<abstract>
<p>A light pipe system is a simple daylighting device that allows the natural daylight to enter into interior spaces or underground spaces where access to windows or skylights is restricted. The use of a light pipe system can enhance illuminance without the use of artificial lighting and thus would reduce energy consumption significantly. This paper presents a performance prediction method of a light pipe system based on the amount of daylight admitted and energy saved by not needing electric lighting. The newly developed model was compared with the existing prediction model under the Korean climate conditions, to illustrate the reliability and robustness of the method. Energy saving potential due to the use of a light pipe system was determined with a due consideration of the different artificial lighting control methods (on and off control, two-step control, dimming control), demonstrating a possible saving in lighting energy usage of up to 30% in average. This study should encourage a wider application of light-pipe system in Korea especially in high rise buildings where day-lighting could be limiting; thus increasing the options for architectural design for building application.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11420011" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of natural light has the potential for improving both the energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality in buildings and this is an important aspect in many green building certification systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11420011">1</xref>]. In office buildings, lighting could constitute about 25–35% of the total energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11420011">2</xref>]. Therefore, considerable amount of energy can be saved by a properly designed lighting system. There are studies in literature reporting the design of energy-efficient lighting systems integrating with daylight; including: using LED based on occupancy sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11420011">3</xref>] or incorporating daylight system such as light pipe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11420011">4</xref>] or application of fibre solar concentrator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11420011">5</xref>]. A light-pipe system can introduce daylight to spaces that would otherwise not benefit from the advantages of daylight penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11420011">6</xref>]. Light pipe system can be used as a primary or secondary light source with benefits of energy, productivity and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11420011">7</xref>]. For the light-pipe system to be widely used in Korea, it is important to quantify its daylighting and energy performance with due consideration regarding the effects imposed by the local climate conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11420011">4</xref>]. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop light pipe predictive model to identify practical solution that would both meet lighting requirements and deliver energy savings.</p>
<p>This paper presents the lighting and energy performance prediction of light pipe system used under Korean climate conditions, using the developed model for this study, and compared the performance evaluation against existing predictive models currently available, with the experimental data. Energy saving potential due to the light pipe system was determined according to the different artificial lighting control methods (on/off control, two-step control, dimming control).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11420011"><title>Light Pipe Prediction Models</title>
<p>There are several existing models for predicting the daylight performance of light pipes. Earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420011">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11420011">9</xref>] theoretically derived daylight transmission models for straight light pipe systems. Recently, semi-empirical prediction models based on the experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11420011">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11420011">14</xref>] were developed by several researchers.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11420011"><title>Theoretical Light Pipe Prediction Models</title>
<p>Zastrow and Wittwer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420011">8</xref>] determines the transmission function of light pipe system by determining the average length of light pipe projected vector on the plane (<italic>D<sub>effective</sub></italic>) and reflection of the surface of the light pipe. However, Zastrow and Wittwer model was only validated with a 0.12 m length light pipe with a side length of 0.01 m and an internal reflectance of 0.95. The transmission T is then obtained as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1420326X11420011"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>R</italic> is the reflectivity of the light pipe, <italic>l</italic> the length of the pipe, <italic>θ</italic> the angle of incidence of the illuminating radiation with respect to the light pipe axis and <italic>d</italic> the diameter of the pipe (<italic>D<sub>effective</sub></italic> = π<italic>d</italic>/4).</p>
<p>Swift and Smith model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11420011">9</xref>] predicts the integral number of reflections regarding the transmission of light through light pipes. Swift and Smith model was based on both theoretical and experimental perspective in examining the parameters that could affect the transmission of light pipes. However, Swift and Smith model considers light rays penetration into the light pipes only in one direction. The transmission function is obtained as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1420326X11420011"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>p</italic> is the aspect ratio of the pipe length to the diameter.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11420011"><title>Semi-Empirical Light Pipe Prediction Models</title>
<p>Using an experimental data, Zhang and Muneer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11420011">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11420011">11</xref>] predicted a Daylight Penetration Factor (DPF) of light pipe. The main factors influencing a DPF were both light pipe’s configuration and the climate conditions such as solar altitude and sky clearness parameters. The coefficients were derived from an experimental analysis and are produced as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1420326X11420011"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>Jenkins and Muneer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11420011">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11420011">13</xref>] developed a model by considering dimensions of the pipe and relationship of the aspect ratio of the pipe to the light transmitted at diffuser level. Jenkins and Muneer model uses experimental data to approximate the transmission of a pipe as a function of aspect ratio. The luminous flux of the pipe is given by:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1420326X11420011"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The final illuminance predictive model was developed as a quartic cosine model. The model could predict illuminance at any point below the diffuser for both straight (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1420326X11420011">Equation (5)</xref>) and elbow (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1420326X11420011">Equation (6)</xref>) type light pipes. Jenkins and Muneer models are as follows:

</p>
<p>Yun and Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11420011">14</xref>] developed a light pipe predictive model based on existing models (Zhang and Muneer, Jenkins and Muneer). The coefficients of predictive models were determined by using linear regression analysis between DPF values and local climate factors. Then the empirical parts of the existing models were replaced. Among ten predictive models, five models (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1420326X11420011">Equations (7)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-1420326X11420011">11</xref>)) were statistically significant which are as follows:

<p>The new model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-1420326X11420011">Equation (12)</xref>) was developed based on an existing model (Yun and Kim) and experimental data. The experiment was carried out in Korea with the light pipe’s aspect ratio of 2.0 and 5.2. The detailed description of the experimental setting was described in references 5 and 15. The new model considers the solar altitude and sky clearness index as a local climate factors.

<p>The new models and existing models predicted illuminance results were computed and evaluated against experimental data. The predictive models were assessed by using the mean bias error (MBE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), which are, respectively, defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula13-1420326X11420011">Equations (13)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula14-1420326X11420011">14</xref>) as:

<sec id="sec9-1420326X11420011"><title>Predicted Lighting Performance of Light Pipe</title>
<p>The daylight performance of a light pipe system using a prediction model was evaluated by analysing under different sky conditions a cumulative frequency of work plane illuminance of locations; each situated 1.5 m away from a centre of the light pipe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11420011">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11420011">4</xref>). Regarding cumulative horizontal plane illuminance, a range of interior horizontal plane illuminance widened in direct proportion to external illuminance. Depending on a sky condition, a light pipe centre (A1) showed a frequency of interior illuminance that differed by forty-fold on average, with 1.5 m location (A2) eight-fold, 3 m location (A3) sixteen-fold, while the lowest frequency difference was found under a partly overcast sky condition.

<p>Under a clear sky condition, a cumulative frequency of illuminance was distributed up to 1150 lx at the light pipe centre (A1), 800 lx at 1.5 m location (A2), and 250 lx at 3 m location (A2). All three locations resulted in a distribution exceeding 10%. In comparison to the CIE illuminance recommendation (100 lx) at the general building’s entrance hall, circulation areas and corridors, and a rest room, A1 location showed 95% satisfaction level along with A2’s 85% and A3’s 59%, hence, under a clear sky condition.</p>
<p>Under a partly overcast sky condition, a cumulative frequency of illuminance was distributed up to 750 lx at the light pipe centre (A1), 400 lx at 1.5 m location (A2), and 100 lx at 3 m location (A2). All three locations again resulted in a distribution exceeding 10%. Setting 100 lx as a standard, over 80% was met from the light pipe centre to 1.5 m distance while only 30% was met at the 3 m distance. Under an overcast sky condition, all A1, A2 and A3 locations met the 100 lx illuminance recommendation by less than 30%.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11420011"><title>Predicted Lighting Energy Saving of Light Pipe</title>
<p>For a light pipe’s lighting energy consumption, a comparative analysis between an artificial lighting design and light pipe consolidated design using three types of lighting control method (on-off, two step and dimming) was implemented based on a prediction model. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11420011">Figure 5</xref> which illustrates the monthly lighting energy consumption, on-off, two-step and dimming all dropped to the lowest during April while surging to the highest during December. Setting “without daylight” as a standard (526 kWh), an on-off system would save the energy consumption by 15% while a two-step system and a dimming system would save 25% and 34%, respectively. The minimum energy consumption level could be achieved when a dimming system was used in a combination with a light pipe system.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11420011" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Monthly lighting energy consumption.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>When lighting energy consumption was analysed under different sky conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11420011">Figure 6</xref>), an amount of variation in lighting energy consumption due to a change in sky condition was found to be slightly higher under a two-step system compared to the other control methods. Giving attention to the amount of lighting energy saved per control method under different sky conditions, the on-off and two-step systems consumed the least energy under a clear sky condition in contrast to a dimming system, which did under a partly overcast sky condition.
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11420011" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Lighting energy consumption and lighting energy saving under clear, partly overcast and overcast sky conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420011-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Under a clear sky condition, the lighting energy consumption of a dimming system was 1.2 times less than the on-off and two-step systems. The discrepancy, however, increased under a partly overcast sky condition such that it was 1.2 times between a two-step and a dimming system, while increasing to 1.7 times between a two-step and dimming system. This upward trend continued under an overcast sky condition. The discrepancy then increased to 3 times between a two-step and a dimming system, and surprisingly 17 times versus the on-off system. Therefore, it turned out that the dimming system showed a drastic reduction in lighting energy consumption especially under an overcast sky condition.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11420011" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study developed semi-empirical model for predicting light pipe’s daylighting and energy performance. The new model adopted existing model’s basic formula and coefficients were determined by using regression analysis of solar altitude and sky clearness index. Comparisons were made between the experimental data and predictive models. The results showed that the new model did better reflect the experimental data than the existing predictive models.</p>
<p>The predicted indoor illuminance level of light pipe could provide 100 lx for most of the daytime under clear and partly overcast sky conditions in Korea. This indicated that the light pipe with an aspect ratio of 5.2 would prove to be an efficient independent light source, providing a lighting coverage of 36 m<sup>2</sup> areas that would require 100 lx of illuminance level such as building’s entrance hall, circulation area etc. Under overcast sky condition, supplementary electric lighting was required to meet the recommended illuminance level. However, considering the fact that over 70% of the sky condition of Korea is clear and partly overcast, the application of a light pipe would provide a high potential daylighting system in buildings in Korea. Moreover, the daylighting predictions were made under windowless space, thus the potential for light pipe’s daylight availability could be increased when this is installed in other building conditions.</p>
<p>The daylight performance of light pipes is strongly influenced by the type of sky conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11420011">14</xref>]. Due to this variation of sky condition, sometimes it is hard to achieve uniform illuminance level in indoor space. Therefore, integrating light pipe with proper lighting controls would be a practical solution for both lighting requirements and energy savings. In this study, the light pipe integrating with dimming system showed lowest lighting energy use than the other lighting control types. Especially, highest decreasing rate of lighting energy use for a dimming system was shown under partly overcast sky condition which is the most common sky condition in Korea. This implies that a dimming system would give the most positive potential for energy savings from light pipes.</p>
<p>The results also indicated that the CO<sub>2</sub> emission due to electric energy production could be reduced by the use of light pipe. Assuming that the value of CO<sub>2</sub> emission from electric energy production is 422 g/kWh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11420011">17</xref>], then a dimming system could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission up to 27%, while a two-step system could reduce 21% and an on-off system could reduce 15%.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11420011" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The new predictive model of a light pipe have been developed and validated with the experimental data. Based on the predicted daylight performance, the lighting energy consumption and energy saving rate via light pipe and various lighting controls were determined. The predicted daylighting and energy performance of light pipe showed that the light pipe can be both a primary and secondary light source during daytime. The predicted lighting energy saving potential due to the light pipe was 27% on average. Especially, consolidating light pipe with dimming system would substantially reduce the lighting energy use. Our findings proved that the light pipe installed under Korean climate conditions can contribute both in increasing daylight availability and energy efficiency. Further investigation of the relationship between the solar radiation and light pipe performance will be conducted. Also, prediction in various climate conditions will be evaluated to produce more reliable and adaptable prediction model of light pipe.</p></sec></body>
