<abstract>
<p>Intraoperative cell salvage of the cardiopulmonary bypass residual volume can dilute platelets and coagulation factors. This is a report of a randomised control trial of 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was processed and transfused after surgery in the cell salvage group and the residual volume was transfused unprocessed in the control group. The coagulation profile was measured using the Rotem<sup>®</sup> thrombelastometry system. Mean (SD) maximum clot firmness after surgery was 52.8 (5.4) mm in the cell salvage group compared to 57.2 (5.0) mm in the control group (p=0.04). Clot formation time was prolonged after surgery by 39 (27) s in the cell saver group compared to 19 (17) s in the control group (p=0.045). Platelet count was reduced after surgery by 96 (32) x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup> in the cell saver group and 70 (19) x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup> in the control group (p=0.03). Blood volume in the chest drains 4 hours after surgery was similar in both groups. There was a strong association between clot formation time after surgery and blood loss (R = 0.68, p=0.001). The increase in blood loss was 4.1 ml for every one-second increase in clot formation time (95% CI 1.9 - 6.4, p=0.001). Cell salvage of the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume reduced platelet numbers and prolonged clot formation time and maximum clot firmness was less in this group.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intraoperative cell salvage (CS) can reduce blood transfusions in cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111432567">1</xref></sup>. The residual cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, also sometimes referred to as pump blood volume, may be processed by CS before transfusion in an attempt to increase the haematocrit and reduce heparin load, but this may dilute platelets and coagulation factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111432567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111432567">3</xref></sup>. A pilot study was performed to examine the relationship between processing the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume and the viscoelastic properties of clot formation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Processing the residual circuit volume through the cell saver system results in the extraction of platelets and plasma clotting proteins during the centrifugal washing phase. The end product results in concentrated red cells that are then transfused back to the patient. Processing large volumes of residual circuit volume may result in a subsequent coagulopathy that could cause increased blood loss in the postoperative phase.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The local Research Ethics Committee approved the study and all participants gave informed written consent. A randomised controlled pilot study was conducted with 10 patients in each group. The person performing the thrombelastometry (CH) was blinded to the patient’s group. All patients were scheduled for elective first-time coronary bypass surgery. Patients older than 70 years of age, those with a known clotting deficiency, those taking warfarin or antiplatelet drugs within 5 days of surgery, or those who had a pre operative platelet count &lt;150 x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup> were excluded. Patients were randomised by sealed envelope prior to induction of anaesthesia. Primary outcome measures were thrombelastometric parameters, platelet count after surgery and the amount of blood present in chest drains in the first 4 hours. INTEM (ellagic acid activated intrinsic pathway) clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness and FIBTEM (tissue factor-triggered extrinsic pathway with platelet inhibitor) maximum clot firmness were measured by Rotem<sup>®</sup> (Pentapharm, Munich, Germany) thrombelastometry. A continuous auto transfusion system (C.A.T.S., Fresenius Hemocare GmbH, Bad Homberg, Germany) was used. In the CS group, blood was salvaged prior to the administration of heparin and after reversal with protamine and the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was processed before transfusion after bypass. CS was not used in the control group and the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was transfused unprocessed after protamine administration. In both groups, cardiotomy blood was returned to the venous reservoir. Data and multivariate analysis was performed using SPSS version 13 (Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Perioperative care</title>
<p>Anaesthesia included fentanyl 10μg.kg<sup>−1</sup>, pancuronium 0.1mg.kg<sup>−1</sup>, propofol and isoflurane. Antifibrinolitic drugs were not used. The cardiopulmonary bypass system included a S5 roller pump (Stockert Instrumente GmbH, Munich, Germany). A Quadrox hollow-fibre oxygenator with VHK 2001 hard-shell venous reservoir and Quart arterial line filter (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) was used. The Vanguard Cardioplegia System (Sorin Biomedica, Mirandola, Italy) facilitated blood cardioplegia. The cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was primed with 2 litres of Hartmann’s solution and heparin 10,000 IU. During bypass, 200ml of 10% mannitol was infused. Patients were cooled to 28°C. Blood flow was non-pulsatile, with an index of 1.8 to 2.4 L.min<sup>−1.</sup>m<sup>−2</sup>.</p>

<p>After surgery, the mean (SD) INTEM maximum clot firmness was 52.8 (5.4) mm in the CS group compared with 57.2 (5.0) mm in the control (p=0.04). Clot formation time was slightly longer in the CS group compared to control, but this was not significant (110 (32) s and 89 (25) s, respectively, p=0.07). However, the mean (SD) increase in clot formation time after surgery in the CS group (39 (27) s) compared to control (19 (17) s) was greater (p=0.045). Six out of 10 patients in the CS group had clot formation times greater than 100s after surgery compared to two patients in the control group (p=0.09, Fisher’s exact test). The FIBTEM maximum clot firmness in the CS group after surgery was 13.0 (2.9) mm compared to 15.7 (3.1) mm in the control group (p=0.04).</p>
<p>After surgery, the platelet count was similar in the two groups, but the mean (SD) reduction in platelet count in the CS group was 96 (32) x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup> compared to 70 (19) x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup> in the control group (p=0.03). The mean (SD) volume of blood collected in the chest drains 4 hours after surgery in the CS group was 382 (211) ml compared to 348 (117) ml in the control group (p=0.3). One patient in the CS group underwent re-operation for bleeding. Two patients in the CS group and one in the control group received a platelet transfusion.</p>
<p>A mutually adjusted multivariate analysis of the association between post-bypass viscoelastic clot properties, platelet count, haemoglobin concentration and blood in the chest drains within the first 4 hours after surgery was performed. With backwards exclusion of non-significant associations and adjustment for treatment group, post-operative bleeding was found to be independently associated only with clot formation time (increase in bleeding per one-second increase in clot formation time = 4.1 ml, (95% CI 1.9 - 6.4, p=0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659111432567" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that CS reduced the rate of exposure to red blood cells (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39-0.92, p=0.02)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111432567">1</xref></sup>. This may be achieved by salvaging blood lost during surgery and processing the residual cardiopulmonary bypass before transfusion. Although processing the residual cardiopulmonary bypass fluid can cause a dilution of platelets and coagulation factors, this practice did not cause an increase in bleeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111432567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111432567">3</xref></sup>, nor did it alter plasma-based assays of coagulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111432567">3</xref></sup>. Daane and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111432567">3</xref></sup> also found impaired haemostasis after the transfusion of both unprocessed and processed residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume. No significant differences were found between the groups in the measured coagulation parameters, nor were there significant differences in the fibrinogen concentration. However their group used plasma-based assays of coagulation which discounted the role of platelets and red blood cells. Point-of-care devices have been shown optimally to assess coagulation and management of bleeding after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111432567">4</xref></sup>. Thrombelastometry gauges how cardiopulmonary bypass affects clot initiation, thrombin formation and initial fibrin polymeration (clotting time), fibrin polymeration and clot stabilisation (clot formation time) and eventual clot firmness through the interaction of fibrinogen and platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111432567">4</xref></sup>. This study found a highly significant decrease after cardiopulmonary bypass in maximum clot firmness and an increase in clotting time and clot formation time in both groups. In addition, INTEM and FIBTEM maximum clot firmness was less when the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was processed. Although maximum clot firmness remained within the normal range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111432567">5</xref></sup>, it implied that both fibrinogen and platelet activity were further inhibited. CS of the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume also prolonged clot formation time to a greater degree than transfusing the residual volume unprocessed. Six out of 10 patients in the CS group had abnormally prolonged clot formation times (greater than 100s) compared to two patients in the control group. There was no difference in blood loss between patients who had CS and controls, but this study was not powered to detect this and larger studies did not observe increased bleeding when CS was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111432567">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between blood loss and clot formation time after surgery regardless of whether patients had CS or not. Also, there was an inverse correlation between postoperative platelet count and bleeding, but not independently from the clot formation time. Although the relationship between postoperative clot formation time (and platelet count) and bleeding was strong, the effect of CS on these parameters was relatively small (any effect is likely to be &lt;100ml over the first 4 hours) and unlikely to be clinically significant. Klein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111432567">5</xref></sup> previously showed a lower platelet count (19 x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup>) after cardiac surgery in patients who had CS, but they did not observe an increase in postoperative blood loss at six hours. Possible explanations for this are the small decrease in platelet numbers when CS was used, the wide range of blood loss and the multifactor nature of postoperative bleeding.</p>
<p>Others have looked at predictors of postoperative blood loss after cardiac surgery. Karkouti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111432567">6</xref></sup> found that pre-existing thrombocytopenia was an important predictor and the risk most pronounced when platelet counts were less than 100 x 10<sup>9</sup>.L<sup>−1</sup>. Cammerer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111432567">7</xref></sup> found post-bypass point-of-care tests were better predictors of subsequent bleeding. Also, using thrombelastometry, they found the α angle to be the strongest predictor of postoperative blood loss. The α angle is closely related to the clot formation time as the α angle determines how quickly the clot thickness will progress from 2mm to 20mm, i.e., the clot formation time. It is, therefore, not surprising that postoperative tests are better predictors of bleeding as they take into account intraoperative blood loss, haemodilution and bypass, all of which alter coagulation.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study results was that the small group numbers probably accounted for the failure to show significant differences in platelet numbers and clot formation time between the groups, hence, the need to look at changes in these parameters. A pilot study was chosen to generate data on which it would be possible to inform a powered investigation of the impact of CS on the coagulation profile following CPB. Other studies have reported a reduction of platelet count when residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was cell salvaged, but this is the first study to suggest that this process alters viscoelastic properties of clot formation over and above the effects of bypass. The desire to increase the haematocrit of the residual cardiopulmonary bypass fluid with CS needs to be balanced against a further impairment in coagulation. This effect is likely to be significant only if large volumes of residual bypass fluid are processed. This study also confirms that blood loss in the first four hours after surgery is most closely related to post-bypass clot formation time.</p>
