<p>Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) and Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) were born within two years of each other and within the same political and social world of colonial Bengal. And yet, there is also a lot that sets them apart. One of them was a world renouncing ascetic while the other consistently set his face against a metaphysical disenchantment with the world (<italic>bairagya</italic>) and asceticism. One used sensuous poetry to give expression to his deepest yearnings; the other took this to be signs of sentimentalism and effeminacy. For one, God was ultimately Transcendent, for the other, He was equally Immanent and sublimely manifest in the human heart. One of them categorically rejected political praxis; the other, while critical of contemporary politics, remained acutely sensitive to political questions. The interesting quality about the book under review is the way it draws together the two figures in a common analytical framework notwithstanding such differences.</p>
<p>By the time both Tagore and Vivekananda had grown up to be young men, important shifts had taken place within social and political life in Bengal and elsewhere. For one, the spirit of reformism and innovation had begun to be affected by a conservative backlash and the hardening of social attitudes. Disenchanted with an earlier faith in the ‘regenerative’ character of British rule, many had taken to cultural myth-making and more violent paths of political resistance. It is indeed extraordinary that at a time when giving in to regressive cultural insularity and puerile political passions would have looked quite natural, both Tagore and Vivekananda stayed clear of these. In their own ways, both fought religious and cultural orthodoxies in an environment otherwise charged with reaction and confronted retributive violence with overtures of sanity and goodwill. Above all, their writings and speeches had deep experiential content, not arid theory and their reading of history made to rest on thoughtful convictions, not empty rhetoric.</p>
<p>Mukherji’s work essentially comprises three essays: one each on Tagore and Vivekananda and a third on what may be loosely called the ‘phenomenology of nationalism’. Interested readers will find the author’s survey of nation-formation and nationalism (Chapter 1) quite informative and insightful. By comparison, his handling of certain key terms like ‘Renaissance’ and ‘social reform’ within the context of nineteenth century India looks less fulsome at places. For instance, Mukherji overlooks the historical and conceptual problems inherent in the application of the term ‘Renaissance’ to literary and cultural developments in colonial India. Drawing parallels between the European Renaissance and the Indian such as many Indian thinkers of this era attempted, loses sight of the fact that one was never as transformative in content or character as the other. I had difficulties too in accepting our author’s claim that the Indian Renaissance and the movement for social reform were pan-Indian in character. Quite to the contrary, it was the unevenness and idiosyncracy inherent in regional cultures which failed to produce the unity that could be more readily mobilised in the name of anti-colonialism. Also, the character of social reform movements in various regions of India was markedly different. Arguably, Bengal was more preoccupied with religious reform than the social and radical, subaltern challenges from below never surfaced in this province with the same effectiveness as was the case in Maharashtra or south India.</p>
<p>In his essays on Tagore and Vivekananda, Mukherji aptly critiques a range of scholars, the present reviewer not excepted, for their naive misrepresentation of certain abiding qualities in these figures. Romila Thapar, for instance, is accused of reading Tagore far too much in the traditionalist–Orientalist mould when it came to portraying certain characters from classical Sanskrit literature. Apparently, such misrepresentations are also partly derived from an inadequate familiarity with Tagore’s works; many of his prose works are still unavailable in translation even when these hold the key to an understanding of some important dimensions of his life and work. In the case of Vivekananda, Mukherji is clearly unhappy with attempts to label the Swami as a ‘revivalist’ or his movement as some form of ‘Hindu revivalism’. This is reminiscent of the critique developed some years ago by the historian Tapan Raychaudhuri who found the expression ‘Hindu revivalism’ inept since Hinduism, in his opinion, had never been dead. As I recall, my quip, at the time, was that it was the dying that could be revived, not the dead and that this was a distinction of which our historical actors were well aware. The conceptual error underlying any rigid separation of the categories ‘reform’ and ‘revival’ lies in overlooking the fact that revivalism always implied a degree of reform, however selectively. And what else may one call the sudden resurgence of interest in Vedanta in a province such as Bengal if not a revival? When Rammohun turned to the serious study of the Upanishads, some of his orthodox opponents found these texts to be forgeries! Befittingly, the cultural hermeneutics of Rammohun and Vivekananda, the two best known Vedantins from Bengal, were oriented towards social and spiritual regeneration, not an uncritical acceptance of tradition.</p>
<p>The ‘alternative vision’ that Tagore and Vivekananda shared between them may be said to rest on the following paradigms. First, there is the refusal to privilege political reform over the social. Neither of these figures appears to have attached much meaning to a synthetic unity of political will that obscured deep-rooted social inequities or fissures. In their understanding, true empowerment rested not on the capacity to wield political power but to make the right social and moral choices. Second, their concern was not so much with the collective, as was indeed the case with a thinker like Bankim Chandra, as the individual. For both Tagore and Vivekananda, the individual was the primary reference point to all human experiences. Reform, as Mukherji rightly puts it (p. 173), would be central to their vision so long as it was individuated and introspective. Tagore humanised religion and Vivekananda divinised man, thereby underscoring the seamless unity of God and His creation. To this may be added their genuine concern for the masses, a quality that anticipates and complements Gandhian programmes. Tagore rediscovered his soul amidst the poor and hapless tenant-farmers in his east Bengal estates and there has rarely been a more evocative expression than ‘<italic>daridranarayan</italic>’, employed by Vivekananda to indicate just how the concern for fellow man could commingle with the spiritual quest for the Divine. Third, and quite aptly too, Mukherji refuses to associate either of these figures with mere anti-colonialism and de-colonisation. For both, I imagine, the more pressing need was to decolonise not so much the body as the mind. Theirs was a nobler enterprise which sought to arrest gross materialism and moral insensitivity in man and replace these with spontaneous love and empathy. It is here that Tagore’s schemes of rural reconstruction, his trenchant critique of aggressive capitalistic nationalism and attempts to bring about a confluence of minds and cultures parallels the ‘man making’ project of Vivekananda. For both, education and self-belief was the key to the recovery and rehabilitation of the self. For both, <italic>mukti</italic> or <italic>moksha</italic> was less an eschatological principle and more an upward flight into human spirit and excellence. Swami Vivekananda once remarked that Vedanta would indeed be more meaningful in such societies that had gained a measure of moral and social freedom.</p>
<p>‘An alternative vision’ is a book that I would readily recommend to anybody enthused by the history of ideas. I commend it also for the unpretentious yet persuasive way in which it presses us to lessen the burden of our own certitudes: it asks us to be kind and less dogmatic when visiting our pasts. I have very much enjoyed reading and reflecting on this work and so, I trust, will many others.</p>
