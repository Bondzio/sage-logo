<abstract>
<p>Despite recent shifts in research emphasizing the value of carefully designed experiments, the number of studies of teacher professional development with rigorous designs has lagged behind its student outcome counterparts. We outline a framework for the design of group randomized trials (GRTs) with teachers’ knowledge as the outcome and consider mathematics and reading knowledge outcomes designed to assess the types of content problems that teachers encounter in practice. To estimate design parameters, we draw on a national sample of teachers for mathematics and a state Reading First sample to estimate for reading. Our results suggest that there is substantial clustering of teachers’ knowledge within schools and professional development GRTs will likely need increased sample sizes to account for this clustering.</p>

<p>Teacher development is seen as critical to improving the quality of U.S. schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162373713482766">Darling-Hammond &amp; Sykes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162373713482766">The Holmes Group, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162373713482766">National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, 1997</xref>). Professional development is increasingly viewed as one of the primary levers for improving teaching quality and ultimately student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162373713482766">Correnti, 2007</xref>). One factor that is driving interest in professional development is rapidly mounting evidence that teachers vary greatly in their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482766">Nye, Konstantopoulous, &amp; Hedges, 2004</xref>). Another is a growing recognition that there is much for teachers to learn if they are to realize ambitious new content standards for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162373713482766">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482766">Borko, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162373713482766">Putnam &amp; Borko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162373713482766">Wilson &amp; Berne, 1999</xref>). To this end, policymakers and funding agencies have directed considerable resources toward professional development studies focused on improving teacher preparedness and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162373713482766">Birman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482766">Borko, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, many argue that the current system of professional development is not up to the task. By most accounts, professional development is fragmented and dominated by district-led workshops that are typically short in duration, disconnected from teachers’ work experiences, and seldom focused on the daily challenges of teaching core subjects such as reading and mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162373713482766">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162373713482766">Wilson &amp; Berne, 1999</xref>). While there are many examples of more substantive professional development, these are typically offered through universities, taught by the developers of the programs, and not available at sufficient scale to address the needs of the vast majority of U.S. teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162373713482766">Hill, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A growing recognition of both the challenges and importance of improving professional development has led to widespread interest in supporting research that can inform the design of effective programs. To this end, policymakers and funding agencies have directed considerable resources toward professional development studies focused on improving teacher preparedness and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162373713482766">Birman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482766">Borko, 2004</xref>). For instance, through many different programs and topics, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has funded over 60 projects that targeted the professional development of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482766">IES Education Research Grants, 2012</xref>) and has recently established an entire program devoted to research on effective strategies for improving teacher quality.</p>
<p>Despite the growing recognition of the importance of well-designed professional development, the existing empirical research base offers only limited guidance because it is mostly derived from small-scale evaluations of single-site programs with designs poorly suited for drawing causal inferences and questionable outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482766">Borko, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162373713482766">Wayne, Yoon, Zhu, Cronen, &amp; Garet, 2008</xref>). There are few examples of studies that were designed to investigate the impact of professional development programs with rigorous designs and on valued and appropriate outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162373713482766">Garet, Porter, Desimone, Birman, &amp; Yoon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162373713482766">Desimone, Porter, Garet, Yoon, &amp; Birman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162373713482766">Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, &amp; Shapley, 2007</xref>). For instance, studies often simply ask teachers participating in a program how much they think they have learned or the extent to which they found the program useful for improving their teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162373713482766">Wilson &amp; Berne, 1999</xref>). Similarly, recent reviews of professional development studies indicated that only 9 of about 1,300 studies identified offered research designs that would permit rigorous causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162373713482766">Yoon et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>If we are to develop a science of effective teaching and improve the quality of teachers, we need studies of professional development that are designed to precisely test our theories of teaching. To this end, the purpose of the work reported in this article is to provide guidance to the research and policy community on the design of rigorous studies that have the power to draw strong causal inferences that can establish the effectiveness of professional development programs on valued outcomes. Using outcomes designed to assess the content and pedagogical knowledge used in teaching reading and mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482766">Carlisle, Kelcey, Rowan, &amp; Phelps, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162373713482766">Hill, Schilling, &amp; Ball, 2004</xref>), we estimate empirical benchmarks of the parameters needed to design studies of teacher professional development with teacher content knowledge as the outcome. Our work presented here focuses on the group randomized trial (GRT) design, in which teachers are nested within schools and interventions are assigned to intact schools. Our analyses are designed to address the following research questions: (1) To what extent is teachers’ content knowledge clustered in schools? (2) To what extent do teacher covariates explain variance in teachers’ content knowledge as well as the clustering of teachers’ content knowledge? (3) Given estimates of clustering and the explanatory power of covariates, what are the minimum detectable effect sizes (MDESs) for GRT designs of various sample sizes? (4) How does the clustering, explanatory power of covariates, and MDESs for teachers’ content knowledge compare with that of students’ achievement?</p>
<p>To address these questions and to provide practical guidance for the design and planning of teacher professional development studies, we draw on two databases that are unique in their scale and the content focus of the teacher knowledge assessments. By examining content knowledge for teaching along several domains and grade levels, we inform data collection regimes that provide the power and precision to reliably differentiate the effects of professional development programs. The article is organized as follows. The next section briefly describes the importance of teacher content knowledge as an outcome of professional development, the importance of collegial interaction in professional development, and the resulting need for GRTs in the study of professional development. The Method section describes our data sources, measures, models, and parameters of interest. The Results section presents empirical benchmarks of design parameters and follows with implications for both the design of GRTs and a comparison with student outcome counterparts. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for the design of studies examining professional development programs.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162373713482766">
<title>Outcomes and Designs for Professional Development</title>
<p>A major issue in the study of professional development is clarifying the contexts and mechanisms through which professional development operates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162373713482766">Desimone (2009)</xref> suggested a basic model for studying professional development that includes attention to three outcomes of professional development: teacher knowledge, teaching quality, and student learning. Desimone argues that attending to each of these features would allow for testing a “theory of teacher change (e.g., that professional development alters teacher knowledge, beliefs, or practice) and a theory of instruction (e.g., that changed practice influences student achievement), both of which are necessary to complete our understanding of how professional development works” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162373713482766">Desimone, 2009</xref>, p. 185). This basic model highlights the central importance of teacher knowledge. Change in teacher knowledge is the most direct and proximal outcome of professional development, and it is also an important mediator that could explain effects of professional development on outcomes such as student learning.</p>
<p>There is also empirical evidence supporting this model and its focus on teacher content knowledge as a critical ingredient and central outcome of effective professional development. In her seminal review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162373713482766">Kennedy (1998)</xref> found that “programs whose content focused mainly on teachers’ behaviors demonstrated smaller influences on student learning than did programs whose content focused on teachers’ knowledge of the subject, on the curriculum, or on how students learn the subject” (p. 17). More recent research has also underscored the importance of subject-matter-focused professional development and shown support for this model. For example, literature has established a variety of associations among teacher knowledge and professional development, teaching quality, and student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162373713482766">Correnti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162373713482766">Hill, Rowan, &amp; Ball, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162373713482766">Kelcey, 2011</xref>). Given these findings, teacher knowledge has emerged as an important outcome defining the effectiveness of professional development programs.</p>
<p>A limiting factor in designing studies with such content knowledge measures as outcomes, however, has been the lack of research instruments suitable for studying teachers’ content knowledge. Instruments for measuring teacher content knowledge divide roughly into two groups, each of which suffers from important types of limitations. The first group is direct assessments of teacher content knowledge. These assessments have typically consisted of straight subject matter tests. The second group of measures is indirect or proxy measures of content knowledge. For example, some researchers have simply asked teachers to self-report their knowledge or learning and used these self-reports as proxies for what teachers actually know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162373713482766">Desimone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162373713482766">Yoon et al., 2007</xref>). Because these types of assessments are not directly connected to the content knowledge used in teaching and/or teachers’ actual knowledge, they are neither adequate proximal assessments of the content knowledge that is typically the focus of professional development nor suitable to assess how content knowledge mediates the effects of professional development on other outcomes such as teaching practice and student achievement.</p>
<p>However, recently substantial progress has been made in developing assessments that focus on aspects of teacher content knowledge that are closely tied to instruction. This new generation of assessments is designed to provide a direct measure of the types of content knowledge needed to address the content problems that arise in teaching. The most fully developed examples of such assessments have come out of the work of Heather Hill, Deborah Ball, and their colleagues in the area of elementary and middle school mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162373713482766">Hill et al., 2004</xref>). Their research has focused on identifying the content-specific tasks that teachers regularly encounter in teaching and then developing instruments to assess the content knowledge used in these teaching practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162373713482766">Ball &amp; Bass, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162373713482766">Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008</xref>). These assessments focus on the content knowledge that is often the target of professional development, and there is evidence that this knowledge is associated with both the quality of instruction and student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162373713482766">Hill &amp; Ball, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482766">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162373713482766">Hill et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to develop other assessments in both mathematical and other subjects that also focus on the unique types of content knowledge used in teaching (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162373713482766">Brown, McGatha, &amp; Karp, 2006</xref>). For example, there has been widespread interest in developing assessments of the linguistic knowledge that primary grade teachers use to teach students to decode text (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162373713482766">Cunningham, Perry, Stanovich, &amp; Stanovich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162373713482766">Moats, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162373713482766">Spear-Swerling &amp; Brucker, 2006</xref>). Other projects have focused on identifying the tasks teachers face in teaching reading and related questions that focus on the knowledge about text, language, and reading processes used in these teaching practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482766">Carlisle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162373713482766">Correnti &amp; Phelps, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162373713482766">Goldschmidt &amp; Phelps, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162373713482766">Phelps, 2009</xref>). Similar work is taking place in elementary science to identify the knowledge used in representing science content to students and in assessing student ideas and misconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162373713482766">Smith &amp; Banilower, 2006</xref>). The Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) project, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is funding the development and dissemination of assessments of content knowledge for teaching in Grades 4 through 9 English language arts and Grades 4 through 8 mathematics and Algebra 1. All of these efforts are focused on developing assessments of content knowledge that is directly tied to teaching practice.</p>
<p>The design of high-quality studies of professional development is also influenced by current arguments that professional development needs to take into account the context of teachers’ work, providing opportunities for teachers to collaborate with colleagues around the professional development content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162373713482766">Desimone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2011</xref>). These ideas suggest that professional development is not simply delivered to an individual teacher and then implemented in the classroom. Effective professional development involves the unpacking and application of ideas by a teacher with his or her immediate colleagues and the coordinated integration of new ideas into their school and instructional context to achieve common aims.</p>
<p>The collegial nature of effective professional development and its delivery to intact groups of teachers within schools is a particularly important issue for the design of professional development studies. Because the natural unit of assignment is intact groups, designs that assign individual teachers within the same school to different treatments remove a critical feature of contemporary professional development. Professional development studies using individual assignment that fail to find differences in the outcomes of treated versus control teachers may represent a failure of the research design rather than a failure of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162373713482766">Rossi, Lipsey, &amp; Freeman, 2004</xref>). Theory failure occurs when a study generates evidence against the theory that links the professional development with intended changes in teachers’ knowledge. In contrast, implementation failure happens when the study features (e.g., design, resources, time, etc.) prevent the theory under study from being fully carried out. If a key activating agent of a professional development program is collegial interaction, requiring teachers to participate in professional development without the benefit of peer interaction may limit the ability to test the theory under study.</p>
<p>Individual assignment of professional development to teachers also complicates causal inference because teachers operate within the common bounds of a school, thereby inducing significant potential for contamination or spillover effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162373713482766">Bloom, 2005</xref>). Spillover effects happen when control teachers receive features of the treatment program because of interactions among treatment and control teachers. Under individual assignment, the potential for a teacher assigned to the professional development sharing aspects (intentionally or unintentionally) of the treatment with a control teacher is high because teachers within a school frequently collaborate and work together to achieve common student learning goals.</p>
<p>This contamination has several important implications. First, it can obscure the contrast between treatment and control because control units received partial, and unknown, treatment. Lacking a true control group, we might then falsely conclude that the program was ineffective simply because we did not observe differences in the outcomes between groups. Second, the contamination or spillover violates one of the main assumptions underlying modern causal theory: the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) of the Rubin causal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162373713482766">Holland, 1986</xref>). In the current context, SUTVA, in part, requires that one teacher’s treatment assignment does not influence another teacher’s potential outcomes. If spillover occurs, the result is an obfuscation of the causal estimands. In particular, the causal effect of the professional development can no longer be clearly defined as the contrast between treatment and control potential outcomes. Rather, there is a multiplicity of potential outcomes and estimands because each teacher’s set of potential responses to the treatment and control conditions is dependent on other teachers’ treatment assignments and the extent to which the combinations induce spillover.</p>
<p>In addition to these theoretical arguments that emphasize the value of rigorous, multilevel designs, there is a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests teacher quality and knowledge are clustered in schools. For instance, research has found that less qualified teachers (e.g., uncertified) tend to be clustered in low-income schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162373713482766">Jerald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162373713482766">Krei, 1998</xref>) and that schools with high proportions of Black and Latino students are far more likely to staff teachers with low content knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162373713482766">Kain &amp; Singleton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162373713482766">Ingersoll, 2001</xref>). More recently, investigations using measures of teacher content or specialized knowledge for teaching have also demonstrated high levels of clustering. For example, 27% of the variation in teachers’ knowledge about reading and reading practices was found to be attributable to differences among schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162373713482766">Kelcey, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>An increasingly common research design that accounts for the nesting and interaction of teachers within schools is the GRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162373713482766">Bloom, 2005</xref>). In GRTs, intact groups (e.g., schools) are assigned to treatment conditions rather than individuals (e.g., teachers). GRTs are often appropriate for studying interventions in education because many educational interventions are designed for intact schools or intended to work through classroom contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162373713482766">Spybrook &amp; Raudenbush, 2009</xref>). Statistically, GRTs are also valuable because assigning intact groups to treatment conditions may help shield against spillover effects.</p>
<p>The planning and design of GRTs depend on the precision with which the study can index the impacts of the intervention. Because the precision with which a study can identify intervention effects is tied to the variation attributable to each level, adequate design of GRTs requires reasonable a priori estimates of parameters such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To help improve the planning and design of GRTs, recent studies have compiled a wide range of empirical ICCs to describe the variance decomposition of many educational outcomes such as academic and behavioral indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges &amp; Hedberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162373713482766">Jacob, Zhu, &amp; Bloom, 2010</xref>). However, the scope of this literature has been limited to design parameters for student outcomes.</p>
<p>In designing GRTs for professional development, some researchers have either ignored clustering or used student parameters on the assumption that the nesting structure for students and teachers within schools are similar. Yet a key finding that has emerged from research on educational outcomes is that design parameters vary considerably across outcomes and that a study’s power is sensitive to these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162373713482766">Jacob, Zhu, &amp; Bloom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162373713482766">Spybrook &amp; Raudenbush, 2009</xref>). While the assumptions underlying the similarity of student and teacher design parameters are suspect, lacking suitable estimates of ICCs for teacher knowledge outcomes, researchers have few other options than to draw from student estimates. With the availability of a new generation of teacher content knowledge measures, this issue will become even more pressing since there is likely to be an increase in GRT studies designed to assess the impact of professional development on teacher knowledge. The analysis presented in the remainder of the article is designed to address these issues.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We used two separate databases that were unique in their scale to address our four research questions. Our analytic work begins by examining the extent to which teachers’ knowledge is clustered in schools using the ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162373713482766">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Because this parameter is fundamental in the planning and design of GRTs, we also describe the uncertainty of our estimates using theoretical and bootstrapped confidence intervals. We next describe the explanatory power of several common covariates so as to improve the efficiency of GRTs with teacher knowledge outcomes. Using our empirical estimates of ICC and variation explained, we then examine the implications they have for the design of GRTs with knowledge outcomes by considering the MDESs for designs with various sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162373713482766">Bloom, 2005</xref>). We conclude our analytic work by comparing our results with their student outcome analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges &amp; Hedberg, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0162373713482766">
<title>Data and Measures</title>
<p>To our knowledge, there are currently no available empirical estimates of ICCs for teachers’ content knowledge. The main reason is that until recently there have been few tests available to assess the type of content knowledge that is the focus of contemporary professional development in subjects such as reading and mathematics. Where these assessments have been created, they have typically been focused on and aligned to specific professional development programs and never used at a scale sufficient to estimate empirical parameters. Only very recently have these assessments started to be used in large-scale studies and across large numbers of schools.</p>
<sec id="section4-0162373713482766">
<title>Mathematics data</title>
<p>Data for teachers’ content knowledge for teaching in mathematics come from the Teacher Knowledge Assessment System (TKAS). TKAS has been used by numerous professional development programs to assess teachers’ content knowledge. The system includes assessments in a number of topic areas as well as teacher background data. Collectively, the data in the analyses reported in this article come from 1,761 teachers and 949 schools and span 36 states. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162373713482766">Table 1</xref> presents basic summaries of teachers’ backgrounds and basic demographic information for the schools in which the teachers served. Although teacher descriptive statistics are based on the full teacher sample, the school descriptive statistics are based on only 459 schools because of missing school-level data. As a result, subsequent analyses focused only on teacher-level covariates and their aggregates at the school level.</p>

<title>Mathematics knowledge</title>
<p>The mathematics outcome measure used in this study focused on the mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) measures developed by the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project. The MKT measures are designed to capture the specialized forms of mathematical knowledge used in recurrent tasks of teaching such as interpreting student errors or unconventional algorithms, selecting problems for particular instructional purposes, or assessing mathematical representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162373713482766">Ball et al., 2008</xref>). The mathematical knowledge measured by the MKT instruments have been shown to be sensitive to professional development treatments and related to high-quality teaching practice and students’ achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162373713482766">Hill &amp; Ball, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162373713482766">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482766">Hill et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Reading data</title>
<p>Data for the reading assessments of teachers’ knowledge come from the Assessment of Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Teachers of Reading study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482766">Carlisle et al., 2011</xref>). The focus of this study was to develop and validate measures of teacher content knowledge in early reading and to investigate the relationship between elementary school teachers’ knowledge of reading, their instructional practices, and their students’ reading achievement. The data reported in this study focus on a measure of teachers’ reading knowledge and background data, which were collected using self-administered questionnaires through the Reading First program in Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482766">Carlisle et al., 2011</xref>). The Reading First program provided funding to support improvement of reading instruction in kindergarten through Grade 3 in school districts with high levels of poverty and underachievement in reading. Of the state Reading First population, approximately half of the teachers volunteered to allow researchers to use their data for research purposes. Collectively, our sample consisted of 818 teachers and 153 schools. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162373713482766">Table 1</xref> presents basic summaries of teacher and school characteristics.</p>

<title>Reading knowledge</title>
<p>Our reading knowledge outcome measure was the Teachers’ Knowledge About Reading and Reading Practices (TKRRP). TKRRP was developed as part of the evaluation of Reading First in Michigan and focused on experts’ judgments of the knowledge that teachers of early reading needed to know to be effective. Based on prior research, items focused on two primary domains: knowledge relevant to the teaching of word reading (e.g., phonemic awareness, letter sound relationships, spelling patterns) and knowledge relevant to the teaching of word reading and comprehension (e.g., morphology, text analysis, fluency) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162373713482766">Phelps &amp; Schilling, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, drawing on insights from fields beyond reading, the measure focused on knowledge of pedagogy and student learning such that assessments were situated in classroom practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162373713482766">Ball &amp; Bass, 2003</xref>). As a result, items measured applied knowledge using classroom and student scenarios that early elementary teachers encounter. The measure consisted of 22 items and was primarily centered on knowledge important to Grade 1 instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482766">Carlisle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162373713482766">Phelps &amp; Schilling, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Our work focused on estimating design parameters for studies that randomly assign interventions to intact schools and measure outcomes using individual teacher knowledge scores. We considered design parameters along several dimensions. The first dimension was subject matter; we considered teachers’ knowledge in both mathematics and reading. Second, we considered the extent to which adjusting for covariates could improve the efficiency of GRT designs. Our models included unconditional specifications as well as specifications with several different sets of covariates. In each case, teacher-level covariates were included as both individual teacher descriptors (Level 1) and school-level descriptors (Level 2) using their aggregates. Covariate sets were intended to increase the efficiency of the study design using teacher-level variables that might be obtained easily in a professional development study. Last, we separated design parameters by domains and grade bands for teachers’ mathematics knowledge, and by grade for reading knowledge. Below we describe the details of the dimensions for both outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section9-0162373713482766">
<title>Mathematics dimensions</title>
<p>For the MKT outcome, the first dimension we considered was outcome domain and its associated grade level. Our analyses focused on five MKT domains: (1) Elementary School Number Concepts and Operations, (2) Elementary School Patterns, Functions and Algebra, (3) Grade 4–8 Geometry, (4) Middle School Number Concepts and Operations, and (5) Middle School Patterns, Functions and Algebra. Second, we examined how design parameters changed as a function of included covariates for five separate sets. The first set Math Coursework of covariates we considered included counts of mathematics and mathematics teaching methods coursework. The second set Major/minor Math was composed of a single indicator of whether a teacher’s degree included a major or minor in mathematics. The third set Math Certified denoted whether a teacher was certified in mathematics. The fourth set Demographics used an indicator of gender (male) and race (White). Finally, we specified a model with no covariates (Unconditional) and a model that used all the covariates in the first four sets (All).</p>

<title>Reading dimensions</title>
<p>For the TKKRP measure, we first broke our sample up by grade using (1) first grade, (2) second grade, and (3) third grade. Second, we measured the effect of including covariates by using covariate sets similar to those used in mathematics. The first set of covariates Professional Training included counts of approved professional training in reading instruction. The second set Major/minor Reading was composed of a single indicator of whether a teacher’s degree included a major or minor in reading. The third set Reading Certified denoted whether a teacher was certified in reading. The fourth set Demographics used an indicator of gender (male) and race (White).

For this reason, we additionally estimated approximate standard errors for ICCs under each domain.

<p>To better describe the distribution of feasible ICCs for each outcome and address the potential for asymmetry, we estimated confidence intervals using a bootstrap estimator. The bootstrap procedure relaxes sample size assumptions and has been shown to provide consistent estimates of the standard errors in small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162373713482766">Hinkley, 1988</xref>; Leeden, Busing, &amp; Meijer, 1997). Of particular relevance in our investigation is our data and of the ICC parameter. To address the impact of clustering (i.e., teachers within schools) on the bootstrap estimates, we estimated the uncertainty of the ICC estimates using the multilevel parametric bootstrap (Leeden et al., 1997). Literature has suggested that the multilevel parametric bootstrap estimator outperforms the usual maximum likelihood asymptotic standard error estimates in small sample sizes (Leeden et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Because of the multilevel structure of our models and the assumed independence of the residuals across levels, we parametrically estimated two distribution functions of the data to generate bootstrap samples. With teachers nested in schools at Level 1, we used the distribution function <italic>N</italic>(0,σˆ<sup>2</sup><sub>ε</sub>&amp;x41; for teacher residuals (ε<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>), where σˆ<sup>2</sup><sub>ε</sub> is the estimated residual variance. For Level 2, we generated the school residuals (<italic>u<sub>0j</sub></italic>) using the distribution function <italic>N</italic>(0,σˆ<sup>2</sup><sub>π</sub>&amp;x41; where σˆ<sup>2</sup><sub>π</sub> is the estimated school-level variance. Using this approach, we constructed 1,000 bootstrapped estimates and estimated empirical confidence intervals (95%) for ICCs for each outcome using exact percentiles (i.e., 2.5% and 97.5%) of the bootstrapped estimates.</p>

<title>MDES</title>
<p>An important implication of the magnitude of the ICC and explanatory power of covariates is their impact on the sample size needed to adequately power a study to detect an intervention effect. A common way to summarize this implication is to estimate the MDES for designs with varying sample sizes at each level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162373713482766">Bloom, 2005</xref>). To estimate MDESs, we adhered to the common protocol of 80% power with a two-tailed test using a 0.05 significance level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges &amp; Hedberg, 2007</xref>). Our work considered balanced unconditional designs as well as designs that conditioned on the covariates that empirically explained the most variance in the previous analyses. We estimated the MDESs using:</p>

<title>Mathematics outcomes</title>
<p>The unconditional ICC for mathematics outcomes ranged from a low of 0.13 in Elementary School Patterns, Functions, and Algebra to a high of 0.30 in Grade 4-8 Geometry with an overall mean of 0.21 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162373713482766">Table 2</xref>). In other words, on average, approximately 21% of the variation in teachers’ mathematics knowledge is attributable to differences among schools. The width of the confidence intervals for the unconditional ICCs was usually on the order of 0.2, corresponding to standard errors of roughly 0.05. The size of this sampling uncertainty was slightly larger than that observed for student outcomes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges and Hedberg (2007)</xref>, which drew on larger samples signif-icantly reduce the variation in the outcome.</p>
<p>Incorporating explanatory covariates into the model tended to have two main effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0162373713482766">Tables 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162373713482766">5</xref>). The inclusion of covariates tended to explain significant school-level variability, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, and moderate amounts of teacher variability, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub><italic>W</italic></sub>. Across mathematics outcomes and at the school level, Covariate Set 1 (Math Coursework) explained on average 29%, Covariate Set 2 (Major/minor Math) explained on average 23%, Covariate Set 3 (Math Certified) explained on average 42%, Covariate Set 4 (Demographics) explained on average 16%, and using all covariate sets simultaneously explained on average 51%.</p>
<p>The inclusion of covariates also frequently reduced the ICC substantially. Take, for example, the ICC for Grade 4-8 Geometry. Without covariates, the unconditional ICC was 0.30, whereas with all covariates the ICC was reduced by more than half. Overall the average ICC across outcomes dropped from about 0.21 for no covariates to 0.16 for Covariate Set 1, 0.17 for Covariate Set 2, 0.13 for Covariate Set 3, 0.18 for Covariate Set 4, and 0.12 when using all covariate sets simultaneously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162373713482766">
<title>Reading outcomes</title>
<p>The unconditional ICC for all three grades was 0.14, although unconditional ICCs for reading fluctuated from 0.08 in second grade to 0.24 in third grade. Confidence interval widths for ICCs were similar to those of mathematics but slightly larger. Overall, the adjustment for covariates produced effects similar to those reported for mathematics outcomes. However, a notable difference was the differential importance of the covariate sets. Whereas the covariate set that explained the greatest amount of variance for mathematics outcomes tended to be certification (Set 3), gender and race demographics (Set 4) explained the most variance in reading. Regarding school-level variance explained across all three grades, Covariate Set 1 (Professional Training) explained 29%, Covariate Sets 2 (Major/minor Reading) and 3 (Reading Certified) explained virtually no variance, Covariate Set 4 (Demographics) explained 50%, and using all covariate sets simultaneously explained 62%.</p>
<p>Covariates also reduced the ICC for reading knowledge in important ways. Adjusting for all sets of covariates simultaneously, the ICC was reduced from its unconditional average of 0.14 to a conditional average of 0.06. In contrast to mathematics outcomes, the set of certification variables explained little variation for the reading outcome. Rather, the set of gender and race variables usually provided the largest explanation of variation in the reading outcome and the largest reduction in ICC.</p>

<title>Implications for Design</title>
<p>Our analysis of MDESs considered designs that conditioned on the covariates that empirically explained the most variance in the previous analyses. As a result, for mathematics outcomes, we used Set 3 (certification in mathematics), and for reading outcomes, we used Set 4 (gender and race demographics). Thus, conditional MDES estimates are based on two covariates for mathematics (one for the teacher-level and one for the school-level aggregate) and four covariates for reading (two for the teacher-level and two for the school-level aggregate).</p>
<p>Using the design parameters estimated above, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0162373713482766">Table 6</xref> describes the MDES for unconditional model specifications, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0162373713482766">Table 7</xref> describes the MDES for the appropriate conditional model specifications. We recognize that there are many different sampling schemes that are possible, and interested researchers could use the parameters reported in this article to create tables tailored to their specific interests. Our choice of sample sizes simply tries to summarize potential designs for single-grade and multi-grade studies while balancing the differences between the data sets. Rows refer to the different reading and mathematics outcomes, and columns describe different combinations of sample sizes at each level. In turn, each cell in the tables provides the MDES for a specific outcome and teacher and school sample size. For instance, using a model without covariates, the MDES for the mathematics domain Elementary School Number Concepts and Operations under a design with 100 schools and 12 teachers per school was approximately 0.27. Similar to the lack of empirical basis for other design parameters (e.g., ICCs), there is little to no literature describing the empirical distribution of effect sizes for the effects of professional development programs. Lacking suitable benchmarks, theoretical rules of thumb would suggest that such an effect is in the small to moderate range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482766">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>

<p>In comparing across subjects, our analyses suggested that MDESs for mathematics and reading were quite comparable. Similarly, comparisons across grades and domains indicated MDESs were comparable. The small differences largely stem from the deviations in observed <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> and ICC values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162373713482766">Tables 2</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162373713482766">5</xref>).</p>
<p>A common tradeoff in the design of GRTs focuses on the exchange between increasing the number of schools versus increasing the number of teachers per school. In contrasting how the MDES changes across sample size combinations for the same outcome, we observed the familiar pattern that a proportional increase in the number of schools improved precision more than the same proportional increase in the number of teachers per school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162373713482766">Bloom, Richburg-Hayes, &amp; Black, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162373713482766">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, consider a design without covariates for reading knowledge in Grade 3 with 10 schools and 6 teachers per school (totaling 60 teachers) to that of a design with 30 schools and 2 teachers per school (totaling 60 teachers).The former has a MDES of 1.04, whereas the latter has a MDES of 0.79. This difference between designs decreased as the school sample size got larger; however, even at 100 schools, the advantage persisted and can be practically important (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0162373713482766">Table 6</xref>). Such differences were also evident across the conditional models. However, the benefit of selecting larger school sample sizes over larger within-school teacher sample sizes faded as the number of schools increased to 100.</p>
<p>Another useful benchmark is to choose a typical number of schools for a design and examine how parameters and assumptions vary. Recent studies of professional development have used school-level sample sizes between about 40 and 90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482766">2011</xref>). Similarly, a typical sample in many studies using student outcomes is somewhere between 40 and 60 schools. Our results suggested that GRT designs for professional development using 50 schools will be adequately powered only under what would seem to be stringent scenarios. In designs without covariates, randomly assigning 50 schools will only be sufficient if effect sizes are about 0.50. Adjusting for covariates further brought down the MDES for 50 schools. However, with 50 schools the inclusion of covariates lowered MDESs only by about 0.05 to 0.10. Although there is little evidence benchmarking realistic and usual gains resulting from professional development programs, fallible rules of thumb would suggest that these effect sizes are still fairly large compared to what we might see in studies using student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482766">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>To reach effect sizes under 0.30 required approximately 100 schools and 6 to 12 teachers per school. Sufficient precision for small effect sizes (e.g., around 0.2) was only possible if designs used large school and teacher sample sizes combined with predictive covariates. Furthermore, more conservative approaches that use, for example, the upper bound of ICC confidence intervals face even more extreme situations. For instance, for an unconditional model for mathematics domain Elementary School Number Concepts and Operations using the ICC upper bound, 30 schools and 4 teachers per school, the MDES increases from 0.64 to 0.70.</p>
<p>To put our results into context, consider several recently funded studies. First, consider a study that focused on the impact of early reading professional development interventions on the knowledge and practice of teachers in second grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2008</xref>). The study randomly assigned 90 intact schools (with approximately three teachers per school) to treatment conditions. With a 0.80 power level and a Type 1 error rate of 0.05, the MDES for an ICC 0.08 (i.e., unconditional ICC for reading knowledge in Grade 2) is approximately 0.37. Results of the professional development study found a statistically significant difference between treatment groups with an effect size of about 0.37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2008</xref>). The results of this study in conjunction with our analyses would suggest that the study design was well powered for the magnitude of the effects.</p>
<p>Now consider the Middle School Mathematics professional development Impact Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2011</xref>). The study used a school randomized design with 39 schools and 92 teachers to examine the extent to which specialized professional development on rational numbers changed teachers’ knowledge. Researchers reported that the specialized professional development program did not have a statistically significant impact on teachers’ knowledge of rational numbers and that the observed effect size was quite small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482766">Garet et al., 2011</xref>). Under the aforementioned conditions, our results suggest that the MDES would be on the order of 0.70 without covariates and 0.60 with a certification covariate. In other words, this study design was likely only sufficient for detecting program effects that have been traditionally labeled as large.</p>

<title>Comparisons With Student Outcomes</title>
<p>It is informative to compare the range of ICC and variance explained values with their student counterparts. As noted above, absent empirical estimates of ICCs for teacher knowledge outcomes, researchers will be forced to default to more widely available parameters for student assessments. A comparison of ICCs can help provide some guidance on whether the use of student parameters could be informative or misleading. Drawing on the unconditional ICCs reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges and Hedberg (2007)</xref>, the average unconditional ICC for student mathematics outcomes (all schools across Grades 1 to 8) and reading outcomes (low achievement schools across Grades 1 to 3) was approximately 0.22 and 0.13, respectively. The parallel estimates for teachers’ knowledge outcomes in our data were 0.21 for mathematics and 0.15 for reading (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0162373713482766">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our review suggested a need for improvement in the design of professional development studies. Our work highlighted two paths to improve the rigor and relevance of research on professional development: using outcomes that are embedded in the chain from professional development to student achievement (e.g., content knowledge relevant to teaching) and rigorous research designs aligned with the theory and implementation of professional development. The empirical benchmarks presented in this article link teacher knowledge outcomes with GRTs to provide guidance for the planning and design of studies of professional development.</p>
<p>Our results indicated that teacher knowledge was clustered such that teachers within the same school were not independent. Looking within academic subjects, the degree of this dependency, as captured by the average unconditional ICCs, across domains and grades was 0.21 for mathematics outcomes and 0.15 for reading outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0162373713482766">Table 9</xref>). Put differently, on average, approximately 21% and 15% of the variation in teachers’ knowledge in mathematics and reading was attributable to differences among schools.</p>

<p>A main impact of the observed clustering of teachers’ knowledge on study design is on the sample sizes needed to precisely detect intervention effects. We found that the magnitude of the clustering indicated that adequate precision would often require sample sizes substantially larger than if teachers within schools were independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162373713482766">Figure 1</xref>). For example, given six teachers per school, the school-level sample size needed to detect an effect size of 0.50 with 80% power for an ICC of zero (indicating that teachers are completely independent) would be 23 schools. However, our analyses indicated that teachers are not independent with an average mathematics ICC of 0.21 and an average reading ICC of 0.15, which would require substantially larger school samples of 45 and 39, respectively. The presence of substantial clustering as evidenced by empirically derived ICCs indicates the need for school-level sample sizes that are nearly twice as large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162373713482766">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The need for increased sample size was moderately tempered by the introduction of covariates into the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0162373713482766">Figure 2</xref>). Our analyses suggested that part of the outcome variation and part of the clustering of teachers’ knowledge can be explained by background factors, thus limiting the impact of the design effect. For example, under the aforementioned scenario, the number of schools necessary to detect an effect size of 0.5 would be reduced from 45 to 34 schools in mathematics and from 39 to 30 schools in reading. Collectively, our results suggested that covariance adjustment on the variables considered might be a useful strategy to marginally reduce sample size but that it does not dramatically improve precision.</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrasting these values with their student outcome counterparts, the estimates of unconditional student and teacher clustering were quite similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0162373713482766">Table 8</xref>). Their close correspondence suggests that the degree to which teachers are clustered is on the same order as that of students. The conditional parameters comparisons were also quite similar, suggesting that the clustering of teachers’ knowledge can be explained by demographic variables to a degree similar to that of students’ achievement. There were several differences between results for student and teacher outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0162373713482766">Table 8</xref>). First, the student mathematics demographic adjusted model explained more variance and had a lower conditional ICC. Our lack of a socioeconomic status index for the teachers or schools may in part explain this difference. A second difference was the disparities in the amount of variation explained by the demographic variables in the adjusted reading model. Specifically, our teacher model explained more of the school- and teacher-level variation than did its student counterpart. We suspect that this difference might stem from the nature of our sample. In particular, our sample for reading teachers was taken from only low-achieving school in a single state, whereas the student sample from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges and Hedberg (2007)</xref> was taken from a national sample.</p>
<p>One limitation of the current estimates is the lack of a prior measure of teacher knowledge. In the student achievement literature, pretests are widely documented to be the most important covariate because they can achieve substantial increases in precision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges &amp; Hedberg, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482766">Hedges and Hedberg (2007)</xref> reported that adjusting for pretest and demographic covariates can explain about 71% and 56% of outcome variation in mathematics at the school and student levels (all schools Grades 1 to 8) and 64% and 34% of outcome variation in reading at the school and student levels (low-achieving schools Grades 1 to 3). Given the approximate correspondence of other teacher and student covariates, it is possible that including a teacher knowledge pretest might yield similar increases in precision. For example, if we were to assume that our teacher models roughly corresponded to the student models, we can roughly estimate the savings from including a teacher-level knowledge test covariate. Using the average ICCs for each subject and assuming six teachers per school in a study powered at 80% to determine an effect size of 0.50, we could expect to see the necessary school sample size drop down to about 17 schools in mathematics and about 20 schools in reading.</p>
<p>Although the sample size and savings in study costs resulting from the inclusion of teacher pre-assessment covariates are potentially substantial, these savings are paired with the potential costs of assessing teacher knowledge at multiple time points—that is, prior to the professional development intervention and postintervention. Multiple assessments would require developing parallel forms for the knowledge assessment to avoid any learning effects from reusing the same form multiple times.</p>
<p>Our results also suggested that there was substantial variation in the observed ICCs across subjects, domains, and grades. These findings underscore the need to establish outcome-specific empirical benchmarks. However, in part, these observed differences could be due to sampling error or generalizability error. Sampling error stems from the chance differences between the sample and population of interest. Our estimates yielded interval widths of about 0.20, suggesting significant overlap in outcome ICC confidence intervals and suggesting that outcomes could have shared similar ICCs. Studies repeating our work would help to explicate the extent to which ICCs differ by outcome. Generalizability error manifests when there is a true underlying difference between a target population and reference sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162373713482766">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>). This issue may be relevant for the values we report because our data were not representative samples of any specific population. As a result, it is unclear how the characteristics of this sample might relate to schools nationally, regionally, or within other types of stratification.</p>
<p>While the data we drew from represent among the most comprehensive data employing teacher knowledge measures that could be used as outcomes for professional development, it is important to recognize that both data sets draw on scores from what is likely a restricted sample of teachers. The reading measures were collected in Reading First schools and represent teachers in high-poverty settings. Furthermore, this sample includes only teachers agreeing to allow their data to be used for research purposes. The mathematics measures were collected for teachers participating in professional development programs that either required or sought out an evaluation instrument. Such programs arguably attract the most rigorous programs and the most motivated teachers. In both cases, these teachers probably do not represent the full range of teachers who might participate in fully developed studies of professional development. Although we do not know how our samples might differ from more representative samples, we think it is likely that our sample is more homogenous. And we would expect that a more homogenous sample would lead to estimates of ICCs that are conservative. In turn, this would suggest that the empirical estimates presented in this article could represent a lower bound of the necessary sample size needed for conducting adequately powered studies.</p>
<p>One implication of the results presented in this article is that GRTs for professional development interventions that use teacher knowledge as an outcome will need either large sample sizes, large effect sizes, or strong pretests to provide adequate precision. This has important implications for funders, policymakers, and researchers. Because GRTs will demand substantial resources, it is important that professional development interventions undergo careful development, extensive field testing, and preliminary research to establish that they are functioning as intended. Furthermore, GRTs may be most appropriate for interventions with larger and more pronounced effects. There is growing evidence that sustained and longitudinal systems of professional development can produce larger impacts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162373713482766">No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162373713482766">Wei, Darling-Hammond, Andree, Richardson, &amp; Orphanos, 2009</xref>). Policies and research studies that examine sustained and well-developed professional development programs are better positioned to produce and detect change on both substantive and statistical grounds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482766">Borko (2004)</xref> called for a coordinated agenda of research on professional development that includes studies that build across three phases: Phase 1 studies investigate the components of a professional development program to understand if and how the program works, Phase 2 studies examine how a program functions with different instructors and across different contexts, and Phase 3 studies compare multiple programs across sites. These phases begin with ones that are informative and that build knowledge in ways that can justify the expense of an adequately powered GRT. Teacher knowledge outcomes, combined with appropriate and rigorous designs that align with the theory and implementation of professional development and that support strong causal inferences, are well suited to respond to this agenda.</p>
