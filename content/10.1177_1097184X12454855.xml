<p>This interesting and multifaceted book is about men’s experiences of migrating to and living their lives in Australia. The men discussed in the seven studies that constitute the book’s main empirical evidence come from, for example, Africa, Latin America, Indonesia, Lebanon, China, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is in many ways very fruitful. There are descriptions of both the historical and current context and development of immigration policy in Australia. There are also analyses of the political, economic, and social factors that contributed to the different types of emigration from the men’s home countries. As a theoretical foundation, there is Connell’s hegemonic masculinity, as discussed by Richard Howson. He argues that despite some criticism, it is still an important model for understanding contemporary men and masculinities. Intersectionality is also included as an analytical perspective in different chapters of the book.</p>
<p>When men immigrated to Australia they came in contact with somewhat unfamiliar ideals and models of masculinity and relationships within and between sexes. At the same time, the Australian and immigrant men’s masculinities are not completely different. Many studies in the book suggest that important similarities include working hard and making good money. However, for many immigrant men the salary had a specific role in the creation of power as the head of the family. Australian women often worked on equal terms with their husbands and earned their own living, which led to economic power in the family that was more divided and equal. Some immigrant men who had relationships with these women sometimes found it difficult to understand and accept their power and independence.</p>
<p>What approaches and strategies that men used in this new country had a lot to do with a combination of factors at multiple levels, for example individual resources and the current economic situation in Australia. Many Lebanese men came to Australia with a dream to create a constructive and wealthy life but ended up in unemployment due to structural changes and downturns in the economy after the seventies. Inadequate language skills, weak public support, and increasing racism contributed to their vulnerable position. This exclusion created compensatory strategies, especially among second-generation immigrant men. They constructed their masculinity by toughness, physical strength, and sexual appeal. Similar male strategies can also be discerned among the marginalized immigrant communities in many other countries, including Sweden.</p>
<p>Chinese entrepreneurs and businessmen in Australia seemed to have a more stable position in society. They were approaching the hegemonic masculine ideals in Australia in terms of institutional power, thanks to their competence in the economic context. At the same time, they did not want to create their masculinity according to the Australian ideals, which they largely described in terms of moral defects, such as lack of parenting, sexual profligacy, high alcohol use, and interest in violent sports.</p>
<p>This is an example of how immigrant men’s attitudes toward Australian men were not entirely focused on adaptation and imitation but also contained resistance. Even Muslim men from Indonesia described Australian men in negative terms such as immature, selfish, antisocial, aggressive, competitive, uncontrolled, and brutish.</p>
<p>The men who seemed to adapt most easily in Australia came from other English-speaking countries such as England and New Zealand. Language skills are of course a very important resource in a new country, but it is also about the cultural similarities that common language and cultural habits creates. It is easier to avoid the “othering” processes men from more exotic countries may experience.</p>
<p>This book is interesting in many ways. In particular, detailed descriptions of the various immigrant men are very rewarding. At the same time, there was an occasional lack of in-depth analysis of empirical data in these studies. In some chapters, which mainly focused on immigrant men’s relationships with women, analyses were mainly connected on patriarchal gender roles and lacked other dimensions. Most chapters, however, focused on intersectional analysis, and a queer perspective was used in certain contexts. One minor problem in these chapters was that after the initial presentation of the theoretical perspectives, they were used to a lesser extent in the analysis of empirical data.</p>
<p>The book also lacked theoretical perspectives about homosociality. This type of collective male orientation was quite visible in the different studies. One example is Maori men and their white compatriots from New Zealand. They did not usually socialize so diligently in their own country but found each other more easily in Australia.</p>
<p>I agree with Richard Howson that Connell’s discussion of hegemonic masculinity is still viable, especially when one takes into account that hegemony is not a monolithic creation, but that there are multiple hegemonies at global, regional, and local levels. I believe that Connell’s model can also be nuanced according to the mental factors concerning men’s character, for example their morality and ethics. There is sometimes too much focus on men’s bodies and the social and economical factors in the current discussion of hegemonic masculinity. Quite a few immigrant men in this book used their mental attitudes in the form of moral and ethical characteristics in the creation of their masculinities in contradistinction to, as they described, “the morally inferior” Australian men.</p>
<p>To conclude, “Migrant men” is a very important contribution to contemporary studies of men and masculinities. It is not that often that masculinities can be deconstructed and analyzed in the same rich and nuanced ways provided by a migration situation. Such a process as this creates a kind of scientific experiment, one which would hardly be accepted in an ethical review of research. I look forward to similar studies on men and migration. This book has provided some interesting details but created even more questions that should be answered in future studies.</p>
