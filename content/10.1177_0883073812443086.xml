<abstract>
<p>This study was conducted to determine the test-retest reliability and construct validity of the Kinematic Dystonia Measure, a quantitative measure of upper extremity dystonia. To determine the effectiveness of various treatments, reliable and valid measures of dystonia are required. Test-retest reliability of the Kinematic Dystonia Measure using the intraclass correlation coefficient was excellent for the hand-tapping task (0.95) and substantial for the eye-blinking task (0.74). Construct validity testing for the hand-tapping task revealed that Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores correlated with total Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.79, <italic>P</italic> = .003), affected arm Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale subscores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.76, <italic>P</italic> = .0.007), and negatively correlated with Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test scores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = –0.60, <italic>P</italic> = .05). The Kinematic Dystonia Measure has excellent test-retest reliability and good construct validity using the hand-tapping task. When combined with functional outcome measures, the Kinematic Dystonia Measure can effectively measure dystonia in children.</p>

<p>Dystonia is defined as a “movement disorder in which sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812443086">1</xref>
</sup> Dystonia is a presenting feature in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy and other neurologic disorders, including acquired brain injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812443086">2</xref>
</sup> When present in the upper extremity, dystonia frequently affects hand and arm function, and therefore various treatments to reduce dystonia are recommended. In order to effectively evaluate changes in dystonia secondary to treatment, a reliable, valid, and responsive tool is needed.</p>
<p>A key component of dystonia is a fluctuation in its severity over time,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812443086">1</xref>
</sup> which makes it difficult to develop reliable and responsive measures. A measure that is frequently used in pediatric clinical settings is the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale. It has been shown to have excellent inter-, intra-, and test-retest reliability<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812443086">3</xref>
</sup> when assessing individuals with moderate to severe dystonia.</p>
<p>A hallmark feature of dystonia is involuntary movement and postures in a limb that increase as the individual engages in voluntary actions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812443086">1</xref>
</sup> To measure changes in arm position related to dystonia, kinematic measures are useful as they quantify the amount of movement present. The Kinematic Dystonia Measure is one such tool.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812443086">4</xref>
</sup> In the Kinematic Dystonia Measure, the subject is seated with his or her unaffected (or less involved) arm resting on a table. As the subject taps the unaffected hand to the beat of an auditory cue, abnormal posturing and movement in the dystonic arm is elicited. Reflective markers attached to the dystonic arm allow joint positions and angular rotations of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist to be sampled by a motion-capture system. These changes in position and angles are summed to produce a Kinematic Dystonia Measure score. The Kinematic Dystonia Measure is able to quantify involuntary movement that is triggered by voluntary actions, which is a key element of dystonia. Although children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy frequently present with a combination of dystonia and choreoathetosis, choreoathetotic movements are not typically triggered by voluntary actions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812443086">5</xref>
</sup> Thus, the involuntary movement elicited by hand tapping and eye blinking in the Kinematic Dystonia Measure is more likely due to dystonia rather than choreoathetosis.</p>
<p>Gordon et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812443086">4</xref>
</sup> conducted a study using the Kinematic Dystonia Measure in 13 children with hemiplegia. Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores correlated well with the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (<italic>r</italic> = 0.74, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), and the Kinematic Dystonia Measure was found to differentiate children with hemiplegia from comparisons. This study provided preliminary evidence that the Kinematic Dystonia Measure can provide a means of quantifying the presence of dystonia in an upper limb. In order to further determine the properties of this measure, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability and construct validity of the Kinematic Dystonia Measure.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073812443086">
<title>Participants and Study Design</title>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained for this study from the hospital Research Ethics Board and participants and/or their caregivers provided informed consent. A consecutive sample of 11 children presenting with upper extremity dystonia were recruited for the study from a tertiary level hypertonia clinic. Children were identified with dystonia or mixed tone (ie, dystonia and spasticity) based on the administration of the Hypertonia Assessment Tool.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812443086">6</xref>
</sup> The Hypertonia Assessment Tool is a standardized clinical examination tool that identifies the subtype of hypertonia (spasticity, dystonia, or rigidity) present in a limb. Children were eligible if they were between 4 and 18 years of age, were more than 6 months from previous botulinum toxin A injections, and were able to complete the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812443086">7</xref>
</sup> A consecutive sample of 6 comparison subjects between 4 and 18 years of age was also recruited for this study. Four years was considered the youngest age at which the Kinematic Dystonia Measure tasks could be completed. The comparison group was composed of healthy controls that did not have evidence of hypertonia in the upper extremity based on a neurologic examination.</p>
<p>This case comparison study assessed children at 2 time points: baseline (time A) and 30 minutes later on the same day (time B). At time A, children were assessed using the Kinematic Dystonia Measure, Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale, Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test, Hypertonia Assessment Tool for the more affected arm, Manual Ability Classification Scale level,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812443086">8</xref>
</sup> and House Functional classification<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812443086">9</xref>
</sup> for spontaneous hand use. At time B, children were tested with the Kinematic Dystonia Measure. Comparison subjects were tested at both time points with the Kinematic Dystonia Measure only.</p>
<p>The Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale is designed to assess the severity of dystonia in 8 body regions: eyes, mouth, neck, trunk, and the 4 extremities. Each body region is rated on a 5-point criterion-based ordinal scale and is summed to produce a total score. The Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity quality of movement in 4 domains: dissociated movements, grasp, weight bearing, and protective extension. Adjustments were made for unilateral scoring by halving the denominator in each domain. The Manual Ability Classification Scale classifies how children with cerebral palsy use their hands to handle objects in daily activities, with level I indicating minor limitations and level V indicating severe functional limitations. The House Functional Classification rates unilateral hand function and grip strength and ranges from 0 (no use) to 8 (complete, spontaneous use).</p>

<title>Kinematic Dystonia Measure</title>
<p>As voluntary movement triggers dystonia, the Kinematic Dystonia Measure is a measure of the amount of involuntary movement in an upper extremity triggered by tapping of the opposite or contralateral hand. The subject is seated with the dystonic arm instrumented with retro-reflective markers, resting in their lap and the contralateral forearm and hand resting on a table placed beside them. Reflective markers (14-mm spheres) were placed at anatomic landmarks of the dystonic upper extremity (third metacarpophalangeal joint, medial and lateral wrist, lateral aspect of the forearm, medial and lateral condyles of the humerus, lateral aspect of the upper arm) and shoulder girdle (left and right acromions, C7, and midpoint of the clavicles).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812443086">10</xref>
</sup> The markers were applied on all children by the same evaluator.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed to tap the contralateral hand in time with an auditory cue provided at a rate of 176 bpm. A 7-camera Vicon MX motion capture system sampling at 120 Hz collected the 3-dimensional coordinates of the markers during testing. Reflective markers were manually identified using Vicon Workstation. Marker trajectories were filtered using a second-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812443086">4</xref>
</sup> Vicon Bodybuilder was used to calculate the following joint rotations according to the biomechanical model described by Rab et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812443086">10</xref>
</sup>: wrist flexion-extension, forearm pronation-supination, elbow flexion-extension, shoulder flexion-extension, shoulder abduction-adduction, and shoulder internal-external rotation. These angles, representing rotational and translational movement, were summed to produce the Kinematic Dystonia Measure score. In individuals where both upper extremities exhibited dystonia, the more affected arm was measured using the Kinematic Dystonia Measure, with the less affected hand completing the tapping task. Comparison children were asked to use their dominant hand for tapping, whereas their other arm was instrumented with markers.</p>
<p>In some children, hand tapping may produce mirror movements that may affect Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores. Other children with more significant motor impairments may not be able to complete a hand-tapping task. Therefore, an eye-blinking task was also introduced to determine if there were differences in Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores between the 2 tasks. Children were seated as in the tapping task and asked to blink their eyes in time with an auditory cue produced at 100 beats per minute. Movement in the dystonic arm was measured using the protocol system described earlier. Children and comparisons were tested with both the hand-tapping and eye-blinking task at time A and B.</p>

<title>Reliability and Construct Validation</title>
<p>Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores from time A to time B. As no criterion standard exists for the evaluation of dystonia, construct validity was assessed using the following a priori constructs:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The Kinematic Dystonia Measure score will be significantly higher for children with dystonia than comparisons.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Kinematic Dystonia Measure score will correlate with the total Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale score.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Kinematic Dystonia Measure score will correlate with the arm Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale subscore.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Kinematic Dystonia Measure score will correlate with Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test score.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073812443086">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the test-retest reliability between repeated measures of the Kinematic Dystonia Measure for both the hand-tapping and eye-blinking tasks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812443086">11</xref>
</sup> Differences between the participants’ and comparisons’ Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores were compared using a Student <italic>t</italic> test. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of the relationship between Kinematic Dystonia Measure and total Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores, the dystonic arm Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale subscores, and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test scores.</p>
<p>Bland-Altman plots were used to estimate measurement bias.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812443086">12</xref>
</sup> The difference in Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores between time A and time B for each subject was plotted against the mean difference between the 2 time points. Plots were examined for the magnitude of the difference between time points (time A–time B) and distribution around the zero line. The mean difference (d) and the standard deviation of the differences (SD<sub>d</sub>) were used to estimate limits of agreement. The limits of agreement were calculated as the mean test-retest difference [d] + (1.96 × SD<sub>d</sub>). It is expected that 95% of the differences between time A and time B for any individual will lie between these limits. Analysis was completed using SPSS, version 16.0(2).</p>

<p>Test-retest reliability for the eye-blinking task was substantial with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.03, 0.93). Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores for the eye-blinking task were significantly different for participants (189.92° ± 155.73°) when compared with comparisons (58.56° ± 55.14°); (<italic>P</italic> = .03).

<p>The Bland-Altman plot for the tapping task revealed a nonuniform distribution around the zero line, where greater variability was associated with larger mean values. For example, larger difference scores between testing sessions were found in children who had a larger mean Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812443086">Figure 2</xref>). For the eye-blinking task, the Bland Altman plot revealed more uniform distribution around the zero line.

This subject was 4 years old, and notes taken during the testing session indicated difficulty in completing the task. Removing this outlier, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores with the eye-blinking task was recalculated as 0.96 (95% CI = 0.82, 0.99). In addition, recalculation of the correlations between the Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores for the eye-blinking task and total Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.41, <italic>P</italic> = .24) affected arm Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale subscores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.72, <italic>P</italic> = .02) and Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test scores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = –0.17, <italic>P</italic> = .63).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study show that the Kinematic Dystonia Measure using the hand-tapping task has excellent short-term test-retest reliability. This is an important finding as dystonia may produce variable postures and movements that make reliable measurement challenging. The Kinematic Dystonia Measure also had good construct validity, with Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores being significantly higher in children with upper extremity dystonia compared with iability among individuals with dystonia. Higher Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores also correlated with increased severity of dystonia as measured by the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (total and arm scores) and negatively correlated with upper extremity function as measured by the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test consistent with a priori constructs. This study therefore supports the use of the Kinematic Dystonia Measure as a quantifiable measure of upper extremity dystonia.</p>
<p>As hand tapping may produce mirror movements, an eye-blinking task was also introduced. Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores from the eye-blinking task have substantial test-retest reliability, and therefore may be used as an alternative if mirror movements are noted. Construct validity testing using this task, however, showed only slight correlations between Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores and Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores and Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test scores.</p>
<p>Correlations improved between Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores and total and arm Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores to the moderate-substantial range after removing 1 outlier identified by the Bland-Altman plot for the eye-blinking task. This individual was young and had challenges completing the test. As the eye-blinking task appears to be more difficult to complete for younger children and correlations between Kinematic Dystonia Measure scores and validity measures were not as strong as in the hand-tapping task, the hand-tapping task is the preferred method of administering the Kinematic Dystonia Measure.</p>
<p>In this study, variability in test-retest scores was greater in individuals with more severe dystonia as shown in the Bland-Altman plots. This variability is often seen clinically and makes measuring dystonia challenging. Further research investigating the Kinematic Dystonia Measure’s long-term reliability and responsiveness to change in a larger group of children with a wide range of functional ability and severity will strengthen the results of this study.</p>
<p>There are limitations to using the Kinematic Dystonia Measure. The Kinematic Dystonia Measure quantifies one aspect of dystonia—involuntary movement triggered by a voluntary motor task. Some individuals may experience an increase in their dystonia with triggers other than voluntary movement. For example, sensory input such as pain or emotional triggers such as anxiety may elicit dystonia. These triggers are not assessed by the Kinematic Dystonia Measure. The Kinematic Dystonia Measure does not quantify postures, which are also a feature of dystonia. This measure would be enhanced by quantifying the amount of time a child maintained a particular posture or by adding a measure of muscle contraction such as electromyography. Children who present with significant hyperkinetic movements such as choreoathetosis combined with dystonia may be challenging to assess using the Kinematic Dystonia Measure, as this measure requires that the individual be able to maintain a stable “rest position” at baseline. Finally, construct validity in this study was evaluated using tools currently available to assess dystonia. The authors acknowledge limitations to the reliability of using the “affected arm” Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale scores.</p>
<p>In summary, the Kinematic Dystonia Measure shows promise in being a reliable valid quantitative measure of upper extremity dystonia. At this time, the Kinematic Dystonia Measure is likely to be used for research purposes rather than in a clinical setting. However, when used in combination with functional outcome measures, it can be effective at evaluating children with dystonia.</p>
