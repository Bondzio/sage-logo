<p><bold>Objective</bold>: The aims of the present study was to investigate communication impairments in a Norwegian sample of children with ADHD and children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and to explore whether children with ADHD can be differentiated from children with AS in terms of their language profiles on the Norwegian adaptation of the Children’s Communication Checklist Second Edition (CCC-2). <bold>Method</bold>: The CCC-2 was completed by the parents, and altogether, 77 children aged between 6 and 15 years participated in the study. <bold>Results</bold>: Communication impairments were as common in a group of children with ADHD as in a group of children with AS. Although a similar pattern appeared on most CCC-2 scales, children with ADHD and children with AS could be distinguished from each other in terms of their language profiles on the subscales assessing stereotyped language and nonverbal communication. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Language abilities should be taken into account when standard assessments of ADHD and AS are performed and before therapies are initiated.</p>

<p>Within communication three intersecting areas of language, content, form, and pragmatics (use) are equally important and problems may arise as a result of impairments within any of these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts &amp; Embrechts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710378233">Landa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710378233">Spanoudis, Natsopoulos, &amp; Panayiotou, 2007</xref>). Communicative competence has an effect on how children think, learn, and develop social relationships. Being the ultimate purpose of language, communication also includes nonlinguistic parameters such as gesture, eye contact, and turn-taking abilities. Thus, communication impairments encompass a wide range of difficulties affecting language as well as verbal and nonverbal pragmatic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710378233">Lust, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710378233">Norbury, Tomblin, &amp; Bishop, 2008</xref>). Pragmatics may be defined as the appropriate use and interpretation of language in different contexts and is usually viewed as one of the three basic components of language mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710378233">Bloom &amp; Lahey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710378233">Fujiki &amp; Brinton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710378233">Tannock &amp; Schachar, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Communication problems have been reported both in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710378233">Bignell &amp; Cain, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Baird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710378233">Tannock &amp; Schachar, 1996</xref>) and in children with Asperger syndrome (AS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Baird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710378233">Tager-Flusberg, 2006</xref>). ADHD is the most frequently diagnosed psychiatric disorder in childhood with a reported prevalence between 3% and 7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710378233">Jitendra, DuPaul, Someki, &amp; Tresco, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710378233">Leblanc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710378233">Sciutto &amp; Eisenberg, 2007</xref>). Although language related problems are not among the cardinal features or required to fulfill current diagnostic criteria of ADHD according to <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., Text Revision; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710378233">[APA], 2000</xref>), several studies have revealed a high prevalence of communication difficulties among these children. Out of a cohort of 3,208 children aged between 6 and 11 years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054710378233">Tirosh and Cohen (1998)</xref> identified a substantial overlap between language deficits and attention deficit disorder that is consistent with previous findings from clinical samples, 45% of the children fulfilled the criteria for both diagnoses. In line with this, more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710378233">Bruce, Thernlund, and Nettelbladt (2006)</xref> reported language impairments in 67% of a clinical sample of 76 Swedish children (mean age 11 years) diagnosed with ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710378233">Cohen et al. (2000)</xref> found that almost 64% of children aged between 7 and 14 year who were child psychiatric outpatients, fulfilled criteria for language impairment, and a diagnosis of ADHD was given to 46% of these children. They claimed that systematic assessment of language is rarely completed in children with ADHD and suggested that a possible reason for this might be that the language deficits primarily are found in the area of pragmatics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710378233">Camarata and Gibson (1999)</xref> also held that studies assessing pragmatic language skills in children with ADHD are rare, and they underlined that this aspect of language may be especially vulnerable to disruption for children receiving this diagnosis.</p>
<p>Pragmatic difficulties are also reported in children within a broad range of different diagnostic backgrounds beside children with ADHD, for example, in children with language impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710378233">Bishop, 1998</xref>), in children with autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts &amp; Embrechts, 2008</xref>), in children with cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710378233">Holck, Nettelbladt, &amp; Dahlgren Sandberg, 2009</xref>), and in children with Williams syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710378233">Laws &amp; Bishop, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop and Baird (2001)</xref> found that children with ADHD scored as low as children with AS on the pragmatic composite of the Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710378233">Bishop, 1998</xref>). In the Netherlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378233">Geurts et al. (2004)</xref> investigated whether children (aged 5-14 years) with ADHD, children with high functioning autism (HFA), and normal controls could be differentiated using the CCC. They found that all groups could be differentiated from each other on the pragmatic composite of the CCC with the ADHD group being in between normal controls and HFA. In a Dutch community sample of 4-year-old children, Ketalaars, Cuperus, Jansonius, and Verhoeven (2010) found a strong connection between behavioral problems and pragmatic language problems. Hyperactivity showed especially high correlations with pragmatic competence. On the basis of these findings, they claimed that early assessment of pragmatic competence may lead to early detection of ADHD.</p>
<p>Children with AS constitute a subgroup within the autism spectrum that displays a specific pattern according to current diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710378233">APA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054710378233">World Health Organization, 1992</xref>); they should not show any clinically significant delay in language development or cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710378233">Vertè et al., 2006</xref>). However, pragmatic deficits are described as universal symptoms in both children and adults with AS by many research teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710378233">Loucas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710378233">Loukusa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710378233">Rapin &amp; Dunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710378233">Ruser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710378233">Tager-Flusberg, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710378233">Rapin and Dunn (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts and Embrechts (2008)</xref> difficulties with the structural domains of language may resolve, although the pragmatic problems seem to remain lifelong, thus indicating a possible mismatch between current diagnostic criteria and the definitions used by some clinicians. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710378233">Loukusa et al. (2007)</xref> found an impaired ability to answer contextually demanding questions among children with both AS and HFA, supporting the hypothesis that even in the presence of normal linguistic abilities children with AS or HFA might exhibit pragmatic impairments. In the Netherlands, when investigating children with HFA, children with AS, children with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise classified (PDD-NOS), and typically developing controls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710378233">Vertè et al. (2006)</xref> found pragmatic impairments in all clinical groups with 72% of the children with HFA, 70% of the children with AS, and 55% of the children with PDD-NOS scoring below cutoff on the CCC.</p>
<p>Commonly pragmatics is divided into three separate domains: (a) discourse management (how to initiate, maintain, and end a conversation), (b) communicative intention (how to request, tease, or inform), and (c) presupposition (assumptions about the interlocutor and the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710378233">Fujiki &amp; Brinton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710378233">Geurts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710378233">Landa, 2005</xref>). Children exhibiting pragmatic problems may have difficulties using nonverbal cues in a conversation to understand intended meaning, initiating conversation, or narrating events coherently. They may violate the rules of conversational exchange, find it difficult to repair communication that has broken down, and interpret language in an overliteral manner. Furthermore, they may have difficulties conveying information through facial expression, gesture, or prosody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710378233">Adams, Lloyd, Aldred, &amp; Baxendale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710378233">Camarata &amp; Gibson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710378233">Fujiki &amp; Brinton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710378233">Gilmour, Hill, Place, &amp; Skuse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710378233">Merrison &amp; Merrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710378233">Ruser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710378233">Ryder, Leinonen, &amp; Schulz, 2008</xref>). Research as well as formal assessment of children’s language abilities has largely focused on the content and form of language, whereas less attention has been paid to language use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710378233">Cohen, Barwick, Horodezky, Vallance, &amp; Im, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710378233">Im-Bolter &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>). This may in part be due to the fact that this aspect of language is not assessed adequately by the most commonly used clinical instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710378233">Bishop, Laws, Adams, &amp; Norbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054710378233">Towbin, Pradella, Gorrindo, Pine, &amp; Leibenluft, 2005</xref>). Different methods for the assessment of pragmatics exist, for example, coding systems of naturalistic interaction, semistructured conversational tasks, standardized test, and checklists or questionnaires. However, assessing pragmatics within a single environment such as a clinic or a classroom might be problematic as pragmatic function is by definition context dependent and difficulties within this area tend to be more apparent in everyday life than in structured test situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710378233">Botting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710378233">Dewart &amp; Summers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710378233">Farmer &amp; Oliver, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The development of the CCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710378233">Bishop, 1998</xref>) and the revised version the Children’s Communication Checklist Second Edition (CCC-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>) was motivated by the lack of assessment tools sensitive to pragmatic impairments. These questionnaires are to be completed by parents, teachers, or other persons who know the child well. They have been shown to provide valuable information of children’s communicative skills not readily obtained by standardized language tests, and they are known for sufficient discriminant validity and satisfactory interrater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710378233">Bishop, Maybery, Wong, Maley, &amp; Hallmayer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Norbury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710378233">Farmer &amp; Oliver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710378233">Geurts et al., 2008</xref>). The revised version, the CCC-2, includes scales assessing both structural aspects and pragmatic aspects of language. The questionnaire was not developed with the intent of differentiating between children with AS and ADHD but has been shown effective in distinguishing children with communication impairments from typically developing (TD) children as well as in identifying children who exhibit pragmatic impairments disproportionate to structural aspects of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>). It should be noted that these data are from the U.K. version assessing English-speaking children. The CCC-2 has also been shown to be effective in an Australian sample, although a lower cutoff had to be used in order for the instrument to differentiate as efficient as in the original U.K. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>). The present study builds on results obtained using a Norwegian adaptation of the CCC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378233">Helland, Biringer, Helland, &amp; Heimann, 2009</xref>). As communication impairments have been reported both for children with ADHD and children with AS, and as the results from previous studies have shown, diverging results as how well the scale differentiates between children with AS and children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Baird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378233">Geurts et al., 2004</xref>), the authors wanted to explore whether these two diagnostic groups would show different profiles or not on the Norwegian adaptation of the CCC-2.</p>
<p>Considering the social disabilities associated with communication impairments as well as the fact that most therapies, including social skills training techniques used with ADHD children are verbally based, it appears important to systematically evaluate language and communication competence in children with psychiatric disorders as part of the assessment procedure before therapies are initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710378233">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710378233">Helland &amp; Heimann, 2007</xref>). To our knowledge no studies investigating communication impairments in children with ADHD and children with AS have been performed on a Norwegian sample so far, thus motivating the first aim of the present study: to investigate the pattern of communication impairments in children with ADHD and children with AS because a diagnostic instrument developed in one culture is not guaranteed to produce similar results in another culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710378233">Canino &amp; Alegria, 2008</xref>). The second aim was to explore whether children with ADHD can be differentiated from children with AS and TD children in terms of their language profiles on the Norwegian adaptation of the CCC-2.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two clinical groups of children in the age between 6 and 15 years participated in this study: an ADHD group and an AS group. The children were recruited from an outpatient clinic, from a Norwegian support system for special education, and from two different parent support groups: one for ADHD and one for autism. This particular age range was selected because most children are diagnosed within this age range. Furthermore, in Norway, this is the age for compulsory schooling. Through these institutions, a letter of information, a letter of informed consent to fill out, and a copy of the CCC-2 were sent to parents of all together 173 children. A total of 67 (39%) of the forms of consent and questionnaires were returned; out of these, 49 were included in the study meeting the following criteria: a diagnosis of either ADHD or AS and no mental retardation according to parental reports (for 20 of the children in the clinical groups the diagnosis were also confirmed by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists), Norwegian as their first language, being able to speak in sentences, no sensory neural hearing loss and consistently completed questionnaires according to the criteria specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop (2003)</xref>. The ADHD group consisted of 28 children (mean age = 11.0; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.3; 21 boys) and the AS group consisted of 21 children (<italic>M</italic> = 10.8; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.4; 17 boys).</p>
<p>TD children aged between 6 and 12 years were recruited to take part in a former validation study of the Norwegian adaptation of the CCC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378233">Helland et al., 2009</xref>). None of these children had any known learning disabilities or specific language problems, and they didn’t have any problems with communication according to their parents. From this sample (<italic>n</italic> = 108), 18 children were selected to serve as a typically developing comparison group. For each child in the ADHD group, a typically developing (TD) child of same age, and gender were randomly drawn from this sample. As the present study covered a broader age range (6-15 years) than our former study, additional 42 children in the age span 12 to 15 years were recruited from regular schools using the same procedure as in the previously mentioned study, and from this sample, 10 children were drawn. Thus, the TD group consisted of 28 children of similar mean age and similar distribution of boys and girls matched with the ADHD group. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, University of Bergen.</p>

<p>The CCC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>; Norwegian adaptation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710378233">Helland &amp; Møllerhaug, 2006</xref>) is designed to identify children with communication impairments as well as to discriminate children with specific language impairment (SLI) from children with pragmatic language impairment disproportionate to their structural language abilities. The questionnaire is to be completed by parents (or others who have known the child for at least 3 months). The CCC-2 contains 70 items grouped into 10 subscales with seven items in each subscale: five items describing difficulties and two items describing strengths.</p>
<p>The separate subscales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710378233">Table 1</xref>) include items assessing, for example, whether the child simplifies words by leaving out sounds (Scale A), produces long and complicated sentences (Scale B), mixes up words that sound similar (Scale C), explains a past event clearly (Scale D), starts conversations with strangers (Scale E), uses favorite sentences in contexts where they are inappropriate (Scale F), shows variable ability to communicate in different situations (Scale G), does not respond to conversational initiatives from others (Scale H), verbally hurts others unintentionally (Scale I), or shows interests in unusual activities (Scale J). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale where the informants are asked to judge how often they have observed the described behavior: (1) <italic>less than once a week (or never);</italic> (2) <italic>at least once a week, but not every day;</italic> (3) <italic>once or twice a day;</italic> and (4) <italic>several times (more than twice a day) or always</italic>. A high raw score reflects poorer performance. In addition, a General Communication Composite (GCC), formed by summing the scaled scores of the first eight subscales (A-H), may be calculated. This is an overall measure of communication skills, effective at discriminating children likely to have communication problems from TD children. A second composite score is the Social Interaction Deviance Composite (SIDC). This is a difference score formed by subtracting the sum of the scaled scores of Scales A, B, C, and D from the sum of Scales E, H, I, and J (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710378233">Table 2</xref>). It is designed to identify children with pragmatic difficulties disproportionate to their structural language abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710378233">Bishop, Maybery, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378233">Helland et al., 2009</xref>). If there are missing data for any of the separate scales composing the SIDC, then this composite is not computed. According to the U.K. standardization, the SIDC is only to be interpreted if the child also scores below cutoff on the GCC, an exception is scores of −15 or less, as scores this extreme is expected to be clinically significant even if the GCC is within normal limits. The raw scores are converted into standardized scores scaled with a mean of 10 and a <italic>SD</italic> of 3 by an automated scoring program that comes with the CCC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>). In the present article, scaled scores (higher score indicating better performance) are only reported for the GCC and the SIDC. The Norwegian version of the CCC-2 had been evaluated on a sample of 153 children aged between 6 and 12, revealing good internal consistency (alpha ranging from .73 to .89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378233">Helland et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>On the basis of our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378233">Helland et al., 2009</xref>), a cutoff at or below 64 scaled scores on the GCC was selected for identifying children with clinically significant communication problems. In the ADHD group, a total of 23 out of 28 children (82.1%) obtained the low score. The corresponding number in the AS group was 19 out of 21 children (90.5%). In the TD group, only 1 child out of 28 (3.6%) scored below cutoff. On the SIDC, 16 out of the 23 children in the ADHD group who were identified with communication problems obtained a score indicative of pragmatic impairment. One additional child scored in the clinical range even with the GCC within normal limits. In the AS group, 16 out of 19 children (missing SIDC scores for two children) obtained a score indicating pragmatic impairment. The corresponding number in the TD group was one child. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054710378233">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087054710378233">2</xref> show the distribution of scaled scores on the GCC and the SIDC in each group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aims of the study reported here were to investigate communication impairments in a Norwegian sample of children with ADHD and children with AS and to explore whether these clinical groups could be distinguished from each other in terms of their language profiles on the Norwegian adaptation of the CCC-2. The main results showed that the vast majority of children with ADHD as well as those with AS encounter communication impairments. Clinically significant communications problems were identified in 82.1% of the ADHD group and in 90.5% of the AS group; the corresponding number in the TD group was 3.6%. The two clinical groups could not be differentiated from each other on an overall measure of communication, the GCC, but they both scored significantly lower than the TD group. These results are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts and Embrechts (2008)</xref>, who reported that both children with ASD and children with ADHD had communication impairments compared with TD children and that the two clinical groups could not be differentiated from each other on the GCC. On the second composite, the SIDC, 69.6% of the children in the ADHD group who were identified as communication impaired, obtained a score indicating more problems with pragmatic language aspects relative to language structure, in the AS group, the same applied to 84.7% of the children. Only one child in the TD group was identified as communication impaired, and this child showed pragmatic impairment. The AS group differed significantly from the ADHD group as well as from the TD group (more impaired). This finding is in line with previous research showing that the SIDC tend to be lower in children with AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710378233">Bishop, Maybery, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710378233">Norbury, Nash, Baird, &amp; Bishop, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that this composite may give a clinician valuable information when differentiating children with AS and children with ADHD. On this measure, the ADHD group could not be differentiated from the TD group, although the scores of the ADHD children were descriptively lower than those of the TD children, this difference failed to reach statistical significance. It should be noted, though, that when used by clinicians, the SIDC is not intended to be interpreted in children scoring within the normal range on the GCC (&gt;64).</p>
<p>The language profiles on the CCC-2 revealed that children with ADHD could only be differentiated from children with AS on two scales: the stereotyped language scale and the nonverbal communication scale. On these scales, the ADHD group performed better than the AS group. It is possible that these two scales highlight problems that are especially prominent in AS like overprecise pronunciation of word, use of favorite phrases, poor eye contact, and lack of facial expression and that they therefore may give additional diagnostic information when identifying children with AS within a clinical context. As children with ADHD may show some autistic symptoms and children with AS may exhibit problems regarding attention and hyperactivity, it is possible that these scales may help assist in differentiating the two clinical groups.</p>
<p>It is an interesting finding though, that the communication problems encountered by the clinical groups are not restricted to pragmatics. Problems within three out of four scales measuring language structure/content; speech output, semantics, and coherence are evident compared with TD children. This finding is somewhat contradictory to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts and Embrechts (2008)</xref>, who found no group differences on speech output, syntax, and semantics in a comparable study using the CCC-2. Furthermore, although our ADHD group was significantly impaired relative to the TD group on the speech output scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378233">Geurts et al. (2004)</xref> found that their ADHD group did not differ from the normal controls on this scale on parental reports in a study using the original CCC. This may not only reflect the differences among the samples but also the fact that the CCC and the CCC-2 might not be directly comparable. Our findings of relatively unimpaired syntax, no significant differences between the clinical groups and the typically developing group were evident on this scale, is in line with the results of a former study on a Norwegian sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710378233">Helland &amp; Heimann, 2007</xref>). In this study, the clinical group (children referred to psychiatric services), differed significantly from the comparison group on all subscales of the original CCC, except the one measuring syntax. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts and Embrechts (2008)</xref> also reported unimpaired syntax in their study using the CCC-2.</p>
<p>The finding that the ADHD group and the AS group received similar scores on the social relations and interests scales were somewhat surprising, as these scales are reported to be sensitive to autistic-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378233">Bishop, 2003</xref>). One might speculate if the social relations problems reported by the ADHD group in part arise as results of their rather profound impairments in structural as well as pragmatic language aspects; alternatively some children with ADHD may have underlying difficulties in social understanding comparable to children with AS. The differential diagnosis between ADHD and AS may be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378233">Geurts et al., 2004</xref>) and we only have diagnosis confirmed by clinicians for part of the children in the clinical groups (20 out of 49), as they were assigned to the ADHD group or the AS group based on parental information. Therefore, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some children in our sample had comorbid disorders unknown to us.</p>
<p>The similarities found between the ADHD group and the AS group on most CCC-2 scales might indicate that a considerable continuity exists between disorders that have been traditionally regarded as rather distinct from one another and that a sharp division between pervasive and specific developmental disorders does not exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Baird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710378233">Bishop &amp; Norbury, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710378233">Gilmour et al. 2004</xref>). An alternative interpretation would of course be that the CCC-2 lacks in specificity for evaluating communicative skills that may distinguish ADHD from AS.</p>

<title>Strength and Limitations</title>
<p>Several methodological limitations have to be considered when evaluating the results of the present study. The high percentage (82.1%) of children in the ADHD group displaying clinical significant communication impairments was somewhat unexpected, although comparable findings are reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710378233">Bruce et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710378233">Tannock &amp; Schachar, 1996</xref>). It is possible that our findings may in part be due to selection bias. Considering the heterogeneity of children diagnosed with ADHD, the authors suspect that parents who were concerned with their children’s communication skills may be overrepresented among the respondents in this study. Not knowing whether the children were on medication or not when the CCC-2 evaluation was carried out is another limitation as one might speculate if medication would lead to improved performance. Furthermore, one has to bear in mind that the diagnosis of ADHD or AS, the absence of mental retardation, as well as the evaluation of the children’s communication are based on parental reports. It is possible that a different pattern would have emerged if confirmed diagnosis had been available for all the children in the clinical groups, if a more comprehensive language assessment using standardized tests had been administered to each child individually, and if information of the severity of the children’s clinical symptoms and their verbal and nonverbal abilities were available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378233">Geurts &amp; Embrechts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710378233">Helland &amp; Heimann, 2007</xref>). However, the results of the children with a confirmed diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 20) did not differ from the results of the children with just parent-reported diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 29) on the GCC, thus indicating that the diagnosis reported by parents are reliable. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop and Baird (2001)</xref> found parental reports tightly linked to the child’s diagnosis in a study using the original CCC. More research is needed to investigate if this applies to the CCC-2 as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378233">Bishop and Baird (2001)</xref> also investigated whether the pragmatic composite was related to intellectual abilities. They found that no significant relation existed neither with verbal or nonverbal abilities based on parental reports.</p>
<p>The fact that the authors do not have any information regarding parental socioeconomic status might also affect our findings. However, Norway enjoys an extensive welfare state with a relatively egalitarian income distribution and most residents have a relatively high standard of living. Due to a combination of high labor marked participation and the universal character of the social security system, Norway has few poor residents compared to most other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710378233">Halvorsen &amp; Stjernø, 2008</xref>). The participating families were residents in rural districts on the west coast of Norway, and thus, significant differences regarding socioeconomic status among the participants would not be expected. It is an aim for further research to investigate whether the authors’ findings are replicable if, for instance, all children at an outpatient clinic referred for ADHD or AS are administered the CCC-2 as part of the standard assessment procedure.</p>
<p>The results of the current study suggests that communication impairments of clinical significance are as common in a group of children with ADHD as in a group of children with AS. Furthermore, the authors’ findings indicate that although a similar pattern appears on most CCC-2 scales, children with ADHD and children with AS can be distinguished from each other in terms of their language profiles on the scales assessing stereotyped language and nonverbal communication, with the AS group being the most impaired. The results reported here underline the importance of routine screening of communication to be performed as part of the assessment procedure for both disorders and before treatment is initiated. At present, this is not the usual procedure in Norway. The area of language and communication is often not assessed at all, and whether or not an evaluation is performed seems heavily dependent on the interests of each individual professional. Therapeutic outcome as well as school achievements might be adversely affected if communication difficulties are not taken into consideration. Children with ADHD are at risk for developing behavioral problems that are often more salient and thus overshadowing less apparent communication problems. Identifying such problems may contribute to better understanding of the children, thus improving their relationships with teachers and parents which in turn hopefully will prevent even more serious problems to develop.</p>
