<abstract>
<p>The present interpretive work explores the consumption experiences of pregnant women transitioning to mother roles, focusing specifically upon the consumption of maternity dress, which has not been previously considered within the context of liminal consumption. Of particular interest were if and how the consumption of maternity dress may shape the self during the liminal transition of pregnancy. Findings revealed that consumption of maternity dress during pregnancy both complicated and supported participants’ embodied experiences as liminal, pregnant selves and their transition to motherhood. Three overarching themes were identified and reflect the ways in which participants’ consumption practices were tightly bound with their identities, which, in turn, represented a repertoire of possible selves that often diverged from the participants’ current identities. Specifically, the three emergent themes included: (1) maternity dress consumption representing disruption in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time,’ (2) maternity dress consumption to affirm one’s new identity as ‘Pregnant/Expectant Mother,’ and (3) maternity dress consumption to maintain continuity in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time.’ Findings also underscored that consumption during liminality is complex, both inciting and relieving ambivalence during role transition.</p>

<body>
<p>Liminal transitions, which are marked by instability and ambiguity, occur throughout the lifespan and serve as periods of transition whereby an individual’s identity may be suspended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480161">Noble and Walker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513480161">van Gennep, 1960</xref>). Research suggests that an individual may use consumption and possessions to assist in transitions during periods of liminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480161">Belk, 1988</xref>). This consumption and focus on possessions serve as a symbolic means for representing the self when identity is in flux, a concept that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480161">Belk (1988)</xref> refers to as the ‘extended self.’ A major liminal transition for women includes pregnancy, a period during which aspects of the self are redefined and negotiated as the body undergoes dramatic changes and a woman moves into the new role of ‘mother.’</p>
<p>During pregnancy, women’s experiences of embodiment and bodily control shift and may be challenged, which may have consequences for identity and the self. For many women, the bodily shifts of pregnancy may not be welcomed but, rather, may incite ambivalence and frustration about appearance and the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480161">Earle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480161">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). Although research on body-related symbolic consumption during liminal periods has focused on strategies to improve an individual’s appearance, such as the use of cosmetic surgery to adopt a new role following a liminal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480161">Schouten, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540513480161">Wicklund and Gollwitzer, 1982</xref>), little to no research has explored the role of symbolic consumption and its subsequent impact on identity during a transition where the body is not perceived as improved in its appearance, such as during pregnancy. As such, the purpose of the present qualitative study was to explore the ways in which women negotiate aspects of their appearance, specifically their clothing selection and use, through symbolic consumption during the liminal transition of pregnancy.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1469540513480161"><title>Body, dress, consumption and liminality</title>
<p>In the contemporary West, the body is regarded by many social theorists as a central site in defining the self, particularly within the context of a consumer culture that emphasizes the appearance of the body as a bearer of symbolic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513480161">Howson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540513480161">Shilling, 2005</xref>). The dressed body <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1469540513480161">1</xref></sup> is made suitable for interaction within society, serving as the boundary between the self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480161">Entwistle, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480161">Davis (1992)</xref> argues that dress forms a visible envelope for the self and ‘serves as visual metaphor for identity; it is also social since our dress is structured by social forces and [is] subject to social and moral pressure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480161">Entwistle, 2001</xref>: 37). Additionally, dress and appearance are central to taking on and performing roles, including gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480161">Goffman, 1959</xref>), and serve as a foundation for guiding interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480161">Blumer, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the area of consumer research, the body is viewed as strongly connected to identity, particularly as an aspect of the extended self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480161">Belk, 1988</xref>). As an extension of the body, managing one’s appearance through clothing selection represents an additional aspect of the extended self. Consumption that takes place for appearance management purposes represents a form of symbolic consumption as it plays a role in shaping meanings of the self and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480161">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480161">Schouten, 1991</xref>) and serves to assist during transitional phases of the life course, such as pregnancy.</p>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group (2010)</xref>, research related to symbolic consumption and identity construction during times of transition may be conceptualized into four main categories: (a) consuming to manage role uncertainty; (b) consuming to achieve an ideal self; (c) consuming to cope with liminality; and (d) consuming to bridge identities. They argue that most of the research in this vein focuses on the positive role that consumption plays for individuals in transition, suggesting that consumption during liminality serves to resolve identity issues. Yet some research on women’s transitions to motherhood – including that conducted by the Voice Group – reveals that such consumption does not always aid in resolving identity issues for individuals. Rather, these findings suggest that transitional consumption may be complex and ambiguous, leaving some individuals with feelings of ambivalence. Cody’s theory of liminal consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480161">Cody, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480161">Cody and Lawlor, 2011</xref>) integrates the possibility of both vexing and empowering outcomes for liminal consumers, proposing that although suspension between clear social categories (e.g. child and adolescent) can produce frustration, confusion, and invisibility within the marketplace, such positioning also can inspire ‘fruitful’ consumption activities that reflect agency and ambition.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480161">Belk’s (1988)</xref> consumer research findings reveal that the greater degree of control an individual has over an aspect of the extended self, such as possessions or the body, the more a part of the self it becomes. This ties to the predominant notion within western culture that one must exert control over the body. Following this logic, the more control over the body and subsequent bodily related practices that one possesses, the more tied to one’s self-concept the body becomes. During temporary distortions of the body, such as pregnancy, however, the capacity to exert control over the body is undermined. That is, research suggests that during pregnancy and postpartum, women view the body as obdurate and out of control and as representing a disparity between their actual and ideal future selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480161">Ogle et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, although yet unexplored, it is possible that, during pregnancy, maternity clothing may represent a means through which expectant mothers can exercise some sense of control over the physical self, thereby alleviating certain identity tensions. Or, following the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group’s (2010)</xref> findings, it may be that the consumption of maternity dress may further complicate these tensions and ambivalences. Such issues will be explored in the present work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540513480161"><title>Role identities and multiple selves</title>
<p>Our understanding of the social world lends the expectation that an individual holds a role and that he/she looks and behaves in accordance with that role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480161">Goffman, 1959</xref>). Additionally, as individuals, we come to understand the social world and how we may situate ourselves within it (i.e. perform in accordance with social convention) through roles and the appearances associated with those roles. ‘Thus it is proposed that product symbolism is often consumed by the social actor for the purpose of defining and clarifying behavior patterns associated with social roles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480161">Solomon, 1983</xref>: 320). Appearance management related consumption is an important prop for setting the stage for the role and for the role performance to have legitimacy.</p>
<p>Social roles play an integral part of an individual’s self-concept. Symbols that portray a particular social role aid the individual in legitimating to others that particular role and may help the individual to create self-understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480161">Schouten, 1991</xref>). Additionally, many consumer researchers contend that symbolic consumption may represent a means for individuals to overcome the ambiguity of role change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480161">Noble and Walker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480161">Schouten, 1991</xref>). During times of role change marked by uncertainty, the consumption of various props can help to transition from one role into another role.</p>
<p>Because we, as individuals, take on a number of roles in our lives, our sense of self may feel divided or fragmented, lacking a single coherent narrative. Theorists argue that given the current postmodern era filled with choice, creativity, and confusion in constructing one’s identity, our sense of self is fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480161">Lifton, 1993</xref>). Although there is a lack of agreement among scholars as to the true nature of the self, many do agree as to the multiplicity that exists within the self or to the notion that the self has multiple layers or facets. These multiple aspects of the self, or multiple selves, converge with the various roles we take in our lives. During periods of liminality, where there is a transition from one role to another, various aspects of our self and identity are forced to be negotiated. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480161">Cody (2012)</xref> found that liminal tween consumption experiences reflect the negotiation of not only present identities, but also the negotiation of identities that are rooted in the past and future (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480161">Cody and Lawlor, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>With their interpretive study of new mothers, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group (2010)</xref> elucidated the various roles – positive and negative – that consumption can play during liminal transitions. The present work further explores the consumption experiences of women transitioning to mother roles, focusing specifically upon the consumption of maternity dress, which has not been previously considered within the context of liminal consumption. Given that the body is constituent of the self – and that the dressed body, in particular, is a bearer of personal identity – we were especially interested in gaining understanding about if and how the consumption of maternity dress may shape the self during the liminal transition of pregnancy. Of particular interest was whether the transition to motherhood may elicit the negotiation of various aspects of the self, and if so, what role the consumption of maternity dress may play in that negotiation process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540513480161" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>For the present work, we adopted an interpretive, qualitative approach that drew upon grounded and reflexive processes to data generation and analysis. To elicit rich descriptions among participants, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 women expecting their first child. Interviews were conducted toward the end of the pregnancy (i.e. during the seventh or eighth month). The decision to target women expecting their first child was purposeful, as the maternity dress consumption experiences of first-time expectant mothers may differ from those of experienced mothers (e.g. first time mothers may not have a ‘store’ of existing maternity dresses from a past pregnancy, nor would they have prior experiences with the consumption of maternity dress).</p>
<sec id="sec4-1469540513480161" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants and data collection</title>
<p>The sample was recruited from two mid-sized university towns in the western and southeastern regions of the USA. Most participants responded to flyers promoting the research posted in local obstetricians’ offices and maternity wear shops. Additionally, a few couples were recruited via snowball sampling.</p>
<p>Participants’ demographic and socioeconomic circumstances varied somewhat, but most shared a middle- or upper middle-class American lifestyle. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 39 years (<italic>M</italic> = 28.8 years). Two participants identified themselves as ‘Hispanic,’ and one participant reported her ethnicity as ‘Asian.’ The remaining participants described themselves as ‘Caucasian.’ All but one participant had completed some form of post-secondary education, and the majority had earned a bachelor’s degree. Several were enrolled in or had completed some form of graduate education. Before becoming parents, all participants were employed or were working toward a degree. Participants’ occupations ranged from clerical to professional and managerial. All participants were married.</p>
<p>An in-depth, semi-structured approach was used for the interviewing process. A set of questions was constructed to guide topics of discussion and focused upon the consumption of dress worn during the pregnancy. Example discussion topics included what was worn and why, how and where maternity dress was obtained, the expression of self through maternity dress, and attitudes toward and experiences with maternity dress consumption (e.g. attitudes toward the selection of maternity dress available in the marketplace, the experience of wearing maternity dress). To avoid ‘leading’ participants, interview questions were purposefully phrased in an open-ended format and were used only as a loose guide to develop topics of conversation between the interviewer and the participants. This approach allowed participants to provide direction for the interview, with the interviewer following their leads by posing questions in response to their comments and teasing out richer meanings from the dialogue. Thus, the interviews resembled a conversation between equals more than a rigid, question and answer session. Most interviews lasted one to two hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469540513480161"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Interview data were transcribed and were analyzed using a qualitative, hermeneutic approach similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540513480161">Hirschman (1992)</xref> and Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540513480161">Thompson and Hirschman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540513480161">Thompson et al., 1994</xref>). Key to the logic underpinning the hermeneutic approach is the assumption that initial readings of the data inform later interpretations, and, in turn, with later readings, the researchers begin to identify meanings and patterns that they do not observe as part of their earlier readings. Using this ‘part to whole process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540513480161">Thompson and Hirschman 1995</xref>: 141), researchers attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of each interview transcript while simultaneously making comparisons across the transcripts.</p>
<p>At the outset of our analytical process, we sought to become immersed in the transcripts and to develop a trustworthy understanding of the participants’ experiences, from their perspectives. Through regular dialogue, we jointly identified and negotiated meanings about several key themes within the data. We then moved to the second level of analysis, in which we sought to situate these themes within existing literature. Here, we attempted to highlight the cultural processes and taken-for-granted knowledge claims that underpinned the meanings participants associated with the consumption of maternity dress. In so doing, we engaged in ‘dialectical tacking’ with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540513480161">Geertz, 1983</xref>), moving between emic (i.e. participant) and etic (i.e. existing theory) forms of understanding to provide an interplay among the data, our interpretations, and prior work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469540513480161"><title>Emergent themes: Dress consumption as complicating and easing the liminal transition of pregnancy</title>
<p>As our participants spoke about the lived realities of consuming maternity dress, they referenced both the ways in which this consumption activity complicated as well as supported their embodied experiences as liminal, pregnant selves and their transition to motherhood (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group, 2010</xref>). Additionally, woven throughout participants’ accounts was evidence that their consumption practices were tightly bound with their identities, which, in turn, represented a repertoire of possible selves that often diverged from their current identities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540513480161">Antonucci and Mikus, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480161">Cody, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480161">Cody and Lawlor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480161">Markus and Nurius, 1986</xref>). As we will discuss, these possible selves represented and framed participants’ aspirations, motives, frustrations and fears. In this way, these various selves resembled closely the co-existing views of the self that were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim (2000)</xref> as the various ‘women’ their participants wanted to be, feared they might be, or were most of the time. For our participants, these various selves were not only coexisting, but also at times intersecting and overlapping. Of particular interest and in contrast to prior work on the consumption of baby products during the transition to motherhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480161">Thomsen and Sørensen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group, 2010</xref>), consumption of maternity dress was only occasionally undertaken to affirm one’s impending identity as a mother, but rather, was most often framed in relation to women’s non-pregnant identities, or the ‘Women They Were Most of the Time.’ In the following section, we more thoroughly consider these theoretical aspects of liminal consumption as they were manifested within our data through the discussion of three overarching emergent themes: (1) maternity dress consumption representing disruption in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time’; (2) maternity dress consumption to affirm one’s new identity as ‘Pregnant/Expectant Mother’; and (3) maternity dress consumption to maintain continuity in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time.’ Throughout this discussion, pseudonyms are used to refer to participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1469540513480161"><title>Maternity dress representing disruption in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time’</title>
<p>The first overarching theme reflected clearly the notion that consumption may play a ‘complicating role’ during periods of liminality, such as pregnancy and the transition to motherhood. In this vein, several participants expressed that their capacity to express the Woman I Am Most of the Time – or their ‘ordinary way of being with [their] clothes’ in order to produce a ‘satisfactory image’ of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>: 321) – was somehow compromised through the wearing of maternity dress, leaving them frustrated and ambivalent. As we discuss below, a variety of circumstances could contribute to these experiences of frustration and ambivalence. At the same time, it is important to note that not all participants who experienced their selves and images as in transition or a state of ‘disruption’ regarded the consumption of maternity dress negatively. Their experiences, as well, will be considered. In particular, findings will be discussed in relation to three minor themes: disruption owing to the desire to be thrifty, disruption owing to the offerings of the contemporary maternity wear market, and disruption owing to shifts in body shape.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1469540513480161"><title>Disruption owing to the desire to be thrifty</title>
<p>One of the most prevalent themes that emerged from our conversations with participants was the belief that because maternity dress is worn only for a limited period of time, the monetary resources allocated to its consumption should be limited, as well (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540513480161">Gregson and Beale, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480161">Longhurst, 2005</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>So, I have gotten most of my maternity clothes from my sisters because it’s frustrating … you don’t want to spend money on them … you’re not wearing them even for nine months, because you’re not showing until three or four or five months. (Lauren)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants identified assorted strategies for minimizing expenditures for maternity dress – which frequently was perceived as expensive – including wearing alternatives to maternity dress (e.g. oversized menswear borrowed from husbands), purchasing relatively inexpensive maternity dress from retailers such as Walmart and Target, limiting the amount of maternity dress purchased and, most commonly, wearing handed down maternity dress. Although participants often expressed gratitude for the handed down maternity dress they received, their accounts revealed that actualizing their commitment to thriftiness in their consumption of maternity dress – whether through the wearing of hand-me-downs or otherwise – incited various ambivalences, perhaps because this self-imposed frugality represented a contrast to the typical dress consumption patterns of the primarily middle-/upper-middle-class participants.</p>
<p>At a most basic level, participants described the way in which their thrifty approach to maternity dress consumption limited their capacity to express the self through the use of ‘favorite clothes’ that were regarded as well suited to their personalities and tastes. That is, as expectant mothers, many participants found themselves building a maternity wardrobe based largely upon handed down or inexpensive garments that they did not view as especially symbolic of the women they desired others to perceive them to be. As the following comment suggests, wearing these garments produced the quagmire of a mismatch between their actual and desired selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480161">Schouten, 1991</xref>) and often left participants feeling rather disheartened:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want to spend a bunch of money on maternity clothes. I just don’t … I had tons of friends send me clothes … There are a couple of outfits that I’ve worn that it’s like, ‘I really shouldn’t wear this, because this makes me feel not very good about myself.’ Like this one, I don’t mind wearing this one at home, but I’ve worn it in public and it’s pretty hideous … Bright orange and flowers on it. This just makes sure everyone notices you. ‘Look at me!’ (Ashley)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, as they sought to be frugal in their consumption of maternity dress, participants often experienced the sense that, as an outcome of their ‘make do’ choices, their capacity to realize their desired selves, or the Women they Wanted to Be or Were Most of the Time (i.e. when they were not expecting) was somehow problematized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>). Ashley’s observation that the bright outfit in question was perhaps more appropriate for home wear than for wear in public venues also highlights the potentially important role that product symbolism can play in mobilizing given images of the self in the eyes of others, particularly in times of role transition, such as pregnancy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480161">Solomon, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>As per participant accounts, the capacity to actualize a desired self during the transition to motherhood also was compromised by the limited volume of maternity dress accrued as a result of efforts to economize. In turn, not having access to a deep and diverse stock of well-liked pieces of clothing undermined participants’ ability to flexibly and easily build a variety of ‘looks’ or ‘versions of the self’ in the process of constructing diverse identities or subjectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480161">Frost, 2003</xref>). Further, as the following comment suggests, working with a somewhat limited wardrobe sometimes moved participants to violate certain, previously embraced ‘moral precepts’ for dressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540513480161">Stone, 1962</xref>), such as not frequently repeating outfits or not wearing certain colors or styles (e.g. those that were perceived to conflict with The Woman One Wanted to Be/Was Most of the Time):<disp-quote>
<p>I can’t afford to buy a whole new wardrobe. I’m meticulous about what I wear … I like clothes. It’s hard for me to know, ‘I just wore those pants two days ago and I’m going to wear them again,’ whereas before I [was pregnant], I would kind of unconsciously say, ‘I wore that outfit about two weeks ago. Okay, I can pull it out again.’ … Now I just have about six to ten days’ worth of clothes. I always said before that when I got pregnant, I wouldn’t sacrifice my own personal taste or style … It’s not always easy because you get a lot of hand-me-downs, and I will get something that will be a color that I never would wear, and I’ve caved in and worn it a few times because you get so tired of the same old clothes. (Diane)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, some participants bemoaned the fact that, in the name of economy, they had resorted to wearing lower quality, less stylish clothing than they would typically wear (e.g. clothing purchased at mass merchants such as Walmart), and as such, they sometimes felt like they were dishonoring their personal aesthetic standards for appearance. For participants, then, violating such moral precepts was regarded as a compromise of sorts; although doing so expanded opportunities for variation in the wardrobe, wearing disliked garments did not, in the participants’ minds, enlarge the range of possibilities for expressing desired selves and, thus, was approached with some measure of resentment or ambivalence.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1469540513480161"><title>Disruption owing to the maternity wear market</title>
<p>In her analysis of the ways in which pregnant women construct pregnant subjectivities in public spaces, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480161">Longhurst (2005)</xref> proposes that since the early 1990s, societal expectations for pregnancy have shifted such that modern expectant mothers in the West have increased opportunities ‘to do’ pregnancy fashionably. Immersed as they were in a cultural context in which pregnant celebrities are praised for their up-to-the minute style and in which pregnancy is no longer viewed as a viable excuse for not looking fashionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480161">Martindale, 2012</xref>), it is perhaps not surprising that in the present sample, many participants confirmed Longhurst’s observation that the maternity wear in the present marketplace affords women expanded possibilities to be chic during pregnancy – opportunities that were not necessarily available to expectant mothers in the relatively recent past:<disp-quote>
<p>They really have pretty cool stuff anymore, and I think that has really changed just in the last three to five years … [Then, it was about] … concealing your pregnancy and just wearing these big tent dresses and shirts – it wasn’t flattering. It just made you look bigger … I remember turning my nose up at a lot of stuff that people wore ten years ago. It has gotten a lot better as far as the styles that are available. (Diane)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Not all participants experienced the offerings of the contemporary maternity market positively, however. Even among participants who agreed that the maternity wear market had improved in recent years, there was still some consensus that ‘looking good’ during pregnancy required more effort than they cared to exert. For instance, most participants supplemented the handed down maternity dress they received from family and friends with items that were purchased, but many reported that they were unable to make these purchases locally and had to resort to shopping online or to purchasing the majority of their maternity clothing during trips to major metropolitan areas, a reality that was somewhat frustrating for them. Further, numerous participants shared that even when they were able to find maternity clothes that were to their liking (e.g. clothing available at higher priced specialty stores such as Pea in the Pod or Motherhood Maternity), they often cost much more than they were willing or able to pay.</p>
<p>Additionally, for many participants, the act of consuming maternity dress prompted a disruption in their ‘usual way of being’ with their clothes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480161">Frost (2003)</xref> reminds us, the consumer marketplace offers not just products, but products that are attached to various versions of selfhood. The products offered within the consumer marketplace, however, do not always mesh with various versions of the self that one hopes to present; such was the case for many participants in the present study. As the following comments suggest, participants frequently regarded the offerings of the maternity wear market as not only limited in stylistic variety, but as incongruent with the set of everyday self-images they wished to mobilize and with the role demands of their day to day lives (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480161">Solomon, 1983</xref>) – that is, with The Women They Were Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Well, a lot of it’s like kidsy. I always laugh at the names of maternity companies: ‘A Pea in the Pod’ or ‘Baby and Me’ or ‘Nine Months.’ It’s like can’t they be normal? I’m still a human. You don’t have to define me by the baby I’m carrying. I think it’s a cultural thing about women that when you are pregnant all of sudden we’re cute. I’ve never been cute in my life so I’ve had to grapple with being cute all of a sudden … You’re still a woman. You’re still a human being. You don’t have to be cute if you don’t want to be cute. [I: What makes the clothes cute?] It’s like lace and ribbons and bows and buttons; stuff that I don’t wear. (Ann)</p>
<p>I walked in to a Motherhood store, looking for something like what you see me in today, grey and black, red, blues, business casual. I walked out of the dressing room in one of these dashiki looking things, and I didn’t know whether to go running through a field of flowers or go to work that day. It really made me angry, so I basically went to every place I could think of to find two or three, I have maybe six things that I like to wear to work and I just mix and match them. For a while during the summer, it was almost impossible, all I could find was tee shirts and capri pants, I hate capri pants … In this area, I almost felt forced to change the way I dress … (Stephanie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, what is perhaps most striking about the accounts of Ann and Stephanie (and others like them) is not so much that they evoke a crystal clear vision of the selves that they wished to construct in the eyes of others, but rather, that they took such care to call to mind the selves that they strove not to communicate to others through their liminal, pregnant appearances (i.e. The Women they Feared they could Become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>). That is, in critiquing the offerings of the contemporary maternity market and in distancing themselves from them, these participants were engaging in a form of identity management through contemplation of what they did <italic>not</italic> wish to convey about the self, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480161">Freitas and colleagues have referred to as an ‘identity not!’ (1997: 323)</xref>. This sort of identity management through negation can sometimes help to assuage tension or ambivalence about new or unfamiliar social roles, such as the transition to parenthood. That is, by invoking identities that they wished to avoid as a template for the construction of their self-presentations, these women molded ‘the unknown into a knowable opposite’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540513480161">Garrison, 1982</xref>: 229), possibly quelling some of the uncertainty associated with their impending role as ‘mother.’ Also of interest here are the specific identities that these expectant mothers perceived as invested in the maternity clothing available in the marketplace and voiced a desire to avoid. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480161">Musial’s (2003)</xref> observation that the marketing of maternity dress in the West often has denied women agency and mature sexuality by containing them within normalized versions of femininity, several participants regarded the offerings of the contemporary maternity market as coercing them into unwanted roles of asexualized, infantilized, and/or ‘Mother Earth/counter-culture’ mothers-to-be, all of which they felt were countervailing to the Women They Were Most of the Time (e.g. professional women to be taken seriously in their jobs) and wanted to remain, as they transitioned to motherhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1469540513480161"><title>Disruption owing to shifts in body shape</title>
<p>Disruption in participants’ ‘typical’ dress consumption habits also was bound up in the bodily changes of pregnancy, calling to mind the ways in which appearances, the body, identity, and consumerism are closely linked in 21st-century western life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480161">Frost, 2003</xref>). Over the years, the participants had accrued much experience in dressing their non-pregnant forms, establishing a sense of the various styles and cuts of clothing that could reliably perform for them in desired ways (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Before [I was pregnant], I never followed fashion. I wore a lot of tailored business casual, because I had that kind of body shape that went well with tailored clothes. (Mary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As expectant mothers, however, participants realized that they could not necessarily fall back upon this reliable stock of knowledge, as maternity clothing did not interface with their liminal, pregnant bodies in the same, predictable ways as did the clothing they had worn previously. This was frustrating for several participants, including Lauren, who felt that the maternity dress offerings available in the marketplace could not adequately accommodate her liminal body build or her personal style (i.e. the Woman She Was Most of the Time), prompting her to suspend her aspirations of a particular image of herself – that is, to forsake her personal style or way of using commodities to symbolically present herself to the world – at least during her pregnancy:<disp-quote>
<p>I would go shopping, and I would spend hours trying all these clothes on and I would come out with a white tee shirt, because the clothes just did not work … It’s so hard to be stylish … you are trying to be cute, and it’s really hard, especially with my body build because I’m short. I described myself recently like an Oompa Loompa … from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. That’s what I felt like, just short, wide, and bleah. You definitely change your style, and you give up trying to be cute. (Lauren)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, it should be noted that Lauren’s sense that she had to surrender her ambitions of presenting a desired (or ‘cute’) self during her pregnancy may reflect more than her dissatisfaction with the fit of maternity clothes on her liminal body; also at stake, seemingly, were the ways in which she processed the embodied experience of pregnancy, itself. That is, although she adopted a ‘pragmatic approach’ to the bodily changes of pregnancy, resigning herself to their inevitability and purposefulness as part and parcel of the pregnancy experience, she was quite anxious about her weight gain and her capacity to reclaim her pre-pregnancy appearance after the birth of her child. Likely, then, these concerns played a pivotal role in informing Lauren’s sense that, during pregnancy, maintaining her usual sense of style may be challenging.</p>
<p>Like Lauren, Mary spoke to the need to adjust the image she sought to present through her dress during her pregnancy, in large part owing to shifts in her body shape. In contrast to Lauren, however, Mary framed this adjustment positively, as an opportunity to hedonically explore a new image of the self that she had not previously considered:<disp-quote>
<p>After I got pregnant, my body wasn’t the same shape anymore … and I got to play around a lot more with styles I would never have worn, ever. That was fun. I looked really good and shapely in what I wore … Now, I pay a little bit more attention to fashion, because, you know, I’m obviously not the same shape, so I’m playing with all sorts of different ideas. I’m like, ‘Sure, let’s follow the current fashion. Why not? I’m only wearing them for three months, so I might as well be in style while I’m doing it.’ That’s just been a huge change. (Mary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Worth noting is that Mary approached the bodily changes of pregnancy more positively than did many other women in the sample; although she did acknowledge some ambivalence about her weight gain and her loss of control over her body, she also framed her liminal, pregnant body as evidence of the ‘miracle of childbirth’ and the ‘amazing things that [her] body could do.’ In turn, these positive feelings toward her body may have afforded her a more affirming lens through which to regard the maternity wear offerings of the contemporary marketplace. Additionally, it is possible that the capacity to aesthetically explore a new way of expressing the self through fashion during the liminal transition to motherhood may have helped her to regain a sense of control over her physical self, and perhaps, to ease some of the bodily tensions she experienced.</p>
<p>Thus, for participants, the bodily changes of pregnancy were experienced in diverse ways but often moved participants to somehow shift their personalized expressions of self through the use of clothing. Although some women, like Mary, embraced these changes as providing expanded opportunities for exciting constructions of stylish or previously unexplored selves, many more, like Lauren, regarded the changes as ‘challenging’ and as prompting an unwelcome disruption in their usual way of ‘being with’ their maternity clothes.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1469540513480161"><title>Dress to affirm new identities and roles as expectant mothers/mothers</title>
<p>The second overarching theme that emerged from our data highlights the ways in which participants invoked the purposeful management of their appearances to affirm either their current, liminal status as ‘mothers to be’ or their actual, impending roles as mothers. Although two differing types of experiences were noted relative to the affirmation of maternal identities, both of these experiences draw attention to the importance of the pregnant body and the body-clothing interface in defining these identities.</p>
<p>In the first case, several participants shared that, as their bellies began to expand in the third and fourth months of their pregnancies, it became important for them to define for on-lookers – through the wearing of maternity clothing – their status as expectant mothers. Implicit here was a concern that, if they did not do so, their ‘baby bumps’ might be read as a sign of overweight (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480161">Earle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480161">Longhurst, 2005</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Finally, I was wearing maternity clothes. It’s weird because you are in this stage where if people didn’t know you, they wouldn’t know you are pregnant. So, that’s kind of a little bit of an ego thing where like, ‘I’ve got a potbelly, but it’s because I’m pregnant’… and you want other people to know that that’s why you have the belly … not just because you’re fat. (Diane)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, we find evidence to suggest that the bodily changes of pregnancy (i.e. carrying extra weight around one’s middle) may be ‘falsely discrediting’ for expectant mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480161">Goffman, 1963</xref>). That Diane was concerned about clarifying for onlookers (through the wearing of maternity dress) that she was not plainly fat, but rather, was expecting a child, reflects the stigma and the moral culpability that contemporary western cultures associate with being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480161">Earle, 2003</xref>) and, in particular, the notion that being overweight is interpreted in such contexts as a sign of failure to adequately control the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480161">Shilling, 2003</xref>). It was this cultural context, then, that seemingly prompted participants to use their maternity dress to disconfirm a dreaded self (i.e. the Women they Feared they Could Become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>) – that is, someone who is suspected of transgressing cultural beauty norms) and at the same time, to signal or confirm the alternative, acceptable identity of ‘Expectant Mother’.</p>
<p>In other cases, participants spoke to the various rewards that they derived from their use of dress to affirm their liminal, embodied statuses as pregnant selves or their impending roles as ‘mothers.’ For instance, both Kim and Mary referenced the pleasure and empowerment they experienced as a result of dressing to accentuate their embodiment as pregnant women:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s neat that nowadays that you don’t have to try to hide your pregnancy … when I was almost 3 months pregnant I had a big event at work … I got a real cute black dress that wasn’t a maternity dress, but it was kind of like stretchy material, and it had what I would call that ‘Rachel from Friends’ look … My little pregnant belly just pooched out in it, and I thought it was adorable. And I had one woman come up to me and say, ‘Boy, don’t you think it’s about time you started wearing maternity clothes?’ And she’s quite a bit older and from this stage you know when she was pregnant women hid it. I said ‘Yeah, I’ve got plenty of maternity clothes.’ And then most other people thought it was just adorable … I guess I haven’t tried to hide it at all … I don’t feel like I’m fat or anything. I’m just pregnant, and there’s nothing wrong with that. (Kim)</p>
<p>I’m like, ‘Oh, I have a belly,’ so I like to wear things that like cling to it … It’s so nice to be to this stage, Oh, thank God! I read this one article that says that pregnancy is the only thing that’s absolute proof that you’ve had sex, and I’m like, well there’s an ultimate statement of being a woman, how cool is that? That’s neat, that’s okay, now. (Mary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the above comments, the participants welcome an era in which the pregnant body is no longer viewed (at least by all) as so abject so as to be in need of coverage that obscures the very fact of its pregnant status. Further, Mary owned and celebrated her pregnant body – cloaked as it was in its body-skimming maternity clothing – as a symbolic embodiment of her agency and of her mature, feminine sexuality. In so doing, she simultaneously renounced cultural discourses desexualizing and infantilizing the pregnant body and reinforced the notion of pregnancy as a period of maturation during which one prepares the self for the ‘adult’ role of motherhood (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480161">Musial, 2003</xref>). Although speculative, it is interesting to muse about the potential role of the surrounding culture milieu – and in particular, the rise of the ‘sexy’ celebrity pregnancy, harkened by the appearance of a nude and pregnant Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in 1991 (Tyler, 1991) – in supporting selected participants’ arrival at this more positive and accepting view of their pregnant selves. That is, one cannot help but to wonder whether popular culture associations of the pregnant body with ‘sexy-to-be looked at femininity’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480161">Martindale, 2012</xref>) somehow paved the way for experiences such as that described above by Mary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1469540513480161"><title>Dress to maintain continuity in the ‘Woman I Am Most of the Time’</title>
<p>The third overarching theme revealed the ways in which pregnant women used their appearance and maternity clothing to maintain a sense of continuity with their pre-pregnant sense of self (i.e. the Women They Were Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>)). Here, participants commented on the struggles experienced in maintaining a consistent sense of self and in presenting that self to others while pregnant. Within this theme, supporting minor themes emerged that focused on the role of maternity clothing in communicating the women’s consistent sense of self and the role of consumption to assuage ambivalence.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1469540513480161"><title>Dress to communicate a consistent sense of self</title>
<p>For many participants, using appearance to communicate a sense of self and style consistent with those conveyed prior to pregnancy was of importance. As was the case in Cody’s study of tween girls, consumer goods (here, clothing) served as a bridge to a past self, such that former ‘subjectivities still [figured largely in participants’] understanding of their current existence, lending itself to a highly liminal experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480161">Cody, 2012</xref>: 51). In this vein, Diane noted that appearance and clothing choices had played a significant role in her life prior to her pregnancy, and that during her pregnancy, they continued to do so:<disp-quote>
<p>I always said before that when I got pregnant I wouldn’t sacrifice my own personal taste or style … Just because I was pregnant I wouldn’t wear a big old tent just because it was comfortable. I am definitely picking clothes out for comfort … but I’ve tried to keep my own personal flair with my maternity wardrobe. (Diane)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Mary, when asked what she tried to communicate through her dress while pregnant, explained, ‘I still try to communicate the same thing [as I did before I was pregnant]. I’m young. I’m a woman. I still have some sex appeal!’ Thus, as is echoed in this remark, maintaining a consistent sense of self during pregnancy, or a sense of self that underscored the The Woman I Am Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>) was key for many participants as they traversed the unexplored landscape of pregnancy and the transition to motherhood.</p>
<p>Frequently, participants’ discussions revolved around a desire to uphold their professional images and roles as authority figures at work during their pregnancies. For several, maintaining their image of The Woman I Am Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>) in a professional context was more important than was maintaining their image in private or home contexts, where more flexibility in self-presentation was seemingly allowed. As the following comment reflects, participants were particularly aware of their self-presentations in professional contexts where their jobs required them to engage in highly visible, ‘front stage’ interactions or roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480161">Goffman, 1959</xref>). For example, Michelle, who was employed as an academic faculty member, remarked that she tried to dress ‘especially nice’ on teaching days or on days when she was meeting with ‘someone special.’</p>
<p>According to participant accounts, presenting a professional image at work was sometimes complicated by the embodied nature of pregnancy, itself, and by the impression that others with whom they interacted noticed the pregnant body, particularly the belly, before anything else, making participants’ clothing choices seem less impactful than they normally would be in managing identity. Ann commented on the fact that many people whom she encountered at work would stare at her belly instead of her face, making her self-conscious at times, ‘because it’s like … being pregnant is like the adult hickey. It’s the ultimate stamp of “we’ve been having sex.”’ Of interest here is that, unlike Mary, Ann did not regard the interpretation of her pregnancy as a signal of her sexual past as empowering, but rather, as an affront to her privacy and as cause for embarrassment. As a result, she, like others in the sample, sought to select maternity dress – such as basic/non-trendy or black clothing – that would allow her to blend into the crowd and that would not call specific attention to her pregnant embodiment.</p>
<p>Participants’ concern with their professional images during pregnancy may reflect the fact that the ‘professional self’ represents a more formal version of the self and may have a significant bearing on one’s livelihood. Or, participants’ emphasis upon upholding their former professional images during pregnancy may be explained in part by the fact that many of them planned to retain their professional roles after their pregnancies, as they took on the role of ‘mother.’</p>
<sec id="sec14-1469540513480161"><title>Consumption to assuage ambivalence</title>
<p>A handful of mothers spoke to various ambivalences that were resolved in part through the consumption of dress worn during their pregnancies and that highlight the ways in which these mothers-to-be sought to maintain a sense of continuity in their presentations of the self as a strategy for ambivalence management. In the first such situation, participants such as Olivia revealed a sense of uncertainty and dis-ease relative to their impending role transition to motherhood. Although Olivia expressed some pleasure at the prospect of mothering a child, she also was apprehensive about the various losses that might accompany this role, including professional losses as well as the loss of her youth, her girlishness and her capacity to captivate her husband’s attention:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if things will ever be the same again … I think with the way my husband views me, because … you go from being a girl to being like a mother … So, I don’t want to lose that young girl that he was first attracted to in the first place of why we got married … I just don’t want to lose some of the qualities or characteristics that I had both physically and personality wise … Like, I just don’t want to be home, cleaning all day, looking totally dirty, and nursing … (Olivia)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In discussing her maternity dress habits, Olivia noted that she tried to ‘keep the same style that I was before’, as if in an attempt to preserve for herself and her husband some semblance of The Woman She Was Most of the Time (i.e. before her pregnancy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>). Similarly, it is interesting to note that in describing some of her maternity clothing – and in particular, her favorite ensembles – she referenced a pair of black pants in which she did not ‘even look pregnant’. Although speculative, it is possible that wearing something that diminished the noticeability of her pregnancy could have quelled, to some extent, her ambivalence about her upcoming maternal role.</p>
<p>In other cases, participants experienced ambivalences relative to the embodied discomforts of pregnancy, and in particular, morning sickness and the expansion of the body in new and unfamiliar ways. To assuage these tensions and frustrations, some mothers purposefully delayed the purchase of maternity clothing, as if to distance their selves from their pregnancies and the associated, bodily distresses. The resistance to purchasing maternity clothing and the concomitant efforts to remain in ‘regular clothing’ as the body changed actually served to inspire some quite negative feelings toward clothing use during pregnancy, as evidenced in the following commentary:<disp-quote>
<p>Then you go through this phase where you just get like this pooch and things kind of widen out, so you’re more of a different shape than a different size. Like, the pants didn’t fit, but the tops did. So I started buying bigger pants, and I found my big, fat pants, and you don’t feel so great but you’re not to the point where you look pregnant. You just look kind of chunky. (Mary)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the consumption of maternity clothing that fit properly and complemented the pregnant form did mitigate some of the bodily-related ambivalences experienced (e.g. some of the concerns related to changes in bodily shape) and even proved to be empowering for some (such as Mary, quoted above).</p>

<sec id="sec15-1469540513480161"><title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>Pregnancy represents a complex liminal transition for women and one that demands the negotiation of the impending mother identity and role. Compared to other life changes, such as divorce or first-time employment, the sheer length and major bodily changes of pregnancy render it a perhaps more complex liminal transition, and one that, prior to the present work, had not been explored with respect to maternity dress consumption and the negotiation of identity. That is, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480161">Longhurst (2005)</xref> examined women’s use of maternity dress to construct a range of subjectivities, she did not consider her participants as liminal consumers nor did she consider how that status may have shaped their symbolic consumption practices and identity construction processes. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480161">Thomsen and Sørensen’s (2006)</xref> work on the role of consumer goods as vehicles for the maintenance and acquisition of motherhood identity did not explore pregnant women’s use of dress, which is intimately linked to the expression and construction of identity. Thus, the present work uniquely contributes to the emerging body of research on liminal consumption and the negotiation of identity as well as to the literature on maternity dress consumption and use.</p>
<p>Findings revealed that clothing selection and presentation of the self during pregnancy took on many unique forms for participants by either disrupting their usual sense of self, confirming a new identity as a soon-to-be-mother, or continuing their usual sense of self. Thus, in a variety of ways, findings underscore the notion that periods of liminality are marked by instability, ambiguity and suspended identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513480161">van Gennep, 1960</xref>), making the task of managing a coherent sense of self a difficult one. In particular, among participants, the complexity of identity and its expression through multiple facets of the self were at times compounded by the liminality of pregnancy. That is, participants sometimes struggled to reconcile various aspects of the self as they contemplated who they had been prior to their pregnancies, who they wanted to be as pregnant women, and/or who they feared they might be or become as pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, participants in the present sample remained largely focused on The Woman I Am Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480161">Guy and Banim, 2000</xref>) as the central point in managing this identity in flux, which represented the women they felt they were before pregnancy (i.e. their actual self). Whether reflecting on disruptions in or attempting to maintain consistency with The Women They Were Most of the Time, participants used this sense of self as the guiding force in managing a pregnant identity and in planning subsequent maternity clothing purchases. This finding diverges from previous research suggesting that pregnant women use clothing to construct or to try on various subjectivities that were different from The Women They Were Most of the Time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480161">Longhurst, 2005</xref>) or that they use consumption of various products primarily to embrace the new role of ‘mother’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480161">Thomsen and Sørensen, 2006</xref>). Additionally, the findings here suggest that consumption during liminality may both incite and relieve ambivalence during role transition (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480161">Voice Group, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the present findings support the notion that consumption during liminality reveals an oscillation among past, present, and future identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480161">Cody, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480161">Cody and Lawlor, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the present findings bring into sharp relief the way in which liminal consumers may situate their embodied consumption practices in relation to prior roles/selves, and to a lesser extent, in relation to future roles/selves. For Cody’s tween consumers, negotiating the ‘fruitful darkness’ of transition from childhood to adolescence represented ‘a suspension of identities akin to a cocooned chrysalis, in the midst of an inevitable transformation’ (2012: 60). While the theoretical implications of liminality as a period of ‘fruitful darkness’ offer insight into contexts beyond the tween experience, they may have less applicability to the context of pregnancy as addressed in the present work. Particularly, the liminality of pregnancy did not necessarily represent the potential for an ‘inevitable transformation,’ but rather represented a suspension of identity whereby participants articulated the importance and goal of returning to the previous state of the body and identity prior to pregnancy.</p>
<p>In seeking to understand the liminal experiences of the expectant mothers in the present sample, it also is instructive to consider their subject positions as (primarily) white, middle-class, heterosexual women. In particular, it is significant to acknowledge the issue of socioeconomic class and their statuses as middle-class women who possessed the financial means to develop wardrobes that comprised relatively deep stocks of clothing that were felt to reflect their personal aesthetics and identities. It was against this backdrop, then, that the participants experienced a sense of relative deprivation and frustration when confronted with the need to be thrifty and to limit their clothing consumption during pregnancy. Similarly, it is important to explore how the participants in this study were defined by their subject positions as white, professional women, who, by virtue of their pregnancies, felt that they had become ‘defined by their bodies’ within the context of the professional world such that they had to manage issues of sexuality in the workplace in a manner that they had not previously confronted. Of interest, of course, was the role of professional dress as a strategic tool in this negotiation process.</p>
<p>Although there are limitations to the present work, such as the lack of socioeconomic or ethnic diversity among participants, the findings reveal that symbolic consumption during the transition to motherhood is rife with complexity. Because no research had yet addressed the role of clothing purchases as a form of symbolic consumption aiding in defining the self during the liminal transition of pregnancy, the present work sheds some light on this topic. Future research could more fully explore the possible ethnic and socioeconomic differences in the lived experiences of women during pregnancy and the role clothing consumption plays in expressing identity. Additionally, it would be valuable to extend the scope of the present work to include some of the broader social and cultural practices surrounding symbolic dress consumption of pregnant women, such as how pregnant women present themselves beyond issues pertaining to clothing selection and use (e.g. the ways in which pregnant women engage with grooming practices and body modification). Finally, the role of significant others in shaping symbolic consumption and the negotiation of identity during the liminal period of pregnancy could be of interest, as well.</p>
