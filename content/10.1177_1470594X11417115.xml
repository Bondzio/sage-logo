<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The philosophical tradition of liberal political thought, especially after Locke, has come to see tolerance as a crucial element of a liberal political order. When individuals in society are sufficiently tolerant, political disagreements can be dealt with amicably; there is little risk of shifting into a Hobbesian state of anticipation because of conflicting political values. However, while much has been made of the value of tolerance, and of societal-level motivations for adopting tolerant viewpoints, little contemporary work has been done on individual-level motivations for tolerant behavior. In part, this is because the emphasis is typically placed on one’s <italic>obligation</italic>, and not on one’s <italic>motivation</italic>, to tolerate, while motivation is simply assumed to flow from moral obligation. This view is most explicit in the Lockean or Rawlsian traditions, wherein it is argued that free and equal moral persons are motivated to tolerate one another in lieu of an obligation to assist others in achieving their life projects.</p>
<p>However, there are reasons to believe that this tradition, which has focused on our moral duties to each other, is difficult to sustain, especially in the face of increasingly diverse populations. Tolerating others is an easier task when those others share a great deal of history and culture with you. But as western countries welcome more and more non-westerners into their borders, tolerance becomes more difficult as this shared cultural bond becomes less common. This is becoming increasingly evident not only in smaller-scale social interactions, but at the level of public discourse as well.</p>
<p>A prime example of this phenomenon is the constitutional amendment, recently passed by a popular referendum vote in Switzerland, to ban the construction of minarets. Minarets are the approximate equivalent of a church bell tower for a mosque; they are tall structures that help Muslims locate a mosque, and traditionally they are used to sound a call to prayer. In the Swiss case, calls to prayer had already been banned, even while church bells remained free to operate. Thus minarets in Switzerland are effectively only architectural flourishes on mosques that indicate their location. Muslims make up approximately 5 percent of Switzerland’s population, and there are currently a total of four minarets in Switzerland – fewer than the number of church bell towers in some towns. There was no pressing threat to the rest of the community, nor were there any potential noise issues. This is simply a case of the majority culture feeling threatened by the presence of a minority with a different set of values. Rather than making an attempt to accommodate or understand the minority population, the majority sought to constrain their public displays of difference. While the Swiss have not gone so far as to ban Islam, they have taken other steps that make its practice more difficult. Halal preparation of meat is banned, and immediately following the successful minaret ban, Christopher Darbellay, president of the Christian Democratic People’s Party, announced his intent (which he subsequently withdrew) to ban separate Muslim cemeteries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup> A Muslim in this society would have ample reason to feel unfairly treated.</p>
<p>Switzerland is not alone in this movement toward less toleration of others. France recently passed a ban on burkas and <italic>niqabs</italic> (both of which cover women’s faces) in public. This ban was initially argued for on the grounds that public safety requires faces to be exposed; however, there was no similar ban on generic facemasks. The argument shifted to a protection of women’s rights and gender equality. But there is no similar ban on exploitative images of women. This was a ban that explicitly targeted conservative Muslims.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup> In a country of more than 62 million people, 7.5 percent of which are Muslim, there are fewer than 2000 women who wear burkas. This is hardly a pressing national concern – the practice of covering one’s face is confined to a tiny minority even within the Muslim population, let alone the entire population of France.</p>
<p>Clearly, the strains of commitment for our current notions of tolerance can become overwhelming in the face of increased diversity, even in supposedly liberal democracies such as Switzerland and France. In this article, we seek to explore whether an alternative to the traditional duties-oriented approach to motivating tolerance might provide a better model. In particular, we wish to explore how we can best promote tolerance in very diverse societies by relying on rational self-interest.</p>
<p>This article will proceed by first surveying the existing literature on toleration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup> First, we will outline what we take to be the dominant approach to toleration in the literature, and then identify a different tradition upon which we would like to build. We will then present an initial, very simple model of rational motivations for tolerance. Key to this model is an application of David Ricardo’s model of trade to thinking about tolerance. This model supports the claim that we always have reasons to be as tolerant as possible. In the next section, we explore why we do not always see tolerant attitudes in the actual world, and point to some potential preconditions for tolerance that the initial model does not capture. Subsequently, we examine a more detailed model that allows us to investigate more carefully the conditions under which tolerant behavior can be rewarded. We conclude by arguing that a consideration of self-interested motivations for tolerance is essential to the success of a robust theory of tolerance for a diverse society, but that even this approach has its limitations.</p>

<title>2. Accounts of tolerance</title>
<p>In its most basic form, tolerance requires that an individual who disapproves of another or of her actions nonetheless refrains from interfering with that other; thus, tolerance can be understood as the act of enduring or putting up with something you disapprove of. John Horton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 32) casts tolerant acts as conflicts of reasons, some of which motivate an individual to disapprove of another and interfere with her actions and some of which motivate an individual to refrain from interfering in spite of his initial disapproval. One tolerates another when the reasons against interference trump the reasons in favor of interference. Similarly, David Heyd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 11) casts tolerant acts as clashes of perspectives. One tolerates another when one ignores considerations of the other’s actions and focuses instead on the other as a person. Thus, in Horton’s picture, reasons that motivate individuals to tolerate others are reasons that manage to trump one’s initial disapproval, while in Heyd’s picture, we are concerned with the relevant aspects of others' personhood that motivate individuals to act tolerantly.</p>
<p>A prominent line of liberal theorists seek to ground tolerance on respect for others' autonomy. Will Kymlicka, for instance, remarks that ‘liberals have historically seen autonomy and tolerance as two sides of the same coin’. Since Locke’s <italic>A Letter Concerning Toleration</italic>, liberals have pointed to others' right to choose for themselves the life they wish to lead as grounds for the duty of tolerance. Though Locke presented a battery of arguments in favor of tolerance, when considering what the duty of toleration requires of private persons he wrote, ‘No private Person has any Right, in any manner, to prejudice another Person in his Civil Enjoyments, because he is of another Church or Religion. All the Rights and Franchises that belong to him as a Man, or as a Denison, are inviolably to be preserved to him’ (1983: 31). Locke’s claim here is that, in spite of individuals' disparate conceptions of religious truth, they, <italic>as persons</italic>, each have the right to operate in civil society without being interfered with by disapproving others. The religious sphere and the social-political sphere ought to be kept separate. Rights and franchises belong to individuals in their role as citizens in the civil sphere. Individuals' religious convictions, on the other hand, belong entirely in the religious sphere. The duty of tolerance requires that individuals respect each other’s autonomously chosen path to religious salvation. ‘Civil Enjoyments', says Locke, ‘are not the Business of Religion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11417115">1983</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>Locke’s general sentiments are strongly endorsed by Mill. <italic>On Liberty</italic> is largely devoted to establishing the right of each individual to decide for herself, and to pursue without interference, the life she wishes to live. Mill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X11417115">1991</xref>: 17) writes, ‘Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.’ Forcing others to conform to our conception of the good does not make us much better off, but being able to follow our conception of the good without fear of interference enhances our lives. As such, when one’s autonomously chosen life plan does not threaten to harm others, it ought to be respected.</p>
<p>Recognizing the close relation between autonomy and toleration in the tradition of liberal thought, some contemporary theorists of toleration (Heyd, Andrew Jason Cohen, and others) have gone so far as to restrict the definition of tolerance, so as to differentiate it from other forms of non-interference such as indifference and pragmatic compromise. They argue that for one’s non-interference in the actions of another to count as a tolerant act, it must be motivated by principled <italic>moral</italic> considerations, most notably, the respect for others as autonomous persons. Heyd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 12) suggests that individuals properly tolerate others only when ‘attention is shifted from the object of disapproval to the humanity or the moral standing of the subject before them’. He continues, ‘The tolerator must therefore appeal to <italic>second-order</italic> reasons, such as the intrinsic value of autonomy, human respect, the overall value of the whole way of life of which the particular (wrong) belief or action are but a part, and so on’ (Heyd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 13). Similarly, Cohen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X11417115">2004</xref>: 81), in his comprehensive conceptual analysis of toleration, maintains that acts of toleration must be principled in a very specific way. For any act, ‘for it to be an act of toleration, one’s noninterference must be based either on respect for the other tolerated or on a principled belief that toleration (or one of its components) is a value’.</p>
<p>Heyd presents a detailed account of the structure of the moral <italic>obligation</italic> of toleration. Cohen offers an account of the concept of toleration itself. These accounts, however, say nothing of people’s actual motivations to tolerate others. We are left to assume that motivations will follow directly from our moral obligations. However, AE Galeotti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11417115">2003</xref>: 58) and Bernard Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 25) both suggest that morally motivated toleration based on values such as respect for others' autonomy is shaky ground on which to base the extremely important <italic>social practice</italic> of toleration. Williams warns against grounding the political practice of tolerance on the <italic>moral ideal</italic> of toleration, as the moral ideal of toleration might not be able to do what liberal theorists promise it can, namely, ensure the peaceful cooperation of citizens who disagree about everything. This is because we can expect that some citizens' value systems, or conceptions of the good, will not have a place for the moral values on which tolerance relies, such as the value of autonomy. Going beyond Williams's claim, even if we assume that citizens <italic>do</italic> universally value autonomy, we have no reason to believe that this value provides sufficient motivation for individuals actively to tolerate others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup> We cannot therefore expect tolerance to be universally practiced by citizens in a liberal society.</p>
<p>Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X11417115">1996</xref>: 26–7) therefore suggests that ‘the practice of toleration has to be sustained not so much by a pure principle resting on a value of autonomy as by a wider and more mixed range of resources'. Williams contends that the peaceful coexistence and social cooperation promised by liberal societies will not be achieved by the widespread adoption of the elusive moral virtue of toleration, typically founded on respect for others' autonomy. Instead, we must look to more widely acceptable motivations for adopting tolerant attitudes. We agree with Williams and therefore, being presently concerned with the condition under which we can expect tolerant behavior to prevail, we break away from the tradition of morally motivated toleration. We instead turn to a tradition of thought that proposes individuals' rational self-interests as a motivator for tolerant behavior.</p>
<p>Albert Hirschman identifies a strand of thought that provides a widely acceptable, and therefore more promising, basis on which we may ground the motivation for tolerance. Hirschman explores the history of the idea that individuals' rational self-interest can counteract their violent and malignant passions. He writes, ‘A feeling arose in the Renaissance and became firm conviction during the seventeenth century that moralizing philosophy and religious precept could no longer be trusted with restraining the destructive passions of men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11417115">Hirschman, 1977</xref>: 14–15). The passions, specifically the lust for power and for glory, were regarded as wild and dangerous. It was accepted that individuals' violent passions, if left unchecked, were apt to conflict and lead to social disorder. Alternatively, individuals' pursuit of their own interests, specifically in the form of self-interested commercial activity, came to be seen as calm, innocent, and innocuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11417115">Hirschman, 1977</xref>: 58). The idea that self-interest could subdue individuals' destructive passions was lauded as ‘a realistic basis for a viable social order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11417115">Hirschman, 1977</xref>: 48). The idea was that commerce creates interdependences between individuals. ‘Thus it was expected that expansion of domestic trade would create more cohesive communities while foreign trade would help avoid wars between them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11417115">Hirschman, 1977</xref>: 52). A new economic order promised to ‘activate some benign human proclivities at the expense of some malignant ones' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11417115">Hirschman, 1977</xref>: 66).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Richard Dees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11417115">1999</xref>: 681) applies these ideas that Hirschman traced in the literature directly to religious toleration. Dees recognizes the degree to which economic self-interest can motivate tolerant attitudes. He remarks, ‘capitalism gives the members of different religious groups a motivation to interact on a basis that ignores religion altogether’. He adds, ‘If people would pay more attention to their economic self-interest, they would pay less attention to religious differences.’ Individuals' harmful preoccupation with, say, religious difference might be subdued if they are made to realize that they stand to benefit economically by being more tolerant. Milton Friedman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X11417115">1965</xref>: 109) famously pushes this line of thought further. He argues that capitalism provides a basis for overcoming disapproval with others by providing economic incentives for ignoring aspects of others that are irrelevant from an economic point of view. ‘A businessman or entrepreneur who expresses preferences in his business activities that are not related to productive efficiency is at a disadvantage compared to other individuals who do not.’ Tolerance, here, is best understood as a willingness to engage with others, regardless of their ideological commitments. Individuals who discriminate in their commercial life based on religious, racial, or political difference disadvantage themselves. One who refuses to interact commercially with ideological or cultural opponents will almost always pay more for commercial goods and services as well as for labor. Other things being equal, we will incur financial burdens whenever intolerant attitudes motivate us to discriminate against potential commercial partners on commercially irrelevant grounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X11417115">
<title>3. Rational motivations for tolerance</title>
<p>As Williams and Galeotti suggest, if the practice of tolerance depends solely on the adoption of particular moral commitments, such as a commitment to respecting others' autonomy, the widespread practice of tolerance may well be unrealizable. The question of how to ground our moral <italic>obligation</italic> to tolerate is an important one. However, the answer to this question is not an answer to the <italic>different</italic> question of how to <italic>motivate</italic> tolerant attitudes in individuals. With regard to the latter question, a path forward may be found in Hirschman, Dees, and Friedman: self-interest may be co-opted as a foundation for motivating tolerance. The challenge is how to articulate and then demonstrate the value of tolerant attitudes. What we aim to do in this section is show that tolerant individuals are likely to become materially better off than their less tolerant counterparts.</p>
<p>To see why tolerant attitudes might be materially beneficial, we must first identify the value in interacting with people whose background is different than one’s own. As a basis, we will use David Ricardo’s theory of trade, and his related notion of comparative advantage. In Ricardo’s trade theory, he argues that the mere existence of differential production in a situation in which at least two goods are being traded leads to the opportunity for wealth creation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X11417115">
6
</xref>
</sup> To show how this works, let us first explicate the distinction between <italic>absolute</italic> and <italic>comparative</italic> advantage. Imagine two individuals, Alice and Bob, both of whom produce shirts and trousers. Let us suppose that in a day Alice can make 12 shirts or 9 pairs of trousers. If Bob made only 4 shirts or 8 pairs of trousers a day, then Alice would have an absolute advantage over Bob in making both shirts and trousers. If Bob could make 5 shirts in a day or 15 pairs of trousers in a day, then Alice would have an absolute advantage in shirt-making, while Bob would have an absolute advantage in trouser-making.</p>
<p>Absolute advantage merely takes into account who is more able to produce a given good, given the costs (in this case, time). Trade theories based on absolute advantage would claim that Bob and Alice would trade only in the second situation. Comparative advantage, on the other hand, argues for considering the opportunity costs of production, rather than merely the actual costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X11417115">
7
</xref>
</sup> So, even if Alice has an absolute advantage over Bob in the production of both shirts and trousers, Bob has a comparative advantage in the production of trousers, as it costs him less in terms of the production of shirts to make a pair of trousers than it does Alice. In this kind of situation, Alice and Bob can benefit from a trade that generates more wealth, even if Alice is better able to produce both goods. This comparative advantage should cause Bob to produce only trousers, while Alice produces only shirts. An exchange rate would be determined to ensure that both parties are made better off. The exchange rate would favor Alice, but this is because she already had an absolute advantage, and is able to produce more, absent any trade. But even though Alice would experience a little more benefit than Bob, both are still made better off than had they not made any exchange.</p>
<p>The notion of comparative advantage is important for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that diversity leads to material benefit. When people are different, they will have different opportunity costs for the same action. As we saw, this allows for mutually beneficial trade based on comparative advantage. It also helps to explain why people are motivated toward more diversity and specialization. What is unique about comparative advantage, however, is its implicit argument that diversity is in some sense more important than absolute advantage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X11417115">
8
</xref>
</sup> So long as people have different skills, even if some skills are less valuable than others, trade will make a diverse society better off than is possible in a homogeneous society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X11417115">
9
</xref>
</sup> Agent diversity both creates the opportunities for and encourages specialization, and specialization creates opportunities for material growth.</p>
<p>We use this basic insight in the construction of a simple model that examines the value of tolerance. In this agent-based simulation, we place agents on a two-dimensional ideological landscape, as is familiar in political science. The agent’s starting location corresponds to their particular ‘ideal point’ – what set of values they most agree with. This initial location also corresponds to their particular set of skills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X11417115">
10
</xref>
</sup> Thus, we assume that one’s ideology is well correlated with the set of skills one has.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X11417115">
11
</xref>
</sup> Finally, each agent has a numerical value for how tolerant they are. In this model, tolerance is reduced to a very simple idea: willingness to consider alternative ideologies. This tolerance value is represented as a radius, within which the agent is willing to consider different compromises over ideologies in favor of cooperating with others. The larger the agent’s radius, the more tolerant the agent is. So, in this model, each agent has a preferred ideology, a skill set, and a tolerance level. What we will now turn to is the interaction between agents.</p>
<p>In each round of the simulation, agents consider all of the other agents within their tolerance radius, and try to determine whether they would gain from interacting with them. Interaction just represents some economic or cultural exchange: agents get together to use their respective skills, which creates some social surplus, and then they use that surplus in a way that is dictated by a compromise of each agent’s ideological commitments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X11417115">
12
</xref>
</sup> So we have two competing pressures in these interactions. First, agents always have an economic incentive to interact with people that are as different from themselves as possible – Ricardian trade is maximized when skills are non-overlapping. On this model, that means that economic benefits are maximized when the Euclidean distance between the agents' initial locations is maximized. The greater the distance, the more different their skills are, and thus the more that is to be gained from combining them. This first pressure for ever-more diversity is offset by a second pressure, which pulls agents back toward their initial ideological standpoints. We assume that while people care about material benefit, they also care about maintaining their ideological commitments. Deviation from those views decreases the value of any material gains that they make. To put this more formally, the following formula represents the payoff function for each agent:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1470594X11417115">

<p>This result makes intuitive sense: as tolerance is a measure of how willing to engage with others with different ideological commitments one is, tolerance increases one’s chances of discovering a satisfactory tradeoff between material gains and ideological purity. This suggests, then, that if one has an interest in material gain, then one has a corresponding reason to become more tolerant. On this model, increased tolerance results in increased reward, even when the potential discomfort of engaging with someone with different ideological preferences is taken into account. From this model, we see that rational actors ought to choose to become as tolerant as they can, with the expectation that this tolerance will be amply rewarded. Tolerance, then, can be thought of not just as a liberal duty to others, but as a rational duty to oneself: to promote one’s own self-interest best, one ought to be more tolerant of others. Rationality thus motivates individuals to see others who are different as potential partners in exchange, rather than as merely potential sources of ideological conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470594X11417115">
<title>4. Challenges to the model</title>
<p>This first model shows that it is rational to be tolerant. The more tolerant one is, the better off one will be materially. If this is true, why have tolerant attitudes not been adopted universally? As mentioned at the outset, there are an increasing number of cases of political communities drifting toward intolerance. The Swiss ban on minarets and the French ban on burkas are two such examples. If our first model is true, why have these cases of intolerance not given way to cordial market interactions? What is preventing us from realizing the rosy picture created by this model? There must be more to the story.</p>
<p>In this section, we consider challenges to our first model. Specifically, we argue that our first model takes for granted certain preconditions for establishing patterns of tolerant behavior. First, there must be at least some people that are more tolerant than the intolerant members of the community. Second, material self-interest must be a salient motivator for individuals in the community. These features are implicit in our first model, but will not always obtain in real-world political communities.</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn from the first model require that there are at least some individuals who are at least somewhat tolerant. For one to be motivated to adopt a tolerant attitude toward others for self-concerning material reasons, one must be able to observe others who are reaping the benefits of their tolerance. It cannot be the case that everyone in the community is equally intolerant. From the rational motivation perspective, universal intolerance is self-sustaining. Though everyone would be more prosperous if tolerant, widespread intolerance can be maintained if no one has seen the benefits of tolerance. On the assumption of the bilateral nature of a social exchange, this suggests that a single tolerant individual could not display tolerant behavior, as she would have no partner. Instead, there needs to be a critical mass of more tolerant individuals for the benefits of tolerance to be seen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X11417115">
16
</xref>
</sup> It is possible for an individual to exhibit tolerant behavior in a unilateral manner, but we suspect that this is rare. In this sense, tolerance is like an innovation that can spread through a population: once people see its virtues, they can adopt it, but it is very difficult to adopt something one has never seen. So, like an innovation, rational self-interest can motivate us to adopt tolerant attitudes only once we have been exposed to them. Thus, for an individual to be rationally motivated to become tolerant, the individuals in a community must be unequally intolerant.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the community as a whole is equally well off when its members are universally intolerant as when its members are universally tolerant. Though both scenarios represent stable self-reinforcing patterns of behavior, we should expect widespread tolerance to yield greater prosperity for all. As mentioned above, the mere fact of diversity enhances opportunities for material growth. However, on an individual level, one may not have the opportunity to realize the material benefits of tolerance where one’s community is uniformly intolerant. An asymmetry in levels of tolerance is implicit in our first model though it may not obtain in cases of intolerance we commonly see.</p>
<p>A second challenge to our model is that material self-interest will not always be reason enough for a community to overcome its intolerance. This suggests a second preliminary condition necessary for allowing rational self-interest to motivate tolerant attitudes. Material self-interest must be a salient motivator. Not surprisingly, a community of individuals who, for whatever reason, value their intolerance more than their material well-being will be unmoved by the prospect of bettering themselves materially if that means having to tolerate others. Some communities will simply value their cultural purity above all else. Wherever a community values a quality that precludes tolerance, such as cultural purity, to the extent that they are unwilling to trade off an increase in diversity with material well-being, rational self-interest will not get off the ground as a motivation for adopting tolerant attitudes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, where material self-interests are most salient, we can expect increasingly widespread tolerance. Several studies have been conducted examining the prevalence of tolerant attitudes in port cities. Port cities have historically been distinctive in that the cities' inhabitants are well aware of their interest in trade and commerce. Where it is apparent to a community of individuals that their livelihood depends on commercial transactions with individuals from different religious, political, or cultural groups, we can expect that they will be motivated to ignore their commercially irrelevant differences.</p>
<p>Saumitra Jha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11417115">2007</xref>) examines the legacy of tolerance in the port cities of medieval India. Today, port cities, such as Surat, enjoy considerably less religious violence than other comparable cities in India. Jha attributes this phenomenon to institutions adopted between the 7th and 17th centuries to foster trade between the local Hindus and immigrant Muslims. Muslims had access to trade networks and markets in the Middle East that were closed to Hindus. To reap the material benefits of access to these new markets, local Hindus had to tolerate the infusion of Muslims into port cities. Jha argues that the Muslim minority fulfilled a unique set of conditions that allowed the local Hindu population to tolerate the religious difference that had historically been the cause of conflict. First, the Muslim traders had complementary opportunities to the Hindu traders in that they had access to trade networks and markets that were off limits to the local Hindus. Second, Hindu traders could not replicate the unique function that the Muslim traders afforded. Lastly, there were effective methods of redistribution of the gains from increased trade back to the local community in the form of lower prices for goods and lower taxation.</p>
<p>In medieval Indian port cities, as in other trade cities, a culture of tolerance was fostered whereby the motivation for material gain was apparent to all. Where individuals of the majority culture, religion, or ideology are prepared to trade off their cultural, religious, or ideological homogeneity for personal gain, we can expect tolerant attitudes to prevail and expect everyone to reap the benefits. The motivation for material gain is implicit in our first model. Thus, the more tolerant agents prospered. We claim that more generally, in communities that do not value their cultural purity above all else, and where their material self-interests are apparent, widespread tolerance ultimately prevails.</p>
<p>It might therefore be the case that traditional accounts of toleration are damaging our chances of adopting tolerant attitudes on a larger scale. This is because, as mentioned above, traditional accounts of toleration suggest that public acknowledgement of our duty to be tolerant of others is a sufficient condition for the widespread practice of toleration. However, as diversity increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for majorities to affirm the moral ideals that traditional accounts of toleration require. Therefore, majorities may be motivated to forgo the prospect of tolerance and diversity in favor of their cultural homogeneity. If, however, individuals can be made to realize that their material prosperity will track their willingness to tolerate others, independent of other moral commitments, they may well be motivated to adopt tolerant attitudes.</p>
<p>In this section, we have tried to show that though our first model shows that there are rational motivations for adopting tolerant attitudes, we will not observe universal tolerance where the necessary conditions, implicit in our first model, fail to be realized. First, there must be at least some individuals in the community who are at least somewhat tolerant. This allows tolerant individuals to reap the material benefits of their tolerance and act as exemplars for others. Second, the motivation for material gain must be apparent. Individuals must be willing to trade off their cultural homogeneity for material gains.</p>
<p>This is still only part of the story. Further conditions must be satisfied to motivate individuals to adopt tolerant attitudes and reap the benefits. To explore these conditions of tolerance, we have constructed a second and more complex model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X11417115">
<title>5. Constraints on tolerance</title>
<p>The results of our first model are clear: in terms of material well-being, it is highly advantageous to be as tolerant of others as possible. One would expect, therefore, highly tolerant societies to be the norm. But sadly, as the Swiss minarets and French burka ban make clear, this fails to be the case even in liberal democracies. There may be aspects of real-world societies, not fully captured by our first model, that prevent tolerance from becoming widespread. We identified two such aspects in the previous section, but there may be others. In order to help determine what these may be, we have developed a second model. In this model, we have dropped the (perhaps controversial) assumption that one’s skills are well correlated to one’s ideology. We have also dropped the assumption that the ideological spectrum can be modeled as a two-dimensional continuous plane. In the first model, one could visualize ideologies as gradually shifting, for instance, from ‘black’, through all the various shades of ‘grey’, and finally to ‘white’; an agent’s ideology could be situated anywhere within this continuous ideological spectrum. In our second model, ideologies are, instead, modeled as discrete nodes, connected together via a network structure. By focusing on network-type structures we hope to characterize real-world relationships between ideologies that cannot be captured by the continuous plane model. But note that the network structure does not subsume the continuous plane structure. Rather, the two models are complementary, for it is not the case that a network structure can capture every relationship between points on a continuous plane, and vice versa. For instance, the ‘small world’ network-ideology structure (which will be explained further below), in which locations in the ideological universe that are far removed from one another can sometimes connect and effectively behave as if they are neighboring points, does not lend itself well to being modeled on a continuous plane. But using the small-world network structure we can represent the alliances and coalitions that often occur between disparate ideologies in the real world, and thus test if these alliances have an impact on the propensity for toleration within a society.</p>
<p>In our second model, the focus is on one-on-one interactions between members of a society. More so than in the first model, we take the individual’s point of view. Agents do not ‘move’ along the ideological spectrum toward the wealthier portions of that spectrum; rather, agents interact individually <italic>with one another</italic> and conclude trade agreements with one another. By taking this even more explicitly agent-centered view, we hope to determine whether there is some particular aspect of individuals' interactions with one another that affects their willingness to trade with others who are different. Let us now discuss our second model in more detail.</p>
<p>In the model, agents interact and form bonds with one another with the goal of maximizing their own individual utility. When two agents form such a bond (which can be interpreted as a trade agreement or partnership) it leads to an increase in utility for both agents, and for society as a whole. We assume that successfully establishing a partnership between two agents is constrained by their levels of tolerance. This assumption is validated by the positive results of our first model. Other factors do come into play; however, all else being equal, those who are more tolerant of others will be more likely to partner with their neighbors and, all else being equal, the more tolerant one is going into a partnership, the greater one’s utility from that partnership will be.</p>
<p>We used <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1470594X11417115">Equation 2</xref>, as follows, to determine the expected utility of a partnership for an agent, say, Alice, who is considering whether to establish a partnership with a second agent, Bob.<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1470594X11417115">

</disp-formula>Before we discuss the significance of each of these variables in detail, let us briefly make an initial pass through the decision procedure. Later, we will go into much greater detail to examine what these variables represent and how this model works. Alice’s goal is to see if partnering with Bob would be suitably profitable for her. To do so, she uses the formula above. Now the first terms we notice, <italic>wealth<sub>A</sub>
</italic> and <italic>wealth<sub>B</sub>
</italic>, represent the total wealth available to Alice and Bob, respectively. Alice cares about wealth, but she also cares about the skills that each bring to the table. The variable <italic>skillsdiff</italic> refers to the number of skills that Bob has that Alice does not, which provides her with a metric for how much she has to gain from partnering with him. But Alice does not just care about material gain, she is also concerned about values. To examine her concern with values, we introduce two other variables: <italic>ideoldiff</italic> and <italic>intolerance</italic>. The first of these, <italic>ideoldiff</italic>, refers to how far apart the two agents are ideologically. If they are close together, we should not expect much conflict, but if they are far apart from each other, there is good reason to expect at least some contention in their relationship. <italic>Intolerance</italic> (represented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1470594X11417115">Equation 2</xref> by the parameter <italic>it</italic>) is a measure of Alice’s intolerance toward others. The maximum level of intolerance within the society is represented by <italic>it</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. If Alice calculates the <italic>expected utility</italic> (<italic>EU</italic>) of the partnership and finds that it exceeds a minimum ‘utility threshold’ for new partnerships (which is specified globally at the start of the simulation), then Alice decides that the partnership is worth forming. Note that since Alice and Bob each go through this decision process, it is possible, indeed likely, that they will have different expected utilities for the potential partnership. So it is possible that Alice would want to partner with Bob, while Bob would not want to partner with Alice. Let us now go through this decision process more carefully and investigate each aspect in turn.</p>
<sec id="section6-1470594X11417115">
<title>5.1. The significance of agent attributes</title>
<p>The characteristic attributes of an agent are: personal wealth, utility, skills, intolerance, and ideology. These attributes account for the differences between the agents. Let us start with the simplest attribute, wealth. Each agent begins with some fixed amount of personal wealth. We need not conceive of personal wealth as monetary wealth. Rather, we can understand ‘personal wealth’ more generally, as a measure of a person’s (arbitrary, from a moral point of view) starting position in society relative to others. We use wealth to allow us to represent agents as belonging to different economic classes and we make the simplifying assumption that this social stratification remains stable throughout the course of the simulation. When agents consider whether to partner with one another, the total wealth available to each agent (which includes the wealth accumulated from previous agreements) is taken into account. It is safe to assume that wealth is desirable to each agent, that is, that the likelihood of a partnership is directly proportional to the wealth one will have access to as a result. Thus, we place wealth in the numerator of the above equation.</p>
<p>Since an agent’s personal wealth remains the same throughout the simulation, we must rely on another variable to track gains from trade that individual agents can make over time. In order to represent an individual agent’s gains from trade with others, we use the notion of <italic>utility</italic>. <italic>Utility</italic> is initialized at the start of the simulation to be identical with an agent’s personal wealth, and it increases as an agent establishes more partnerships, since partnerships with others who also have access to wealth will be valuable to an agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X11417115">
17
</xref>
</sup> Like personal wealth, utility is defined abstractly. It is a measure characterizing the increase in material well-being that an agent accrues as a result of partnerships with other agents. Note that an agent’s utility is not actually taken into account in the partnership equation, since it is a measure of an agent’s personal satisfaction with her current partnership situation. Since this is a subject-dependent matter (recall that the expected utility for a partnership between Alice and Bob will be different for each), we use wealth, which is a purely objective (and observable, from the point of view of other agents) parameter, in the partnership equation instead of utility.</p>
<p>In addition to wealth and utility, each agent begins with a certain number of ‘skills'. Like wealth and utility, skill is also an abstract concept. It can, for example, refer to a problem-solving skill, a manufacturing skill, and so on. The only requirements on skills are that they are relevant to an individual’s material well-being, that they are not easily transferable, in the short term, between individuals, and that they are all of equal value.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X11417115">
18
</xref>
</sup> For example, as we discussed above, Muslim traders in medieval India had a skill: access to markets in the Middle East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11417115">Jha, 2007</xref>). This skill certainly is relevant to material well-being, for obvious reasons. It is also not easily transferable. Trade relations take time to build up, to say nothing of the technical skill required to travel on the high seas or the business acumen one needs to deal with one’s customers or the language barriers that need to be overcome if one desires to ‘learn’ this skill. On the other hand, establishing a partnership with someone who has this skill will allow one to reap some of its benefits, if one is tolerant enough to be willing to have business dealings with a foreigner. In the model, we assumed that agents desire access to as many skills as possible; if one does not have a particular skill, then one desires, all else being equal, to trade with someone who does in order to have access to it. As in the case of wealth, we assume that the likelihood that an agent will desire a partnership with another is increased by the availability of diverse skills, thus it also finds a place in the numerator of the equation.</p>
<p>Intolerance is the most straightforward of the agent parameters. If an agent’s intolerance is high, this will prevent him from desiring agreements with others even when, all else being equal, the expected gain in utility would be great. For the purposes of the model, however, we assume that every agent has a price, and that even an agent with a high level of intolerance will enter into an agreement with an agent of an undesirable ideological stripe if the expected utility is high enough. However, in this case the agent’s high level of intolerance will prevent him from maximizing the utility of that partnership. This, we believe, has a real-world parallel. A business owner who is highly intolerant of others may, if the price is right, partner with someone that he is intolerant of, but it is likely that that business relationship will be strained and less fruitful than a more amicable partnership. To account for intolerance, we add the correction factor (1 + <italic>it</italic>
<sub>max</sub> – <italic>it</italic>)/<italic>it</italic>
<sub>max</sub> to the denominator of the equation (since intolerance is assumed to be inversely correlated with the probability of partnership). Here, <italic>it</italic>
<sub>max</sub> refers to the maximum level of intolerance allowed within a society. This is a global parameter of the model that is specified at the start of the simulation.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the likelihood of a partnership is inversely proportional to the ideological difference between the two agents involved (represented by <italic>ideoldiff</italic>, which will be explained below). The role of the intolerance correction factor is to mitigate these circumstances. As can be seen from the equation, when the intolerance level of an agent is low, the ideological gap between herself and her prospective partner will appear smaller than it is.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470594X11417115">
<title>5.1.2. Ideology</title>
<p>The last agent attribute, ideology, is complex enough to deserve its own subsection. Ideology refers, roughly, to an agent’s world-view. As with the other agent attributes, ideology is an abstract concept: it may represent different religious, economic, or philosophical points of view. An important question is how ideologies are related to one another in a society: what does the ideological <italic>spectrum</italic> look like? In our first model, ideologies were related to one another as points on a two-dimensional ‘ideology landscape’. In our second model, in order to ensure that our results were not biased by the choice of any particular ideological structure, we considered three alternative structures, all of which plausibly can be taken as representing situations that obtain in the real world. These structures are <italic>line</italic>, <italic>ring</italic>, and <italic>small-world network</italic>.</p>
<p>
<italic>Line</italic> is the simplest ideological structure, and it is also the structure which most naturally comes to mind when one thinks of the political spectrum with its corresponding notions of ‘left’ and ‘right’. In a line structure, an extreme left-leaning person (for example, a liberal socialist) is less likely to align herself with an extreme right-leaning person (a radical conservative, say), as we would expect. But although a line is the most intuitive picture of the way ideologies are structured within a society, there are situations in which this simple structuring breaks down. Take the case of Hitler’s National Socialist ideology and Stalin’s communism. In terms of the simple line structuring of ideologies, Nazi ideology represents the extreme right, while Stalin's communism represents the extreme left – they could not be further apart. However, the two ideologies share much in common. For example, both ideologies were used to justify totalitarian regimes; both relied, in part, on ‘cults of personality’ to maintain their regimes; and, indeed, the two ideologies were close enough so as not to preclude a non-aggression pact and a joint invasion of Poland in the early days of the Second World War. On the other hand, Nazism and communism both seem to be much further away from moderate political ideologies than they are to each other. In order to capture such relationships, we considered a <italic>ring</italic> ideology structure.</p>
<p>In a <italic>ring</italic> structure, the only notion operative is one of relative distance. There is nothing corresponding to a ‘radical left’ or ‘radical right’ position within the ideological spectrum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470594X11417115">Figure 2</xref>
 illustrates this. Here, imagine that <italic>M</italic> represents a ‘moderate’ position within the society, while <italic>L</italic> represents an ‘extreme left’ position and <italic>R</italic> an ‘extreme right’ position. It is easily seen that the distance along the ring from <italic>L</italic> to <italic>R</italic> is less than the distance from <italic>M</italic> to <italic>L</italic> or from <italic>M</italic> to <italic>R</italic>.</p>

</sup> This is a ring in which ‘alliances' or ‘affiliations' between different (perhaps distant) ideologies are possible. Here, imagine two or more disparate ideologies uniting against a common opponent. In parliamentary democracies, for instance, this may happen when no one party is able to achieve a majority in the legislature. In cases such as these, two political parties with very disparate ideologies may find it convenient to align their interests. While minority parliaments are a temporary phenomenon, an example of a more permanent alliance is the separatist Parti Quebecois in the Canadian province of Quebec. The Parti Quebecois is a coalition of disparate elements, some ‘left’, some ‘right’, some more radical, some more moderate, united together for the purpose of achieving independence from the rest of Canada. To represent these alliances, we imagine a ring structure with extra connections between nodes on the ring, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470594X11417115">Figure 3</xref>

<title>5.2. A walk through the model</title>
<p>Consider an agent, who we will call Alice. During each round of the simulation, Alice must decide whether she will attempt to establish partnerships with other agents in her community. To do so, she considers all the agents who are not already her partners and determines in turn whether a partnership with that agent will result in enough utility to make that partnership worth her while. To get a sense of this decision-making process, imagine that Bob, Charles, and Dalma are not already Alice’s partners. In this case, Alice must consider whether it is in her interest to partner with any of them by making an expected-utility calculation for each potential partnership. At the end of this process, if she decides, for instance, that Bob and Dalma, but not Charles are worth partnering with, she adds Bob and Dalma to her list of desired partnerships. Bob, Charles, and Dalma do the same, and when all agents have decided, their respective lists are compared. Partnerships are established only when the desire for partnership is mutual. In our example, Alice’s list contains Bob and Dalma. But suppose that Bob’s list includes Alice, but Dalma’s list does not. In this case, Alice will establish a partnership with Bob, but not with Dalma.</p>
<p>Let us now consider a particular calculation of expected utility. Imagine Alice deliberating whether to partner with Bob. To do so, she first determines the total wealth of her own immediate<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X11417115">

</xref>
</sup> partnership network, which is just the wealth of the people (including herself) to whom she is already connected; call this <italic>wealth<sub>A</sub>
</italic>. For example, suppose that Alice, whose personal wealth is 5, is currently partnered with Eve, whose personal wealth is 6, and Fatima, whose personal wealth is 3. Then, <italic>wealth<sub>A</sub>
</italic> = 5 + 6 + 3 = 14. Similarly, she determines the set of distinct skills, <italic>skills<sub>A</sub>
</italic>, which belong to her and her immediate partners. For example, if Alice has skills {1, 3, 5}, Eve has skills {3, 7, 9}, and Fatima has skills {2, 5, 9}, then the skill set to which she has access is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}.</p>
<p>Alice then determines Bob’s wealth and skills. From <italic>skills<sub>A</sub>
</italic> (the skills she has access to) and <italic>skills<sub>B</sub>
</italic> (the skills Bob has access to) she determines the number of new skills (<italic>skillsdiff</italic>) which would result from the partnership. Next, she determines the ‘ideological difference’ between herself and Bob, which is just the distance between their respective positions in the ideological spectrum. Finally, Alice determines the <italic>expected utility</italic> of a partnership with Bob according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1470594X11417115">Equation 2</xref>. If the <italic>expected utility</italic> is high enough,<sup>

<title>5.3. Findings</title>
<p>Our principal finding is that societies in which there are many and diverse skills, of which but a few are possessed by any particular individual, are societies in which tolerant attitudes pay off. To relate this to the real world, think of a city such as New York. A person living in New York has access to many and varied skills and services, yet no one person can do it all herself. It is no coincidence that New York is also one of the more tolerant cities in the world. Societies such as these, it seems, encourage cooperation by, on the one hand, enticing individuals with their large available resources (represented by the large number of skills available), while on the other hand, ensuring that no one individual is able to take advantage of these resources on her own. Our analysis showed that, for a society with a total of 30 skills, individuals enjoy greater utility when the minimum number of skills per agent is between two and three, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470594X11417115">Figure 4</xref>
 shows.</p>

</fig>
<p>When running the simulation for a society whose ideologies are connected together in a small-world network, we discovered that this relationship between skills and utility is compromised as the number of alliances between ideologies is increased. We formulated the following hypothesis to explain this relationship. Recall that the small-world network is essentially a ring structure with additional connections between nodes along the ring (which represent alliances between different ideologies). When there are many alliances relative to the total number of ideologies in a society, there are more connections between nodes on the ring, and the average distance between nodes (ideologies) decreases greatly. Now consider Alice again. When the average distance between ideologies is great, Alice’s partnerships will tend to be with those who have access to a large number of skills that are different from hers. This is because, in the calculation of expected utility, new skills are needed to counteract the negative effect of great ideological distance. But when the average distance between ideologies is <italic>small</italic>, Alice will demand fewer new skills, on average, from her potential partners in order to achieve her minimum level of desired utility from the partnership. Thus partnerships between agents with access to similar skill sets becomes more common in a scenario in which average ideological distance is small (as is the case in a small-world network with many alliances relative to the number of ideologies).</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we ran various sets of simulations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470594X11417115">Figure 5</xref>
, the x and y axes are as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470594X11417115">Figure 4</xref>, however, a new z-axis is added to represent the number of ideologies in society. Here, the number of alliances is held constant at five. Thus, as we increase the total number of ideologies in society, the average distance between ideologies increases. Note that the relation between utility and skills that we noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470594X11417115">Figure 4</xref> is maintained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470594X11417115">Figure 5</xref> when the total number of ideologies is great, but that it breaks down when we decrease the total number of ideologies. This confirms our hypothesis.</p>

<title>5.4. Wealth disparity</title>
<p>If there is great wealth disparity in a society, then it may not pay wealthy members of society to tolerate minority groups, who are often poor. Indeed, in this case we might say that there is intolerance toward minorities, not so much because they are different, but because there is no incentive to trade with poor people. If we recall Ricardian trade theory, however, we should be suspicious of this hypothesis; for on Ricardo’s theory, an agent has an incentive to trade even when he enjoys an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>The data from our model contradicts the hypothesis. We found that average utility is greater for more tolerant individuals irrespective of whether they are upper, middle, or lower class, even when we set the parameters of the simulation so that there is a large disparity in wealth between upper and lower classes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470594X11417115">Figure 6</xref>
 shows the relationship between levels of intolerance and average utility for the different classes of society (those whose wealth is at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile, which correspond to the lower, middle, and upper classes) in a situation of great wealth disparity. As the graph makes clear, high levels of tolerance are correlated with high utility, regardless of one’s position in society.</p>

<title>6. Discussion</title>
<p>Let us now reconsider our original claim: that rational self-interest can be harnessed as a superior motivation for tolerant behavior in diverse societies. As we have argued, the mainline argument for toleration relies on the notion of a duty toward others. This duty, however, can become more and more burdensome as societies become more and more diverse. At some point, the strains of commitment for maintaining these duties become too great. As these arguments do not provide some notion of benefit that individuals can derive from being in a diverse society, tolerance can only be a burden to bear, and not a mixture of burdens and benefits.</p>
<p>What we have proposed is to follow a different thread in the literature, and argue that tolerance can be supported by self-interest: that association with people different than oneself has not just the well-recognized challenges of value conflicts, but the less well-acknowledged benefits of gains to trade. This is the key insight that we have sought to explore in this article. In doing so, we have developed two different models. While they both make the assumption that people can be intolerant of difference and prefer people like themselves, they also make the assumption that we can often find value in diversity – most readily seen in economic terms by means of skill differences. While the models share these common assumptions, they are otherwise rather different from each other – we have aimed to show that it is these two key shared assumptions that drive our convergent results. In particular, both models support our argument that individuals should be rationally motivated to become more tolerant.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that this motivation for tolerance must be made conditional. As we have seen, pure rationality by itself is not sufficient. A uniformly intolerant society will have a hard time becoming less intolerant, precisely because there are no examples of tolerance to learn from. So while intolerance may be an equilibrium, we argue that it is not a stable equilibrium – once there are a sufficient number of more tolerant people in the population, quickly everyone will find motivations to become at least as tolerant. So, we must have some lack of uniformity in the population.</p>
<p>A second condition is that individuals must actually have some material interests. If no interest can overcome one’s desire to be intolerant, then the mechanisms of individual rationality can never deliver us to a more tolerant society. But likewise, if intolerance is an overriding virtue in a society, it is unlikely that any mechanism can take us toward tolerant behaviors. Such a society would not be a fertile place for notions of liberal duties to others.</p>
<p>The third, and perhaps most interesting condition, is that individuals must have a relatively small number of the available skills in a society to make tolerance a rational behavior. Having fewer skills forces us to work with others who are different from ourselves in order to do the things we would like to be able to do. If we can be self-sufficient, then tolerance is no longer necessary. But if we must cooperate to succeed, then tolerance will be the primary means by which we can succeed. This last condition reveals something rather important. While the other two conditions were perhaps perfectly clear prima facie, this condition is only made clear by thinking about the nature of our participation in society. As Rawls rightly points out, we are engaged in a system of social cooperation. Even relatively illiberal societies require various forms of cooperation. What this condition argues, however, is that as soon as we accept that we must engage in various forms of cooperation (as soon as we cannot be Robinson Crusoe) we are made better off by becoming more tolerant. We will be more able to achieve our life plans and pursue our own goals and values if we are able to cooperate with those whose values and life plans differ from ours the most.</p>
<p>What these conditions on the rational motivation for tolerance show us is that, while we cannot expect tolerance to flourish everywhere, we can expect that tolerance will flourish in far more conditions than we perhaps previously expected was possible. Further, it is in many cases those hardest cases for the traditional accounts of toleration (very diverse societies) that we argue should become the easiest cases for tolerance if our three conditions are met.</p>

<p>Students of the philosophy of law will notice an affinity here with Lon L. Fuller’s analysis of the conditions conducive to the notion of duty (1969). Fuller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470594X11417115">1969</xref>: 24) writes, ‘When we ask, “In what kind of society are these conditions [for the optimum efficacy of the notion of duty: reciprocity, equality, and fluidity] most apt to be met?” the answer is a surprising one: in a society of economic traders. By definition the members of such a society enter direct and voluntary relationships of exchange. As for equality it is only with the aid of something like a free market that it is possible to develop anything like an exact measure for the value of disparate goods … Finally, economic traders frequently change roles, now selling, now buying … This analysis suggests the somewhat startling conclusion that it is only under capitalism that the notion of the moral and legal duty can reach its full development.’</p>

<p>This compromise location is determined by the weighted average of the locations of the agents. So if it is just one agent in each initial location, they would each try to meet at the halfway point between them.

<p>This formula favors large groups, as there is a linear benefit to adding more agents.

<p>The distance agents move toward the highest-payoff agents is weighted by how many agents they move toward.
