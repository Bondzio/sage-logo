<abstract>
<p>The cognitive and social processes underlying musical and social collaboration were explored in a small-scale study of two professional and two student singer-pianist duos. Each of the eight participants rehearsed one song with his or her regular partner and a second song with a new partner of the same level of expertise; four participants rehearsed a third song with a new partner of the other level of expertise. Their talk during rehearsal was analysed to determine a) numbers and initiators of verbal exchanges, b) interactional style, c) musical dimensions, and d) rehearsal strategies. The professional duos rehearsed more efficiently, in that they talked less and sang/played more. Interactional style was overwhelmingly positive. Students were more likely than professionals to show solidarity and ask for orientation, while professionals were more likely to give and ask for opinions. Basic, interpretive and expressive musical features were found to be as salient in these single rehearsals as evidenced in earlier research investigating protracted rehearsal periods; the present study also identified a range of rehearsal strategies, although the most common was working from the beginning to the end of the song. In conclusion we make some brief suggestions for performers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What are the effects of familiarity and expertise on the practice and rehearsal strategies of singer-pianist duos? While the effects of expertise can be extrapolated from the extensive research literature on the cognitive processes underlying practice strategies of individual musicians, from beginners to elite performers, the effects of familiarity – that is, how well musicians know each other, which is likely to be related to how long they have played together – have not hitherto been studied directly. Although the role of group dynamics in ensemble rehearsal and performance has been explored in survey, interview, observational and empirical research involving the participation of student and professional instrumental chamber groups, including piano and cello-piano duos, there has been very little investigation of singers and pianists working together; such research is largely confined to single case studies. In the present study we examined social and cognitive processes revealed by the rehearsal talk of student and professional singers and pianists who had known each other as duo partners for different lengths of time, or were meeting for the first time. In order to introduce the theoretical frameworks within which we analysed and interpreted the data, relating firstly to the performers’ social interactions and secondly to the musical and strategic dimensions they discussed during rehearsal, we will review the findings of group studies of individual performers, some with student participants and others comparing musicians of varying levels of expertise. We will continue by reviewing the findings of case studies of student and professional musicians. Then we will consider research on the social and cognitive processes underlying the music making of professional string quartets, wind quintets and piano duos, before examining comparisons of expert and “novice” (i.e. less experienced) ensemble performers including cello-piano and singer-pianist duos.</p>
<sec id="section2-1029864911435733">
<title>Group studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1029864911435733">Gruson (1988)</xref>, for example, used observational methods to study the practising and learning behaviours of 43 more and less expert pianists over time, and combined group comparisons with more detailed observations of and interviews with 12 individuals of different levels of expertise. She concluded that consistent and lasting changes in practising behaviour are the result of spending many hours over many years in order to master pieces of increasing difficulty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1029864911435733">Williamon and Valentine (2000)</xref> also observed a group of 22 pianists, divided into four sub-groups representing different levels of skills, who were asked to learn and memorize a piece by Bach appropriate to their expertise. The researchers found that quantity of practice – although it increased with expertise – was not associated with quality. Performances rated more successful by independent judges were given, however, by pianists who had worked on longer segments of the music at earlier stages of practice, and indeed attention to compositional structure was subsequently shown to underlie effective learning and memorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1029864911435733">Williamon &amp; Valentine, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1029864911435733">Hallam (2001a)</xref> interviewed 55 violinists aged 6–18 and 22 professional musicians who played a range of instruments in order to identify the practising strategies they reported. The experts were much more likely than the novices to report using metacognition. In a follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1029864911435733">Hallam 2001b</xref>) the young violinists were observed learning a new piece of an appropriate standard in a ten-minute practice session, and then performing it to a panel of adjudicators. Effective use of strategies was shown to be correlated more strongly with expertise, measured by examinations passed, than performance outcome.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1029864911435733">Miksza (2007)</xref> explored correlations between specific strategies (<italic>repeat section</italic>, <italic>slowing</italic>, <italic>whole-part-whole</italic> and <italic>skipping directly to or just before critical musical sections</italic>) and the use of these strategies and performance achievement in a group of 60 young brass players. Once again, quality of practice was found to be more important for performance outcomes than quantity of time spent playing.</p>
<p>A similar finding was made for long-term recall by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1029864911435733">Ginsborg and Pitkin (2008)</xref> in an experiment involving 20 student wind players. They were divided into two groups, matched for instrument and year of study, and asked to learn and memorize one of two newly-composed pieces, either simple or complex (the second was a variation of the first). Participants were asked to keep practice diaries and, once the piece was memorized, to perform it from memory on repeated occasions over four weeks. Level of complexity and quantity of practice did not predict accuracy and fluency of recall over time, although there was an effect of expertise. Content analysis of the diaries showed that the more successful memorizers had used mental practice, auditory and visual approaches to practice, and paid more attention to detail.</p>
<p>Ginsborg has also undertaken group studies of singers. While two investigated the effect of memory for text on memory for melody using experimental methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Sloboda, 2007</xref>), an observational study adapting Gruson’s methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, 2002</xref>; 2003) identified the “modes of attempt” used by 13 singers of varying levels of expertise in six practice sessions when learning and memorizing the lyrics and melody of a novel song and showed that higher-level strategies, particularly the use of metacognition to set and meet goals, and to evaluate achievement, underlie successful memorization.</p>
<p>Group studies of solo performers, then, have suggested that practice is more effective when it is strategic. Comparisons of more and less experienced musicians suggest that effective strategies are likely to be informed by metacognition, involving awareness of compositional structure and attention to detail as well as the goals to be achieved in each practice session. In order to investigate the processes underlying effective practice strategies, however, it is necessary to obtain data richer than those analysed in group studies. Furthermore, while biographies of well-known soloists and interviews with them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin, Imreh, &amp; Crawford, 2002</xref>, Chapter 3) can provide valuable insights into musicians’ reported practising strategies, these may be based on their own post-hoc rationalizations; case studies can offer both richer and potentially more reliable data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1029864911435733">
<title>Case studies</title>
<p>Two microanalyses of expert solo performers’ practising behaviours have been reported, the first involving a single pianist practising one piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864911435733">Miklaszewski, 1989</xref>), the second comparing three pianists who practised the same two contrasting works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435733">Miklaszewski, 1995</xref>). Methods included the analysis of video recordings, participants’ post-hoc commentaries and graphic representations of practice subsequently developed by Chaffin and his colleagues, discussed below. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1029864911435733">Miklaszewski (1989)</xref> proposes that preparation for performance requires the alternation of intellectual and motor activities to divide the work into sections and then to repeat subsections as necessary until the whole piece can be played complete. The evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435733">Miklaszewski’s (1995)</xref> study, however, suggests that approaches to practice are idiosyncratic and depend not only on personal preference but also the specific demands of the music.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1029864911435733">Nielsen (1999)</xref> undertook similar research with two organists studying different works. Detailed observations were made of two hour-long practice sessions, the first at an early stage of learning and the second closer to the time of public performance. As well as confirming earlier findings, Nielsen’s results suggest that effective practice is characterized by the use of learning strategies applicable in other domains to the choice of material to be worked on, its integration into the whole, and the interpretation of the composer’s intentions as evidenced by the score.</p>
<p>On the basis of a series of longitudinal case studies with a pianist (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al., 2002</xref>), a cellist (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1029864911435733">Chaffin Lisboa, Logan, &amp; Begosh, 2010</xref>), a jazz pianist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1029864911435733">Noice, Jeffrey, Noice, &amp; Chaffin, 2008</xref>), and a singer (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Chaffin, 2011</xref>), Chaffin and his colleagues have developed a theory of performance cues to explain aspects of the relationship between preparation and performance. Analysis of behavioural data (starts, stops and repetitions of musical material), verbal commentaries during practice and comparisons of annotations made on the musical score post-performance shows that performers attend to specific features of the music during practice and rehearsal. A subset of these features is retained and used to guide the unfolding of the music and serve as cues for retrieval during performance from memory. Recent research exploring the processes underlying spontaneity in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Chaffin, 2012</xref>) has shown that certain features to which the performer was not aware of attending during practice may be experienced as particularly salient in performance and function as retrieval cues on subsequent occasions when the music is recalled.</p>

<sec id="section4-1029864911435733">
<title>Ensemble rehearsal</title>
<p>Given that most musicians work collaboratively as well as independently, there is a growing body of research investigating the nature of ensemble rehearsal, particularly in relation to the cognitive and social processes contributing to peer collaboration and improved learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1029864911435733">Doise &amp; Mugny, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1029864911435733">Howe, McWilliam, &amp; Cross, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1029864911435733">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). We will look first at research on professional, then on student ensembles and duos, before returning to the issue of expertise.</p>
<sec id="section5-1029864911435733">
<title>Professional ensembles</title>
<p>Early research on musical collaboration focused predominantly on social processes in professional string quartets (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864911435733">Ford &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864911435733">King, 2006</xref>, for reviews). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1029864911435733">Young and Colman (1979)</xref>, for example, put forward a theory of leadership in string quartets derived from Interaction Process Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1029864911435733">Bales, 1950</xref>), including the necessity for quartets to include both “task” and “socio-emotional” specialists.</p>
<p>As biographies of and case study research with soloists can provide valuable insights into individual practising strategies, so biographies of and interviews with successful ensembles such as the Beaux Arts Trio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1029864911435733">Delbanco, 1985</xref>) and the Guarneri Quartet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1029864911435733">Blum, 1986</xref>) can provide valuable insights into musicians’ views on musical collaboration. Relatively few empirical studies have been undertaken with professional ensemble musicians, however, although the social processes hypothesized by Young and Colman were supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1029864911435733">Butterworth’s (1990)</xref> case study of the Detroit Quartet involving questionnaires, observations of rehearsals and interviews.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1029864911435733">Murnighan and Conlon (1991)</xref> studied 20 more and less “successful” quartets and concluded that in the latter the first violinist was likely to combine both task and socio-emotional orientations, thus providing democratic leadership. More than a decade later, a survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864911435733">Ford and Davidson (2003)</xref> of 55 members of 20 wind quintets revealed that they share certain similarities with string quartets, notably the need for good social dynamics, as well as differences. Wind quintets are not perceived by promoters or audiences as equivalent to string quartets in terms of status or repertoire, for example. A range of problems arising from the instrumental composition of the ensemble (combining wind and brass) needs to be addressed by each group: the social as well as musical integration of the horn player; the blending of sound and the sharing of leadership responsibilities, among others.</p>
<p>Research on duos has focused on different kinds of interaction between them, and their functions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435733">Williamon and Davidson (2002)</xref>, for example, observed the rehearsals of two professional pianists who had recently formed a duo and noted their use of body movement for both musical and social co-ordination. At first they moved quite differently, as two individuals; before long they were playing as a single unit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, Chaffin, and Nicholson (2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1029864911435733">2006b</xref>) investigated the development of shared retrieval cues by a singer and pianist/conductor via the analysis of their discussions during rehearsal as well as their musical behaviours. This study drew on the first author’s dual expertise as singer as well as researcher, and it is worth noting that performer-researchers are increasingly turning their attention to the processes underlying their own performance, including that in the context of chamber music (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1029864911435733">Doğantan-Dack, 2008</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864911435733">Blank and Davidson (2007)</xref> interviewed 27 pianists from 17 professional piano duos and found that it was vital for the parallel relationships between each pair of musicians, social as well as professional, to be negotiated successfully.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1029864911435733">
<title>Student ensembles</title>
<p>It is perhaps easier for researchers in academic contexts to undertake research with music performance students than professional musicians. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1029864911435733">Davidson and Good (2002)</xref> undertook case study research with a newly-formed student string quartet with the aim of tracking the development of social and musical co-ordination between its members and were able to show, for example, that the desire for effective communication and concern for the music can override tensions arising from perceived imbalances in technical ability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864911435733">King (2006)</xref> drew on the management theories of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1029864911435733">Belbin (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1029864911435733">2000</xref>) in her study of team roles in three quartets whose members were university students, using interviews and observations of rehearsals. She found that where team-role behaviour was stable, in that each player consistently played the same role, performance outcomes were better than for quartets whose players transferred roles between them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1029864911435733">Burt-Perkins and Mills (2008)</xref> also used interviews and observations of concert performances to explore the experiences of conservatoire students who formed a wind quintet. In many conservatoires, students perceive themselves primarily as soloists in training; Burt-Perkins &amp; Mills argue that playing chamber music – an extra-curricular activity – provided their participants with not only the opportunity to develop their musical, social and organizational skills beyond those they perceived to be necessary for soloists but also a forum for engaging in “in-depth” learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1029864911435733">
<title>Comparisons of experts and novices</title>
<p>In contrast to the body of literature comparing the practising strategies of expert and novice solo performers, very few studies have attempted to assess the effects of expertise on the nature of ensemble rehearsal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman (2000)</xref> undertook a case study involving the participation of seven cello-piano duos. These were formed for the purposes of the research by musicians who did not already know each other; the members of four duos were advanced students, while the members of the others were professionals. Goodman (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1029864911435733">Davidson &amp; King, 2004</xref>) details different approaches to rehearsal, communication and social interaction in two of these duos. While these differences may be attributable to the musicians’ expertise (and certainly it appears that the professionals rehearsed more economically, for example, and with fewer disagreements) they could also be related to personal idiosyncracies. As part of a larger study of small-group music-making at universities and conservatoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Wistreich, 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1029864911435733">Ginsborg (2009)</xref> used structured diary methods to investigate the effects of focus, effort and enjoyment on the practice and rehearsal strategies of two student string quartets and a wind quintet at a conservatoire where chamber music was part of the curriculum. Two – one well-established, the other newly formed – were successful, in that they had won several competitions and gave regular performances; the third did not rehearse or perform other than in preparation for a single concert and compulsory assessment. Focus, effort and enjoyment varied according to the length of time the ensemble had worked together. The successful well-established group enjoyed individual practice more than joint rehearsal, while the reverse was true of the successful newly-formed group.</p>
<p>To summarize the approaches taken to the empirical study of ensemble rehearsal, social and to a lesser extent cognitive processes have been investigated in professional string quartets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1029864911435733">Butterworth, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1029864911435733">Murnighan &amp; Conlon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1029864911435733">Young &amp; Colman, 1979</xref>), wind quintets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864911435733">Ford &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>), trios (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1029864911435733">Doğantan-Dack 2008</xref>) and duos (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864911435733">Blank &amp; Davidson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864911435733">Ginsborg et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1029864911435733">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435733">Williamon &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>) via group and case studies. Similar research has been undertaken with the participation of student ensembles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1029864911435733">Burt-Perkins &amp; Mills, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1029864911435733">Davidson &amp; Good, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1029864911435733">King, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential effects of expertise on ensemble rehearsal can be inferred from the findings of studies investigating expertise in solo practice and performance, and from those involving professional ensembles. For example, it might be speculated that duo performers with greater musical expertise would have clearer perceptions of musical structure, thus permitting more efficient rehearsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435733">Williamon &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>); they have more experience of non-verbal communication with other performers so they can talk less and play more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman, 2000</xref>). For the purposes of the present study we defined expertise in terms of experience and recruited advanced student and professional duos to carry out the same task in a single investigation. In this way it was possible to test the hypothesis that there would be differences between the rehearsal behaviours of the two groups of musicians. We would not argue that one group was more musically expert than the other; we can only say that the advanced students had completed four or five years of training recently, while the professionals had received their training many years earlier.</p>
<p>Another issue arising from the focus, hitherto, on either student or professional ensembles is that the former tended to be newly formed for research purposes and the latter were likely to be well-established; the participants in the studies carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435733">Williamon and Davidson (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1029864911435733">Ginsborg (2009)</xref> are exceptions to this rule. In other words, what is perceived to be an effect of expertise may in fact be an effect of length of partnership and therefore familiarity. Again, suggestions can be made as to the potential effects of familiarity: for example, duos who know each other well do not need to spend time learning about each others’ preferred rehearsal or performance styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864911435733">Blank &amp; Davidson, 2007</xref>), with implications for the balance between talking and playing and, thereby, efficiency of rehearsal. The advantage of recruiting student and professional participants to the same study is that it was possible to examine the effects of familiarity as well as expertise. In addition, because the participants were prepared to be observed rehearsing and performing together in different combinations, a question that has not hitherto been addressed could be asked: what are the effects of expertise on duo rehearsal when duo members have an asymmetrical relationship such that one is more experienced or has more power (e.g., the coach working with a student, or the diva with an accompanist)?</p>

<title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
<p>The aims of the present study, then, were to investigate some of the differences in short-term preparation for performance by singers and pianists of different levels of expertise (defined for the purposes of the study as advanced student and professional) and familiarity, measured by length of experience of duo partnership (established duo partners and those who were working with each other for the first time). As in previous case study research involving duo performers, we video-recorded rehearsals, so we could have chosen to analyse and present behavioural as well as verbal data. The findings of the analysis of behavioural data have, however, been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; King, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864911435733">King &amp; Ginsborg, 2011</xref>) and we have decided for the purposes of this report to focus on the verbal data alone. These had the potential to be particularly rich, since our participants were singers and pianists who would have to agree on and communicate the meaning not only of music but also words. Ethical approval was granted by the research ethics committees of both authors’ institutions and the participants gave their informed consent for the data they provided to be analysed and reported. The participants were asked to practise, rehearse and perform short songs in the following combinations: alone; with their regular duo partner (established and therefore same level of expertise); with a new partner of the same level of expertise (new same-expertise); with a new partner of a different level of expertise (new different-expertise). Our hypotheses were as follows: there would be differences between</p>

<list-item><p>4) the kinds of rehearsal strategies they used, identified via content analyses of the participants’ verbal utterances.</p></list-item></list>
<p>These differences would be related to participants’ expertise (defined as professional <italic>versus</italic> student), performer type (singer <italic>versus</italic> pianist) and the type of duo in which they were rehearsing (established <italic>versus</italic> new same-expertise <italic>versus</italic> new different-expertise).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Four established singer-pianist duos, comprising a female soprano and a male pianist in each instance, took part in the study. Two of the duos involved professional musicians. Amanda and Colin, aged 60 and 76, had worked together for 10 years, and Isobel and George, aged 51 and 63, had worked together for 15 years. The other two duos involved advanced students at a conservatoire. Betty and Robert, aged 25 and 26, had worked together for two years, and Sophie and Guy, aged 22 and 21, had worked together for two years (all participants’ names are pseudonyms). While the professionals were clearly considerably older than the students, thus presenting a confound between age and expertise, it should be noted that all the participants were experts in the sense of having spent many years training and, particularly in the case of the professionals, performing in public. The word “expertise” should be taken as an indication of experience rather than ability.</p>

<sec id="section11-1029864911435733" sec-type="materials">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Three songs by Ivor Gurney (1890–1937), unknown to the participants, were chosen: <italic>An Epitaph, On the Downs</italic> and <italic>I Shall be Ever Maiden</italic>. The choice was made on the basis that the songs are of similar length (about 4 minutes) and difficulty (as judged by two independent experts, one a university vocal tutor, the other a member of the teaching staff in the School of Vocal Studies at a conservatoire), and in a genre familiar to the participants, all of whom had played or sung other songs by Gurney.</p>
<sec id="section12-1029864911435733">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The four duos were asked to prepare either <italic>An Epitaph</italic> or <italic>On the Downs</italic> individually for 20 minutes before rehearsing it for 40 minutes and performing it in two experimental conditions on separate occasions: first, with their regular duo partner (established same-expertise) and second, with a new duo partner of the same level of expertise (new same-expertise). Two of the duos, one professional and one student, were also asked to prepare <italic>I Shall be Ever Maiden</italic> on a subsequent occasion in a third condition: with a partner from the other duo (new different-expertise). The musicians were asked to verbalize their thoughts as they prepared the songs individually prior to the rehearsals undertaken with their duo partner but no such request was made in relation to the rehearsals since it was assumed that the singers and pianists would talk to each other in the course of working together. The singers were told that there was no need to attempt to memorize the song but all the musicians would be expected to give a performance to the researcher and video camera; no further instructions were provided (or, for that matter, needed). The researchers’ experience as (respectively) singer and pianist in other duos informed their decision as to the length of time that would be required for the practice and rehearsal sessions. While the singer in one of the duos struggled to learn one of the songs in the time allocated, another duo did not need to use all the time available, so the researchers were satisfied that on balance the length of time was sufficient. All practice sessions and rehearsals were video-recorded. Transcripts were made of all the utterances produced in all the rehearsals, musical and verbal, using tables. Each row consisted of an “episode”, musical or verbal. Musical utterances were indicated in columns showing</p>
<list id="list2-1029864911435733" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>i) the beats of the song on which the pianist started and stopped playing, and/or</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ii) the singer started and stopped singing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>iii) the words of the song sung by the singer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>iv) information relating to body movement;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>v)errors in the words or music.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The analysis of musical utterances is not presented in this article. Verbal utterances (“talk”) were recorded in a separate column. Each “talk” episode was defined as starting at the beginning of each session before the first musical episode and, when that came to an end, before each subsequent musical episode until the end of the session. The majority consisted of one or more utterances made by each of the two performers (the maximum was 45, lasting 4 minutes), while those that involved only one utterance made by one of the performers was likely to represent a response to a musical utterance, so we have called these talk episodes “verbal exchanges”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1029864911435733">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The verbal exchanges made by each pair of duos in their rehearsals were counted. The speaker of the first verbal utterance in each exchange was noted. Content analyses of each utterance were made using two frameworks: Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1029864911435733">Bales, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1029864911435733">1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1029864911435733">Table 1</xref>) and – where appropriate – a coding system of musical dimensions (MD) based on that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al.

The results of the analyses using these two frameworks are presented separately. Exploratory data analysis confirmed that the data were not normally distributed so parametric statistical tests could not be employed.

<title>Musical dimensions and rehearsal strategies</title>
<p>Almost all of the participants’ verbal utterances could be coded for interactional style. A smaller proportion referred to musical dimensions and rehearsal strategies. The specific topics mentioned by the participants were categorized according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al.’s (2002)</xref> framework of musical dimensions into basic (including structural), interpretive, expressive and strategic features (the latter equivalent to those labelled “metacognitive” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864911435733">Ginsborg et al., 2006a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1029864911435733">Figure 4</xref> shows the mean percentages and standard deviations of all utterances made by all participants in both or all of their rehearsal sessions, as appropriate, that referred to basic, interpretive, and expressive musical dimensions and rehearsal strategies. A Friedman test showed significant differences between the percentages of utterances made in the four categories, such that participants were most likely to refer to basic dimensions and least likely to refer to rehearsal strategies (χ<sup>2</sup>[3,<italic>N</italic> = 8] = 15.9, <italic>p</italic> = .001). There were no significant effects of expertise or performer type on the proportions of utterances they made categorized as referring to the three types of musical dimension or rehearsal strategies; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1029864911435733">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1029864911435733">3</xref> these are ordered by the frequency with which they were referred to, from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Basic features included pitch, tempo (as notated on the musical score), technical issues, the location of breaths, ensemble issues, rhythm, comments on the song itself, dynamics (as notated), words (pronunciation), issues relating to notation, metre (practical decisions), figuration, entries, issues relating to the instrument being played by the pianist, the structure of the song and articulation (as notated). All the participants mentioned pitch, tempo, breath and ensemble.</p>
<p>Interpretive features refer to the performers’ understanding of the composer’s intentions, so while several specific features were given the same labels as those in the basic category, they actually required different kinds of decisions to be made. Expressive features constitute the way a basic or interpretive feature is implemented, i.e., conveyed in performance. Interpretive features included <italic>rubato</italic>, dynamics, words (meaning), tempo, energy, phrasing, articulation, climax, colour, pedal, harmony and metre. All of the participants mentioned <italic>rubato</italic> and dynamics. Specific instances of basic and interpretive features implemented as expressive features were mentioned by all participants but not categorized further.</p>
<p>References to rehearsal strategies included singing and playing through the whole song (all participants), repeating sections or smaller units, general comments about learning strategy, rehearsing phrase by phrase, using a slower tempo, rehearsing verse by verse, commenting on use of rehearsal time, the pianist playing the vocal line at the same time as the accompaniment, and the pianist playing chords under the melody line rather than the accompaniment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This small-scale study of four established professional and student duos, re-combined to produce four new and two mixed partnerships, was devised to explore the different ways of working available to musicians involved in ensemble rehearsal, specifically through the analysis of verbal exchanges, interactional style and references to musical dimensions and rehearsal strategies. First, we tested three hypotheses based on the findings of earlier studies, although these were necessarily informal since they were derived, for the most part, from data obtained from a very small number of participants. Second, we identified potential differences between the rehearsal sessions of new different-expertise duos via the reporting of talk in rehearsal between one student pianist working with a professional singer and one professional pianist working with a student singer, acknowledging that this could only represent a snapshot of possible “coach-student” and “diva-accompanist” interactions. Third, we sought to establish the extent to which the musical and social strategies described in earlier research on soloists and chamber musicians were used by the singers and pianists who participated in the present study. We have illustrated the findings where appropriate with quotations from the transcripts of the participants’ rehearsals in addition to those provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1029864911435733">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1029864911435733">3</xref>.</p>
<p>We predicted that there would be differences in the efficiency of the rehearsals undertaken by duos with greater musical expertise because they would be likely to have, first, clearer perceptions of musical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1029864911435733">Williamon and Davidson, 2002</xref>), and second, more experience of non-verbal communication with other performers so they could talk less and sing or play more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman, 2000</xref>). We also hypothesized that established duos would not need to spend time learning about each others’ preferred rehearsal or performance styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1029864911435733">Blank &amp; Davidson, 2007</xref>) with outcomes similar to those hypothesized for more expert duos.</p>
<sec id="section20-1029864911435733">
<title>Verbal exchanges</title>
<p>If efficiency of rehearsal involves more playing and singing and less talking, then – notwithstanding our argument that the student participants should not be considered less “expert” than the professionals – the professional duos were significantly more efficient than the student duos, so our second hypothesis is supported: students talked significantly more than professionals in these rehearsals. Nevertheless, in many cases it is clear from the transcripts that participants would have liked to have been able to continue beyond the allocated time (Isobel: “That can’t be 40 minutes; no way is that 40 minutes!”), while one of the established professional duos, Amanda and Colin, decided after 20 minutes that no further rehearsal was necessary (this was taken into account in the analysis). This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1029864911435733">Goodman’s (2000)</xref> conclusions but on the evidence of our analysis of participants’ references to basic features (which include compositional structure) and rehearsal strategy (e.g., “Rehearse phrase by phrase” <italic>versus</italic> “Whole song”) the professionals’ superior efficiency cannot be attributed to their clearer understanding of musical structure. Our data indicate, therefore, that our first hypothesis should be rejected (also see under <italic>Rehearsal strategies</italic> below). Furthermore, the established student and established professional duos were not significantly more efficient than the new combinations of student, professional and mixed duos, nor were singers or pianists more or less likely to initiate verbal exchanges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1029864911435733">
<title>Interactional style</title>
<p>Social-emotional interaction was overwhelmingly positive, in that participants’ utterances were most likely to be categorized as “Agrees” or ‘Shows solidarity”. There were few categorized as “Disagrees” and none as “Shows antagonism”. Most examples of tension release were shown by one of the professional singers, Isobel, working with both her new partners, perhaps reflecting a measure of (quite unwarranted) nervousness: “Sorry I sung the wrong notes there [<italic>pointing to score</italic>] as well which made me panic”. Students were significantly more likely to show solidarity than professionals, and Guy in particular responded to Isobel’s tension release by showing solidarity (“Oh, we’ll get there!”). This reflects their collegial relationships. As Betty said to the camera at the outset of her rehearsal with her new same-expertise partner Guy, “This is Guy’s and I’s first ever working together . . . – we do lots of partying together”; they were clearly already good friends.</p>
<p>The few examples of tension were exhibited by one of the student singers, Betty, with her regular partner Robert, albeit in the context of what was clearly a highly supportive relationship (“I’m tired . . . I don’t like this song”). It may be, of course, that in the somewhat artificial setting of a one-off rehearsal in a room with a video camera the participants made an effort to be pleasant to each other.</p>
<p>The high proportion of utterances categorized as “Gives opinion” is attributable to the professionals, regardless of whether the context was a rehearsal with an established, new same-expertise or indeed (in the case of George) new different-expertise partner (“Some of the spookiness of this has got to come from the left hand of the piano”); his regular partner, Isobel, also made a high proportion of such utterances. It may be that the professionals were used to taking more responsibility for rehearsals, and that the students – perhaps used to being coached – felt they should defer to the professionals’ greater age and experience, or had less well-formed opinions. It is worth noting that the frequency of “Agree” utterances discussed above may reflect responses to opinions given.</p>
<p>Although there were comparatively few instances of asking for an opinion (e.g. Amanda: “Is it meant to be a silence there?”), these too were significantly more likely to be requested by professionals than students perhaps because they believed – correctly, in light of the present findings – that their duo partners would be prepared to offer them. By contrast, the students were more likely to ask for orientation (e.g. Sophie: “What do you play when I come in, can you play the next chord that you play?”). While the new different-expertise duos were not considered for the purposes of the statistical analysis, the majority of task-related utterances in their rehearsals concerned orientation. Orientation is clearly important in new partnerships but in comparison with professionals who may be better at intuiting appropriate starting points, locations for attention and so on, students may have learned from their teachers to be explicit in the interests of efficiency. The third hypothesis is supported insofar as the interactional style of the established and new partnerships differed: asking for and giving orientation provided a way for partners to get to know each others’ rehearsal styles.</p>
<p>To this end, the data point towards the basic familiarity principle, which is in turn rooted in the “mere exposure” effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1029864911435733">Zajonc, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1029864911435733">1980</xref>) whereby people develop a preference for something because they are familiar with it. Research indicates that there is a link between thought and affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1029864911435733">Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003</xref>) and that the positive feelings that arise from being in a familiar situation enable an individual to be more flexible within that situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1029864911435733">Isen, 2004</xref>). In this study, we did not ask explicitly if our singers and pianists preferred working with their regular or their new partner, but the data did reveal how interaction in the familiar and unfamiliar contexts differed and thus potentially influenced the individual’s affective experience of the rehearsal. If the way the musicians talked with their regular partners (familiar context) represents their typical interactional style, then their use of different types of utterance with new partners (unfamiliar context), including asking for and giving orientation, may reflect their affective experience of the rehearsal as they move beyond their “comfort zone”. This could well be explored in future research.</p>

<sec id="section22-1029864911435733">
<title>Musical dimensions</title>
<p>The following basic features were mentioned by at least six of the eight participants: pitch, tempo, technique, breath, ensemble, rhythm and words (e.g. pronunciation). Interpretive features referred to by six or more participants included <italic>rubato</italic>, dynamics, tempo and words (e.g. meaning); all mentioned expressive features. Even though the present study required musicians to rehearse for only 40 minutes following 20 minutes of independent practice, the findings are comparable to the specific features identified in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1029864911435733">Ginsborg et al., 2006a</xref>), focusing on changes of emphasis over extended rehearsal periods from nine to 33 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1029864911435733">
<title>New different-expertise duo rehearsals</title>
<p>One potential difference between the rehearsal sessions of new different-expertise duos was that, while the singers and pianists in all the same-expertise duos initiated similar proportions of verbal exchanges, thereby setting the tone of each dialogue, the professionals both initiated the majority of their exchanges with their student partners. Isobel initiated 69% of her exchanges with Guy, although only 48% and 44% with George and Colin respectively, and George initiated 71% of his exchanges with Betty, in comparison with the 52% he initiated with each of his other partners. As suggested above, this may reflect a sense of responsibility by the professionals for the conduct of the rehearsal. The rehearsal style of these partnerships, therefore, reflected a stereotypical hierarchy between the performers based upon perceived levels of expertise; this observation also relates to our third hypothesis because the manner in which the students and professionals worked with one another was clearly affected by this hierarchy, albeit unconsciously.</p>
<p>While, as we have seen, the greatest proportion of all utterances made by the members of these duos involved providing orientation (a mean of 40.85%), both the students were more likely to agree with their professional partners than vice versa. Of all of Betty’s utterances, 40.4% were agreements with George, who only agreed with Betty in 15.6% of his utterances; the equivalent proportions of utterances for Guy and Isobel representing “Agree” were 37.8% and 21.9%. By comparison, Betty agreed with Robert, her regular partner, in 17.8% of all her utterances (and showed tension in 17%), and with Guy, her new same-expertise partner, in only 6.5% of utterances. Similarly, Guy’s agreements with Sophie, his regular partner, represented 6.8% of his utterances, and with Betty 20.1%. This finding is related, no doubt, to the proportions of exchanges initiated by the professionals; where these involved the stating of opinions on the music or the performance of the musical segment just played and/or sung, agreement would in many instances be the natural response. For example, George’s comment, “That’s a strange passage” elicited, not surprisingly, “Yes”, from Betty.</p>
<p>It was argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1029864911435733">Davidson and Good (2002)</xref> on the basis of their research with students that the desire for effective communication and concern for the music can override tensions arising from perceived imbalances in technical ability. In the present study any tensions that arose within the student duos could be attributed to the performers’ self-evaluations, rather than evaluations of each other (e.g. Betty: “OK I apologize for all the wrong notes I’ll be singing . . .” – Guy: “ . . . Wrong notes I’ll be playing – it’s one of these pieces that get hard if you get wrong fingers and do stupid things in one of those running basses”). Such self-evaluations were perhaps inevitable given the time pressures under which the musicians were expected to practise and rehearse, and which must have affected the nature of their dialogues. Nevertheless, given their levels of expertise – at the time of the study the students were all well on their way towards professional careers – it was only to be expected that in their duo rehearsals they would exhibit the good social as well as musical dynamics predicted by the findings of research on professional chamber musicians, as did the members of the professional duos who took part in the study. There were many examples of polite consideration shown to regular partners (e.g. Colin to Amanda: “Um, how are you on that last semibreve? Have you plenty of breath there?”; Isobel to Peter: “I feel as though we are making some sort of accommodation . . .” and his response to her, having worked on the passage in question, “That’s it. That’s better. I must do what you do. I must count threes and do that more accurately. That was better that time.”), as well as new partners (e.g. Isobel to Colin: “ . . . What would you think if I said what about a slight easing up there [<italic>pointing</italic>] just so that I could place “bare” absolutely nakedly?” to which Colin agreed: “Yes, of course”). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1029864911435733">Ford and Davidson (2003)</xref> suggest that one aspect of successful social dynamics is the sharing of leadership responsibilities, and this was evidenced in the present study by the equal division of labour shown by the same-expertise duos, student as well as professional, in initiating verbal exchanges.</p>
<p>As we are reminded by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1029864911435733">Miklaszewski’s (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1029864911435733">Nielsen’s (1999)</xref> studies, for example, it would not only be inappropriate to draw general conclusions from a study involving such a small number of musicians, but also such a small number of songs; in the interests of being able to make potentially meaningful comparisons between the rehearsal sessions three similar songs by the same composer were chosen, but even so they made different demands on the performers, who liked them to different extents. While Betty did not feel that <italic>Up on the Downs</italic> suited her voice, George said to her in their rehearsal of <italic>An Epitaph</italic>: “Well, of the three songs we’ve done, I’ve liked them better each time. I don’t know, it could be . . . when I first opened this I thought this is going to be . . . but it’s not quite as hard as it looks”. There were of course idiosyncratic approaches to rehearsal – Guy, for example, was the partner who first raised the subject of the text of the lyrics to each song, in each of his sessions (with Sophie: “Do you have any idea what this little ditty’s about because I haven’t the faintest idea”; with Betty: “So right, the overall plan of the song, what’s happening, talk to me”; with Isobel: “Do you know what the poem’s about, because I just . . .”) – but the duos paid particular attention to the same passages and although we did not in the present study address the extent to which these locations might have functioned as performance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1029864911435733">Chaffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Chaffin, 2011</xref>), it would be possible to explore this in future research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1029864911435733">
<title>Rehearsal strategies</title>
<p>The most commonly mentioned rehearsal strategy was attempting to sing and play through the whole song. It was sometimes unclear, however, whether this meant starting from the beginning and stopping for any reason, from correcting errors to refining interpretation, when it seemed necessary to do so (Betty to Robert: “Just have a crack at it and see where it goes horribly wrong, then we can fix it kind of thing”) or aiming to achieve a complete run-through without stopping (Amanda: “Once through and then we’ll go and say we’re ready”, to which George responded, “ . . . Let’s just run it”). This was a little surprising given that the participants were all expert musicians; it has been shown in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1029864911435733">Williamon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, 2003</xref>) that this strategy is more likely to be employed by novices than experts, who prefer to identify smaller units, practise them separately and then recombine them.</p>
<p>It has been shown in a number of group studies that practice is more effective when it is strategic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1029864911435733">Hallam, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1029864911435733">Miksza, 2007</xref>) and that effective strategies are likely to be informed by metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1029864911435733">Hallam, 2001a</xref>) involving awareness of compositional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1029864911435733">Williamon &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1029864911435733">2002</xref>) and attention to detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; Pitkin, 2008</xref>) as well as the goals to be achieved in each practice session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1029864911435733">Ginsborg, 2003</xref>). In the present study the goal of each rehearsal was to prepare a single song to a standard in which a performance – straight through, without stopping – could be given to the performers’ satisfaction. Accordingly, the single strategy mentioned most often, and the only one mentioned by all of the participants, was categorized as “whole song” (56 references in total). References to verses, sections, subsections, lines and phrases imply awareness of compositional structure, and these (combined) were mentioned 63 times. There were 19 general comments about learning strategy made by four participants, and five about use of rehearsal time made by three participants; these confirm the use of metacognition. As could have been predicted, there was a great deal of evidence for attention to detail.</p>
<p>Relating to expertise and of relevance to this study is the social facilitation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1029864911435733">Allport, 1924</xref>): people will perform better on simple tasks than on complex tasks when in the presence of others. This theory helps to explain one particular aspect of our data: the difficulty of learning the unfamiliar Gurney songs in a pressured environment in the presence of a familiar <italic>versus</italic> unfamiliar partner. For example, Isobel seemed to struggle more when working with Colin and Guy than with her regular partner, George; in the former situation, both piece and person were unfamiliar, whereas in the latter, only the piece was unfamiliar. While we did not measure this phenomenon directly in our study, it does help to explain the nature of some of the utterances in the rehearsals with the new partners, particularly relating to frustration with the material.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Verbal exchanges, interactional style, attention to musical dimensions (illustrated by references to basic, interpretive and expressive features) and rehearsal strategy must all reflect the individual personality of the musician as much as their musical expertise, prior experiences of collaboration and level of familiarity with their current rehearsal partner. In order to follow up earlier research involving single case studies we have chosen in the present analyses to focus, largely, on similarities and differences potentially attributable to expertise and familiarity, but an alternative strategy would have been to have tracked in more detail each of the individual musicians’ characteristics in the context of rehearsal with familiar and new, same- and different-expertise partners. Future research will aim to reconcile the findings of the present investigation, based on the analysis of verbal data, with behavioural data including non-verbal communication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1029864911435733">Ginsborg &amp; King, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1029864911435733">King &amp; Ginsborg, 2011</xref>), practice records (stops, starts, errors unnoticed and corrected) and performance, the better to identify the constituents of effective rehearsal.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is possible on the basis of the existing evidence to make some suggestions, particularly for new or short-term partnerships when rehearsal time is short, such as preparation for auditions and competitions. Clearly, the better prepared each partner is, the less time needs to be spent on basic issues and the more can be devoted to interpretive and expressive features. It may be more efficient to work on longer sections, to play and sing more and to talk less. Care should be taken to contribute equally to the direction of the rehearsal, particularly when there is a perceived imbalance of experience and/or authority. In these ways – and no doubt in many others still to be determined – collaborative rehearsal can be stimulating, productive and above all, enjoyable.</p>
