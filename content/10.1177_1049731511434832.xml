<abstract>
<p>Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are more common in severe mental illnesses (SMI) clients than in the general population, yet brief screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent. In a two-part study, the authors used correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to develop and validate a 3-item PTSD scale derived from the PTSD Symptom scale (PSS) with SMI clients. Results from Study #1 (<italic>N</italic> = 220) revealed that a 3-item Brief PSS showed excellent accuracy for detecting PTSD, good internal consistency, and good concurrent validity with other relevant measures. In Study #2 (<italic>N</italic> = 327) comparable reliability and concurrent validity were found with measures similar to those used in Study #1. Practitioners are encouraged to use the Brief PSS with SMI clients, and if positive, conduct a full assessment and diagnosis. Limitations of the study include the lack of a structured interview for primary Axis I diagnosis.</p>

<p>People with severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders experience high rates of trauma including physical and sexual abuse and exposure to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511434832">O’Hare &amp; Sherrer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731511434832">Resnick, Bond, &amp; Mueser, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al. (1998)</xref> found that 98% of their sample of people with SMI (<italic>N</italic> = 275) reported at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511434832">O’Hare and Sherrer (2009)</xref> found 92.8% (<italic>N</italic> = 276) of clients with SMI reported at least one traumatic event. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al. (1998)</xref> reported the following traumas during childhood: sexual assault (35.5%); physical assault without weapon (20.8%); assault with a weapon (17.2%); and witnessing a killing or serious injury of another (17.7%). Adulthood traumas included: sexual assault (25.9%); physical attack without weapon (39.7%); physical attack with a weapon (49.2%); and, witnessing a killing or serious injury of another (42.6%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511434832">O’Hare and Sherrer (2009)</xref> found that 51.8% of clients reported having been physically abused at least once in their lifetime, 41.7% sexually abused, and 21.3% saw another person harmed or killed. Comparable rates of physical and sexual abuse have been found for clients with bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511434832">Goldberg &amp; Garno, 2005</xref>) and schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731511434832">Lysaker, Meyer, Evans, Clements, &amp; Marks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731511434832">Ross, Anderson, &amp; Clark, 1994</xref>). Women with SMI are about twice as likely to have been sexually and physically abused in their lifetime, and men are more likely to have witnessed extreme violence or attacked with a weapon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731511434832">Goodman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511434832">O’Hare &amp; Sherrer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, trauma among people with SMI occurs more frequently than for people in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511434832">Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, &amp; Nelson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731511434832">Norris, 1992</xref>) for whom rates can range as high as 70% for some trauma. In addition to higher rates of trauma, people with SMI are more prone to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the rates for which are four to five times higher (33% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare, Sherrer, &amp; Shen, 2006</xref>; 43% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 1998</xref>) than in the general population (about 8%). SMI clients with PTSD experience more severe symptoms of psychopathology, more substance use problems, and are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, self-mutilation, and other problematic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511434832">Gearon, Kaltman, Brown, &amp; Bellack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511434832">O’Hare, Shen, &amp; Sherrer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731511434832">van Dorn et al., 2005</xref>). Given the high rates of trauma, PTSD and increased associated problems in the SMI population, early screening for trauma/PTSD could lead to earlier intervention and improved client outcomes.</p>
<p>There are a number of well-validated scales that have been used with SMI samples to measure PTSD symptoms including the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511434832">Blake et al., 1995</xref>), the PTSD Checklist (PCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731511434832">Weathers, Litz, Herman, Juska, &amp; Keane, 1993</xref>), and the PTSD Symptom scale (PSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511434832">Foa &amp; Tolin, 2000</xref>). Although administration guidelines vary somewhat, these and other PTSD scales closely match <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>—<italic>Fourth edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) criteria for PTSD. After interviewing the client about stressful and potentially traumatic events in their lives, the practitioner then determines whether the “worst” or index trauma meets <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Criterion A:<disp-quote>
<p>The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following are present: 1) the person experienced witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others; 2) the person’s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511434832">APA, 2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>Criteria B, C, and D are comprised of several indictors that measure re-experiencing (one symptom is required: e.g., intrusive thoughts, reliving the experience, dissociative flashbacks), avoidance (three symptoms required: e.g., avoiding thoughts, feelings, people, situations that are associated with or arouse recollection of the event, feelings of detachment), and hyperarousal (two symptoms required: e.g., sleep disturbance, trouble concentrating, irritability, exaggerated startle response).</p>
<p>Despite the high rates of PTSD in the SMI population, there is considerable evidence that PTSD goes largely underdetected given the wide disparity between rates found in structured research interviews versus chart diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511434832">Cusack, Grubaugh, Knapp, &amp; Freuh, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al. (1998)</xref>, for example, found that, although 43% of clients met criteria for PTSD using the PCL in their study, only 2% of clients had actually been diagnosed with PTSD during treatment. However, if administered within the context of routine mental health screening, a full and adequate diagnostic interview for PTSD could add considerable demand on both practitioners and clients working under the increasing constraints of time and funding limitations. Conducting adequate assessments and diagnoses for trauma/PTSD also competes with resources needed to explore other cooccurring Axes I and II disorders such as substance abuse and personality disorders, along with a range of high-risk behaviors, and other interpersonal and psychosocial problems. A valid and reliable trauma/PTSD screen for clients with SMI is needed that can be administered quickly and, if positive, would then trigger a full assessment and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Brief, valid and reliable PTSD scales with adequate sensitivity and specificity have been developed for different groups, although none included psychiatric populations. These included a general population sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511434832">Breslau, Peterson, Kessler, &amp; Schultz, 1999</xref>), the results for which included only avoidance and hyperarousal items (and thus less applicable to SMI clients where dissociation, which is significantly associated with re-experiencing in SMI clients, was not represented); Chinese disaster victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731511434832">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), the scale for which focused exclusively on natural disaster, not a representative trauma for SMI patients; and, patients in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511434832">Lang &amp; Stein, 2005</xref>), a study that resulted in a low response rate with a sample of women, exclusively). Despite the need for routine screening of SMI clients given their very high rates of trauma and PTSD and low rates of routine detection in daily practice, we could not find a brief version in the literature that was developed and validated specifically with SMI clients.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049731511434832">
<title>Purpose of This Study</title>
<p>Although brief screening tools should not substitute for a full assessment and diagnosis, they can serve as a practical indicator that a client is probably suffering from a particular condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511434832">Bredemeier et al., 2010</xref>). We used survey data from two samples of community mental health clients with SMI diagnoses (i.e., either a schizophrenia spectrum or major mood disorder) collected in 2003 and 2009 to develop and validate a brief PTSD scale. The purpose of this two-sample study was to, first (in Study #1) develop a brief version of the PSS-I using correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, develop a useful cut score for screening purposes and then test the internal consistency and concurrent validity of the brief PSS-I with other key trauma-related variables. In Study #2, we used data from another sample of SMI clients to test concurrent validity between the Brief PSS and other relevant factors including lifetime trauma and trauma-related subjective distress, factors very similar to those used in Study #1. We hypothesized that the brief PSS-I would show satisfactory accuracy in detecting true positives and true negatives for PTSD when using the full PSS-I as a diagnostic tool, good internal consistency reliability, and would significantly correlate with key variables related to trauma in both samples of SMI clients. Finally, we examined gender differences in reliability testing, and ROC analysis, and in tests of concurrent validity. Although studies generally have shown no differences in rates of PTSD diagnosis between men and women in the SMI population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>), women have reported greater perceived threat from stressful and traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511434832">Olff, Langeland, Draijer, &amp; Gersons, 2007</xref>), greater negative appraisals of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511434832">Sherrer, 2011</xref>), and greater subjective distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>) from an array of stressful and traumatic events.</p>

<title>Study #1 Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1049731511434832">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>All clients who participated in the survey conducted in 2003 at a community mental health center in southeastern New England were at least 18 years of age. Clients eligible for community support services had an SMI diagnosis and required case management services; outpatient clients who participated were also diagnosed with an SMI, but did not require case management support. Response rate for the voluntary survey was 60.2%. Analysis for this study begins with a subsample of 220 clients (77.7% of the larger sample) who cited at least one index trauma (i.e., the worst lifetime trauma), and who were diagnosed by staff psychiatrists with a primary Axis I SMI disorder: schizophrenia (54, 24.5%), schizoaffective (52, 23.6%), major depression (75, 34.1%), and bipolar I disorder (39, 17.7%). Ninety-two (41.8%) of these clients were male, 125 (56.8%) were female. Mean age (<italic>N</italic> = 220) was 45.4 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.3). The sample was overwhelmingly White (199, 90.5%), followed by African American, Native American, and Hispanic at about 2–3% each. The remainder accounted for 1% Asian and “other.” Median annual household income was $9,000, with almost three quarters (156, 70.9%) of clients covered by federal health insurance. About three quarters of the clients (73.0%) had completed high school or better. Most clients (188, 85.5%) had been hospitalized at least once in their lifetime for a mental health or substance use problem, and almost all (208, 94.5%) were taking psychiatric medication at the time of the study.</p>
<p>The survey was implemented as part of routine care by staff social workers and case managers who were provided with specific training in the use of the instruments. Each staff member was instructed to canvass the clients on their caseload regarding their willingness to participate. Those who signed informed consent forms were included in the study. The interview was designed to take about one client contact hour to complete, although staff members were encouraged to accommodate client needs should they have required more time or additional contacts to complete the interview. Research supporting the reliability and validity of self-reported trauma/PTSD in people with SMI is substantial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 2001</xref>). The documents and procedures for this survey were approved by the mental health center’s research review committee and by the Boston College Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p>

<sec id="section5-1049731511434832">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Lifetime stressful/traumatic events were measured using the Risky Behavior and Stressful Events scale (RBSES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>) which includes items drawn from research on trauma in both SMI and general population samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731511434832">Green, 1996</xref>; Kessler et al., 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731511434832">Norris, 1992</xref>). These items include experiences with the following: physical abuse, sexual abuse, seeing others harmed or killed, being involved in a serious accident, natural disasters, experiencing life-threatening illness, and sudden death of friend or loved one. Interviewers asked clients to estimate how many times each event occurred in their lifetime and how much distress they felt about the event at the time of the interview <italic>(none</italic> = 0, <italic>a little</italic> = 1, <italic>moderate</italic> = 2, <italic>much distress</italic> = 3, and <italic>extreme distress</italic> = 4). RBSES subscales have been shown to be internally consistent with Cronbach αs ranging from .72 to .80, and also shown to have good concurrent validity having correlated significantly and moderately with PTSD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511434832">2010</xref>). After identifying the “worst” trauma (a prerequisite prior to using a PTSD scale), the interviewer continued with the PSS-Interview version (PSS-I) which is comprised of 17 items corresponding to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria and has an excellent record of internal consistency, test–retest and interrater reliability as well as factorial and concurrent validity with other valid PTSD scales as well as with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria with a variety of populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731511434832">Foa, Cashman, Jaycox, &amp; Perry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511434832">Foa &amp; Tolin, 2000</xref>). Cronbach αs for a sample of 257 people with SMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>) were .88, .88, and .87 for re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal subscales, respectively, and the scale correlated positively and moderately with subjective distress from abuse-related trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>) and lifetime high-risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2010</xref>). Each of the 17 items is scored according to the following scale: 0 = <italic>not at all,</italic> 1 = <italic>once per week/a little,</italic> 2 = <italic>two or four times per week/somewhat,</italic> 3 = <italic>five or more times per week/very much</italic> with a potential total score ranging from 0 to 51. Subscale scores for re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and total PTSD score were summed. To meet <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria for PTSD, the client must be given a score of 1 or more (i.e., <italic>once per week</italic> or more) for 1 item to meet criteria for re-experiencing symptoms, 3 items for avoidance, and 2 items for hyperarousal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049731511434832">
<title>Statistical Analysis Plan</title>
<p>In Study #1, we examined correlations among the 17 items of the PSS with their respective subscales to identify those that correlated most strongly. This approach was chosen over using factor loadings for two reasons: (a) factor analytic solutions for the PSS-I, although reasonably comparable across different samples, have been shown to result in somewhat different factor solutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511434832">O’Hare, Shen, &amp; Sherrer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731511434832">Palmieri &amp; Hobfoll, 2005</xref>), not an uncommon outcome for other well-known scales as well; (b) for heuristic purposes, we wanted to develop a brief screen that would represent all three core symptom criteria (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal) in accordance with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. Second, we tested the new brief 3-item scale for internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α) and concurrent validity by correlating the brief version with the full PSS, rates of lifetime trauma, and the client’s total subjective distress related to their total trauma. Finally, we used ROC analysis to measure the area under the curve (AUC), that is, the overall accuracy of the Brief PSS, and also to determine the optimal cut point for the brief scale, that is, the optimal balance of detecting true positives (i.e., sensitivity) and true negatives (i.e., specificity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511434832">Johnson, Chipp, Brems, &amp; Neal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731511434832">Pintea &amp; Moldovan, 2009</xref>). Originally developed for electronic signal detection, ROC analysis has been increasingly used to assess the accuracy of medical and psychological tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511434832">Bredemeier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511434832">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). Analyses were conducted with statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) 19.0.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049731511434832">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 220 clients interviewed in Study #1, the following rates of one or more trauma were reported: physical abuse (53.5%), sexual abuse (44%), seeing someone close to you harmed or killed (21.2%), seeing other persons harmed or killed (20.2%), being involved in a life-threatening accident (45.3%), witnessing a life-threatening accident (29.8%), experiencing a natural disaster (43.5%), experiencing a life-threatening illness (37.3%), and experiencing the sudden death of a friend or loved one (79%). Because the number of times these events occurred in the lifetime of most of these individuals are relatively low (generally once or twice), these traumatic event categories were summed into a “total traumatic events” score (<italic>M</italic> = 29.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 55.7). Because the sum was also excessively skewed, we transformed it by taking the square root resulting in a skew &lt;2 in order to conduct parametric correlation analysis. Finally, mean score for total “subjective distress” showed a moderate positive skew (<italic>M</italic> = 4.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.37), but did not require transformation.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049731511434832">
<title>Correlating PSS-I Items and Subscales</title>
<p>The 17 PSS items were also somewhat positively skewed (&lt; 2 with the exception of Item #8 at 2.02), but distributions were adequate for Pearson correlation analysis with their respective subscales. The highest correlations between items and their respective subscales were as follows: Item 4 (…<italic>feeling emotionally upset when reminded of the trauma</italic>) for re-experiencing, <italic>r</italic> = .85<italic>, p &lt;</italic> .01; Item 10 (… <italic>feeling distant or cutoff from people around you since the trauma</italic>….) for avoidance, <italic>r</italic> = .86, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01, and Item 15 (… <italic>trouble concentrating … losing track … forgetting</italic>….) for hyperarousal, <italic>r</italic> = .85, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01.

<p>Cronbach’s α for the 3-item PSS-I is .81. Analysis by gender revealed comparable results (.77 for men, .82 for women). Descriptive statistics for the brief 3-item PSS-I scale revealed a moderate skew (<italic>M</italic> = 2.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.84, skew = .82, kurtosis = −.62), with a range of scores from 0 to 9. The Pearson correlation between the brief PSS-I and the full PSS-I is very high (<italic>r</italic> = .93, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01), again, with comparable results by gender (women: <italic>r</italic> = .92, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .94, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01). Correlations between the brief PSS-I and total reported lifetime trauma (<italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) and total self-reported “subjective distress” from trauma (<italic>r</italic> = .50, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) were moderate and show solid evidence for the concurrent validity of the brief PSS. These results were also comparable by gender for total trauma (women: <italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .39, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) and for subjective distress (women: <italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .52, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01). These associations were also comparable to correlations between the full 17-item PSS-I and total lifetime trauma (<italic>r</italic> = .35, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) and self-reported subjective distress (<italic>r</italic> = .53, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01), again, showing moderate positive correlations by gender for total trauma (women: <italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and subjective distress (women: <italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01).</p>

<title>ROC Analysis</title>
<p>Using the diagnostic coding of the PSS-I as the state condition (1 = <italic>positive for PTSD</italic>, 0 = <italic>negative</italic>) and the new 3-item brief PSS-I as the test variable, we found the AUC to be .96 supporting the conclusion that the brief 3-item PSS has excellent accuracy for detecting PTSD as measured by the diagnostic version of the PSS-I (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511434832">Figure 1</xref>
). Examination of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731511434832">Table 2</xref>
 suggests that a cut point of 3 would be optimal for yielding high sensitivity (i.e., detecting PTSD when it is present, i.e., the true positive rate) and high specificity (i.e., not detecting PTSD when it is not present, i.e., the true negative rate). For a cut score of 3, estimated sensitivity is 94.3% with a false positive rate (i.e., 1—specificity) of 14.7% (or, conversely, a specificity of 85.3%). A cut score of “2” would raise the chance of false positives considerably (i.e., reduce specificity) and not improve sensitivity substantially. A cut score of “4” would reduce sensitivity to 88.6%.</p>

<title>Study #2 Method</title>
<sec id="section12-1049731511434832">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Data for Study #2 were collected from four community mental health centers in southeastern New England from March to September in 2009. All clients met the same state eligibility criteria as clients who participated in Study #1. The original target sample was 500 clients. One hundred clients were selected from three centers and 200 from a center with a larger census. They were consecutively interviewed at intervals based on their routinely scheduled 6-month reassessments. Four hundred and sixty-six (93.2%) provided sufficiently useful data for the study. Analysis for this study began with a subsample of 327 clients who identified an index trauma, and who were diagnosed by staff psychiatrists with a primary Axis I SMI disorder: schizophrenia (85, 26.0%), schizoaffective (71, 21.7%), major depression (100, 30.6%), and bipolar I disorder (71, 21.7%). One hundred and seventy-three (52.9%) of these clients were female, and one hundred and fifty-three (46.8%) were male. Mean age (<italic>N</italic> = 327) was 47.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.23). The sample is about three-quarters White (240, 73.4%), followed by African American (33, 10.1%), Hispanic (30, 9.2), and the remaining clients identifying themselves as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, of mixed race, or not applicable each within a range of .5–2.0%. Median annual household income was $9,000, with most (288, 88.1%) covered by public health insurance, and the remainder by another third party insurance (9, 2.8%) or “no insurance” (18, 5.5%). One hundred and forty-three clients (66.2%) had completed high school or better. Most clients (308, 94.2%) had been hospitalized at least once in their lifetime for a mental health or substance use problem, and almost all (322, 98.5%) were taking psychiatric medication at the time of the study. Bivariate analyses showed no differences between the two study samples by gender, age, Axis I diagnosis, index trauma, or income, but did show statistically significant differences by race. The sample from Study #2 included more clients of color, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 1) = 24.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and also revealed that sample to have slightly less education (Study #1 sample: <italic>N</italic> = 215; <italic>M</italic> = 12.25 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.7; Study #2 sample: <italic>N</italic> = 314; <italic>M</italic> = 11.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.7).</p>
<p>In Study #2, the questionnaires were incorporated as part of routine care (which included all informed consent and confidentiality assurances) to improve overall assessment and 6-month evaluations. Data were then accessed for secondary analysis since the investigators were blind to client identities and were not directly involved with data collection. Procedures for the study were approved by each individual center as well as the IRB of Boston College.</p>

<sec id="section13-1049731511434832">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The five most frequently identified trauma items from the 2003 survey using the RBSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>) were used in the current study. These included physical abuse, sexual abuse, saw others injured (an item that combined military, home or crime situation), suffered a life-threatening injury, and experienced the unexpected death of a loved one. These items were measured using class interval scoring based on an examination of frequency distributions from Study #1. These class intervals are as follows<italic>: never, 1 time, 2–5 times, 6–10 times, more than 10 times.</italic> Midpoints of class intervals <italic>2–5 times (3.5) and 6–10 times (8)</italic> were used in subsequent analysis; 11 was used for <italic>more than 10,</italic> a conservative measure of lifetime occurrences, but a reasonable one based on examination of distributions from data from Study #1. To measure PTSD symptom severity, the exact same 3 items derived from the original PSS-I in Study #1 (i.e., Item #4, emotionally upset when reminded of the trauma, Item #10, feeling distant or cut off …, and Item #15, trouble concentrating…) were summed as the “brief PTSD screen” and used in the analysis that follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049731511434832">
<title>Statistical Analysis Plan</title>
<p>First, we tested the internal consistency of the scale (Cronbach’s α) to determine comparability to that in Study #1. In addition, we conducted a series of Pearson correlations to test for concurrent validity and compare these results with those found in Study #1. Finally, we compared results by gender in these analyses, which was conducted with SPSS 19.0.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049731511434832">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The percentages of clients from Study #2 reporting one or more traumatic events are as follows: physical abuse (52%); sexual abuse (37.3%); saw others harmed or killed (32.4%); experienced a life-threatening illness (36.4%); and, experienced the unexpected death of a loved one (76.5%). Other findings included: mean total traumatic events (<italic>M</italic> = 10.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.4, skew = 1.3) and total distress from trauma (<italic>M</italic> = 9.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.3, skew = 1.3). The Brief PSS scale again showed good internal consistency comparable to Study #1 (Cronbach’s α = .82), and was almost equal for women (.81) and men (.82).</p>
<p>Correlations between the Brief PSS and total trauma (<italic>r</italic> = .38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and total distress from trauma (<italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) were moderate and positive. By gender, the Brief PSS correlated moderately and positively for total lifetime trauma (women: <italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .39, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01) and for total subjective distress from trauma (women: <italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01; men: <italic>r</italic> = .52, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01). Overall, these correlations were comparable to their counterpart associations in Study #1.</p>

<sec id="section16-1049731511434832">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first brief PTSD screen developed for use with people who have SMI, a group with very high rates of trauma and PTSD compared with the general population (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1049731511434832">Appendix A</xref>). The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the 3-item Brief PSS-I (at a recommended cut score of 3) appear to be very good overall. The Brief PSS-I also shows very good internal consistency for a 3-item scale, and good concurrent validity when correlated with total trauma and subjective distress associated with trauma, factors that have been previously shown to correlate positively and moderately with the full PSS-I with SMI clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511434832">2010</xref>). Reliability and correlation analyses replicated well with these two independent samples as well as by gender, findings that also support the psychometric integrity of this brief scale.</p>
<p>In general, assessing and diagnosing PTSD with the SMI population is not without controversy. The construct validity of PTSD as a discrete disorder has provoked debate over the ambiguity surrounding the determination of what constitutes a “Criterion A” event (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511434832">Weathers &amp; Keane, 2007</xref>), given that an actuarial view of what events meet the threshold for “trauma” might not be congruent with how people appraise and react to stressful events in their lives. For example, although experiencing the unexpected death of a loved one might not objectively meet the standard intended by Criterion A, evidence with SMI clients suggests that the subjective distress associated with sudden interpersonal losses can be comparably correlated with PTSD symptom severity as are other events more traditionally considered to be traumatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731511434832">O’Hare &amp; Sherrer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also the problem of attributing PTSD symptoms to one trauma when the client reports multiple stressful/traumatic events that might also be of one or multiple types of trauma. It might be that cooccurring psychopathology and associated vulnerabilities to mood disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511434832">Brady &amp; Sinha, 2005</xref>), high cooccurrence between PTSD symptoms and other distress symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731511434832">Marshall, Schell, &amp; Miles, 2010</xref>), as well as a proneness for negative self-appraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511434832">Sherrer, 2011</xref>) all contribute to increased vulnerability in SMI clients to respond negatively to a range of adverse events that might or might not meet Criterion A standards.</p>
<sec id="section17-1049731511434832">
<title>Application to Social Work Practice</title>
<p>Social workers and other mental health practitioners should assess routinely for trauma and other stressful events, and minimally inquire about some of the more common traumatic events during both childhood and adulthood: physical and sexual abuse, sudden losses of loved ones, having witnessed or experienced violence in addition to routinely screening for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511434832">Cusack et al., 2006</xref>). Should there be initial evidence of trauma/PTSD, a full assessment should follow. It is understood that working under increasing pressures of cost-effectiveness often precludes the routine use of complete instrument batteries that assess for PTSD, substance abuse, and other important problems that frequently cooccur with SMI. However, using valid screens for PTSD and other problems can help quickly winnow potential target problems and set priorities for treatment planning. Since trauma and PTSD have been consistently associated with more severe psychiatric and psychosocial problems in SMI clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511434832">Mueser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511434832">O’Hare et al., 2010</xref>), undetected trauma and untreated PTSD could result in poorer outcomes overall.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049731511434832">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>This study is limited by the fact that Axis I chart diagnoses were utilized rather than a structured diagnostic interview. In addition, caution should be used in generalizing the results to non-White respondents. Although both samples were relatively large, they were not drawn randomly. There was also a slight difference in the two samples by race composition and a slight difference in level of education. Future studies using the Brief PSS with more diverse groups of SMI clients would serve an important role in replication. Finally, despite the fact that brief screens are designed for preliminary detection, there is no guarantee that the brief PSS will perform as well as the full PSS-I.</p>
