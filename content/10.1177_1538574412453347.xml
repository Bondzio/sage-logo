<abstract>
<p>It is well known that splenectomy is the standard of care in the management of clinically significant hypersplenism; however, some patients are found to be unacceptably high risk to tolerate open or even laparoscopic surgery. We present a 62-year-old female with significant comorbidities who was declared a very high risk for any open surgical intervention. She underwent splenic artery embolization with remarkable improvement of her platelet count. Her postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth hospital day.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypersplenism is a clinically significant problem when the cellular destructive function of the spleen is exaggerated; open splenectomy is the definitive standard of care regardless of the etiologies which can be of primary or secondary causes. In certain cases, open surgical intervention presents patients with an unacceptable risk of complications and mortality. There have been reported cases where partial splenic embolization has been effective as the sole treatment of thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412453347">1</xref> 2</sup> In this case report, a patient with chronic, symptomatic thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced cirrhosis, what was felt to be unacceptably high risk for an uncontrolled bleed via conventional abdominal surgical procedures, is presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574412453347">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 62-year-old female with a history of chronic pancytopenia secondary to hypersplenism was admitted to our facility with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts of 15 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. She was found to be in end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. This patient was classified as high risk for any surgical interventions secondary to her comorbidities, so the vascular surgery team was consulted for a splenic artery embolization.</p>
<p>Patient’s medical history was significant for morbid obesity, stage 4 chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and NASH with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. On physical examination, she was found to have 2 + bilateral lower extremity edema and bibasilar expiratory wheezing. In addition, she had multiple bruises on her body secondary to her thrombocytopenia. Urgent hemodialysis was indicated, but persistent thrombocytopenia, despite multiple platelets transfusions, remained a significant handicapping factor against immediate placement of a hemo or peritoneal dialysis port.</p>
<p>Via right common femoral artery approach, the celiac artery was accessed using a Cobra glide catheter. Over an angled Glidewire, a 4-F glide catheter was telescoped to the level of the splenic artery. A splenic artery arteriogram was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412453347">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Appropriate Gelfoam was used to embolize the splenic artery and distal branches. Repeat arteriogram showed sluggish flow through the splenic artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412453347">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the decision was made to proceed with coil embolization of the main splenic artery. Eight Tornado coils were deployed successfully; repeat splenic arteriogram showed occlusion of all segmental splenic arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412453347">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>She had no significant postoperative complaints. On postoperative day 6, her platelets count tripled to 66 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Afterword, a Perm-A-Cath was placed. She continued to do well and was discharged to a long-term acute care facility because of complex medical needs. </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypersplenism is a familiar sequelae of portal hypertension which can occur in certain types of liver diseases. Presumably, as the size of the spleen increases, its intrinsic activities are unregulated with subsequent sequestration and destruction of the platelets. The result is varying degrees of trilineage pancytopenia dependent on the degree of hypersplenism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412453347">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Splenectomy has been shown to be an effective means of treatment of thrombocytopenia. A study conducted by the Mayo Clinic in 2001, covering a 6.6-year follow-up from splenectomy, 64% of the study participants had either a partial or a complete response with 50% requiring additional medical therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412453347">4</xref>
</sup> Indications for a splenectomy in a nontraumatic setting include blood dyscrasias, splenic tumors, and symptomatic relief of hypersplenism secondary to chronic illnesses (ie, portal hypertension, chronic myeloid leukemia, and Gaucher disease).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412453347">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412453347"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412453347"/>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412453347"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412453347">9</xref>
</sup> Splenectomy is associated with a rise in platelets of 137 ± 52 in the first year and the need for platelet transfusions are significantly decreased compared with preoperative amounts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412453347">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Splenic artery partial embolization (SAPE) may play a role and preserve splenic immune function and improve blood counts. Incomplete ablation of splenic parenchyma would serve to decrease the activities of splenic sequestration yet leave enough tissue to preserve the spleen’s immunologic activities. This would help resolve the pancytopenia in these patients. Splenic artery partial embolization would also avoid the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis by encapsulated bacterium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412453347">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our patient, with an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) class IV preoperative risk,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412453347">7</xref>
</sup> was not a viable candidate for open splenectomy. She was not also a candidate for laprascopic splenectomy due to the presence of portal hypertension and the elevated size of the spleen. Therefore, pursuing a minimally invasive procedure to deal with her hypersplenic thrombocytopenia was felt to be warranted. Our technique of using Gelfoam thrombin spray followed by coil embolization was very effective in controlling the parenchymal and segmental splenic arterial bed. Upon immediate follow-up, the patient’s platelet count was doubled and then tripled in few days. </p>
<p>There have been few case reports/case series in the literature regarding the use of SAPE for treatment of symptomatic hypersplenism. Most of these have been anecdotal international cases with mixed results. In the United States, there have been 2 reports of SAPE use in hypersplenism.</p>
<p>Pinto et al published a case report using a femoral approach to catheterization of the splenic artery using 250 to 350 μm polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles to achieve nearly 60% embolization of splenic parenchyma. This was done in a patient who needed stereotactic injection of radioactive P32 into a craniopharyngioma. However, this procedure was delayed secondary to a platelet count of 40 × 1000/mm<sup>3</sup> due to hypersplenism as a result of hepatic cirrhosis caused by chronic alcohol abuse and potential concomitant NASH. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 4 but was soon readmitted secondary to fever and chills with lung infiltrates which responded well to antibiotics. At postoperative day 7, the platelet count rose to &gt;100 × 1000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Then, at postoperative day 20, platelet count reached 250 × 1000/mm<sup>3</sup>. This increase in count was sustained in the follow-up period of 85 days. The patient was then able to undergo radioactive P32 injection without complications.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Sockrider et al reported a case series of 6 patients undergoing SAPE as an alternative to open or laparoscopic splenectomy. Three patients were status-post orthotopic liver transplantation with persistent hypersplenism. The other 3 patients had hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension but were still awaiting liver transplant. All the patients had thrombocytopenia, platelet counts below 50 000, and neutropenia, and this research group selectively embolized the lower pole of the spleen using a percutaneous femoral artery approach. In the first 2 cases, Cook microcoils were delivered via target tracker catheter, which was successful in the first case; however, in subsequent case, long-term occlusion was inadequate. The PVA (contor) particles sized 355 to 500 μm provided more reliable occlusion of vessels in the other cases reported. No more than 25% to 30% of the spleen was targeted to be occluded. In all 6 patients, no procedure-related complications were evident and postembolization syndrome (fever, left upper quadrant pain, small left pleural effusion, and leukocytosis) was well controlled with oral or intravenous analgesics. Mean platelet counts improved from 34 to 157 in the pretransplant group and from 25 to 157 in the posttransplant group. There was also a sustained resolution of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia during the 26-month- and 37-month follow-up periods in the pretransplant and posttransplant groups, respectively.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Splenic artery partial embolization, as a sole treatment for hypersplenism, may be effective in select groups of high-risk patients who had significant trilineage pancytopenia as a result of increased splenic sequestration. These patients, due to their multiple medical risk factors, are not candidates for the current standard of care—open or laparoscopic splenectomy. Multicenter prospective studies are warranted to characterize the durability and effectiveness of this technique.</p>
