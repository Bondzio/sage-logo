<abstract>
<p>Multifocal progressive leukoencephalopathy (PML) is associated with JC virus (JCV) seropositivity, past immunosuppression, and natalizumab treatment for two years or more. The aim of our study was to investigate the rate of treatment discontinuation after stratifying for the three risk factors in a group of 104 natalizumab-treated patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. We investigated JCV serological status in our population. We then divided patients into groups according to their PML risk. Treatment indication was reassessed. Of the patients, 64 (61.5%) were JCV seropositive. Amongst seropositive patients on natalizumab for 2 years or more, 10 had received immunosuppression (group A), and 38 had not (group B). After an informed and shared decision-making process, 6/10 (60%) from group A compared with 9/38 (23.7%) from group B discontinued treatment (<italic>p</italic>=0.027). In groups A and B, discontinuation also depended upon doctors’ views (<italic>p</italic>=0.019, group A; <italic>p</italic>=0.010, group B) and clinical outcomes (<italic>p</italic>=0.021, group A). No-one from low–intermediate risk groups discontinued. The decision to discontinue natalizumab treatment is complex, even when clear PML risk rates are described. Clinical outcomes and doctors’ idiosyncrasies play a crucial part in patients’ final choice.</p>

<p>Despite its proven efficacy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512439238">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512439238"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512439238">3</xref></sup> the use of natalizumab in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has been restricted due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512439238">4</xref></sup> By July 2011, 145 cases of PML had been reported, being fatal in around 20%, and causing moderate and severe disability in around 50% and 37% of the remaining, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512439238">5</xref></sup> Until January 2012, 201 cases of PML had been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov">www.fda.gov</ext-link>, accessed February 8, 2012).</p>
<p>PML risk in natalizumab-treated patients depends on prior exposure to JC virus (JCV), which occurs in 50–60% of all individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512439238">6</xref></sup> natalizumab treatment duration, and past history of immunosuppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512439238">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512439238">5</xref></sup> According to a statistical algorithm presented in April 2011,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512439238">7</xref></sup> which showed the risk stratification for PML depending on these three risk factors, JCV seronegative patients had an estimated annualised risk of PML lower than 0.11/1000, whereas PML risk in JCV seropositive patients ranged from 0.35/1000 to 8.1/1000 depending on the presence of the other risk factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512439238">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we performed a systematic determination of anti-JCV antibodies in our natalizumab-treated patients, after obtaining their written informed consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512439238">8</xref></sup> Subsequently, we informed them about their JCV serological status and estimated PML risk, giving them the opportunity to discontinue natalizumab if they considered their risk was higher than acceptable.</p>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>We included consecutive patients receiving natalizumab who had been tested for anti-JCV antibodies and provided with information about their JCV status at the time of the study. We divided them into groups, depending on their estimated PML risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512439238">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512439238">Table 1</xref>). Treatment indication was then reassessed, and a decision whether to stop or to continue on therapy was reached following an informed and shared decision-making approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512439238">9</xref></sup> Such an approach meant that all patients were given evidence-based written information about their individual PML risk, which depended on the presence of past immunosuppression and natalizumab treatment duration, as well as information about the risks of discontinuing natalizumab treatment. This information had been previously discussed and agreed in our ordinary clinical meetings. Afterwards, patients –generally together with their relatives or friends – thoroughly discussed it with the neurologist responsible for the visit in each case and, after the discussion, both parties reached an agreement regarding the decision to stop natalizumab or not.</p>
<p>First, we studied variables possibly involved in the decision to stop treatment, such as JCV serological status, treatment duration, previous immunosuppression (chi-square tests).</p>
<p>Second, after allowing for known PML risk factors and considering only patients from groups where discontinuation was observed, we analysed whether variables such as gender, age, disease duration, number of natalizumab doses, last Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512439238">10</xref></sup> assessment, changes in EDSS scores from natalizumab onset to present, and the neurologist involved in the informed and shared decision-making process (from a total of six) were significantly associated with treatment discontinuation (univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512439238" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Some 104 consecutive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) were included. None refused to be tested for anti-JCV antibodies. Of these patients, 64 (61.5%) were JCV seropositive and 40 (38.5%), seronegative. Amongst JCV seropositive patients on natalizumab for 2 years or more, 10 had also received previous immunosuppression (group A), and 38 had not (group B) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512439238">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>All JCV-seronegative patients and those JCV seropositive on natalizumab for less than 2 years decided to continue treatment. However, 6/10 patients (60%) from group A (with highest PML risk) and 9/38 (23.7%) from group B (with second-highest PML risk) preferred to discontinue (discontinuation in A vs. B: <italic>p</italic>=0.027).</p>
<p>As expected, natalizumab discontinuation was associated with JCV seropositivity (<italic>p</italic>=0.001), treatment duration longer than 2 years (<italic>p</italic>=0.013), and previous immunosuppression (<italic>p</italic>=0.019). Considering only groups A and B, where treatment discontinuation was observed, and allowing for the presence of previous immunosuppression, the neurologist involved in the decision-making process was significantly associated with treatment discontinuation (<italic>p</italic>=0.019 (group A), and <italic>p</italic>=0.010 (group B)). In addition, in group A, patients who discontinued natalizumab had experienced a worse EDSS evolution over the treatment period than patients who continued (<italic>p</italic>=0.021) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512439238">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Multivariate analyses merging groups A and B, adjusting for previous immunosuppression and the individual neurologist involved, showed that patients with a worse EDSS evolution over the treatment period tended to discontinue more (OR (95%CI): 5.31 (0.84, 33.39), <italic>p</italic>=0.075) than patients with a better evolution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512439238" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Treatment discontinuation happened in 60% of patients with highest PML risk (group A) and in 23.7% of patients with the second-highest PML risk (group B). Lack of reference data on natalizumab discontinuation after knowing patients’ individualised PML risk hampers categorisation of this figure as high or low. As expected, JCV serological status, treatment duration, and past immunosuppression influenced the decision to stop treatment. Interestingly, other factors not related to PML risk, such as EDSS changes during natalizumab treatment and the individual neurologist involved in the decision-making process, also played a role.</p>
<p>With regard to EDSS changes over natalizumab treatment, patients who stopped treatment had experienced a worse EDSS evolution than patients who continued. However, EDSS changes only became significant within the group with the highest PML risk (group A), indicating that an unfavourable benefit–risk balance during treatment was probably crucial to the decision. In the multivariate analysis, the influence of EDSS changes over the treatment period only showed a trend towards significance, possibly due to the low numbers and the fact that this influence was mainly present in a small subgroup (group A) of our population.</p>
<p>As regards the influence of the individual neurologist involved in the decision-making process, although regular clinical meetings had been held to decide what information should be given to patients, our results suggest that physicians’ individual idiosyncrasies are critical in all informed and shared decisions. A limitation of our study derives from the fact that no specific variables related to the neurologist idiosyncrasy such as age, years of experience in medical practice or other patient-related variables such as personality traits, psychiatric co-morbidities or formal neuropsychological testing were considered for our analysis. Thus, it is not possible to further clarify which factors conditioned the decision to stop treatment. The decision was a product of an exclusive doctor–patient relationship, where both parties had to reach an agreement. It is here important to highlight that, to date, in our unit we have not encountered any case of PML, and it is therefore very likely that this has influenced patients’ and doctors’ point of view. Furthermore, the lack of real alternatives to natalizumab for these patients, in our setting and at the time of the study, made our patients more likely to continue on natalizumab treatment than otherwise.</p>
<p>Widespread extrapolation of the present results is limited, as they are linked to the cultural background of our population. A further limitation is that our results reflect a situation that is constantly changing, since new data on PML risk may appear, and the range of alternative drugs to natalizumab will soon be increased.</p>
