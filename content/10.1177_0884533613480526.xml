<body>
<p>Nutrition professionals choose to publish papers in journals for a variety of reasons. It may be a personal aspiration, a job requirement, or a path to career advancement. However, writing and submitting an article does not always result in publication. For every article published, several more are rejected for publication. Writing is not an inherent ability, but a skill that can develop with mentoring and practice. The purpose of this article is to identify necessary steps to plan, write, submit, and publish a journal article and to outline strategies to improve chances of eventual publication.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533613480526">
<title>Obstacles to Writing</title>
<p>Lack of mentors, experience, and time are common obstacles to successful writing and publishing; however, you can overcome these barriers with determination and persistence. To begin the process of learning to write, read scientific literature. Examine the language and format of papers written in top-tier journals so you can identify characteristics of a well-written paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613480526">1</xref></sup> Seek a mentor who is an experienced writer and is willing to tutor or coauthor with you.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613480526">2</xref></sup> Ask for feedback on your writing projects and invite your mentor to critically review your papers before you submit them for publication. Seek opportunities to write for newsletters, patient handouts, blogs, websites, or other print materials to practice and hone your writing skills. Rather than saying “I don’t have time to write,” make an effort to set aside time, whether a few minutes or a few hours, to write. Few clinicians have protected time to write; the reality for many clinicians is that they must write after work hours or at home.</p>
<p>Once you have overcome these obstacles, you can start the process of writing and publishing. This process is not a single step but a series of steps, including planning, writing, submitting, revising, resubmitting, and proofing, before a paper reaches final publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0884533613480526">
<title>Planning a Journal Article</title>
<p>Before you begin to write, you should spend a significant amount of time planning to write. First, you need to select a topic. The topic may already be chosen for you if you are preparing to write a research paper or if you have been invited by a journal to author a paper. Nonetheless, you should choose a topic in which you have great interest or expertise, or it will be a chore to write. You must also think about why you want to share this information and if the topic is relevant and timely. In other words, “So what?” So what if you don’t publish this information? Why is it important to publish on this topic? Do you have something to say?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613480526">1</xref></sup> You must also consider your reading audience and what messages you need to address in the article to meet their needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613480526">3</xref></sup> Finally, focus on why you are writing. Is it to share research findings, summarize a state of the art, or challenge a well-held belief?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613480526">3</xref></sup> Once you have determined the answers to these questions, you can begin to formulate your topic.</p>
<p>The next part of planning is conducting a literature search. This step will already be completed if you are authoring a research paper because you would have needed to conduct a literature review to outline the study design. Conducting a literature review is vital to the success of your paper and serves at least 2 purposes. First, you need to know what has already been written on this topic. You want to publish new information, not rehash what has already been written. Second, the scientific literature is the foundation on which you will build your article.</p>
<sec id="section3-0884533613480526">
<title>Identify the Right Journal</title>
<p>Before you write an article, identify the journal to which you will submit your article. Do not skip this step because submitting to a journal that is a not a good fit for your manuscript is one of the main reasons a paper is rejected for publication. To select a journal that will be a good fit for your paper, identify a few options and then look at the journals and their websites to investigate the aims, vision, readership, and editorial board of the journals as well as the types of articles they publish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613480526">3</xref></sup> You can also contact the editor if you have questions about a journal. Another factor that may be important to authors is the “prestige factor” of a journal. It is difficult to have a paper accepted for publication in exclusive journals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613480526">1</xref></sup> If you submit a manuscript to a top-tier journal and it is rejected, you still have the option to submit your paper to another journal; however, publication of your results will be delayed. Many authors choose to forgo a high-impact journal for one that is a good fit for their manuscript and where their paper has a good chance of being accepted. Other factors to consider when choosing a journal include the journal’s average time to complete the review and return a decision as well as any submission fees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613480526">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533613480526">
<title>Obtain Author Guidelines</title>
<p>Another reason to identify a journal early in the writing stage is so you can obtain author guidelines before you write your paper. Author guidelines provide instructions on how to format your paper. It is vital to follow those guidelines exactly because some journals will not even review your manuscript if it does not comply with their guidelines. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533613480526">Table 1</xref> summarizes common components addressed by journal guidelines for authors.</p>

<tr>
<td>Title page</td>
<td>Some journals use blinded review, in which case author names and institutions should not appear on the title page. Read the guidelines to determine what information the journal wants to appear on a title page.</td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>After the title, this is the second-most read section of the paper. It is important to write an accurate and concise abstract. In addition, PubMed truncates abstracts at 250 words, so do not exceed this limit.</td>

<tr>
<td>Disclosures, permissions, and acknowledgments</td>
<td>Most journals require authors to disclose any conflicts of interest or financial ties related to the article. Permissions to adapt or reprint previously published tables or figures are required; journals will have various methods by which to obtain or forward those permissions to their journal. Acknowledgments are allowed by most journals.</td>

<sec id="section5-0884533613480526">
<title>Determine the Type of Article</title>
<p>The final step in planning your paper is to determine what type of paper you want to write. This will dictate the components and length of the paper. Many journals publish various types of articles. The categories of manuscripts for <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>) include Review, Clinical Research, Clinical Observations, Techniques and Procedures, Pivotal Paper, Clinical Controversy, Clinical Dilemma, Invited Commentary, and Letter to the Editor. An explanation of these types of articles and author guidelines can be accessed from <italic>NCP</italic>’s website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncp.sagepub.com/">http://ncp.sagepub.com/</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Writing a Journal Article</title>
<sec id="section7-0884533613480526">
<title>Getting Started</title>
<p>If you have planned carefully and completed all the steps discussed in the previous section, you can begin writing. It is important to set a schedule and follow any deadlines given to you by a journal. Some writers need large blocks of time to write, while others use smaller bits of time to write a paper in sections, a process referred to as “chunking.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613480526">4</xref></sup> You must find the method that works for you and plan time to write.</p>
<p>Using an outline can be advantageous because it ensures you cover all the topics you need to include and acts as a map to guide writing. According to Albarran and Scholes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613480526">3</xref></sup> the most common writing mistakes involve lack of a clear and logical structure, obvious aim of the article, and in-depth literature review. Thus, starting with an outline will assist in avoiding these mistakes and help you present a focused message.</p>
<p>When you actually begin to write, complete your first draft as soon as you can. Pay attention to content rather than grammar and spelling at this point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613480526">5</xref></sup> Do not spend time to make it “look good” the first time around; just get your thoughts on paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613480526">2</xref></sup> You can rewrite and rephrase the paper to improve word choices, sentence structure, and unity between paragraphs later.</p>

<title>Include Key Parts of an Article</title>

<title>Write Concisely and Correctly</title>
<p>When you write a manuscript, keep it short and sweet. Don’t take 6 sentences to say what you can say in one or two. Keep sentences and punctuation simple. Avoid one-sentence paragraphs; unify paragraphs and tie thoughts together so that there is a good flow to the paper. Avoid jargon and spell out all abbreviations with first use. Write in the first person rather than in the third person and write in an active rather than a passive voice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613480526">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613480526">6</xref></sup> Be sure to use correct grammar and punctation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613480526">3</xref></sup> Finally, do not repeat information in the text that is already in a table or figure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0884533613480526">
<title>Follow Ethical Writing Principles</title>
<p>When you write a paper, you must also adhere to ethical principles related to authorship, disclosure, plagiarism, copyright laws, duplication, redundancy, accuracy, and confidentiality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613480526">7</xref></sup> It is much better to follow ethical principles from the outset rather than to publish an article that is later found to have crossed ethical boundaries requiring a withdrawal of the article from the literature with a notification to readers.</p>
<p>Authors listed on a manuscript should include only those who have contributed significantly to the design, implementation, analysis, and writing of the paper. The first author should be the one who had the most involvement in the research and writing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613480526">8</xref></sup> Some journals require authors to identify how they were involved in the paper; “honorary” authorship is discouraged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613480526">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613480526">7</xref></sup> It is important that each listed author be actively involved in the study or review, writing or editing of the paper, and approval of the final version of the paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613480526">8</xref></sup> Because the order of authors listed on a paper can be a point of contention among authors, it should be discussed and agreed upon at the outset and revisited at the time of submission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613480526">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Authors need to disclose any financial or personal relationships that could be interpreted as causing bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613480526">7</xref></sup> Potential conflicts with sponsor-supported research or financial aid for studies should also be disclosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613480526">8</xref></sup> It is up to the journal and editor as to whether those disclosures are published.</p>
<p>Most authors are aware that plagiarism is unethical. However, authors are not always aware of what constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism encompasses not only copying text verbatim from another source but also paraphrasing someone else’s work without citing the source (including material from grants or articles written in another language) and plagiarizing one’s own work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613480526">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613480526">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613480526">9</xref></sup> Self-plagiarism involves copying or reusing your work from a previous article (including research grants, book chapters, or other articles) without adequate citation or permission from the publisher.</p>
<p>Copyright infringement is another serious offense. Copying or adapting sections of text, tables, and figures requires permission from the original journal in which it was published. Even if you authored the original table or figure, the journal that published the article containing the table or figure usually owns the copyright to that item. Most journals and publishers have websites where you can submit permission requests. Sometimes journals charge a fee to grant reprint permissions; authors are generally responsible for paying the fee. Seek permissions early in the writing phase because the editor will hold a paper from publication or remove figures and tables if permissions are not received on time.</p>
<p>Authors also need to avoid duplication and redundancy of manuscripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613480526">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613480526">7</xref></sup> Authors should not submit an article to more than one journal at a time. Submitting a paper that is the same or very similar to another published article is also considered unethical. Redundant publications repeat information from a previous paper without adding any new information. Another practice that is discouraged is “salami” publishing in which an author submits several manuscripts based on one study with each paper reporting only one part of the results. In some cases, it is logical to separate a study into smaller parts for reporting. However, if this is done, the author should cite the original work in follow-up papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613480526">4</xref></sup> Another questionable practice involves combining data from a published study with additional data to form a paper when there is really not enough new data to warrant another paper. These papers have been referred to as “meat extenders.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613480526">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be apparent that submitting fraudulent data is unethical. Few realize, however, that false data not only affect the results of the original study but can corrupt further research based on principles or techniques in the flawed paper.</p>
<p>It is of utmost importance that confidentiality of patients be upheld. Most journals, including <italic>NCP</italic>, require any study involving humans or animals be completed under the auspices of an institutional review board (IRB) or local animal care and use committee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613480526">6</xref></sup> Even reports based on retrospective quality control studies require IRB approval when patient data are involved. Gaining IRB approval should be done before any data are collected and analyzed.</p>
<p>There are several authoritative sources on publication ethics. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) publishes the <italic>Code of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613480526">10</xref></sup> COPE also publishes flowcharts to help editors deal with ethical issues such as redundancy or plagiarism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613480526">11</xref></sup> The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) publishes <italic>Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publications</italic>, which includes a section titled “Publication Ethics: Sponsorship, Authorship, and Accountability.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613480526">12</xref></sup> Finally, the Council of Science Editors has a <italic>White Paper on Promoting Integrity in Scientific Journal Publications</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613480526">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section11-0884533613480526">
<title>Submitting a Journal Article</title>
<p>Once you have written your paper, it is vital to review and revise it. Then review and revise it again. When you have scrutinized the paper thoroughly, give it to a mentor or friend to read and critique it. Then, revise your manuscript again. Once you and your coauthors are satisfied with the content and format of the paper, it is time to submit it.</p>
<p>If you obtained journal guidelines at the outset of writing your paper, you should have already formatted the paper as required by the journal with regard to title page, blinding of author or institution names, abstract length, keywords, font type and size, margin width, reference style, and page numbering. Follow the author guidelines exactly. Some papers are returned to the authors just for the simple fact that the authors did not adhere to the guidelines. This delays the review process.</p>
<p>Most journals, including <italic>NCP</italic>, use a web-based submission site whereby authors submit their manuscripts online. Include a cover letter stating that you are submitting your article to that journal for consideration of publication. The cover letter should include a conflict of interest statement, notice of ethical principles of research, and copyright transfer unless the journal provides forms for you to complete that contain this information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613480526">8</xref></sup> Adhere to the requirements for tables and figures. Figures will often be submitted separately from the manuscript and usually are required to meet journal specifications for file type and resolution.</p>
<sec id="section12-0884533613480526">
<title>Peer Review Process</title>
<p>After submission, you should receive acknowledgment from the journal that your manuscript was received. Now you must wait while your manuscript undergoes peer review. At <italic>NCP</italic>, we employ a double-blind review process. The editor invites reviewers with expertise in the topic area to critically review the paper. Some journals ask authors to suggest reviewers. If you recommend reviewers, be sure that they can give a fair and unbiased review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0884533613480526">
<title>Editorial Decision</title>
<p>On the basis of the reviewer comments and recommendations, the editor will make a final decision about the paper. Rarely is a paper accepted outright; it is usually returned for revision. Some papers require 2 or 3 revisions before they are accepted for publication. Other papers may undergo revisions but eventually be rejected because the revisions still cannot overcome flaws in the paper or study design. If the editor invites you to revise and resubmit the paper, look at the reviewer comments carefully and make revisions. You do not have to make every revision suggested; however, if you do not, you need to explain in a rebuttal what you changed, what you did not change, and why. Ultimately, it is the author’s prerogative to determine which changes to make. However, it is the editor’s decision whether or not to publish the paper. If you submit a revision, make sure to return it by the designated deadline.</p>
<p>If your paper is rejected, don’t give up. More papers are rejected than are accepted. What you do with the paper at this point is up to you. Ask yourself, “Why was it rejected? Is the paper salvageable?” Read the reviewers’ comments with an open mind. Think of the reviewers’ comments as a gift intended to improve your paper.

<title>Publishing a Journal Article</title>
<p>If your article is accepted for publication, you will need to sign a transfer of copyright form if not done earlier in the submission process. As part of the publishing process, manuscripts are often edited by a professional copy editor for grammar and punctuation. Once the manuscript has been typeset, you will receive a galley to proof. You should not make major changes to the paper at this point. Instead, review data for accuracy and search for typos and grammatical errors. Check headings, tables, figures, and references. Authors are usually given only a couple of days to review their galley and return it with comments. Many journals, including <italic>NCP</italic>, publish articles online before they are available in the print form. This allows for rapid dissemination of information. The prerelease of articles is accessible at the <italic>NCP</italic> website in the OnlineFirst section.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Someone once told me that you (as a writer) are only as good as your worst publication. I think the point of that statement is that you should not submit a paper unless you have put your best effort into writing it. The quality of a paper is often a reflection of the amount of time you spent planning and writing it. As detailed in this Commentary, writing for publication is a not a single step but a process that includes planning, writing, submitting, revising, resubmitting, and proofing. Developing good writing skills involves seeking mentors and opportunities to write. However, if you have the passion or desire to publish, it is possible to develop the “write” skills.</p>
