<abstract>
<p>Citric acid (CA) is the most important organic acid used in the food and other industries. <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> is an insect species, which has rich nutritional composition (especially protein) and cultivated in some countries. Therefore, the present study investigated the usability of hydrolysate extract of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass as substrate for the production of CA from <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> MT-4. The insect extract (IE) was found to be rich in ash (34.9 g/100 g), protein (35.6 g/100 g) and mineral contents. Yeast extract was found to be the most favorable substrate for biomass production, whereas the maximum production of CA (41.8 g/L) was achieved in the medium containing IE. Besides, uniform pellets with the smallest size (4 mm) were observed in IE medium. It was thought that rich magnesium (6.78 g/100 g) and manganese (1.14 g/100 g) contents of IE increased the production of CA, resulting in the formation of small uniform pellets. This is the first report on the effect of protein-rich insect biomasses on the production of CA. In this regard, <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass was tested for the first time as a CA-production substrate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Citric acid (CA), an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is extensively used in food preparations, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. About 70% CA is used in the food industry and remaining 30% in other industries. CA is used as an acidity regulator and flavor enhancer in food industry, particularly in the production of beverages. Nowadays, CA is also increasingly utilized as a monomer for the manufacture of biodegradable polymers that are widely used in various medical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436646">Dhillon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436646">Lazar et al., 2011</xref>). Due to its numerous applications, global production of CA has reached 1.7 million tonnes per year as estimated by Business Communications Co. (http://www.bccresearch.com). The most commonly used microorganism for the industrial production of CA is the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, which is grown in solid state or submerged fermentation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436646">Lazar et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the recent years, waste materials of plant origin, such as apple pomace, citrus peels, banana peels, corn husks and molasses starchy materials, have been used as low-cost substrates, mainly carbon sources, in submerged or solid cultures of<italic> A. niger</italic> strains for the production of CA. Especially, several attempts have been made to produce CA using molasses, which is preferred due its low cost and high sugar content (40–55%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436646">Dhillon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233712436646">Hang and Woodams, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748233712436646">Vandenberghe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748233712436646">Vendruscolo et al., 2008</xref>). Some investigators also reported that organic materials such as horn and shrimp wastes could be used as a substrate for the production of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436646">Kurbanoglu and Kurbanoglu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233712436646">Rao et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Edible insects have played an important role in the long history of human nutrition in Africa, Asia and Latin America. More than 1000 species of insects that are edible in a certain stage of their life cycle have been reported worldwide as traditional foods by humans and been an important part of the nutritional intake and economic value of many societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712436646">Cerritos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233712436646">Raksakantong et al., 2010</xref>). They have very high crude protein content, and insect proteins have been reported to be a good source of essential amino acids, equivalent or even superior to soy protein. They are also very rich in terms of fat, vitamin and mineral contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436646">Longvah et al., 2011</xref>). Of these insects, grasshoppers are widely studied mainly because of their economic importance in many parts of the world. The famous member of the grasshoppers, the migratory locust (<italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>) Linnaeus (Orthoptera: Acrididae) is widely distributed in many parts of the world such as Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712436646">Cerritos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233712436646">Metcalf and Metcalf, 1993</xref>). <italic>L. migratoria</italic> is one of the most useful and commonly laboratory-reared species. It is cultivated in European countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Turkey, and sold to many countries as alive. It is estimated that <italic>L. migratoria</italic> will also be produced massively for human consumption in the very near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436646">Hinks and Erlandson, 2004</xref>). However, to our best knowledge, there is no report about the other employment fields of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> despite its rich nutritional composition, mainly protein content. In this context, conversion of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass into a microbial fermentation substrate can be one of the answers to reduce the total price of the microbial culture media as well as an environmentally friendly method for removing these residues.</p>
<p>Therefore, the present study was mainly performed to generate the extract from <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass by acid hydrolysis and to elucidate the usability of this extract as a substrate for the production of CA in the submerged culture of <italic>A. niger</italic>.</p>

<title>Preparation of IE</title>
<p>In the present study, the insects whose average lengths were 13–15 cm were used. Their biomasses were dried at 105°C and then ground with a blender (Waring Products Corp., New York City, New York, USA). This material with 1 mm diameter was termed as insect flour (IF). First, 100 g of IF was hydrolyzed with 200 mL of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. The neutralization of the obtained acidic hydrolysate was performed using the alkaline solution containing 40 g/L KOH, 40 g/L Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> and 4 g/L Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The production scheme of insect extract (IE) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233712436646">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Chemical analysis of IE</title>
<p>Total sugar content of IE was determined according to the anthrone method using glucose as a standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436646">Hodge and Hofreiter, 1962</xref>). The protein, fat and ash contents of IE and commercial peptones were determined according to AOAC methods 984.13, 920.39 and 924.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712436646">AOAC, 1990</xref>). The nitrogen content was measured using a micro-kjeldahl apparatus (Labconco, Labconco Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri, USA), and the total protein was estimated by multiplying nitrogen content by 6.25. Crude fat was determined by Soxhlet extraction method in a Soxhlet apparatus using diethyl ether as a solvent. Ash was determined by combustion of dry sample in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne 62700; Barnstead/Thermolyne Corp., Dubuque, Iowa, USA). The concentrations of macroelements and microelements were determined using an inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Optima 2100 DV, ICP/OES, Shelton, Connecticut, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712436646">Mertens, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712436646">2005b</xref>).</p>

<title>Isolation of <italic>A. niger </italic>strains</title>
<p><italic>A. niger </italic>strains were isolated from various soil samples. In brief, 1 g of soil sample was suspended in 10 mL sterile-saline water. The obtained suspension was diluted up to 10<sup>−3</sup> with sterile-saline water. One milliliter of the suspension was plated on petri dish containing 20 mL of molasses agar medium (MAM). In order to prepare this agar medium, 20 g of agar was dissolved in 1 L molasses solution containing 50 g of sucrose. The sucrose concentration in molasses solution was adjusted to 50 g/L with deionized water. The medium pH was adjusted to 4.5. The inoculated petri dishes were incubated at 30°C for 6 days. At the end of this incubation period, colonies having wider diameter (fast-growing colonies) were picked up, subcultured and purified.</p>

<sec id="section6-0748233712436646">
<title>Preparation of inoculum and the screening of strains</title>
<p>The isolates were initially grown at 30°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants. At the end of 6 days of incubation period, 10 mL of sterile saline water (0.9% NaCl) was added to culture slant of each isolate and these slants were vortexed. The final concentration of each spore suspension was adjusted to about 10<sup>6</sup> spores per mL with sterile-saline water. One milliliter of the homogenized spore suspension was inoculated into 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of molasses broth medium (MBM). The medium contained only molasses solution (sucrose concentration was 50 g/L, pH 4.5). The flasks were incubated at 30°C and at 200 r/min in a shaking incubator (ZHWY-200B, Zhicheng Analytical Co., Shanghai, China). At the end of 6 days of incubation period, maximum production of CA was achieved with the strain MT-4, and it was therefore used for subsequent experiments. The taxonomic identification of the most productive isolate was made using mature cultures on standard PDA plates at 30°C in order to ensure a good development of taxonomic-relevant features and following the identification keys provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748233712436646">Von Arx (1981</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712436646">Domsch et al. (1993</xref>). Observations for the identification were made by staining the isolated fungus using lactophenol cotton blue and examination under low-power microscope.</p>

<title>Production of CA with <italic>A. niger</italic> MT-4 in the molasses extract medium</title>
<p>The production experiments were performed in molasses IE medium (MIEM) containing molasses solution and IE. For this, 1 mL of the spore suspension of <italic>A. niger</italic> MT-4 was inoculated into a 250-mL flask containing 100 mL of MIEM. The flask was incubated at 30°C and 200 r/min for 6 days in a shaking incubator. The preliminary experiments were undertaken to determine the optimal concentrations of IE. Subsequently, IE was compared with two organic nitrogen sources (bacto peptone (BP) and yeast extract (YE)) at the same concentration. To do this, BP or YE was added to the molasses medium instead of IE. The media containing BP and YE were termed as molasses BP medium (MBPM) and molasses YE medium (MYEM), respectively.</p>

<title>Analysis of fermentation parameters</title>
<p>First, 10 mL of the sample taken from each culture broth was centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 15 min. One milliliter of the obtained clear supernatant was suitably diluted and then spectrophotometrically analyzed for the determination of CA concentration according to the modified method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436646">Marier and Boulet (1958</xref>). For this, appropriately diluted 1 mL sample was transferred into a test tube and 1.3 mL pyridine was added. After the mixture was vortexed, 5.7 mL acetic anhydride was added to this mixture in the test tube. The final mixture was again vortexed and immediately placed in a constant temperature (20°C) water bath and incubated for 30 min. The optimal density was recorded at 420 nm with the blank set. Concentration of CA was determined by referring to a standard curve of pure CA and was expressed as grams per liter (g/L). To determine the mycelial biomass concentration, the wet mycelia obtained at the end of the centrifugation process were washed three times with distilled water and then dried to a constant weight at 105°C.</p>

<title>Production of IE</title>
<p>Hydrolysates or extracts, which are used as substrates in microbial fermentations, can be produced by acid hydrolysis of the materials of plant or animal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233712436646">2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233712436646">Taskin and Kurbanoglu, 2011</xref>). If hydrolysates or extracts are used mainly as nitrogen source, then they are generated with strong acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436646">Kurbanoglu and Kurbanoglu, 2004</xref>; Taskin et al., 2011b). Therefore, the present hydrolysis experiments were performed with 6 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. For this, 100 g of IF was hydrolyzed with 200 mL of 6 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233712436646">Figure 1</xref>, the hydrolysate obtained with acid hydrolysis was subjected to neutralization, filtration and drying processes, respectively. At the end of these processes, 115 g of IE was produced. The obtained IE was used mainly as nitrogen source, since it had high protein content. While chemicals were selected for the hydrolysis and neutralization processes, a lot of attention was paid for the selection of the ones that contain the mineral elements required for cell growth or CA synthesis in <italic>A. niger</italic>. For example, the usage of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for hydrolysis process made IE rich in terms of sulfur (S) content. S is required for the synthesis of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, the vitamins thiamine and biotin and some carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436646">Bourn and Prescott, 2002</xref>). Similarly, it was achieved that IE became more rich in terms of potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) elements using KOH, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub> for neutralization. K is required for a variety of enzymes, including those involved in protein synthesis. Mg stabilizes ribosomes and cell membranes, complexes with adenosine triphosphate and operates as cofactor for many enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712436646">Brock et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233712436646">Prescott et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, Mg and Mn are also the most important elements promoting the production of CA in <italic>A. niger</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436646">Max et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the present process was designed by considering the points mentioned above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0748233712436646">
<title>Chemical analysis of IE</title>
<p>Nitrogen, protein, ash, fat, total sugar and mineral contents of IE were analyzed, and the obtained results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712436646">Table 1</xref>. From the results summarized in this table, it can be concluded that IE contained organic and inorganic substances required for microbial activities. It was determined that IE had high protein (35.6 g/100 g), ash (34.9 g/100 g) and total sugar (26.9 g/L) contents. The high protein content of IE is an indication that IE can serve as a possible alternative substrate for the cultivation of microorganisms and support the production of valuable microbial products. High ash content of IE is not so surprising, since acid hydrolysis leads to high ash content in the final products as the neutralization step cannot be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233712436646">Taskin and Kurbanoglu, 2011</xref>). Even, high ash content of IE can be an advantage for microorganisms because ash is a reflection of the amount of mineral elements in the samples and therefore serves as the main source of mineral elements needed for microbial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2010</xref>, 2011a). The total sugar content of IE can serve as an additional carbon source for microbial growth, since it is very high. The fat content (2.1 g/100 g) of IE is very low. This finding may make IE a more important substrate for microbial studies, because it has been suggested that protein sources used in microbial cultivations have low fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712436646">Bridson, 1995</xref>; Taskin et al., 2011a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233712436646">Taskin and Kurbanoglu, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Isolation and screening of mould strains</title>
<p>It has been well-known that there has been a growing interest in the isolation of microorganisms from various sources for the production of industrially valuable microbial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233712436646">Taskin and Erdal, 2011</xref>). In this context, exploration of CA-producing new mould isolates may represent a significant contribution to fermentation studies. The isolation experiments were performed on MAM containing only molasses and agar. The aim of this application was to isolate mould strains, which was capable of using molasses solution as the sole nutritional substrate. At the end of the present isolation experiments, 10 mould strains capable of using molasses sucrose as carbon source could be isolated from different soil samples. On the other hand, the screening for new microorganisms is accepted as a very powerful tool for obtaining strains with higher production ability than those already known. In this context, several investigators have used the screening method to obtain the best yield for their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712436646">Gromada and Fiedurek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233712436646">Taskin and Erdal, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233712436646">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233712436646">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233712436646">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>). The present screening experiments showed that even if all the 10 mould isolates grew in MBM-containing molasses, only three of them could produce CA. Among the three CA-producing isolates, the maximum production of CA (16.4 g/L) and biomass (12.4 g/L) was achieved with the isolate MT-4. This strain was isolated from the soil, where the molasses-containing effluent of sugar fabric was discharged. The effective utilization of sucrose as carbon source may be interpreted that the isolate might have adapted to their environment, where soil was constantly contaminated with effluent-containing sucrose. This finding is in good agreement with the fact that the soil contaminated by the effluent of sugar fabric is a good source for the isolation of microorganisms, being capable of effectively utilizing sucrose as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233712436646">Taskin and Erdal, 2010a</xref>).</p>

<title>Determination of the optimal concentration of IE</title>
<p>The effect of IE on biomass and the production of CA was investigated in various concentrations (0–50 g/L), and the obtained results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233712436646">Table 2</xref>. The lowest biomass and CA concentrations were recorded in the control medium containing only molasses solution. It is an expected result that the mould is capable of growing and producing CA in the control medium containing only molasses solution, because it has been reported that molasses contains nitrogen, carbon and mineral sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436646">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233712436646">Taskin and Erdal, 2010a</xref>). Even so, CA and biomass production significantly increased when IE was added into the medium. For example, adding 10 g of IE to the medium increased the production of CA from 16.4 to 24.4 g/L. The maximum value (28.5 g/L) for mould biomass was reached at the IE concentration of 40 g/L, whereas the production of CA was the maximum (41.8 g/L) at the IE concentration of 30 g/L. These results concluded that the optimum concentration of IE were different for biomass and CA production in <italic>A. niger</italic>. Similar results were also reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712436646">Honecker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712436646">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436646">Max et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233712436646">Papagianni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436646">Pintado et al., 1998</xref>), which showed that the optimum concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and mineral sources might be different for biomass formation and CA synthesis in <italic>A. niger</italic>. For example, it has been reported that excessive nitrogen and potassium promote a higher growth and consequently diverts the source of carbon toward energy and biomass production that restricts the production of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712436646">Bari et al., 2009</xref>). Taking into account the results mentioned above, the subsequent experiments were performed in MIEM-containing IE (30 g/L) and molasses solution.</p>

<title>Effect of different media on biomass and the production of CA by <italic>A. niger</italic> MT-4</title>
<p>In order to appraise the effectiveness of IE on biomass and CA production by <italic>A. niger</italic> MT-4, IE was compared with yeast extract and peptone. For this, the experiments were performed in MYEM and MBPM as well as in MIEM. Concentration of each extract in the culture medium was adjusted to 30 g/L. Cell growth, sugar consumption and the production of CA on all the three media were rapid on the 2nd and 3rd days. But, they slowly progressed after the 3rd day. Noteworthy differences in CA and biomass production were not observed in the production media within the first 24 h of fermentation. The results also demonstrated that substantially all the sugar contents of production media (MBPM, MIEM and MYEM) were exhausted at the end of 6th day of cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436646">Figure 2</xref>(c)), where the mycelial biomass and concentrations of CA reached the maximal values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436646">Figure 2</xref>(a) and (b)). Conversely, very high residual concentration of sugar (13.9 g/L) was assayed in the control medium at the end of the 6th day. No further CA and biomass production were detected in the production media after the 6th day. In direct contradiction, a reduction in total biomass amount of the mould was observed in all the production media after the 6th day (data not shown). This situation could be attributed to the fungal cell lysis, which appears with the depletion of nutrients in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2011a</xref>). In contrast to the production media, sugar consumption, cell growth and the production of CA were not observed in the control medium after 96 h of fermentation. This result might have resulted from the depletion of nutritional components such as nitrogen and mineral sources in the control medium containing only molasses. At the end of the 6-day optimal incubation period, concentrations of biomass and CA were determined as 27.5 and 38.4 g/L in MYEM, 26.4 and 41.8 g/L in MIEM and 24.9 and 32.4 g/L in MBPM, respectively. These results concluded that YE was more favorable substrate for biomass production, whereas IE was more favorable substrate for CA production.</p>

<p>Fungal growth in the form of a pellet is favorable for the fungal fermentations, since it not only makes repeated batch fermentation possible but also significantly improves the culture rheology resulting in better mass and oxygen transfer into the biomass and lower energy consumption for aeration and agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748233712436646">Van Suijdam et al., 1980</xref>). Especially, several investigators have reported that pelleted growth is more suitable for CA production by <italic>A. niger </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436646">Ikram-ul et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712436646">Pazouki and Panda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436646">Pera and Callieri, 1999</xref>). The present experiments exhibited that all the production media gave rise to fungal growth in the form of a uniform pellet, whereas mycelial growth in the form of a nonuniform pellet was observed in the control medium. On the other hand, uniform pellets with the smallest size (average 4 mm) were achieved in MIEM. The average sizes of uniform pellets were 5 and 7 mm in MYEM and MBPM, respectively. Obtaining uniform pellet of small size in MIEM is very important, because the small uniform pellet form is usually preferred in fungal fermentation studies. Large pellets may limit internal mass transfer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748233712436646">Table 3</xref>), resulting in a low reaction rate and, consequently, a decrease in the production rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233712436646">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The experiments demonstrated that IE resulted in higher CA concentration and the uniform pellets with smaller size when compared with BP and YE. This situation could be attributed to chemical composition of IE, that is, some specific substances in IE might have promoted CA synthesis and small uniform pellet formation in <italic>A. niger</italic>. On the other hand, rich Mg and Mn contents of IE could be one of the other important factors stimulating CA synthesis and small uniform pellet formation in <italic>A. niger</italic>. Precisely, IE must have increased CA synthesis by stimulating uniform pellet morphology in the mould. This is because it has been reported that Mg and Mn elements have the significant potential to promote CA synthesis and uniform pellet formation in <italic>A. niger</italic> and that there is a positive relation between uniform pellet morphology and CA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436646">Ikram-ul et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712436646">Imandi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712436646">Lofty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436646">Max et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436646">Pera and Callieri, 1999</xref>). On the other hand, some investigators informed that Fe (iron) ions decreased CA synthesis at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712436646">Pera and Callieri, 1997</xref>). In this regard, rich Mg content of IE might have affected positively CA synthesis by decreasing the inhibitory effect of Fe in the molasses solution. Because, it was reported that addition of Mg into the molasses medium counteracted the deleterious effect of iron and cane molasses, therefore, resulting in a better conversion of sugar into CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436646">Fedoseev, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Growth substrate costs often make up the major part of the production costs of microbial cells and bioproducts in the fermentation industry. Therefore, selection of a suitable low-cost nutrient is accepted as a major aspect in microbial fermentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233712436646">Taskin and Erdal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233712436646">Taskin et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748233712436646">Tinoi et al., 2005</xref>). The present study elucidated that sugarcane molasses and insect (<italic>L. migratoria</italic>) biomass could be used together with as cheap fermentation substrates. Due to its availability and low price, molasses is a convenient raw material for the industrial production of CA by fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436646">Pera and Callieri, 1999</xref>). Especially, <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass was tested as a fermentation substrate for the first time in the present study. The insect <italic>L. migratoria</italic> is cultivated in some European countries including Turkey. Therefore, the insect biomass can be easily obtained, especially, in Turkey. Besides, some of the <italic>L. migratoria</italic> can reach to 6 inches (15 cm). Considering these facts, it is possible to say that the use of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass as a substrate may be an alternative approach in the reduction of total price of CA-production media.</p>

<sec id="section16-0748233712436646">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Hydrolysate extract of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> biomass could be effectively used as a new fermentation substrate for the production of CA by <italic>A. niger</italic>. It may also be tested as a substrate for the production of other industrial products, such as carotenoid, enzyme, polysaccharide and ethanol. A new acid hydrolysis was developed for the preparation of fermentation substrate having rich protein, carbohydrate and ash contents. The process also provides the extract to be richer in terms of the minerals, which increases the synthesis of CA in <italic>A. niger</italic>. In conclusion, we believe that the present study can make significant contributions to the fermentation studies for the production of various microbial products.</p>
