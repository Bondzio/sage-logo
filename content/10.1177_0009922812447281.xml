<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>This 7-year-old Caucasian male was seen in our outpatient clinic as a follow-up visit for recurrent fever.</p>
<p>He began having nightly fevers approximately 14 weeks earlier that were reported to be 100.4°F to 101.6°F by his parents. At his initial visit with us after 5 weeks of fever, his parents reported increased fatigue but denied any additional localized symptoms or recent illnesses. He had been previously healthy, with no history of severe illness, hospitalizations, significant surgery, or unusual travel. He had no pets. Our initial laboratory evaluation included a complete blood count with manual differential, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, chest x-ray, urinalysis, urine culture, tuberculosis skin test, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All were normal or negative, except an ESR of 43mm/h, a slightly low hemoglobin of 10.2 gm/dL, and an elevated platelet count of 452 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. His primary care physician had obtained an EBV-VCA (Epstein–Barr virus antibody to viral capsid antigen) IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgM (immunoglobulin M), CMV (cytomegalovirus) IgG, and ANA (antinuclear antibody) tests, all of which were normal, with the exception of a positive EBV-VCA IgG antibody concentration. At this point we elected to simply observe him on an outpatient basis for the development of any new signs or symptoms and have the parents record any elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>Nine weeks later, the parents scheduled a follow-up visit because of continued fever, now of 14 weeks duration. His fever had resolved after his initial visit but only for 1 week. Since that time, they recorded nightly temperatures above 102°F. He also developed intermittent fatigue, decreased appetite, night sweats, vomiting, and increasing abdominal pain. His abdominal pain was mainly limited to the epigastric area, although it sometimes occurred in the right lower quadrant. He had daily bowel movements but occasionally had difficulty passing stool, and his parents observed very foul-smelling nonbloody stools. The past several days he had been extremely fatigued and pale looking.</p>
<p>Physical examination revealed a thin, pale child who was otherwise pleasant, cooperative, and in no apparent distress. His weight was 20.4 kg, decreased from 20.5 kg at the visit 9 weeks earlier but in the10th to 25th percentile. He was afebrile and other vital signs were normal. A new finding on exam was gingival ulcers along the right lower gum line, with no pharyngeal exudates or erythema. Abdominal exam was significant for right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended. Skin tags were noted on perianal exam.</p>
<p>Given the new abdominal symptoms and mouth ulcers, Crohn disease was now a strong consideration. Additional history revealed that the paternal uncle was being treated for Crohn disease.</p>
<p>Significant new laboratory findings were a hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL and a hematocrit of 31.1% with 693 000 platelets/µL. MCV (mean corpuscular volume) was 74.9 fL and RDW (random distribution of red cell width) was 14.5%. Microcytosis was noted on peripheral smear. C reactive protein was 45.4 mg/L (normal &lt;8.4 mg/L). Urinalysis was normal and urine culture was negative.</p>
<p>We referred this patient to our pediatric gastroenterologists. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophagitis with no bleeding. The stomach was normal. Aphthous ulcerations were found in the duodenal bulb. Colonoscopy showed perianal skin tags and aphthous ulcers of the anus. Patches of inflammation surrounded by normal mucosa were found throughout the colon, and aphthous ulcers were found in the terminal ileum. All areas were biopsied, and biopsies revealed ileitis and colitis with ulceration, crypt abscesses, and architectural distortion throughout the colon.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Crohn disease with ileitis and colitis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is classically defined as a well-documented fever, a least twice a week, lasting 3 weeks, with no discernible cause after 1 week of careful investigation. Some clinicians use other definitions of FUO, including just 2 weeks of fever with no obvious cause after history, physical exam, and screening lab tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812447281">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In approximately two thirds of cases of FUO, an etiology is never established, and the fever is presumed to be the result of undiagnosed viral disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812447281">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812447281">2</xref></sup> Of the cases of FUO that are found to have demonstrable causes, most are infectious agents, with EBV disease, urinary tract infections, and cat scratch disease currently being most common in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812447281">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812447281">2</xref></sup> Other potential etiologies are malignancy or autoimmune disorders or are factitious (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812447281">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812447281">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812447281">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>Because the causes of FUO are so numerous, the diagnostic approach to this presentation must be focused and cost-effective. The speed and components of the workup should be based on the presenting symptoms and degree of illness that the child exhibits. Of course, the first step to any clinical diagnosis is a thorough history and physical exam, and this is especially true with FUO. Sometimes, as in our case, certain aspects of the history may only be revealed with repeat questioning, so a thorough history at each subsequent visit is equally as important as at the initial visit. This history and physical exam should be what guides the clinician in decisions of which investigative tests to order and how aggressively to pursue other tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812447281">3</xref></sup> At initial presentation, our patient had neither symptoms nor physical exam findings other than nightly fever, so only routine screening tests were performed. Our screen for malignancy was a complete blood cell count with a manual differential, LDH, uric acid, and chest x-ray. For possible occult infection a urinalysis with urine culture and a tuberculin skin test were obtained. He had no exposure to kittens or cats, so a <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic> antibody test for cat scratch disease was not obtained. Because of his gender and age, an ANA screen was not considered. We did order an ESR as a nonspecific screen for ongoing inflammation.</p>
<p>For other patients, additional testing as determined by history, symptoms, age, physical examination, and geographic location would vary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812447281">4</xref></sup> These might include EBV and CMV serology, ANA, sinus x-rays, and abdominal ultrasound. However, an extensive battery of tests is not only costly but may serve only to give the family unwarranted worries and anxiety. Extensive and invasive testing should be reserved for patients with appropriate symptoms or severity of illness to warrant such investigations. When our initial screening tests revealed nothing significant, we decided to wait and see how our patient progressed. His second visit yielded further findings that helped us direct our investigative efforts. With his new physical exam findings and positive family history for Crohn disease, we were able to order appropriate investigative tests and make the diagnosis quickly and with minimal expense. This case supports the recommendation for a stepwise approach to evaluating FUO with an emphasis on repeat examinations rather than extensive laboratory testing. Also it points out the importance of treating each patient on a case-by-case basis, tailoring evaluations accordingly. Over time, our patient pointed to his abdomen as the cause of his prolonged fever, which along with the new mouth ulcers led to the correct diagnosis.</p>

<title>Crohn Disease</title>
<p>Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, involving any region from mouth to anus. Although it is most commonly diagnosed in the adult population, it is being diagnosed in childhood with increasing frequency. In fact, one of the first patients described by Dr. Crohn was a 16-year-old boy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812447281">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812447281">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The initial presentation varies widely, with prolonged fever being a common component. Clinical reviews have indicated that FUO was seen and evaluated in 10% to 15% of patients prior to identification of inflammatory bowel disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812447281">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812447281">7</xref></sup> Older children, 6 to 17 years of age, more commonly present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever, as did our patient on his second visit, whereas the 0 to 5-year-old group more commonly are seen because of rectal bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812447281">7</xref></sup>. On physical exam, children with Crohn disease often appear pale and malnourished, with decreased energy and poor appetite. They often have abdominal pain and tenderness to palpation, especially in the right lower quadrant, and there may be perianal disease present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812447281">8</xref></sup> Laboratory studies often reveal anemia, with a component of iron deficiency, thrombocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, or an elevated ESR. These findings are consistent in both age groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812447281">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radiographic and endoscopic investigations are required for diagnosis. Studies of both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts should be obtained, including esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and ileo-colonoscopy with appropriate biopsies. The lesions seen in Crohn disease may be transmural and tend to be segmental with skip areas of normal bowel between areas of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812447281">8</xref></sup> Aphthous ulcers, linear ulcers, and strictures are common findings on colonoscopy. Biopsies exhibit chronic inflammatory changes or noncaseating granulomas. Upper gastrointestinal films with contrast and small bowel followthrough characteristically reveal aphthous ulcers, strictures, or cobblestoning in the mucosal surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812447281">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once diagnosed, treatment is individualized, based on age, localization of disease, and degree of inflammation. Other associated complications, particularly growth failure, should be carefully followed. The goals of treatment with pediatric Crohn disease are to control the inflammatory processes while minimizing side effects from medication, to facilitate growth through proper nutrition, and to allow the patient to maintain a lifestyle that is as close as possible to normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812447281">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crohn disease is not curable, even with surgery, so treatment today is reliant on anti-inflammatory medications and nutritional therapy. Because of the chronic and variable nature of Crohn disease, it is important that treatment be adjusted periodically depending on symptoms. Growth and weight gain should be monitored closely. Complications of Crohn disease include strictures, fistulas, abscesses, and perforation. Crohn disease also increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the colon and carcinoma of the small intestines.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In general, patients presenting with FUO pose a diagnostic conundrum, with the differential diagnosis list being long and widely varied. When beginning evaluation of a child with FUO, it is important to choose investigative studies based on a careful history and physical exam. Ordering a large battery of tests to screen for the multiple causes of FUO is expensive and time-consuming. It is important to keep in mind that the majority of cases of resolve without medical intervention. Instead, it is best to have patience, ordering only screening tests to rule out potential serious etiologies, and to give the child time to manifest other symptoms or physical exam findings that will focus the diagnostic work-up. It is also important to take a careful history and perform a thorough physical exam with each subsequent visit, both to aid in data gathering and to reassure parents that investigative efforts are complete and justified.</p>
