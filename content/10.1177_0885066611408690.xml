         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Sepsis continues to be a common and serious problem. It is currently the leading cause of death in noncardiac intensive care units (ICUs).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066611408690">1</xref>
            </sup> The incidence of sepsis among hospitalized patients continues to increase as the population ages. The current incidence of severe sepsis among hospitalized patients in the United States is 208 cases/100 000 patients.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066611408690">2</xref>
            </sup> It is estimated<sup>

            </sup> that there will be nearly 1 million cases of sepsis in the United States in the year 2010, with an associated mortality rate of greater than 30%.</p>
         <p>Among surgical patients, sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. A large epidemiologic study from Angus et al determined that surgical patients account for nearly one third of all sepsis cases in the United States.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611408690">3</xref>
            </sup> Our recent analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) Database determined that sepsis and septic shock where 10 times more common than myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0885066611408690">76</xref>
            </sup> The incidence of sepsis was highest in patients requiring emergency surgery. Colonic perforation was the predominant source of sepsis. The development of septic shock was associated with a 30% mortality rate among elective surgical patients and a 39% mortality rate among emergent surgical patients. Risk factors for both the development of sepsis and death from sepsis included age older than 60 years, the need for emergency surgery, and the presence of comorbid conditions.<sup>

         <title>Definition of Surgical Sepsis</title>
         <p>A clear and accurate definition of surgical sepsis is critical for clinicians and researchers. A standard definition allows us to identify patients, leads to a better understanding of the disease process, and facilitates clinical research. Sepsis syndrome was first defined in the literature by Roger Bone <sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611408690">5</xref>
            </sup> in 1989. This was followed by the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicines Consensus Conference in 1991 that defined the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611408690">6</xref>
            </sup> In response to ongoing criticism from experts in the field, a second consensus conference was convened in 2001 to revise the original definitions. The updated consensus conference definitions included an expanded list of the signs and symptoms of sepsis.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066611408690">7</xref>
            </sup> While the definitions included in the 2001 update are widely accepted, they do not specifically define surgical sepsis. In addition, the consensus conference definitions remain nonspecific and allow for some variability, especially with regard to defining organ dysfunction.</p>
         <p>In an attempt to better define the categories of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, we have modified the American College of Chest Physician/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference definitions. We have defined surgical sepsis as SIRS plus an infection requiring surgical intervention for source control or SIRS plus an infection within 14 days of a major surgical procedure. Major surgical procedure is defined as any procedure requiring general anesthesia for &gt;1 hour. Severe sepsis is defined as SIRS plus infection plus acute organ dysfunction. The types of acute organ dysfunction are defined as follows: (1) Neurologic: Glasgow Outcome Score (GCS) &lt;13 upon recognition of sepsis or deteriorating GCS to &lt;13 during first 24 hours. (2) Pulmonary: P<sc>ao</sc>
            <sub>2</sub>/F<sc>io</sc>
            <sub>2</sub> ratio &lt;250 (&lt;200 if lung is the primary site of infection) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ([PCWP], if available) not suggestive of fluid overload. (3) Renal (one of the following): urine output (UOP) &lt; 0.5 mL/kg for ≥1 hour despite adequate volume resuscitation, increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL from baseline (measured within 24 hours of starting sepsis resuscitation) despite adequate volume resuscitation or increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL during the first 24 hours of sepsis management, despite adequate volume resuscitation. Adequate volume resuscitation is defined as a minimum intravenous fluid (IVF) infusion of 20 mL/kg per ideal body weight (IBW) or central venous pressure (CVP) ≥8 mm Hg or PCWP ≥12 mm Hg. (4) Coagulation (one of following): international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5, platelet count &lt;80 000 or ≥50% decrease in platelet compared to 24 hours before instituting sepsis resuscitation or in the 24 hours after starting sepsis resuscitation in the absence of chronic liver disease. (5) Hypoperfusion: lactate level &gt;4 mmol/L. Septic shock is defined as SIRS plus infection plus acute cardiac dysfunction which is defined by the following (must meet both criteria): (1) IVF challenge ≥20 ml/kg per IBW of isotonic crystalloid infusion or CVP ≥8 mm Hg or PCWP ≥12 mm Hg and (2) require vasopressors to increase MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg.</p>

         <title>The Early Identification of Sepsis</title>
         <p>The early identification and management of sepsis remains a significant challenge to health care providers. In the recent past, multiple organizations have focused their efforts on providing evidence-based guidelines in an attempt to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis. Several recent studies in the literature have highlighted the correlation between early sepsis intervention and patient survival. The use of early goal-directed therapy as described by Rivers et al has emphasized the importance of early intervention during the “golden hours” of sepsis.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066611408690">8</xref>
            </sup> A recently published study by Kumar et al demonstrated a significant correlation between time to appropriate antibiotic administration and patient urvival.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066611408690">9</xref>
            </sup> In this study of 2154 patients with septic shock, administration of effective antimicrobial therapy within the first hour of document, hypotension was associated with a survival rate of 79.9%. Each hour of delay in the administration of effective antimicrobial therapy was associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%.</p>
         <p>In spite of strong evidence that the early implementation of evidence-based, sepsis-specific therapies saves lives, the early identification of sepsis remains challenging. The signs and symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific, particularly in the early phases of sepsis. As bedside nurses and other health care providers focus on multiple priorities and tasks, early signs of sepsis are often missed and time critical interventions are delayed. Lack of awareness of the signs and symptoms of impending sepsis may contribute to the problem. In the surgical patient, some of the early signs of sepsis are often attributed to other common problems seen in the postoperative period. For example, altered mental status, a potential early sign of sepsis, is often attributed to the administration of narcotic pain medication or sundowning, particularly in the elderly patient. Oliguria, also an early sign of sepsis, is often attributed to underresuscitation. While many nurses notify physicians of hyperthermia, how often are we notified of hypothermia that can also be an early sign of sepsis? Likewise, acute hypoxia on the surgical wards spurs a workup for pulmonary embolism but acute hypoxia may herald the onset of severe sepsis or septic shock. Identifying patients in the early stages of sepsis is imperative. If patients are allowed to progress into septic shock their mortality is prohibitively high (&gt;30%), despite aggressive interventions. When you consider these factors the benefit of routine, accurate screening of patients for sepsis quickly becomes apparent.</p>
         <p>A recent audit of ward nurses' knowledge of sepsis demonstrated lack of awareness of the standard definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, the significance of increased blood lactate concentration as an indicator of severe sepsis, and the basic tenets of early goal-directed therapy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066611408690">10</xref>
            </sup> The conclusion of this audit was that these deficits could result in missed or delayed diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock and seriously delayed therapy. Physicians also struggle with the early identification and evidence-based management of sepsis. A recent international survey of physicians regarding their knowledge about sepsis reported that 83% of physicians surveyed had missed the diagnosis of sepsis.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066611408690">11</xref>
            </sup> The reasons listed for missing the diagnosis of sepsis included lack of monitoring, lack of a common definition for sepsis, and lack of knowledge. Of the 1058 physicians surveyed, only 140 (13.2%) were able to give the definition of sepsis from the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine(ACCP/SCCM) consensus statement.</p>
         <p>Within our institution, we have identified sepsis to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our general surgery patients. As a result, our multidisciplinary surgical ICU (SICU) team has developed a sepsis management protocol that utilizes computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) to ensure timely and consistent implementation of the Evidence Based Guidelines (EBGs).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066611408690">12</xref>
            </sup> Through our initial experience with implementation of our CCDS sepsis management protocol, we encountered the unanticipated problem of untimely and inaccurate recognition of sepsis by bedside clinicians. As bedside nurses and other team members focus on multiple priorities and tasks, early signs of sepsis were often missed and interventions were delayed. The need for routine, accurate screening of all SICU patients for sepsis quickly became apparent. In an attempt to increase the early identification of sepsis, we developed a sepsis-screening tool in our SICU.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066611408690">13</xref>
            </sup> Our initial experience with this mandatory sepsis-screening tool in our SICU showed promising results. The screening tool yielded a sensitivity of 96.5%, a specificity of 96.7%, a positive predictive value of 80.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.5%. In addition, sepsis-related mortality decreased from 35.1% to 23.3%.</p>
         <p>We have subsequently implemented and validated our sepsis-screening tool on the inpatient surgical ward. The screening tool yielded a sensitivity of 99.9%, specificity of 91.3%, a positive predictive value of 16.3%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The sepsis-related mortality in those patients that screened positive for sepsis was 6.3%. Of the 16 patients that developed sepsis, 4 (25%) required transfer to the SICU. Of the 16 true positive screens, 14 (87.5%) had sepsis and 2 (12.5%) had severe sepsis at the time of the screen. These results emphasize the importance of sepsis screening for the early identification of sepsis.</p>

            <title>Initial Assessment</title>
            <p>A clinical suspicion for the presence of sepsis should prompt further evaluation of the patient. The initial evaluation should focus on determining the degree of physiologic derangement that the patient is experiencing. Specifically, it is important to assess for the presence of tissue hypoperfusion. There are several clinical and laboratory variables that can be used to evaluate tissue perfusion status. The following variables are indicators that the patient is experiencing tissue hypoperfusion: (1) UOP &lt;0.5 mL/kg of IBW, (2) mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;65 mm Hg, (3) Glasgow Coma Score &lt;12, and (4) serum lactate ≥4 mmol/L. The presence of tissue hypoperfusion should prompt aggressive resuscitative measures that are focused on restoring tissue perfusion. Based upon the definitions outlined above those patients that do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion would fall into the category of sepsis. Those patients that do have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion would be categorized as having severe sepsis/septic shock. The initial resuscitation and management of these patients will be discussed below.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section6-0885066611408690">
            <title>Initial Resuscitation of Sepsis</title>
            <p>The initial resuscitation phase of sepsis should begin immediately upon recognition of sepsis. The goals of the resuscitation phase include reversal of hypoperfusion, diagnosing the source of infection, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and source control. Many institutions have developed order sets that specifically address each of these issues. The utilization of standardized protocols for the initial management of sepsis has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes in multiple settings.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066611408690">14</xref>

               </sup> The major tenets of initial resuscitation can be initiated in any area of the hospital and should not be delayed pending arrival in the ICU. Establishing intravenous (IV) access is a critical first step as this allows for the administration of IVF and antimicrobials. For those patients without evidence of tissue hypoperfusion, a large bore peripheral IV should be sufficient. In the event that peripheral IV access is not attainable, a central venous line should be inserted in a timely fashion. The initial resuscitation fluid of choice still remains extremely controversial. There are no prospective, randomized controlled trials evaluating crystalloid versus colloid resuscitation in surgical patients with sepsis. The SAFE trial was a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that compared the effect of colloid versus crystalloid fluid resuscitation on mortality in patients admitted to the ICU.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066611408690">20</xref>
               </sup> The results of the study revealed similar outcomes for patients in the colloid and crystalloid group, suggesting there is no advantage to the use of either resuscitation fluid. A subgroup analysis of patients with severe sepsis showed a slight improvement in survival among patients that received albumin, but this difference was not statistically significant as this study was not specifically designed to evaluate patients with sepsis.</p>
            <p>If colloids are given, the initial fluid bolus should be 300 to 500 mL of colloid over 30 minutes. If crystalloids are given, the initial fluid challenge should be 1000 cc of crystalloid over 30 minutes. Additional fluid boluses should be repeated based upon the patient’s response. Fluid resuscitation should be initiated with the following goals in mind. (1) A target CVP (if available) of 8 to 12 mm Hg in nonintubated patients and a target CVP of 12 to 15 mm Hg in mechanically ventilated patients,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066611408690">21</xref>
               </sup> (2) A MAP<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066611408690">22</xref>
               </sup> of ≥65 mm Hg, (3) UOP of ≥0.5 mL/kg per h, and (4) Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) of ≥70% or mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) of ≥65% (if available).<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066611408690">23</xref>
               </sup> These goals of resuscitation should be achieved within 6 hours of the recognition of sepsis. In addition, a baseline serum lactate should be sent upon the identification of sepsis. A repeat serum lactate level should be sent 4 hours later to monitor the progress of the initial resuscitation. A recent randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of lactate clearance versus ScvO<sub>2</sub> as end points of resuscitation showed no difference in survival, suggesting that both variables are equivalent as end points of resuscitation.<sup>

            <title>Initial Resusciation of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</title>
            <p>For those patients presenting with severe sepsis and septic shock, the timely restoration of tissue perfusion is critical. The concept of early goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock was initially developed and validated in the emergency department (ED) setting. The ED is frequently the point of entry into the hospital for many patients with sepsis. Unfortunately, many of these patients may wait for prolonged periods of time in the ED. The end result is often a delay in the implementation of early sepsis resuscitation. The use of early goal-directed resuscitation has been shown to improve survival in patient presenting with severe sepsis and septic shock.<sup>

               </sup> The basic tenets of early goal-directed therapy are to identify tissue hypoperfusion and institute therapies to reverse global tissue hypoxia by optimizing oxygen delivery. Tissue perfusion can be monitored by measuring SvO<sub>2</sub>, ScvO<sub>2</sub>, or peripheral muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>).

Early goal-directed therapy attempts to restore tissue hypoperfusion by addressing these variables.</p>
            <p>To restore intravascular volume and enhance CO, an initial crystalloid fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg of IBW is recommended. This fluid bolus can be initially administered through existing peripheral IVs, however placement of a central venous line for monitoring of CVP is recommended. In addition, an arterial line should be placed in those patients presenting with hypotension that do not rapidly respond to volume loading. The utilization of noninvasive blood pressure monitoring for patients in septic shock often produces inaccurate measurements and should not be used for titrating vasoactive medications. A Foley catheter should also be inserted to allow for close monitoring of UOP and bladder pressures should be monitored in patients requiring vigorous volume loading. The goals of resuscitation remain the same as those listed above; (1) A target CVP (if available) of 8 to 12 mm Hg in nonintubated patients and a target CVP of 12 to 15 mm Hg in mechanically ventilated patients.<sup>

            <p>In patients presenting with septic shock, the initial fluid bolus may not restore their MAP to ≥65 mm Hg. A repeat fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg of IBW can be given to correct hypovolemia. However, transient vasopressors therapy may need to be initiated, even if volume resuscitation is still ongoing. Septic shock is primarily a vasodilatory shock, associated with a high CO and a low systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, initial vasopressors therapy should be targeted at restoring vascular tone. Both norepinephrine and dopamine are acceptable first-line agents for the treatment of septic shock. These agents should be administered through a central venous catheter. Norepinephrine is primarily an α-receptor agonist that promotes widespread vasoconstriction and has little effect on heart rate or stroke volume. Dopamine has dose-dependent effects on α, β, and dopaminergic receptors. The initial increase in blood pressure seen with dopamine is related to increasing CO. At higher doses (&gt;7.5 µg/kg per min), dopamine does activate α-receptors with resultant vasoconstriction. The Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) Study found that dopamine administration was associated with increased mortality rates and was an independent risk factor for death.<sup>

It is our current practice to initiate a vasopressin drip at a rate 0.04 U/min in those patients requiring norepinephrine infusion at ≥15 µg/min.

            <p>While most patients with sepsis initially present with increased CO, a subset of patients will develop myocardial depression from sepsis. The exact mechanism for this reversible myocardial dysfunction is still under investigation. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted in response to stretching of myocardium and has been used clinically to assess volume overload and predict death in acute congestive heart failure. More recently, BNP has been shown to be elevated in early septic shock and likewise predict death. We have recently shown that BNP increases with initial sepsis severity and is associated with early left ventricular (LV) dysfunction that in turn is associated with later death. Monitoring BNP in early sepsis to identify occult LV dysfunction might prompt earlier use of inotropes which are not commonly used in early sepsis resuscitation.</p>
            <p>For those patients with suspected or documented cardiac dysfunction, the addition of inotropic therapy is recommended. Dobutamine is the first-line agent for the treatment of cardiac dysfunction in patients with sepsis. The management of patients with a cardiac component to their shock state presents a unique challenge to the managing clinician since they require the titration of vasopressors and inotropic agents. In this subset of patients, we have found that the utilization of a pulmonary artery catheter can be extremely useful. This allows for the specific titration of vasopressors based upon systemic vascular resistance and inotropic agents based upon CO.</p>

Current recommendations include obtaining a minimum of 2 blood cultures, including 1 blood culture from each vascular access device and 1 blood culture from a peripheral puncture. Additional cultures from other sites (respiratory and urinary tract) and radiographic imaging should be dictated by clinical suspicion.

Antimicrobials should be administered after appropriate cultures have been sent but within 1 hour of sepsis recognition. When selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy, a few general rules should be applied. The initial antimicrobial coverage should be broad enough to cover all potential pathogens. There is substantial evidence that administering inadequate antimicrobial coverage is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.<sup>

While antimicrobial therapy has always been a mainstay in the treatment of infection, only recently has the importance of antimicrobial choice and rapid administration been demonstrated to significantly impact patient mortality. In a landmark study by Kumar et al the relationship between time to antimicrobial administration and patient mortality was clearly documented.<sup>

In Kumar’s previously mentioned study, &gt;50% patients with septic shock experienced a delay in antimicrobial administration of at least 6 hours. A recent multicenter prospective analysis of compliance with antimicrobial administration revealed that only 60% of patients were receiving antimicrobials within 1 hour.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885066611408690">47</xref>
               </sup> After a 2-year educational campaign and focused programs for performance improvement, the compliance only reached 67%. Clearly, there must be some significant clinical hurdles that we must overcome in order to implement this seemingly simple intervention.</p>
            <p>Several barriers to the timely administration of antimicrobials have been identified. One critical issue is the rapid availability of IV access. During active sepsis resuscitation IV access is need for fluid administration as well as antimicrobial therapy. In addition, appropriate cultures, often from various sites, must be sent prior to antimicrobial administration. Many antimicrobials are not readily available in patient care areas and must be transported from the pharmacy to the bedside. Most patients receive at least 2 empiric antimicrobials, which can result in additional delays if adequate IV access is not available. Performing this multitude of tasks, particularly in an unstable patient with septic shock can quickly overwhelm the clinical team. The end result is a delay in antimicrobial administration.</p>
            <p>While each institution has their own specific barriers to implementation, it is important to recognize the importance of administering IV antimicrobials within 1 hour. This simple task of administering an antimicrobial can significantly improve patient survival. In order to minimize the time to antimicrobial administration, there are a few basic clinical practices that can be implemented to help overcome these barriers. Rapidly establishing IV access is critical to the success of the resuscitation. If peripheral IV access is not easily attainable, central venous access should be secured promptly. Central venous access has the benefit of providing the clinical team with multiple infusion ports as well as a way to monitor CVP. Working in conjunction with pharmacy to establish a rapidly available, pre-mixed supply of commonly administered antimicrobials will also help minimize delays. Many institutions have developed a “sepsis toolbox” containing IV fluids, culture materials, blood tubes for measuring serum lactate, and a pre-mixed supply of antimicrobials. This toolbox can be taken to the bedside of patient with sepsis at any location in the hospital, avoiding potential delays in the initiation of resuscitation.</p>
            <p>The choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy is as important as administering antimicrobials within 1 hour. Antimicrobial selection can be a complex process and should take into account the patient’s history and comorbid conditions, recent antimicrobial exposure, and probable source of infection. With the recent emergence of several virulent, drug-resistant pathogens, the length of the patient’s hospital course and the potential for infection with such organisms should be taken into consideration. Failure to provide effective antimicrobial coverage for the causative organism significantly increases the risk of death from sepsis. The best practice is to provide broad coverage initially and de-escalate antimicrobial therapy based upon culture data. In addition, specific evidence-based guidelines are also available based upon the specific site of infection.<sup>

            <p>The final component of the initial resuscitation bundle is identifying and controlling the source of infection. This can be as simple as removing an infected vascular access device. However, in our experience, in surgical patients the abdomen is the site of infection in ≥50% of cases. These patients frequently require diagnostic imaging to identify the source and an operative procedure for source control. This includes emergent debridement of necrotic tissues, abscess drainage, removal of infected vascular access devices, and exploratory laparotomy. In the setting of septic shock, these procedures, while necessary, can present a unique challenge to the surgical team.</p>
            <p>The concept of damage control laparotomy (DCL) was first utilized for the care of critically injured patients with trauma.<sup>

               </sup> Damage control is defined as initial control of hemorrhage and contamination followed by intraperitoneal packing as needed and rapid, temporary abdominal closure. This concept was employed on those patients that presented with severe physiologic derangements such as coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia. Rather than persist for hours performing definitive surgery in the operating room (OR), these patients have their critical surgical issues addressed in an abbreviated fashion so they may be taken to the ICU for further resuscitation. Once their physiologic derangements have been corrected, they are taken back to the OR for a definitive surgical procedure. The decision to utilize DCL should not be viewed as a bailout. Instead, it is a deliberate decision to truncate the surgical procedure in order to minimize the time away from the ICU. The decision to perform DCL is often made prior to arriving in the OR and is based on the severity of the patient’s physiologic derangements at the time of presentation.</p>
            <p>The concept of DCL has now evolved to include critically ill patients with surgical sepsis. Much like the patient with trauma having the lethal triad of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, many patients with septic shock present in a similar fashion. For those patients presenting with septic shock and a source of infection that requires surgical intervention, the utilization of DCL can be lifesaving.</p>
            <p>The first priority is to initiate resuscitation. The patient needs to undergo preoperative optimization during which time the airway is secured, central venous and arterial lines are placed, volume resuscitation and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are administered, and vasopressors are titrated to the appropriate end points. Within 6 hours, the patient is taken to the OR for emergency laparotomy and potential damage control. The surgeon needs to assess the degree of physiologic derangement early in the operation and if the severe physiologic derangements exist, then the operative interventions need to be truncated. The primary aim is to control the source of infection (eg, resect dead bowel, close bowel perforations, and washout the abdomen). We do not create ostomies at this first operation. The abdomen is then temporally closed (via a variety of techniques) and the patient is rapidly returned to the ICU where they undergo postoperative optimization. This includes optimizing volume resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, correction of coagulopathy and hypothermia, and monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Over the next 24 to 48 hours, abnormal physiology is corrected so that the patient can safely return to the OR for a definitive operation and abdominal closure. Septic shock is a tremendous metabolic insult, and it is very important to provide optimal nutritional support (often requires combine enteral and parenteral nutrition) and early mobilization to prevent the loss of lean body mass impairs recovery.</p>
            <p>One of the problems with this “damage control” strategy is that in some of the patients the midline fascia cannot be closed at the second operation because of bowel distention and they need to be taken back to the OR for additional laparotomies. The midline fascia is progressively closed with the use of a vacuum-assisted closure device. For this technique to work, it is important that the bowel not become adherent to peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall out the lateral gutters otherwise the abdomen becomes “frozen” and the fascia cannot be brought to midline. Therefore, gentle lysis of adhesions must be performed at each laparotomy. Traditionally, abdominal wall defects in these “frozen” abdomens were closed by mobilizing skin/subcutaneous tissue flaps to cover the defect (ie, accepting a large hernia defect and need for delayed reconstruction) or by bridging the defect with mesh with later split thickness skin grafting once granulation tissue has developed. This is associated with a 20% Gastrointestinal (GI) fistula rate, which is a terrible complication. Additionally, many of these patients required delayed complex abdominal wall reconstructions. Recently, there has been a lot of enthusiasm for acute reconstruction with biological mesh. However, long-term follow-up studies show that many of these patients require delayed hernia repairs of large defects.<sup>

            <p>In addition to “damage control” scenarios, there are other reasons that we will leave the abdomen open and plan a staged relaparotomy. (1) Patients with ischemic bowel that have undergone a resection will be taken back the next day to assess viability of the remaining bowel before we attempt an anastomosis or ostomy. We have been quite successful in completing the small bowel to colon anastomosis at the second operation and thus these patients have avoided the need for a temporary ileostomy. (2) Patients who have massive bowel distention that cannot be closed without causing significant intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) will undergo temporary abdominal closure. Intra-abdominal hypertension sets the stage for ACS which occurs with subsequent ICU resuscitation.<sup>

As a result of advances in trauma care starting in the 1980s, this entity emerged as an epidemic in the mid-1990s in trauma centers worldwide.

In fact, high-dose steroids were associated with increased mortality. As a result of these studies, the use of high-dose steroids for patients with septic shock has been largely abandoned. However, the use of low-dose steroids for the management of septic shock remains a topic of intense discussion.</p>
            <p>The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency in septic shock has been the focus of several recent clinical studies. In order to better understand the debate, a basic understanding of the role of the adrenal glands is required. The adrenal gland produces several substances including sympathetic hormones and glucocorticoids, including cortisol. Cortisol has immunologic and anti-inflammatory effects including inhibition of many proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 [IL-1], IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, interferon-γ [INF-γ], and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]). It also stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and decreases the local inflammatory reaction. Cortisol also plays a vital role in maintaining vascular tone and endothelial integrity. In addition, cortisol potentiates the vasoconstrictor effects of catecholamines. During critical illness, the normal physiologic response results in the stimulation of the adrenal glands and an increase in cortisol production by up to 6-fold. During sepsis, the adrenal gland’s ability to increase cortisol production may be impaired. Multiple factors contribute to this including high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, decreased glucorticoid sensitivity of receptors, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by various medications. The end result is a state of relative adrenal insufficiency.</p>
            <p>In the recent past, numerous trials have been undertaken to evaluate the use of low-dose steroids in sepsis. Low-dose steroid use is defined as ≤300 mg of hydrocortisone (or an equivalent steroid) over long duration ≤5 days. In 2002, Annane et al published the results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the use of low-dose steroids in patients with septic shock.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885066611408690">64</xref>
               </sup> All patients with septic shock were randomized within 3 hours of the onset of septic shock to either the treatment arm or the placebo arm. Patients underwent a low-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test and relative adrenal insufficiency was defined as a delta cortisol of ≤9 mcg/dL or less. Patients in the treatment arm received hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours and 50 mcg of fludrocortisone orally (PO) daily or matching placebos. Patients that received low-dose steroids showed a decreased time to shock reversal and a decreased mortality compared to placebo. Subsequently, 2 smaller trials and 2 meta-analyses demonstrated similar results.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885066611408690">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885066611408690">66</xref>
               </sup> The findings of these studies suggest that low-dose steroid use in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency significantly improves time to shock reversal and 28-day mortality. However, a follow-up study published in 2008 brought the use of low-dose steroids in septic shock back into question. The CORTICUS trial was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that also evaluated the use of low-dose steroids in patients with septic shock.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885066611408690">67</xref>
               </sup> Patients with septic shock underwent a lose-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test with a delta cortisol of ≤9 mcg/dL used to define relative adrenal insufficiency. Unlike the Annane study, patients in the CORTICUS trial were randomized up to 72 hours after the diagnosis of septic shock to receive either hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours or matching placebos. In this study, the administration of hydrocortisone did not improve shock reversal or mortality. The results of this study called into question, yet again, the benefit of low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock. However, it is important to note that the Annane study and the CORTICUS trial were evaluating potentially different patient populations. In the Annane study, patients were randomized within 3 hours of the onset of septic shock. In the CORTICUS trial, patients were randomized up to 72 hours after the onset of septic shock. In addition, patients in the Annane study received both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisones as opposed to only hydrocortisone in the CORTICUS trial.</p>
            <p>Despite the ongoing debate over the optimal use of low-dose steroids in patients with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines still recommend (GRADE 2C) that hydrocortisone should be considered in patients with septic shock that are not responsive to volume resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885066611408690">68</xref>
               </sup> The dose of hyrdrocortisone given should not exceed 300 mg/d and should be administered in divided doses. The use of fludrocortisone is still considered optional. While the optimal duration of steroids also remains in question, most would agree that steroid administration should continue until the patient is off vasopressor therapy.</p>

            <title>Activated Protein C for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</title>
            <p>In the normal physiologic state, anticoagulation predominates. The major anticoagulant factors are protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Protein C is activated by the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin on the surface of the endothelium. Once activated, protein C directly inhibits factor Va and factor VIIIa in the clotting cascade. In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, there is a decreased expression of thrombomodulin on the vascular endothelium. As a result, there is decreased production of activated protein C (APC). This results in a shift toward the procoagulant state. This shift to a procoagulant state results in microvascular thrombosis, impaired fibrinolysis, and endothelial dysfunction. The microvasculature becomes occluded with resultant tissue hypoxia and direct tissue damage, which ultimately results in organ dysfunction/failure. The extent of coagulation disturbance ranges from mild laboratory abnormalities to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This underlying disruption of the intrinsic production of APC served as the physiologic impetus for the administration of APC as a means to reverse the procoagulant state seen in severe sepsis and septic shock.</p>
            <p>Due to the expense and potential bleeding complications associated with APC, its use should be restricted to patients meeting specific criteria. The administration of APC is currently approved for those patients that are at highest risk of death from sepsis. This includes patients with an APACHE II score of ≥25, patients with multiple organ failure (2 or more organs), septic shock, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis. Because of the inherit risk of bleeding from the administration of APC, its use in surgical patients must be carefully considered. Current absolute contraindications to the use of APC include active internal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke within the preceding 3 months, severe head trauma or intracranial surgery in the preceding 2 months, trauma patients with an increased risk of life-threatening hemorrhage, the presence of an epidural catheter, presence of an intracranial neoplasm, platelet count &lt;30 000/mm<sup>3</sup>, INR &gt;3, or administration of other anticoagulant therapies at therapeutic doses (warfarin and heparin). The use of prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin is not contraindicated. The current guidelines for the use of APC in surgical patients include discontinuing the agent 2 hours prior to an invasive surgical procedure and restarting infusion 12 hours after an invasive surgical procedure. The use of APC has been shown to improve survival in surgical patients with a high risk of death. A recent review of current literature evidence by Barie et al revealed a significant reduction in mortality (odd ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.97) with the administration of APC in surgical patients with an APACHE II score of ≥25.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885066611408690">69</xref>
               </sup> While there is an increased risk of bleeding in surgical patients that receive APC, this survival benefit afforded by the administration of APC is believed to outweigh the risk. However, in those patients with a lower risk of death from sepsis, the administration of APC outweighs the potential benefits due to increased risk of bleeding complications. The 2008 Surviving Sepsis guidelines recommend consideration of APC in adult patients with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction with clinical assessment of high risk of death (typically APACHE II &gt;25 or multiple organ failure) if there are no contraindications (grade 2B and grade 2C for postoperative patients).<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885066611408690">68</xref>
               </sup> They recommend that adult patients with severe sepsis and low risk of death (eg, APACHE II &lt; 20 or 1 organ failure) should not receive APC.</p>

            <title>Implementing Evidence-Based Care</title>
            <p>In an effort to improve sepsis-related mortality, multiple professional organizations have published evidence-based guidelines for the management of sepsis.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885066611408690">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0885066611408690">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0885066611408690">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0885066611408690">72</xref>
               </sup> While there is no question that these evidence-based guidelines have had a positive impact on the management of these patients, the number and complexity of these guidelines make it difficult for bedside clinicians to consistently implement these measures. In addition, some of the early interventions are time sensitive (cultures prior to antibiotics, antibiotics within an hour, achieve goal CVP, and source control within 6 hours) and need to be prioritized. One can easily appreciate the challenges of consistently implementing timely, evidence-based care.</p>
            <p>The relationship between compliance with evidence-based guidelines for sepsis and mortality has been well established. A study by Gao et al demonstrated a 2-fold increase in hospital mortality in patients that did not receive the 6-hour sepsis bundle.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885066611408690">73</xref>
               </sup> In addition, noncompliance with the 24-hour sepsis bundle was associated with a 76% increase in risk of death.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885066611408690">73</xref>
               </sup> A recent multicenter study was conducted to establish the relationship between compliance with the 6-hour and 24-hour sepsis bundles and hospital mortality.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885066611408690">47</xref>
               </sup> Over the 2-year study period, compliance with the 6-hour resuscitation bundle improved from 10.9% to 31.3%. Compliance with the 24-hour management bundle also improved, rising from 18.4% to 36.1%. A concomitant decrease in hospital mortality was seen, with mortality dropping from 37% to 30.8% over the 2-year study period.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885066611408690">47</xref>
               </sup> These studies demonstrate 2 important points: (1) there is a direct relationship between compliance with evidence-based guidelines and patient survival and (2) the vast majority of patients are still not receiving evidence-based care.</p>
            <p>In an effort to improve compliance with the evidence-based guidelines, we have begun utilizing CCDS as a means to effectively implement evidence-based guidelines at the bedside.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066611408690">19</xref>
               </sup> Computerized clinical decision support has proven valuable in implementing other complex, EBGs for critically ill patients.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0885066611408690">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0885066611408690">75</xref>
               </sup> A computer-based algorithm has the ability to accurately and precisely manage clinical interventions, often more consistently than the bedside clinician. We therefore developed a CCDS-based platform to assist us in implementing EBGs for sepsis management. This bedside CCDS program includes an algorithm for goal-directed volume resuscitation, with subsequent real-time prompts for specific therapies such as antibiotics, vasopressors, and further modalities within the initial 24 hours after sepsis identification. Acknowledgment of administered therapies allows the computer logic to proceed to the next step, ensuring compliance with all aspects of the EBGs. Following implementation of CCDS sepsis management in our SICU, we have seen compliance with the 6-hour resuscitation bundle improve from 29% to 79% and sepsis-related mortality has subsequently dropped from 23% to 14%.</p>

         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>Sepsis continues to be a common and often lethal problem in surgical patients. The risk factors for the development of sepsis in surgical patients include the need for emergency surgery, age greater than 65 years, and the presence of preexisting comorbid conditions. Those patients presenting with septic shock that are in need of emergent surgery for source control represent a unique challenge to the surgical team. The utilization of DCL for these patients has been shown to improve survival. Early identification of sepsis and implementation of evidence-based care has been demonstrated to improved outcomes. However, the early identification of sepsis and implementation of evidence-based care continues to present a significant challenge for clinicians. The utilization of sepsis screening and evidence-based sepsis management protocols can increase compliance with resultant improvement in patient outcomes.</p>
