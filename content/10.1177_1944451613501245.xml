<p>“I use quotes around “pain” and “feeling” because these are mental states that seem inseparable from consciousness.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the practice of anesthesia, we think a lot about pain. It is kind of a disconnected thing, this thinking, because we are trying to put ourselves into our patient’s shoes and imagine the “pain” that their bodies are “feeling” during surgery while under anesthesia. I use quotes around “pain” and “feeling” because these are mental states that seem inseparable from consciousness. It is almost a philosopher’s question, like the one about a tree falling in the woods: Is the unconscious brain, one without thoughts, perceptions, or memories, able to form the mental representation of pain? How does a feeling of pain register with any persistence within pharmaceutically disordered neural pathways?</p>
<p>Awake humans can tell you that they are feeling pain. There are many different adjectives to describe pain: crampy, burning, electric, sharp, dull, and just plain sore to name a few. What if you are an organism without language? Do animals feel pain? Of course they do, because they have the same nociceptive pathways and the same nonverbal behavioral responses that humans do. Nevertheless there is a tendency for humans to presume that “lower” forms of life have less well developed central nervous systems and thus do not experience pain as intensely as we do. This thinking had led in the past to some egregious abuses of animals involved in scientific/medical research.</p>
<p>For example, it was not uncommon in the past for animals undergoing major, invasive experimental surgical preparation to be paralyzed with neuromuscular blocking drugs but given only light or no anesthesia. When these terrible practices came to light, it helped bring forward in the 1960s the first regulations of animal use in medical research. A federal bureaucracy housed in the Department of Agriculture has arisen to oversee the treatment of animals in such widely disparate pursuits as circuses, Las Vegas shows, and the biomedical research community. Outside of government, the animal rights movement continues as a goad to ensure proper conduct and care in research that, of necessity, uses animal models; however, the movement’s goal of the complete abolition of animals for this purpose is naive and in some cases cynically obtuse.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at my institution for 12 years, and over this time I have seen remarkable changes and advances in laboratory veterinary medicine, especially in the area of pain management. In deliberating on the “humaneness” of how animal experiments are being conducted, the committee now requires the rational use of neuromuscular blocking agents and adherence to the concepts of multimodal analgesia and minimum alveolar concentration of anesthetic that will ensure adequate analgesia and depth of anesthesia. These standards are equivalent, if not higher than those used for human patients in the operating room.</p>
<p>This much-improved picture of how animals are treated while conducting scientific research parallels improvement in how pain is managed postoperatively and in the ICU. In fact, animals used in pain studies have elucidated new drugs and approaches that have enabled people to recover faster and far less painfully than before. In this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic>, we publish an excellent review article on the management of patients who start out with chronic pain and then undergo a surgical procedure or have a traumatic accident that superimposes an acute painful insult onto their chronic pain profile. I find these patients among the most difficult to manage because their central nervous systems have already been “revved up” and sensitized to feel pain more intensely and persistently. The usual drugs and doses that are effective at managing pain in normal patients are woefully inadequate for these patients with <italic>acute-on-chronic</italic> pain. That is why this article is so timely and helpful for ICU practitioners to review. It provides an effective framework for approaching these patients and strong guidance on the most effective agents to use in them.</p>
<p>Additional articles published in this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic> include a review of the use of dexmedetomidine to aid in awake fiberoptic intubations and an original article with excellent data to weigh in on the question of whether volume-controlled or pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation is better for brain-injured patients. There is also a research methods article that describes the approach to study interprofessional collaborations within the ICU. Finally, we conclude with 2 interesting cases that we hope will hold the readers interest.</p>
