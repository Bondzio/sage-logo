<title>Background:</title>
<p>Many patients with an unhealed cuff after repair show functional improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513485719">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To evaluate outcomes of arthroscopically repaired massive rotator cuff tears and to identify prognostic factors affecting rotator cuff healing and functional outcome, especially in patients with failed rotator cuff healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513485719">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513485719">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Among 173 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of a massive rotator cuff tear, 108 patients with a mean age of 63.7 years were included. Outcome evaluation was completed both anatomically (CT arthrography or ultrasonography) and functionally at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively; mean follow-up period was 31.68 ± 15.81 months. Various factors affecting cuff healing were analyzed, and factors affecting functional outcome were evaluated in patients with failed repairs using both univariate and multivariate analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513485719">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The anatomic failure rate was 39.8% in arthroscopically repaired massive rotator cuff tears; however, functional status significantly improved regardless of cuff healing (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Several factors were associated with failure of cuff healing in the univariate analysis, but only fatty infiltration (FI) of the infraspinatus was significantly related to healing failure in the multivariate analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .04). Among patients with failed rotator cuff healing, only reduced postoperative acromiohumeral distance (AHD) was related to poor functional outcome in the multivariate analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .01), with a cutoff value of 4.1 mm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513485719">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Despite a high rate of healing failures, arthroscopic repair can be recommended in patients with massive rotator cuff tears because of the functional gain at midterm follow-up. Higher FI of the infraspinatus was the single most important factor negatively affecting cuff healing. In cases of failed massive rotator cuff repair, no preoperative factor was able to predict poor functional outcome; reduced postoperative AHD was the only relevant functional determinant in the patients’ eventual functional outcome and should be considered when ascertaining a prognosis and planning further treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Massive rotator cuff tears, defined as a tear involving more than 2 cuff tendons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546513485719">55</xref></sup> or a tear of more than 5 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513485719">9</xref></sup> compose 10% to 40% of all rotator cuff tears and approximately 80% of recurrent tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513485719">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513485719">28</xref></sup> Massive rotator cuff tears have different characteristics than smaller tears, and patients with symptomatic massive rotator cuff tears could suffer from diminished strength, limited range of motion (ROM), and debilitating pain. Fortunately, with the development of operative techniques and instrumentation, the majority of rotator cuff tears, even massive tears, can be repaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513485719">29</xref></sup>; therefore, primary rotator cuff repair is highly recommended even for patients with massive cuff tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513485719">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513485719">33</xref></sup> However, the overall outcome after repair of a massive tear is less predictable and less satisfactory with a high failure rate even if a complete repair is achievable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513485719">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513485719">14</xref></sup> The reported failure rate after arthroscopic repair of large and massive cuff tears has been reported as up to 94%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513485719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0363546513485719">54</xref></sup> This is attributed to the fact that chronic massive tears are more commonly associated with poor tissue quality with advanced fatty infiltration (FI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513485719">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513485719">30</xref></sup> and the disruption of glenohumeral mechanics with decreased acromiohumeral distance (AHD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513485719">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513485719">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to consider the difference between anatomic and functional outcomes after surgical repair because some patients with massive rotator cuff tears will have functionally satisfactory outcomes in spite of failed rotator cuff healing after repair. Previous authors have also reported that anatomic outcome does not seem to be associated with functional outcome, as many patients with an unhealed cuff after repair show functional improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513485719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513485719">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513485719">20</xref></sup> We therefore wanted to know which factors are associated with function in patients after massive cuff tear repair, particularly for failed repair. Knowledge of these factors will help to determine the prognosis and further treatment strategies in the circumstances of healing failure, which is prevalent after massive rotator cuff repair. The purposes of the current study were to evaluate outcomes after arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears, to identify prognostic factors affecting rotator cuff healing, and ultimately to determine the factors influencing functional outcome in failed rotator cuff healing (primary outcome variable). We hypothesized that the arthroscopically repaired massive rotator cuff tears would have different characteristics in outcomes and its predictors and that there might be a significant factor in the patients’ eventual functional outcome in failed rotator cuff healing.</p>

<title>Demographic Data</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study protocol. Between February 2004 and December 2010, 173 consecutive patients underwent arthroscopic repair for a massive rotator cuff tear at the authors’ institution. Patients with massive rotator cuff tears were considered surgical candidates for arthroscopic repair if they did not have irreparable tears combined with advanced cuff tear arthropathy and if they had persistent severe pain and disability not responding to at least 6 months of adequate nonoperative treatment. The inclusion criteria of the study were patients who underwent complete repair. In addition, postoperative cuff integrity had to be verified by computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) or ultrasonography (USG) a minimum of 1 year postoperatively, and patients had to be evaluated by various functional outcome instruments preoperatively and at least 1 year postoperatively.</p>
<p>We defined massive rotator cuff tears as complete detachment of 2 or more tendons on arthroscopic findings, according to the criteria described by Zumstein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546513485719">55</xref></sup> Exclusion criteria were partial repair (n = 5), previous surgery on the same shoulder (n = 6), severe glenohumeral arthritis (stage 3 according to Hamada et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513485719">19</xref></sup> classification; n = 5), or workers’ compensation status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513485719">32</xref></sup> (n = 5). Patients who did not undergo CTA/USG (n = 21) or functional outcome evaluation (n = 10) at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively and those who were lost to follow-up before reaching 12 months (n = 13) were also excluded. A total of 108 patients with an average age of 63.7 ± 6.4 years (range, 42-77 years) were included in the study.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect the outcome of arthroscopic repair, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, preoperative pain intensity, comorbidities, hand dominance, bone and tissue quality (bone marrow density and fatty infiltration), preoperative stiffness and pseudoparalysis, tear size and location, acromiohumeral distance, repair technique, and concomitant surgical procedures (distal clavicle resection and biceps procedures) were prospectively collected and evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513485719">Table 1</xref>). A clinical researcher with over 9 years of experience (H.R.K.) prospectively collected a full dataset on all patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery at our institution (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital). There was no traumatic massive tear followed by arthroscopic repair soon after acute trauma. Sports activity was defined as high (dynamic or contact sports: eg, boxing, rugby, basketball, football, volleyball, tennis), medium (static sports: eg, golf, yoga, swimming, bicycling, running), and low. High work level was defined as heavy manual labor, medium as manual labor with less activity, and low as sedentary work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513485719">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513485719">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>Forward elevation was measured in degrees between the arm and the thorax with the elbow held straight. External rotation at the side was measured in degrees between the thorax and the forearm with the arm held in an adducted position at 90° of elbow flexion. Internal rotation at the back was measured by the vertebral level reached with the tip of the thumb and numbered serially as 1 to 12 for the 1st to 12th thoracic vertebra, 13 to 17 for the 1st to 5th lumbar vertebra, and 18 for any level below the sacral region. A clinical researcher measured the ROM of each patient with a goniometer. Shoulder stiffness was defined for forward elevation as &lt;120° passively, external rotation as &lt;30° passively, and internal rotation at the back as lower than L3 passively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513485719">39</xref></sup> Pseudoparalysis was defined as active shoulder elevation &lt;90° in the presence of full passive forward elevation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513485719">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients’ bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the last outpatient visit before surgery using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy, enCORE version 8.8, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin), and the lowest T-score of the proximal femur and lumbar spine, except the value for the Ward area of the proximal femur, was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513485719">1</xref></sup> The FI of each rotator cuff muscle (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis) was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetom Avanto 1.5-T system, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; and Philips Gyroscan Interia, Philips Medical Systems, Utrecht, the Netherlands), according to the criteria established by Goutallier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513485719">16</xref></sup> and modified by Fuchs et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513485719">13</xref></sup> at the most lateral section of the oblique sagittal image, at the point where the scapular spine was still in continuity with the body of the scapula forming a Y-shape.</p>

<title>Data of Patients and Massive Rotator Cuff Tears</title>
<p>Of the 108 patients, there were 44 men and 64 women, with 91 patients (84.2%) having tears that involved their dominant arm. The mean duration of symptoms was 34.2 ± 36.4 months (range, 1-120 months); mean follow-up period was 31.7 ± 15.8 months (range, 14-71 months). Thirty-one patients (28.7%) had anterosuperior (supraspinatus and subscapularis) complete tears, 60 patients (55.6%) had posterosuperior (supraspinatus and infraspinatus and/or teres minor) complete tears, and 17 patients (15.7%) had complete tears of all 3 muscles. The mean AP tear size was 4.94 ± 0.95 cm, and the mean amount of retraction was 4.60 ± 0.89 cm. The mean FI grades were 3.13 ± 0.93 for the supraspinatus, 2.11 ± 1.05 for the infraspinatus, and 1.68 ± 0.92 for the subscapularis. The mean preoperative AHD was 6.96 ± 2.57 mm (range, 0.8-11.1 mm). Forty-three patients (39.8%) underwent cuff repair with a single-row technique and 65 patients (60.2%) with a double-row technique.</p>

Distal clavicle resection was performed in patients who experienced symptomatic acromioclavicular arthritis, and biceps tenotomy or tenodesis was performed for symptomatic biceps tears involving more than 50% of the tendon and for symptomatic, degenerative superior labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions, according to the age and activity level of the patient. If the patient had a stiff shoulder, concomitant manipulation under anesthesia with an arthroscopic capsular release was performed.</p>
<p>The repair technique was either single or double row. Of the 2 techniques, the better method to cover the footprint was chosen according to tendon status, tear configuration, and tendon mobilization. The torn cuff was carefully mobilized at the bursal and articular sides; however, we did not perform interval slide procedures for the repair. Instead, the mobile posterior cuff was shifted to the anterior side of the footprint to achieve coverage. If the mobile posterior cuff was enough to cover the footprint, a double-row repair of a transosseous-equivalent type was performed for the posterior cuff. The anterior cuff usually could not be mobilized to the lateral footprint, so a single-row repair with or without margin convergence sutures was performed. All knots were tied securely using self-locking and sliding knots, followed by 3 consecutive half-hitches on alternating posts.</p>
<p>Immobilization after cuff repair was maintained with an abduction brace at 60° for 6 weeks. Shrugging of both shoulders, active elbow flexion/extension, active forearm supination/pronation, and active hand and wrist motion were encouraged immediately after surgery. Active-assisted ROM exercises were allowed after the patients were weaned off the brace following 6 weeks of immobilization. Muscle strengthening exercises were started at 12 weeks, and sports activities were permitted at 6 months after surgery. All rehabilitation was supervised by the Department of Rehabilitation at our institution.</p>

<title>Outcome Assessment</title>
<p>Anatomic assessment of postoperative rotator cuff healing was evaluated either by CTA (n = 73) or USG (n = 35) at a mean of 13.1 ± 3.2 months (range, 12-16 months) after surgery. Experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, who were unaware of the present study, performed and interpreted CTA or USG and further evaluated rotator cuff healing to the greater tuberosity. In the interpretation of CTA, contrast media leakage through the footprint was regarded as a failure, and maintenance of the cuff insertion into the footprint defined a healed cuff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513485719">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546513485719">51</xref></sup> For USG, the criteria for the diagnosis of an unhealed cuff were as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513485719">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0363546513485719">53</xref></sup>: no observation of the repaired tendon attributable to retraction, focal defect, or gap within the repaired tendon with consecutive loss of the normal anterior arc of the subdeltoid bursa; loss of the repaired supraspinatus substance with widening of the gap between the supraspinatus and biceps tendons; and hypoechoic or anechoic cleft extending through the entire substance of the repaired cuff.</p>
<p>Functional outcomes were evaluated by means of ROM, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, simple shoulder test (SST), and Constant score. The SST was converted to a 100-point scale from a 12-point scale (multiplying by 100/12) to aid in comparison. This has been described by previous authors when comparing shoulder scoring scales in rotator cuff repair evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513485719">45</xref></sup> Functional outcome assessment was conducted at preoperative admission (108 patients), 1 year after surgery (101 patients), and at a final follow-up period (108 patients). Five patients underwent their final functional outcome measures at 1 year; thus, the final follow-up functional outcome data for these patients were obtained. The patients with an unhealed cuff after repair were divided into 2 groups of good or poor function based on the ASES score, as the ASES score has been widely used and well validated for the evaluation of outcome after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513485719">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546513485719">52</xref></sup> Good function was defined as &gt;80 points and poor function as &lt;80 points on the ASES score, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513485719">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513485719">43</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>An independent <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for the analyses of the continuous variables, and the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test was used for the categorical variables to determine the differences according to cuff healing and functional outcome. A paired <italic>t</italic> test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare the preoperative and postoperative scores for the functional outcome instruments. In addition, correlation analysis using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) was performed to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the AHD measurement. The reliability of preoperative and postoperative AHD was excellent (ICCs of 0.977 and 0.944 for intraobserver and interobserver reliability of preoperative AHD, respectively, and 0.912 and 0.848 for postoperative AHD, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors affecting anatomic and functional outcomes by inputting the significant variables derived from the univariate analysis using the stepwise forward conditional method. To determine the cutoff value of AHD for functional outcome, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with a calculation of the area under the ROC curve was performed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>

<title>Outcomes After Arthroscopic Repair</title>
<p>There were no complications other than failure of healing and early postoperative shoulder stiffness. There was no infection, wound problem, axillary nerve injury, or deltoid muscle problem. Ten patients (9.3%) showed early postoperative shoulder stiffness at 3 months; however, it was resolved after extensive physical therapy.</p>
<p>For anatomic outcome, repaired rotator cuffs did not heal in 43 of 108 patients (39.8%). The location of anatomic failure was superior (supraspinatus) in 10 patients (23.3%), anterosuperior (supraspinatus and subscapularis) in 6 (14.0%), posterosuperior (supraspinatus and infraspinatus and/or teres minor) in 8 (18.6%), and all cuff muscles in 19 (44.2%). The mean size of failed repairs was 2.80 ± 1.37 cm in the AP dimension and 2.93 ± 1.29 cm in the amount of retraction, and it was significantly smaller than the initial tear size (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>For functional outcome, 38 of 108 patients (35.2%) showed poor functional outcome, which was defined as &lt;80 points for the ASES score in this study. Overall, ROM was significantly improved in forward flexion (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) but not in external and internal rotations both at postoperative evaluations of 1 year and at the final follow-up. All patients achieved significant improvements in every functional outcome measurement of pain (VAS, ASES, Constant, and SST scores) evaluated at 1 year and at the last follow-up visit (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513485719">Table 2</xref>). Final functional outcomes at a mean follow-up of 31.7 ± 15.8 months were not statistically different between healed cuffs and unhealed cuffs with respect to ROM (all <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05), VAS score for pain (<italic>P</italic> = .210), ASES score (<italic>P</italic> = .06), Constant score (<italic>P</italic> = .1), and SST score (<italic>P</italic> = .174) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513485719">Table 3</xref>). As functional outcome was not significantly worse in spite of the failure in healing, and all patients were satisfied with the result, we did not perform reoperations to treat healing failures.</p>

<title>Factors Affecting Functional Outcome in Unhealed Cuffs</title>
<p>Among 43 patients with unhealed cuffs, 29 patients (67.4%) who scored &gt;80 points on the ASES score at the last follow-up were allocated into the subgroup of good function, and 14 patients (32.6%) who scored &lt;80 points on the ASES score were allocated into the subgroup of poor function. The mean follow-up period between the 2 subgroups was not statistically different (good function subgroup: 32.48 ± 15.46 months; poor function subgroup: 38.85 ± 15.60 months; <italic>P</italic> = .214). In the univariate analysis, longer symptom duration (<italic>P</italic> = .027), higher FI of the infraspinatus and subscapularis (<italic>P</italic> = .049 and <italic>P</italic> = .017, respectively), larger AP tear size (<italic>P</italic> = .043), amount of retraction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and reduced preoperative and postoperative AHD (<italic>P</italic> = .048 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively) were related to poor functional outcome assessed by the ASES score (see Appendix 2, available online). However, in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, no preoperative factor was able to predict poor functional outcome; only reduced postoperative AHD was a relevant functional determinant negatively affecting the patients’ eventual functional outcome (<italic>P</italic> = .01) (see Appendix 3, available online). The cutoff value of postoperative AHD corresponding with the highest accuracy based on ROC curves to predict functional outcome was 4.1 mm (sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 85.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513485719">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that functional outcome improved regardless of cuff healing in patients with arthroscopically repaired massive rotator cuff tears. Fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus was the only independent prognostic factor for healing, and postoperative AHD was the only relevant functional determinant for the eventual functional outcome in patients with failed massive rotator cuff repairs.</p>
<p>Failure of healing after arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears is a common problem,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513485719">29</xref></sup> and the present study showed results (39.8% failure rate) comparable with those of previous published studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513485719">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513485719">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546513485719">49</xref></sup> However, functional outcome improved regardless of the healing failure in the current study. Even though there were some controversies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513485719">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546513485719">49</xref></sup> many authors reported notable functional improvement after rotator cuff repair despite the absence of healing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513485719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513485719">23</xref></sup> which is consistent with this result. We believe that the decrease of tear size in failed repairs, which could be looked at as a partial repair, and subacromial decompression with acromioplasty might have led to functional improvement in spite of failed repairs. Therefore, we believe rotator cuff repair could be considered even if the possibility of healing seems to be low in massive rotator cuff tears without arthropathy because patients can have a satisfactory functional outcome regardless of healing failure.</p>
<p>In this study, we revealed that only FI of the infraspinatus was an independent prognostic factor negatively influencing structural integrity after arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears. Previously, Chung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513485719">7</xref></sup> reported that FI of the infraspinatus, amount of retraction, and BMD were all independent prognostic factors for the failure of cuff healing after arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, in the current study, we confined the cohort only to massive rotator cuff tears, all having large amounts of retraction. Also, the chronic and retracted tears led to local osteoporosis around the tuberosities, so general osteoporosis did not seem to affect much of the cuff healing in the present cohort with massive tears. We believe that the difference of cohorts between the 2 studies, full-thickness tears versus massive cuff tears, produced different results. The importance of FI of the infraspinatus on outcome has been suggested by several authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513485719">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513485719">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513485719">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513485719">37</xref></sup> Goutallier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513485719">16</xref></sup> reported that the presence of FI of the infraspinatus had a highly positive correlation on the recurrence of cuff tears, and more recently, Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513485719">22</xref></sup> also confirmed the importance of FI of the infraspinatus in their series of massive rotator cuff tears. High FI of the infraspinatus, rather than the supraspinatus or subscapularis, especially in cases of grade 3 or 4, would be the best indicator of poor muscle quality, and other variables such as age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513485719">34</xref></sup> sex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513485719">44</xref></sup> symptom duration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513485719">25</xref></sup> tear size,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513485719">3</xref></sup> and FI of other cuff muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513485719">17</xref></sup> may be surrogate factors for healing after arthroscopic massive rotator cuff repair.</p>
<p>Because not all patients with failed cuff healing of arthroscopically repaired massive tears experience poor functional results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513485719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0363546513485719">54</xref></sup> it is important to know which factors affect functional outcome under these circumstances. In this study, the ASES score was used to discern a good or poor functional outcome in patients with failed cuff healing. The ASES questionnaire has been well validated and is known to be highly reproducible, valid, and responsive to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513485719">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546513485719">52</xref></sup> Previously, Park et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513485719">41</xref></sup> defined satisfactory outcomes as an ASES score of &gt;80 points. Similarly, other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513485719">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513485719">43</xref></sup> have subdivided the ASES score into 4 grades (&gt;80, 61-80, 41-60, and &lt;40), with &gt;80 points considered an excellent result. We also believe that the criterion of 80 points is reasonable, as patients in our practice with an ASES score of &lt;80 points were usually unsatisfied with their surgical result and sought additional treatment.</p>
<p>It is interesting that several factors that reflect chronicity of the tear (longer symptom duration, higher grade of FI, larger tear size, and narrow preoperative AHD) consistently affected functional outcome in our analysis of patients with failed healing of massive rotator cuff repair. Therefore, we should keep paying attention to these factors when trying to predict functional outcomes of patients whose cuffs failed to heal. In addition to these preoperative factors including preoperative AHD, postoperative AHD was also associated with functional outcome; even more, it was the only independently relevant functional determinant in the eventual functional outcome of patients with failed cuff healing. Controversy still exists as to the effect of AHD on functional outcome, with several authors showing no correlation between AHD and functional outcome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513485719">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513485719">26</xref></sup> while other authors have demonstrated the prognostic value of AHD on functional outcome after rotator cuff repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513485719">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513485719">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546513485719">50</xref></sup> However, postoperative AHD should be considered differently from preoperative AHD, as the postoperative condition after rotator cuff repair surgery could affect the AHD measurement because of the performed acromioplasty, repaired rotator cuff acting as a space holder, improved stabilization of the glenohumeral joint, or the progressive narrowing of AHD due to failure of the repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513485719">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513485719">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513485719">48</xref></sup> Preoperative AHD might be reversible according to the surgical procedures and cuff healing. On the other hand, postoperative AHD could be regarded as a determined indicator of rotator cuff function after surgery. Thus, we believe that postoperative AHD is a more relevant functional determinant for eventual function, especially in massive rotator cuff tears. In this study, postoperative AHD was decreased compared with preoperative levels in patients with poor function and unhealed cuffs. We believe that postoperative narrowing of the AHD means the disruption of the normal glenohumeral mechanics because of cuff healing failure, which may result in poor function. On the other hand, small gains made in AHD postoperatively could mean the regaining of the force couple and stable glenohumeral joint by a partial healing effect after rotator cuff repair in spite of the failure of complete healing, which may ensure good function.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we determined the cutoff value of postoperative AHD related to functional outcome to be 4.1 mm. If the last measured postoperative AHD is less than 4.1 mm, poor functional outcome might be expected in patients with failed healing of massive rotator cuff tears, and further treatment such as re-repair or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty may be considered. Conversely, if postoperative AHD is greater than 4.1 mm, nonoperative management could be recommended in spite of healing failure. Therefore, the data of the current study may help surgeons counsel patients who failed to have successful healing after arthroscopic massive rotator cuff repair about their expected functional outcomes and to plan further treatment strategies.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study include the fact that the investigation was performed in a homogeneous group of patients who underwent only arthroscopic repair by 1 surgeon, with a relatively large number of cases of massive rotator cuff tears (108 patients) with various potential prognostic factors. However, we recognize that the current study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, although most variables were gathered prospectively. Even though we revealed the independent prognostic factors using multivariate regression analysis, there could also be selection bias and a confounding effect, of which we were not aware. A well-organized, prospective cohort study might be needed. Second, not all patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears were included because of strict inclusion criteria. Some patients refused CTA and even USG because they did not want the rather expensive and time-consuming procedures. This dropout from the cohort might cause a risk of selection bias, of which we were not aware. Third, the mean follow-up period was relatively short (31.7 ± 15.8 months). It is possible that functional status may further improve or depreciate in the long term. Fourth, even though true shoulder AP radiographs were taken in a standardized manner (patients standing and the arm held in neutral rotation at the level of the shoulder joint), there could be a subtle difference in the angle of radiographs and in the arm position or patient comfort level during the examination, which could make a difference in the measurement of AHD. Fifth, we utilized 2 evaluation methods (either CTA or USG) for the assessment of postoperative cuff integrity, which could decrease the consistency of interpretation. In addition, there was no validation process of the ability to detect cuff healing failure. However, CTA is known to be a valuable method to confirm postoperative cuff integrity, with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513485719">36</xref></sup> and USG also has been described as an accurate method in the evaluation of rotator cuff integrity, with a 98% detection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513485719">12</xref></sup> Moreover, to minimize examiner dependency and avoid surgeon prejudice, experienced musculoskeletal radiologists who were unaware of the present study performed USG and interpreted cuff integrity according the given strict criteria. Thus, we do not believe this compromised our ability to analyze cuff healing status.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the anatomic failure rate was 39.8% after arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears; however, the functional status improved at the midterm follow-up regardless of cuff healing. Fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus was the most independent prognostic factor negatively affecting cuff healing of massive rotator cuff tears. In cases of failed rotator cuff healing, no preoperative factor was able to predict poor functional outcome; reduced postoperative AHD was the only relevant functional determinant for the eventual worse functional outcome and should be considered when ascertaining a prognosis and planning further treatment strategies.</p>
