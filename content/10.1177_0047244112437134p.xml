<p>The best writers require us to approach them on their own terms and, as the editors point out, <italic>Saturn’s Moons</italic> is in part modelled on Sebald’s own method. The seemingly heterogeneous chapters prove to be subtly interrelated; texts by others are incorporated, mirroring the author’s practice of <italic>bricolage</italic>; and the black-and-white photos complement the narrative and constitute one of their own. But if the <italic>Handbook</italic> is to fulfil its purpose, it must depart from the author’s methods in order to shed light on them.</p>
<p>How much to reveal about <italic>W. G. Sebald</italic> is not a simple question. The degree to which he incorporated not just the texts, but also the lives of others into his fictions is greater than we can know − and those involved have a right to privacy. And, to borrow a metaphor from <italic>Austerlitz</italic>, the author may have viewed his works in part as cryptic crosswords to be solved by the reader independently. At any rate, questions posed −<italic>What does 24 September mean?</italic> − double as clues to which answers are often hidden in plain sight. Nevertheless, although Sebald suggests that finding the solutions would be worthwhile, he is suspiciously vague about the effort involved. The <italic>Handbook’s</italic> great value is that it does an immense amount of work for us without revealing too much.</p>
<p>Mark Anderson picks up the story where Sebald himself began it, with the marriage of his maternal grandparents in 1905. The author incorporated more members of his mother’s side of the family into his fictions, dwelling in particular on his maternal grandfather. This emphasis is reflected in Anderson’s essay on the years 1944 to 1952, which frames Sebald’s childhood within the larger context of the Allgäu, thus helping the reader to distinguish between his actual <italic>Heimat</italic> and the semi-fictional one in his works. <italic>Saturn’s Moons</italic> skips over the author’s years in Sonthofen, and Richard Sheppard picks up the biographical thread in 1963 and carries it through to 1975. These years, less familiar to readers, were critical for Sebald’s intellectual development and ultimate choice of home and work, and Sheppard shows how they flowed into his essays and fictions. <italic>Saturn’s Moons</italic> then turns to Sebald’s career at UEA from 1970 to 2001. Gordon Turner’s descriptions of his duties, illustrated by anecdotes from former students, give way to more sustained observations by Luke Williams, a creative writing student. Finally, Florian Radvan describes the experience of writing a doctoral thesis under Sebald’s supervision. Given that the narrator’s rare remarks about his academic career grow darker over time, the picture that emerges here − of a passionate teacher who left his mark on students and colleagues, not just readers − may surprise.</p>
<p><italic>Saturn’s Moons</italic> next transitions to Sebald’s critical work. Uwe Schütte’s insightful overview of these writings will be especially appreciated by those who do not read German. Michael Hulse and Anthea Bell then address the problems of translation. From very different perspectives, they discuss the complexities of Sebald’s ‘concern for the English reader’ and shed light on why the translations into English differ from his work in German and from translations into other languages. Clive Scott’s analysis of Sebald’s use of visual images could be read for its method alone. His careful documentation of the author’s interest in the theory of photography, using marginalia from texts in the <italic>Nachlass</italic>, is to be appreciated. Ulrich von Bülow’s essay on that <italic>Nachlass</italic> in the DLA is important not only for its description of <italic>what</italic> it contains, but also for its observations on <italic>why</italic> it contains what it does and no more. One might well wonder whether Sebald considered his <italic>Nachlass</italic> an extension of, rather than a key to, his published work.</p>
<p>The ‘Catalogue of W. G. Sebald’s Library’, with the limitations mentioned in Jo Catling’s matching essay, will be indispensable to any serious researcher, as will the extensive ‘Primary Bibliography’ and ‘Secondary Bibliography’, the ‘Reviews of Works by W. G. Sebald’, the ‘Audio-Visual Bibliography’, and the ‘Index to Interviews with W. G. Sebald’. Finally, the ‘Chronology’ complements the biographical essays and sheds much light on the distinction between author and narrator.</p>
<p>In his afterword, Stephen Watts offers a glimpse of that W. G. Sebald about which <italic>Saturn’s Moons</italic> is mainly silent. Could readers of <italic>Austerlitz</italic> have guessed, prior to reading Watts’s tribute to a friendship with a man called ‘Max’, what lay behind a rucksack, a few lines from a poem, and a handful of London place names? The essay reveals why many, precisely because they cannot explain themselves, experience Sebald’s work as intensely personal. In an interview given to <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> shortly before his death, Sebald insisted on a distinction between the private citizen and the author. Watts suggests that he may not have always maintained it.</p>
