<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>When reading “The Reliability of Arthroscopic Classification of Acetabular Rim Labrochondral Disease” by Nepple et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480110">3</xref></sup> it is obvious how, even in orthopaedic practice, the application of the same seemingly objective evaluation criteria by many experts may produce differing results. Nepple and colleagues used the Cohen kappa (κ) factor to report the ability of 4 arthroscopic hip surgeons to classify 40 procedures for assessment of labrum and articular cartilage into the 5 types of labral and cartilage states defined by the Beck criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480110">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480110">2</xref></sup> based on reviews of standardized arthroscopic videos. By asking the surgeons to repeat the process 2 weeks later, both intraobserver and interobserver agreement were able to be calculated. For the labrum, the average interobserver κ of .62 and intraobserver κ of .65 showed substantial reliability, but some disagreements were evident when trying to differentiate degeneration from detachment of the labrum. Concerning the articular cartilage, both average interobserver (κ = .65) and intraobserver (κ = .80) reliabilities showed substantial consistency, with some doubts when cartilage malacia and debonding were differentiated.</p>
<p>The Beck classification has the intrinsic limitation of not considering the evolution and progression of acetabular rim labrochondral changes, and it is difficult to define the condition when several patterns of injury coexist. We have proposed a novel comprehensive classification for acetabular rim lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480110">4</xref></sup> Specifically, we emphasize that acetabular rim changes progress over time, and we classify them as <italic>early</italic> and <italic>severe</italic>. In early lesions, softening and buckling of the acetabular rim may lead progressively to labral degeneration, cartilage erosions, and cartilage flap without involvement of the femoral head, which is normal. Severe conditions, usually evolved from early lesions, vary from partial- or full-thickness defects to periarticular or subchondral cysts (geodes). Large articular cartilage flaps may also detach, with massive exposure of the subchondral bone, and changes may occur on the femoral side over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480110">4</xref></sup> Our classification, the reliability of which has not yet been proven, has been conceived to overcome potential limitations of the Beck criteria. This novel system allows one to classify the condition by using a probe, without the need of recording intraoperative videos, which is a source of bias.</p>
<p>Because the authors focused on acetabular rim labrochondral disease confined to the anterior-superior portion only, their findings may not be applicable to the central and peripheral compartments, the visualization of which can be less optimal. We explored the entire acetabular rim. Acknowledging that more accurate imaging and arthroscopic evaluations would allow one to implement more comprehensive classifications, we outline that these conditions may arise from longstanding disorders, and hip pathoanatomy needs to be assessed properly. Since the prevalence and causative factors of these manifestations are not definitely known at present, the true nature of our classification is to take into account etiological factors and imaging parameters to reasonably provide a more complete picture of the hip condition and morphology. These valuable parameters can be determined on imaging and arthroscopy. Specifically, we show that arthroscopy is sensitive enough to confirm the presence of acetabular rim lesions and to assess their extent—both prognostic factors for poor outcomes—in patients undergoing more invasive procedure such as osteotomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480110">4</xref></sup></p> <sig-block>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>We appreciate the interest in our recent study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480110">1</xref></sup> Indeed, all classification systems are imperfect to some degree. Useful classification systems must be comprehensive enough to adequately capture all key information but not overly complex such that they cannot reliably be utilized in clinical practice. We believe that the Beck classification of labral and articular cartilage pathology represents the current standard for arthroscopic evaluation of intra-articular disease in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Most authors have advocated its use, instead of the classic Outerbridge classification of cartilage lesions, as the Beck criteria are more relevant to the spectrum of pathology seen in FAI. Our current understanding of disease progression and outcomes in FAI is limited, but an ideal classification would also predict these factors. We agree with the limitations of the Beck classification referenced in the letter and note that they were outlined in the discussion portion of our study.</p>
<p>We have noted the authors’ recent publication of “a novel comprehensive classification for acetabular rim lesions” which was published recently in <italic>International Orthopedics</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480110">2</xref></sup> The study proposes a classification of “early” and “severe” acetabular rim lesions. Early lesions describe a spectrum of findings from softening/buckling to labral degeneration, cartilage erosions, and cartilage flap (without femoral head involvement), while severe lesions describe a spectrum of findings from partial-thickness cartilage loss, full-thickness lesions, and periarticular/subchondral cysts. We appreciate the authors’ attempt to introduce a novel classification. However, we have concerns that a classification system with only 2 disease categories will not adequately characterize the spectrum of intra-articular abnormalities encountered with FAI. The authors report that their classification requires only arthroscopic images of examination with an arthroscopic probe and is applicable to the entire hip joint. The use of arthroscopic videos in reliability studies of knee and shoulder disease is well established. Static arthroscopic images often have difficulty characterizing dynamic factors that can be seen intraoperatively. We believe static arthroscopic images are more likely to introduce bias than are arthroscopic videos. Nevertheless, one method should not be deemed superior without comparing the two methods directly. The Beck classification is applicable to pathology in the entire central compartment as well as the peripheral compartment. In our study we chose to focus on the anterosuperior acetabular rim for several reasons. The majority of pathology in FAI is localized to this region. Additionally, focusing on a specific quadrant eliminates confusion of classification when several areas having varying degrees of pathology are present. This however does not represent a weakness of the Beck classification.</p>
<p>In summary, as outlined in our study, we believe that while the Beck criteria are imperfect, they do represent the current standard for disease classification. We demonstrated substantial interobserver reliability of the Beck classification and noted several common sources of disagreement. We agree that continued efforts to improve disease classification systems in the hip are warranted, but we do not believe the authors’ classification system improves the characterization of disease or is likely to improve the level of reliability of disease classification. Ultimately a classification system should have a reliable grading scheme that is prognostic with respect to outcomes and/or risk of further disease progression. Future investigations are needed to identify the most appropriate classification scheme(s).</p>
