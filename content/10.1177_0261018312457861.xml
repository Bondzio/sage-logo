<abstract>
<p>New Labour came to power promising to offer a new, evidence based approach towards drug policy. However, despite early promise, the latter years of the Labour government descended towards tabloid led criminal justice populism. During the same period, the Conservative opposition often gave contradictory messages on policy, although they increasingly appeared to veer towards a hard-line, abstinence based approach. In power they have moved quickly to produce a drugs strategy that promises a move towards a ‘recovery’ agenda. This article reviews and evaluates the evolving Conservative Party policies on drugs misuse and explores whether the strategy lives up to its ambitious rhetoric and its stated aim to follow evidence based policies. It finds a mixture of laudable aims; vague and sometimes contradictory statements; proposals that are unsupported, and sometimes contraindicated, by evidence; and policy goals that are often at risk of being undermined by a wider policy agenda that threatens to marginalize people with drug problems still further.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are few areas of social policy in more need of an evidence based approach than drugs policy. It has long been argued that governments of all parties have been more influenced by media led moral panics than rational, evidenced based thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261018312457861">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261018312457861">Critcher, 2003</xref>). Whilst undoubtedly drug use can cause problems for individual users, their families and communities, many users have been able to use substances without experiencing difficulties or causing difficulties for others. The concept of problematic drug use is much contested, with some, including many in the media and political circles, seeing any illegal drug use as problematic; the New Labour drug strategies focusing on usage of heroin, crack cocaine and drug related crime and others focusing on whether substance use is causing the user or others problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261018312457861">Cave et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457861">Hunt and Stevens, 2004</xref>). This paper will focus on the developing Conservative policies to users of drugs controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971): as arguably, in the eyes of policymakers, the continued criminalization of these users signifies any usage as problematic.</p>
<p>For over 40 years there has been a good deal of consensus between the main parties on the drugs issue. Both had supported the implementation of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MoDA) and the continued criminalization of drug use. Both also supported the move towards harm reduction in the 1980s, promoting needle exchanges and substitute prescribing of the synthetic substitute drug, methadone, as a way of tackling the spread of HIV/AIDS amongst injecting heroin users. Injecting heroin users were increasingly offered substitute prescription of methadone at a steady dosage; an approach known as maintenance prescribing. This was a pragmatic acceptance of the evidence that harm reduction policies could reduce harm at individual, community and societal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457861">ACMD, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457861">Buchanan, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless the new approach did not include reviewing the appropriateness of criminalization, or a serious attempt to tackle the root causes of substance misuse.</p>
<p>Over several decades research has highlighted the links between deprivation and substance misuse. Pearson points to American studies on the links between heroin usage and deprivation dating back to the 1950s. In the 1980s he noted links between deprivation and drug misuse in his study of the heroin outbreak in northern English cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261018312457861">Pearson, 1987</xref>). The correlation between the rise in poverty and an increase in problematic drug usage is perhaps most starkly demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457861">Reuter and Stevens (2007)</xref>. They chart the rise in heroin usage during the 1980s and 1990s, a period that saw significantly increased rates of poverty, following the Conservatives’ divisive neo-liberal economic and social policies. By charting the numbers of new heroin ‘addicts’ notified to the Home Office between 1975 and 1996, they found an increase from 525 a year, to over 15,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457861">Reuter and Stevens, 2007</xref>); an increase of over 2800%.</p>
<p>Tony Blair had come to power in 1997 offering a change of approach to more evidenced based policies. The government set up the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) to examine the underlying factors behind drug dependence and other social problems. SEU research found that ‘Problematic Drug Users tend to be members of the most deprived and socially excluded communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261018312457861">SEU, 2004</xref>: 11). After decades of research pointing to the links between deprivation and substance use problems, it seemed that government was taking tentative steps to address the issue: with increased funding for treatment services; the setting up of the Sure Start initiatives, focusing on the early life chances of deprived young children; and the Supporting People scheme focusing on vulnerable adults at risk of homelessness. At the end of their period in office, it could be argued that their policies had had some modest successes. There was a significant reduction in treatment waiting times and dramatic increases in the numbers of people accessing support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457861">Home Office, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457861">Reuter and Stevens, 2007</xref>). After three decades which saw sharp rises in drug use, the last decade saw a stabilization and a small reduction in the number of drug users overall; a decline in cannabis usage; reductions in heroin use; fewer younger users; and a drop in drug related crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457861">Home Office, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457861">Reuter and Stevens, 2007</xref>). However, despite this, the UK still had the highest number of drug users in Europe and numbers remained at historically high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261018312457861">EMCDDA, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457861">Reuter and Stevens, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As time wore on the promise to pursue evidence based approaches became increasingly hollow. During the last decade a number of studies had critiqued the scientific basis of the MoDA’s drug classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261018312457861">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261018312457861">Police Foundation, 2000</xref>). There were also suggestions that the drugs issue should be treated primarily as a health and social care concern, as opposed to a criminal justice one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261018312457861">House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261018312457861">House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs, 2002</xref>). The evidence was mounting that criminalization added further harms, rather than addressing the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261018312457861">Rolles, 2009</xref>). Research suggested that moves towards decriminalization in Portugal had led to reductions in problematic use, in prison overcrowding and in drug related harms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457861">Greenwald, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261018312457861">Hughes and Stevens, 2010</xref>). In his summary of the outcomes of Portuguese policy, Greenwald noted that rates of sexually transmitted diseases and drug related deaths had fallen dramatically, and called the policy ‘a resounding success’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457861">2009</xref>: 1). Whilst never advocating such radical ideas, New Labour promised a review of the classification system in 2006. However, this was quickly and quietly discarded.</p>
<p>In addition, it was argued that policy had failed to live up to its early promise of attacking the underlying causes of the issue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457861">Buchanan (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457861">2010</xref>) has argued that the focus in treatment on individual aspects of dependence, whilst having some success in reducing individual and social harms, had largely not addressed the underlying factors, such as deprivation, structural inequalities and social exclusion. New Labour had failed to take on the Thatcherite consensus on social and economic policy and truly address structural inequality. Critics argued that they instead relied on a populist, criminal justice led approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457861">Buchanan, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457861">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457861">Hunt and Stevens, 2004</xref>). Much of the increased expenditure was focused on treatments delivered in conjunction with the Criminal Justice System (CJS), via a variety of community based treatment orders. At the same time, in spite of this move to promote treatment, there was a huge increase in prison numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457861">Buchanan, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457861">Buchanan (2010)</xref> has accused New Labour of simply engaging in and prolonging drugs war rhetoric, with the effect of only marginalizing drug users still further. This rhetoric is apparent in the title of Labour’s final strategy: <italic>Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457861">Home Office, 2008</xref>); with its implication that society needs protecting from this enemy within. This drugs war rhetoric continued to exacerbate the stigmatization, labelling and marginalization of drug users. The impact of this has been well documented over many years, particularly in its impact on individual users and their families, and as a barrier to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261018312457861">Goffman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261018312457861">Guy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261018312457861">Hunt and Derricott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457861">Lloyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261018312457861">Singleton and Lynam, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The end of New Labour</title>
<p>The upgrading of cannabis back to Class B status, against the advice of their experts on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD); the sacking of this body’s former head, David Nutt; and the resignation in protest of several of the council’s members, marked an inauspicious end for New Labour drug policy. In the final months of their hold on power, a media led moral panic began to focus on the synthetic, legal high mephedrone, and a number of alleged deaths (although news stories often preceded the publication of the victims’ toxicology reports). The government pressurized the ACMD to report quickly. The report was produced in a matter of weeks, in time for the general election, and whilst the panel was short of several members following the recent resignations. As a result of this they were forced to rely for evidence on such esteemed academic sources as the <italic>NME, Mixmag</italic> (British popular music magazines), and reports in tabloid newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261018312457861">ACMD, 2010a</xref>). The rushed report recommended the classification of mephedrone, as a Class B substance, under the MoDA. It was a classic example of policy making on the hoof, following media pressure.</p>

<title>Evolving Conservative policy</title>
<p>The election of David Cameron as Conservative leader in 2005 had potentially promised a different direction in policy. He had been a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs that reviewed British drugs policy in 2002. Their report had made recommendations for a serious rethink of policy, most dramatically stating that:
<disp-quote>
<p>If there is any single lesson from the experience of the last 30 years, it is that policies based wholly or mainly on enforcement are destined to fail. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261018312457861">House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs, 2002</xref>: para 268)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the press release accompanying the report Cameron supported these findings claiming, ‘“We need to get away from entrenched positions and try to reduce the harm that drugs do both to users and society at large”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457861">Hope, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 2005 Conservative leadership election he was challenged on the report’s proposal for downgrading the classification of ecstasy. He again stood by the report, emphasizing the need to base decisions on sound scientific principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457861">Hope, 2008</xref>). This was a brave move during a time in which he was pushing for the votes of party members.</p>
<p>Around this time there was a countervailing trend within the Conservative Party towards tougher approaches. The influential right wing think-tank, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261018312457861">Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) (2006)</xref>, had suggested a move from harm reduction towards abstinence based approaches. They suggested that harm reduction was defeatist and that insufficient thought was given to the funding of abstinence based treatment services; with a particular emphasis on residential rehabilitation. There is no serious consideration in their report for the evidence base for this, or its cost-effectiveness. In fact research evidence so far has shown mixed results. A survey of 57 English residential rehabs in 2004, had found that only 48% of clients had completed their treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261018312457861">Meier, 2005</xref>). Long-term outcomes were better for those who completed programmes, suggesting that it is those who are most motivated towards abstinence that are more likely to complete their treatment. In addition, there was strong evidence that clients dropping out of residential rehab were at particular risk from overdose on relapsing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261018312457861">EMCDDA, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261018312457861">Gossop et al., 2002</xref>). Rather than suggesting matching treatment to client needs and levels of motivation, the CSJ proposed compulsory admittance to residential rehabilitation for all on criminal justice orders. With residential rehabilitation costing considerably more than community methadone prescribing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261018312457861">Wodak, 2011</xref>), this was a policy lacking in evidence of cost-effectiveness and potentially capable of causing significant harm. It is reasonable to argue that better provision could be made for those who feel ready for residential rehab. However, if large numbers of people were to be forced into residential treatment, regardless of their state of readiness to change, then potentially drop-out rates, and as a result, relapse and overdose rates, could increase dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, harm reduction, and in particular methadone substitute prescribing, had come increasingly under fire. The media began to focus on the idea that dependent drug users were ‘parked’ on methadone, often against their wishes. A report by another influential Conservative think-tank, the Policy Exchange, focused on the issue of drug treatment in prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457861">Chambers, 2010</xref>). This report claimed that prisoners were being forced on to methadone, regardless of their own personal wishes.</p>
<p>However, in spite of the report’s author, Chambers, claiming to have carried out extensive research, the evidence base was at best flimsy. He often fails to sufficiently evidence his claims; at one point using an article from the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> (a British right wing tabloid newspaper) as authoritative evidence of coerced methadone prescribing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457861">Chambers, 2010</xref>). His main arguments appear to be around the overuse of maintenance prescribing, that is long-term prescribing at a set dosage, instead of detoxification by reducing the dosage to get people drug free. In describing why this is so, he betrays a startling ignorance of the rationale behind prescribing and of safe prescribing practices in general. At one point he criticizes the use of more gradual reduction of methadone dosages, in spite of the fact that gradual reductions are recommended by the Department of Health’s clinical experts and the Royal College of General Practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457861">DH, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261018312457861">Ford et al., 2011</xref>). His report criticizes prison methadone detoxifications that take 12 weeks; a practice he describes as ‘maintenance by another name’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457861">Chambers, 2010</xref>: 34). In fact, given that average community methadone dosages vary between 60 mg and 120 mg per day, and that clinical experts recommend reductions of 5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457861">DH, 2007</xref>), a 12 week detoxification is actually fairly rapid and far from ‘maintenance by another name’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457861">Chambers (2010)</xref> suggests moving to a practice of rapid, 2 week detoxifications, a process only considered safe in specialist hospital settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457861">DH, 2007</xref>). Needless to say, such facilities are not available in the vast majority of prison settings. He nevertheless dismisses the combined expert evidence, by claiming that their prescribing recommendations, based on extensive clinical research, are merely driven by a fear of litigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457861">Chambers, 2010</xref>). He thus dismisses the views of dozens of experienced scientific experts and 40 years of peer reviewed research into substitute prescribing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457861">DH, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261018312457861">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261018312457861">Gossop, 2006</xref>), in one, unevidenced statement.</p>
<p>A further challenge to his views came from extensive research by the European Commission for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (ECPT). The ECPT carried out studies at several UK prisons, talking to hundreds of prisoners. They found a very different picture:
<disp-quote>
<p>prisoners were being forced off methadone maintenance or being offered low doses without reference to clinical needs, whereas the evidence supporting methadone maintenance therapy in prison is strong (both for criminological and health outcomes). The doses of methadone (or buprenorphine) need to satisfy the individual’s addictive needs, and respond to the additional risks of disease transmission while in custody, and immediately after release. Instead, it appeared that the rapid reduction in the daily doses of methadone offered to inmates was being done for administrative reasons rather than based on clinical needs, and the reduction was being done without the consent of the patient. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261018312457861">ECPT, 2009</xref>: 37)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was worrying that prisoners seemed to be being denied medical treatment and forced to undergo painful withdrawal symptoms. Indeed, it was this that led 197 heroin dependent prisoners to claim and win compensation for ill treatment and a denial of their human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261018312457861">Slack, 2008</xref>). This led to a change in prison prescribing policy by the Labour government. In light of this, the reaction from the Conservative Party spokesman, Nick Herbert, was particularly worrying:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It is a breach of no-one’s human rights, let alone prisoners’, to be denied drugs to help them sustain their habit.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261018312457861">Slack, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The implication here seemingly being that incarceration was not punishment enough and to allow physical and psychological suffering was entirely appropriate when dealing with drug users.</p>
<p>This new hard-line approach appeared to completely reject the harm reduction paradigm. It also rejected the idea that harm reduction and abstinence based approaches could exist side by side, that harm reduction could be a stepping stone towards further, long-term change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457861">ACMD, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457861">2010b</xref>). The idea that drug treatment could be tailored to the individual, depending on their circumstances and level of motivation, seemed to be rejected in favour of a one size fits all, abstinence based policy.</p>
<p>In the 2005/10 parliament, Cameron himself appeared to give contradictory signals. In 2008 he performed a U-turn on his earlier position regarding ecstasy: he now categorically stated his opposition to its reclassification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457861">Hope, 2008</xref>). However, the following year he intervened in the dispute between the Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, and ACMD chairman, David Nutt; a dispute fuelled in part by Nutt’s comments regarding the levels of risk involved in ecstasy usage. Nutt had criticized the government’s position on the classification of cannabis and ecstasy and had made the statistically correct observation that horse riding carried greater risks of death than ecstasy usage. Cameron criticized the public fallout between the government and its experts, describing it as an ‘unseemly spat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261018312457861">Rose, 2009</xref>). However, given his earlier U-turn, and that he supported Johnson’s decision to sack Nutt, it is difficult to see how he would have avoided a similar outcome.</p>
<p>That Cameron appeared to have moved decisively towards the hardliners was signified when the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457861">Conservative Party 2010</xref> manifesto proposed abstinence based criminal justice orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457861">Conservative Party, 2010</xref>). This was a decisive move away from New Labour’s approach. Their Criminal Justice Act (2003) introduced Drug Rehabilitation Requirements that required users to <italic>reduce or eliminate</italic> their drug use, rather than insisting on total abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>). This new policy was hence a major step away from the harm reduction paradigm of the last 25 years.</p>
<p>An earlier speech to the Scarman lecture on poverty was also telling of his thoughts around the root causes of substance misuse:
<disp-quote>
<p>for most people, material poverty is a consequence of other factors: Family breakdown, drug and alcohol addiction, unemployment, poor education. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261018312457861">Conservative Party, 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At first sight this could be viewed as a welcome shift towards acknowledging the importance of addressing poverty. Indeed, it was widely hailed at the time as evidence of Cameron’s ‘compassionate Conservatism’. However, it is telling that he cites poverty as a ‘<italic>consequence</italic>’ of substance dependence, rather than the other way round. In so doing he harked back to a Victorian view of deprivation; blaming the poor for unwise lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>The formation of Britain’s first coalition government in 65 years in May 2010, added another perspective: that of the Liberal Democrats. In 2002 they had produced a paper examining drugs policy. The first chapter was entitled ‘A system that isn’t working’, and detailed the failings of the war on drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457861">Liberal Democrats, 2002</xref>). The paper contained recommendations for: ending imprisonment for possession of Class B and Class C substances; decriminalization of possession, social supply and cultivation for personal use of cannabis; reclassifying ecstasy from Class A to Class B; and liberalizing the policies regarding the medical usage of cannabis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457861">Liberal Democrats, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The question remained which of these contrasting ideas would influence the new government’s drug policy.</p>

<title>The 2010 drug strategy</title>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about the new strategy was the speed with which it was compiled. The new drugs strategy was published a mere 7 months after the general election. The consultation for the strategy itself caused controversy. Stakeholders voiced concerns at the time period they were given to respond to proposed policy changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457861">ACMD, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457861">DrugScope, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457861">Transform, 2010</xref>). The consultation period lasted 6 weeks, a remarkably short time for any consultation. The ACMD noted the lack of time it had to prepare a considered response, suggesting that the publication of the strategy be delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457861">ACMD, 2010b</xref>). Other stakeholders were more forthright in their criticisms, suggesting that the consultation was merely tokenistic, that decisions had already been made regarding the direction of travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457861">Transform, 2010</xref>). In particular it was pointed out that the government’s National Treatment Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261018312457861">NTA, 2010</xref>) had already laid out concrete policy changes in their 2010/11 business plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457861">Transform, 2010</xref>). Two particular policy changes announced by the NTA were moves towards abstinence based treatment, involving time limitations for methadone prescribing, and commissioning services on a payment by results (PbR) basis. It is curious then that the consultation asked stakeholders for opinions on decisions that seemed to have been already made.</p>
<p>A further worrying development was the lack of an evidence base for many of the proposals in the document, and that some approaches and policies with a substantial evidence base appeared to be omitted completely. It was pointed out that harm reduction was not mentioned once in the document, despite an extensive evidence base from previous decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457861">DrugScope, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457861">Transform, 2010</xref>). In addition to this the document did not offer a chance to debate any challenge to the criminal justice agenda.</p>
<p>On 8 December 2010, the strategy was published, only weeks after the conclusion of the consultation process. Perhaps its most significant attribute is its brevity. At a mere 26 pages, including title pages, it is remarkably brief compared to its predecessors.</p>
<p>An initial reading of the document gives the impression of a more moderate approach than that suggested by the hardliners. It seems indeed to move back from the rhetoric of the abstentionists:
<disp-quote>
<p>Substitute prescribing continues to have a role to play in the treatment of heroin dependence, both in stabilising drug use and supporting detoxification. Medically-assisted recovery can, and does, happen. There are many thousands of people in receipt of such prescriptions in our communities today who have jobs, positive family lives and are no longer taking illegal drugs or committing crime. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This appears to recognize the value of harm reduction whilst addressing the stigmatizing concept of the methadone user as a burden on society. The strategy goes on to pledge that the government will also continue to examine the role of heroin prescribing, UK pilot studies of which showed such positive outcomes in recent trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261018312457861">Strang et al., 2010</xref>). It seems at this point as though a decisive break has been made with the rhetoric of recent years towards an acceptance of the evidence base behind harm reduction approaches.</p>
<p>The document also appears to recognize the importance of tackling drugs problems in a holistic manner, by adopting a ‘Whole Systems Approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 20), recognizing the importance in particular of housing, training, skills and employment. The strategy at one point appears to recognize the influence of poverty in particular, stating that whilst drug dependence can affect anyone, those with a background of ‘childhood abuse, neglect, trauma or poverty are disproportionately likely to be affected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Throughout the document there is a commitment to a ‘recovery agenda’. Recovery is a much disputed term amongst the treatment community, with abstentionists and harm reduction advocates both offering differing interpretations. It is a term that has been frequently utilized in press releases and speeches from ministers. Indeed, much commentary on the proposed policy changes has appeared to focus on the commitment to ‘recovery’, without actually defining its meaning. Abstentionists have seen recovery as incompatible with harm reduction policies, whereas harm reduction advocates have taken a broader view. Defining recovery is therefore important and has profound consequences for substance users themselves. White has succinctly defined why this is so:
<disp-quote>
<p>How recovery is defined has consequences, and denying medically and socially stabilized methadone patients the status of recovery is a particularly stigmatizing consequence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261018312457861">White, 2007</xref> cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261018312457861">UKDPC, 2008</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A narrow vision of recovery hence only adds to the stigma faced by those on long-term methadone prescriptions; people who have, in order to reach a point of stability, often made significant and difficult changes in their lives. The stigmatizing political and media rhetoric towards methadone users has made them the epitome of the undeserving poor. Hence, the government’s conceptualization of recovery can give us deeper insights into the direction of policy and their attitudes towards stigma.</p>
<p>The concept of recovery in fact originally came from the mental health field. The original proponents of these ideas envisaged a more flexible and person-centred approach:
<disp-quote>
<p>A central tenet of recovery is that it does not necessarily mean cure (‘clinical recovery’). Instead, it emphasises the unique journey of an individual living with mental health problems to build a life for themselves beyond illness (‘social recovery’). Thus, a person can recover their life, without necessarily ‘recovering from’ their illness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261018312457861">Shepherd et al., 2008</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In attempting to find some consensus, the UK Drug Policy Commission (2008) drew on this, seeing recovery as an individual journey, a process, rather than an end state. Fundamentally they recognized it as ‘sustained control over substance use’ and enhanced health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261018312457861">UKDPC, 2008</xref>: 8). Control was conceptualized as being inclusive of abstinence and maintenance. That the government appeared to be moving towards this was perhaps exemplified by the statement on the value of maintenance prescribing. It seems to be reaffirmed later when the document specifically describes recovery as ‘an individual, person-centred journey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 18).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261018312457861">
<title>Inherent contradictions</title>
<p>However, first impressions can be deceptive. In spite of the inclusive rhetoric, and the government’s insistence that they will pursue evidenced based policies, the document frequently contradicts itself. Additionally, many of the stated aims are undermined and contradicted by the government’s wider policy agenda and the pronouncements of leading Conservative politicians.</p>
<p>The vision of a person-centred recovery journey is contradicted early in the document with the assertion that: ‘People should not start taking drugs and those who do should stop’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 9). At a later point, just before the strategy talks of recovery being an ‘individual, person-centred journey’, it espouses a system that gets people, ‘into full recovery and off drugs and alcohol for good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 18). It seems remarkable that a policy document can seemingly offer two distinct and contradictory ideas within the same page.</p>
<p>The strategy also contains inherent contradictions within its attitude towards criminalization; talking of the importance of treatment and rehabilitation at one point, yet at another stating, ‘drug possession is a crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 14). The foreword by the Home Secretary, Theresa May, refers to calls for an exploration of the benefits of decriminalization. She quickly dismisses these views by claiming that it
<disp-quote>
<p>fails to recognise the complexity of the problem and gives insufficient regard to the harms that drugs pose to the individual. It neither addresses the risk factors which lead individuals to misuse drugs or alcohol, nor the misery, cost and lost opportunities that dependence causes individuals, their families and the wider community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This statement betrays a profound misunderstanding of the decriminalization argument. Decriminalization supporters do not attempt to claim that it addresses the causes of substance misuse, but rather that it reduces the harm and the stigma caused by criminalizing a large section of the population: stigma that is clearly a barrier to ‘recovery’ and an additional harm in itself.</p>
<p>Stigma has been highlighted as a major barrier to change and reintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457861">Lloyd, 2010</xref>). A good example is the stigma faced by many in accessing employment, an achievement which is thought to be a major facet in supporting and maintaining positive changes in substance usage. Research here points out that both abstinent ex-users and current stable methadone users have been regarded with suspicion by potential employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457861">Lloyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261018312457861">Singleton and Lynam, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary strategy chosen to promote employment appears to be a revival of a late-era Labour idea of withdrawing benefits from users who do not engage in treatment. This idea was heavily criticized when first proposed by Labour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457861">DrugScope (2008)</xref> pointed out that there was no evidence that the threat of withdrawal of benefits would be productive; they argued that it may in fact drive people away from support, adding that withdrawing benefits for up to 6 months could potentially have devastating consequences for not only the users themselves, but their families and communities. These criticisms were amongst the reasons why these provisions were initially dropped, only to be resurrected once again in the new strategy.</p>
<p>In the current economic climate most will find job-seeking difficult, yet people with drug problems appear to face additional barriers. Physical and mental health issues, life skills and educational attainment, the inflexibility of employers and the above mentioned stigma are all factors in making the transition to employment extremely difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457861">Lloyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261018312457861">Singleton and Lynam, 2009</xref>). Yet in spite of this the government is pressing ahead with the policy. The strategy itself gives little thought to addressing stigma directly and the rhetoric of ministers has certainly done nothing towards reducing this. In studying the media pronouncements of ministers, one finds that rhetoric has been forthright and uncompromising. When discussing the figures of sickness benefit claimants, ministers specifically singled out drug users. When questioned on this Cameron claimed:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… there are some who are on these benefits who do not deserve them and frankly we are not doing our job looking after taxpayers’ money if we do not try and make sure these people go to work.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261018312457861">BBC News, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It would seem counter-productive in addressing stigma to stereotype drug users on benefits as the feckless, undeserving poor. In fact the real reasons for high unemployment here are far more complex. With this in mind, the question must be asked whether the policy’s aim is to provide support or to reduce the benefits bill. Cameron’s rhetoric reinforces a current dominant discourse towards punishing ‘benefit scroungers’, with those with drug problems seen as a politically soft target.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261018312457861">
<title>Evidenced based policies?</title>
<p>In spite of this, the strategy is at pains throughout to emphasize its commitment to evidence based policy. Two new policies from the original consultation were in particular criticized for lacking supporting evidence: the reliance on residential rehabilitation and the idea of payment by results (PbR) for treatment providers based on outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release, 2010</xref>). As previously argued, the evidence supporting residential rehabilitation is equivocal and it would appear to be one of the most expensive forms of treatment. The strategy actually appears to water down this commitment slightly by instead promising to pursue ‘alternative forms of treatment-based accommodation in the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 12). This rather vague wording seems to offer something cheaper than residential rehab, without defining what it is. Whilst we can actually study the research on residential rehab, we have no current research base on this rather vague new concept. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457861">Release (2010)</xref> has commented, if people on criminal justice orders are to be coerced into residential facilities, then this may in fact need a change in the law.</p>
<p>The efficacy of PbR has in fact been researched, although not in the drugs field. PbR was introduced in health care in the UK in 2002, although it related to activity, rather than outcomes. The Labour government introduced the idea of outcomes based payment when contracting out to independent sector employment services. The rationale has been to save money and increase quality by cutting bureaucracy, providing performance related incentives and providing ‘consumer choice’.</p>
<p>The results of research here have not been encouraging. Evidence from the health sector in the United States, where PbR has been established for some time, yielded worrying results. Research in the 1980s showed that health care providers were more likely to discharge patients home early in an unstable condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261018312457861">Maybin, 2007</xref>). The idea that PbR would encourage reductions in bureaucratic and administration costs has also been disputed, with the Kings Fund study finding that, ‘The expected reduction in transactional and administrative costs has so far not been borne out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261018312457861">Maybin, 2007</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>A major criticism of the PbR approach is that it has led to incentives for providers to cherry pick the most profitable clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261018312457861">Roberts, 2011</xref>). Evidence from the government’s ‘Pathways to work’ in particular has highlighted that providers have focused their energies on those most ‘job ready’. Workers in some agencies have reported management pressures to focus on profitable clients at the expense of those with serious illnesses or low motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261018312457861">Roberts, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a clear danger that drug services will also focus on the most motivated and stable, those who offer the best returns on investment. Indeed if a significant proportion of their funding is based on drug free outcomes, they may have little choice but to do so. The obvious danger here is that some of society’s most marginalized and vulnerable become commodities in a crude, market driven process.</p>
<p>It’s important to also note that many people with drug problems have complex needs, requiring support from multiple agencies. It’s difficult to see how a competition based, PbR system would support the co-operation needed between agencies. The regulation and monitoring required to support such integration may in fact lead to increased bureaucracy, management and administration costs. It was concerns such as these that led the last government to delay its planned PbR system for mental health. These concerns have led commentators to urge caution in pushing forward PbR systems in the drugs field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457861">ACMD, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261018312457861">Roberts, 2011</xref>). In spite of this the government is keen on pressing forward.</p>

<sec id="section7-0261018312457861">
<title>The wider policy agenda</title>
<p>Given the complex nature of drug dependence it is hard to divorce drugs policy from the wider policy context. Whatever the direction of specific drugs policies, wider issues such as social and economic policy will have an inevitable impact on tackling substance dependence. In this discussion it is impossible to avoid discussing the government’s austerity drive. The drugs sector has traditionally been dominated by voluntary sector providers. However, these agencies have relied heavily on central and local government funding, with substance misuse being an unfashionable cause for charitable giving. Hence, regardless of the treatment policies chosen, it is difficult to avoid discussing the potential impacts of the cuts on drug treatment providers and service users. The strategy attempts to recognize this, by pointing to the £100 million transition fund available to the voluntary sector to help them through this time of austerity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>). However, this pales into insignificance when one considers the impact of spending cuts and the VAT rise on the voluntary sector as a whole, with voluntary agencies losing billions in local government grants. The government’s localism agenda also threatens to undermine the commitment to funding drug treatment made in the strategy. Previously the £1 billion substance use treatment budget was ring-fenced, but under the new Public Health England body, the government is removing this, leaving drug services more vulnerable at a time of cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261018312457861">DrugScope, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the strategy the government also acknowledges the importance of housing and renews its commitment to Labour’s Supporting People programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457861">HM Government, 2010</xref>). However, at the same time this money is again no longer ring-fenced, allowing councils to make cuts to supported housing services. With the stigma attached to people with drug problems, they present a tempting target as hard-pressed councils look to slash budgets.</p>
<p>The wider reforms of the benefits system are also a cause of concern. In particular the cuts to housing and council tax benefits are expected to have a huge impact on the poorest members of society. The cap on housing benefits is expected to increase problems of homelessness and vulnerable housing. The links between homelessness, vulnerable housing and substance use have already been stated and any holistic attempt at ‘recovery’ is thus bound to be undermined. In addition the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that the government’s spending cuts and welfare policies will result in an increase in relative poverty of 800,000 and in absolute poverty of 900,000 people by 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457861">IFS, 2010</xref>). This seems to undermine the strategy’s rhetoric of a ‘whole systems approach’ and threatens the spectre of a repeat of the huge rises in substance misuse seen in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As time wore on, New Labour increasingly veered towards tabloid populism in both rhetoric and policy. In assessing evolving Conservative policy during this period, one encounters often contradictory ideas. In 2002, Cameron appeared to offer a radically different approach, whilst others appeared to pull in the opposite direction. It was hence sometimes difficult to ascertain the Conservatives’ true intentions. The formation of a coalition government in 2010 clouded this picture still further.</p>
<p>However, the strategy contains none of the radical thinking exemplified by Cameron the backbencher, or his Liberal Democrat coalition colleagues. At times it promotes laudable aims and appears to promise evidenced based policies. Yet at others it blatantly contradicts itself, sometimes within the same page. This has led to a series of vague and at times confusing contradictions. As such it is difficult to view the drug strategy itself as a coherent guide to future policy direction.</p>
<p>The fact that the government has actively put into place plans for changes in policy before asking for advice on what changes to make, suggests the consultation was a paper exercise: a government that wanted to be <italic>seen</italic> to be interested in seeking out evidence, whilst having already made the important decisions. The speed at which these policies are being implemented seems to reinforce this impression. The think-tanks that appear to have influenced these shifts have produced reports conspicuous for their absence of hard evidence. The wholesale move towards abstinence based residential treatment and PbR is based on little evidence of their potential to produce the positive changes the government envisages. Residential rehabilitation, whilst undoubtedly helpful for some, is not a magic bullet. The strategy proposes something vaguely akin to residential rehab, namely, ‘alternative forms of treatment-based accommodation’. This is a vague concept, one which it fails to clarify, let alone provide any evidence for. Whilst it is laudable to offer support towards abstinence (of which quality residential rehabilitation can be an important component), to enforce this regardless of the person’s motivation to change shows a remarkable ignorance of addictions theory and evidence based practice in drugs treatment. It also risks exacerbating the real harms that can be caused by drug usage.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to a PbR system in drugs treatment. However, there is firm and recent evidence of the potential to promote cherry picking, leaving those with more complex issues to fall through the net. A belief in crude market mechanisms appears to apply the neo-liberal logic of consumerism to a complex issue. The most marginalized, deprived and stigmatized citizens are expected to become overnight confident consumers in a ‘market’ of provision. In reality the policy has the potential to do real harm. It is difficult to understand what could drive this policy, other than blind faith in neo-liberal dogma. Instead we appear to be moving towards a policy that turns vulnerable people into mere commodities, with those seen as a high investment risk losing out.</p>
<p>The harms of the criminalization of drug use for users and society in general are well known. It would take a brave politician to publicly address this issue and such courage has so far been lacking in the leaders of all main parties. In spite of his early pronouncements, Cameron appears quickly to have fallen in line with the dominant discourse of criminalization.</p>
<p>The influences of structural inequality and poverty on rates of misuse, and as a barrier to change, are also well attested. Again, politicians of all parties have been reticent in challenging the Thatcherite consensus. However, this leap of faith has been traditionally most difficult for Conservatives. Hence, any proclamations that appear to recognize the importance of inequality in fuelling social problems need to be welcomed. However, despite the occasional warm rhetoric, the Conservative attitude to poverty appears more than ever to be rooted in the Victorian dichotomy of the deserving and undeserving poor; with drug users being the most undeserving of all. Looking beyond the strategy, wider social and economic policies have the potential to cause real damage and make the already difficult transition out of drug misuse even more daunting. Moreover, the prospect of significant increases in poverty and inequality over the next few years offers the potential for further increases in drug related problems.</p>
<p>In the end drug treatment approaches are only part of a bigger picture, it is wider social and economic forces that influence the overall scale of the problem. At this relatively early stage, the Conservatives appear to offer the worst of both worlds. Their policies towards dealing with drug users threaten to further marginalize them and cause additional harm. In attacking harm reduction approaches, the government attacks one facet of drugs policy that has had some success in both reducing harms and encouraging chaotic users into treatment. At the same time their wider policy agenda threatens to create more vulnerable people for whom substance misuse appears a viable alternative to the void of poverty and deprivation.</p>
