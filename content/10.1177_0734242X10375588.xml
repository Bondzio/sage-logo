<abstract>
<p>Many of the characteristics of typical medical waste ash can be found by using ash leaching experiments. The present study investigated the characteristics of fly ash derived from incineration of medical waste in China. The particle diameter of the fly ash was in the range 154–900 μm. Elemental analyses of the fly ash indicated that it contained calcium, aluminium, iron, sodium, potassium and magnesium, and that copper, lead, chromium and mercury were the dominant heavy metals it contained. As leaching time was increased the leaching concentrations of the heavy metals increased and the leaching toxicity was augmented. When the pH was neutral, the concentrations of most heavy metals in the leachate were minimum whereas when the pH was alkali or acid, the leaching toxicity was greatly enhanced. High temperature melting was found to be a good method of fixing heavy metals, and the main components of the sinter were Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub> and CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, etc.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fly ash generated by incineration of Chinese medical waste materials is hazardous and Chinese regulations state that it must be collected and disposed of separately. As this kind of fly ash contains a number of heavy metals it is important to study the leaching characteristics and stability of these metals in order to protect the environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10375588">Akiko et al. (1996)</xref> utilized HNO<sub>3</sub> as a lixiviating solution to study the leaching characteristic of heavy metals in fly ash at different pH values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X10375588">Tashiro et al.

<p>The studies cited above investigated the leaching characteristics of waste, including fly ash as well as the disposal of the cement made from fly ash generated by incineration of municipal solid waste; however, very few studies have reported investigations of the leaching characteristics and melting of fly ash from medical waste incineration. In the present study, the leaching characteristics and melting of the fly ash were studied under different conditions in order to create a reference for the safe disposal of fly ash from Chinese medical waste.</p>

<title>Fly ash source</title>
<p>Fly ash was collected from a medical waste incineration plant in Zhejiang Province, China. The medical waste was composed mainly of combustible matter such as plastic waste, absorbent cotton, and medical face masks. The incinerator has a rotary pyrolysis kiln which operates at 500–600°C and a second firebox with a fluidized bed which operates at 900–1000°C. Hot gases leave the furnace and pass through a convection chamber before entering a bag-type dust remover for particulate control. In the present study the fly ash was collected by this bag-type dust remover.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X10375588">
<title>Characteristics of fly ash</title>
<p>In order to obtain the particle size distribution of fly ash, the fly ash was sieved through a stack of sieves including &lt;38.5, 38.5–74, 74–154, 154–250, 250–355, 355–500, 500–900 μm, 900 μm–2 mm, and &gt; 2 mm.</p>
<p>The ashes were collected semi-wet. Prior to any leaching tests, the fly ash was air-dried to 4.5% moisture content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for analysis of the crystallized phase of the 154–900 μm fractions as this was the main size distribution range. The XRD analysis was conducted over a range of 1–120° using a powder X-ray diffractometer. A quantitative element analysis of this fraction was also performed using the thermal field emission environmental scanning electron microscope – energy spectrum – electron backscatter diffraction system (SEM–EDS–EBSD). At the same time, the heavy metals were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry with the exception of mercury (Hg), which was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry, after the samples had been decomposed with HNO<sub>3.</sub>

<title>The influence of time on the leaching characteristics of heavy metal</title>
<p>The material investigated was fly ash from the incineration of Chinese medical waste. Acetic acid solution (pH 2.88) was used as the leaching solution. The pH value of 2.88 was chosen from the TCLP for hazardous waste in the US EPA test method 1311–TCLP. The leaching solution was mixed with fly ash (2.000 g) at a liquid : solid ratio of 20 : 1, The leaching time was separately controlled for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 h. Finally, equipment with an effective aperture of 0.6–0.8 μm was used to filter the leaching solution from different leaching times, and then the filtrates were used to measure heavy metal content. The heavy metals were measured by the atomic absorption technique; Hg was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry.</p>
<p>For all experiments three parallel experiments were performed and all the data presented are the average of three measurements.</p>

<sec id="section7-0734242X10375588">
<title>The influence of liquid : solid ratio on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p>A 2.000 g sample of fly ash from incineration of Chinese medical waste was measured. The leaching solution was acetic acid solution with a pH value of 2.88  ±  0.05 from the US EPA test method 1311–TCLP. The acetic acid was mixed with the sample in liquid : solid ratios of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 and the leaching time was 18 h. The equipment was used with an effective aperture of 0.6–0.8 μm to filter the leaching solution from the samples with different liquid : solid ratios, and the filtrates were used to measure the heavy metal content. The heavy metals in the supernatants were measured by atomic absorption technique; Hg was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry and the data presented are the average of three measurements.</p>

<sec id="section8-0734242X10375588">
<title>The influence of the initial pH of the leach solution on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p>Two-gram samples of fly ash were investigated. The leaching solution was a mixture of HNO<sub>3</sub> and NaOH with pH values of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. By adjusting the concentration of HNO<sub>3</sub> or NaOH, the pH of the leaching solution could be controlled. The leaching solution was mixed at a liquid : solid ratio of 20 : 1 with the sample, and the leaching time was 18 h. Finally, the equipment was used with an effective aperture of 0.6–0.8 μm to filter the leaching solution from the different pH samples and the filtrates were then used to measure the heavy metal content. The heavy metals were measured by the atomic absorption technique; Hg was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry and the data presented are the average of three measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0734242X10375588">
<title>The influence of the particle size on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p>According to the particle size range, &lt; 38.5, 38.5–74, 74–154, 154–250, 250–355, 355–500, 500–900, 900–2000, &gt; 2000 a 2.000 g sample of fly ash was measured from each range. The leaching solution was acetic acid with pH value 2.88  ±  0.05 from the US EPA test method 1311–TCLP. The leaching solution was mixed with a liquid : solid ratio 20 : 1 and samples of every particle size. The leaching time was 18 h. The filtrates were used to measure the heavy metal content. The heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption technique; Hg was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry and the data presented are the average of three measurements.</p>

<sec id="section10-0734242X10375588">
<title>The melting of fly ash at high temperature</title>
<p>The melting temperature of the fly ash was about 1080°C, which is the softening temperature required for the ash melting point detection apparatus. The melting equipment of the electro-thermal furnace was used with a temperature control range from 400 to 1500°C. A 20.000 g sample was placed in a crucible, and then placed in the hearth of the melting equipment at 1080°C for 40 min under an air atmosphere. After the fly ash was completely melted, the heating system was turned off and the hot sinter of fly ash cooled to normal temperature, and the sinter removed. The sinter was saved as samples for use in leaching experiments to investigate the influence of melting the fly ash on leaching of heavy metals from the fly ash. The lixiviating toxicity method was chosen for the experiments and was used to detect the toxicity of the heavy metals in the sinter. The method used acetic acid as the lixiviating solution, with a pH value of 2.88 ± 0.05 as specified in the US EPA test method 1311–TCLP, and then the lixiviating solution was mixed with the sinter according to a liquid : solid ratio of 20 : 1. Finally, the admixture was put into a solution bottle and centrifuged at a rotation speed of 30 rpm for 18 h at 23 ± 2°C. After centrifugation, filter paper with an effective aperture of 0.6–0.8 μm was used to filter the admixture and obtain the leaching solution to measure the heavy metals using the atomic absorption technique; Hg was measured by cold atomic absorption spectrometry. The leaching experiments with respect to the melted ash were carried out as previously described.</p>

<p>The particle size distribution of samples of two ash samples collected from the commercial medical waste incinerator was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10375588">Figure 1</xref>, the particle diameter of fly ash from incineration of Chinese medical wastes was primarily within the range 154–900 μm and 33% of the particles were in the diameter range 250–355 μm.</p>

<p>The elemental analyses of the fly ash are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10375588">Table 1</xref>: the bulk density was 0.968 kg/m<sup>3</sup>; the content of the combustible part was 8.4%; the pH of the ash was 5.6, and the data are the average value from three parallel experiments. The thermal field emission environmental SEM-EDS-EBSD was used to perform the measurements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10375588">Figure 2</xref> shows that the ash contained the metals calcium (Ca), aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), sodium (Na), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg). Silica (Si) was also found in large quantities. The main species expected to form anions are chlorine (Cl) and sulfur (S). A high Cl content (up to 18.44%) was observed and was attributed to the presence of Cl-bearing plastics in the Chinese medical waste. There was also a possibility of carbonate formation by absorption of carbon dioxide into the alkaline wet and dry ashes, which occurs in both the cooler zones of the boiler and during transportation and storage. Although no measurements were conducted for carbonate, it may have a significant effect on the leaching profile of lead and, to a lesser degree, calcium, whose carbonates are extremely insoluble or sparingly soluble.</p>

<title>Multiple batch leaching tests of fly ash</title>
<p>The leaching time, liquid : solid ratio, pH and particle size of the leaching conditions strongly influence the dissolution behaviour of heavy metals from ash. Therefore these conditions were studied to seek a good understanding of the leaching characteristics of the heavy metals in fly ash from incineration of Chinese medical waste.</p>
<sec id="section14-0734242X10375588">
<title>The influence of leaching time on the leaching characteristics of heavy metals</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375588">Figure 3</xref> shows that the concentrations of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), Hg and Pb increased linearly along with the leaching time, whereas those of Cu and manganese (Mn) were steady. These results imply that the influence of the leaching time on the two heavy metals was slight within 24 h. It is suspected that due to the influence of the acetic acid solution, some heavy metals leach into the solution so that the concentration of some of the heavy metals would increase over time. Concentrations of Cu and Mn were steady for the 24 h duration of the experiment, and it is hypothesized that the concentration of Cu and Mn would increase with time.</p>

<title>The influence of liquid : solid ratio on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X10375588">Figure 4</xref> shows that the leaching ratios of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Hg clearly increased as the ratio of liquid : solid (L/S) increased. The leaching ratio of Mn and Pb linearly increased as the L/S ratio increased, whereas the leaching ratio of Cd, Cr, Cu, and Hg present an arc in the same conditions, which explains why the effect on the leaching ratio of heavy metals of low L/S was greater than that of the higher L/S. By contrast, the leaching concentration of Cd was the highest and when the L/S ratio was 90, the Cd leaching ratio was about 50%. When the L/S value was 20 : 1, the Cd leaching ratio was the highest at about 35%, and that of Cu was the lowest at about 10%. All of the lixiviating toxicity of heavy metals exceeded the US EPA standard in the fly ash samples from incinerated Chinese medical waste.</p>

<title>The influence of the initial pH of the leach solution on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p>When the pH was less than 4, the leaching concentrations of Cu, Cr and Pb reduced sharply, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X10375588">Figure 5</xref>. For pH values between 4 and 11, the leaching concentrations were steady, but they increased as the pH increased for pH values greater than 11. Thus the final leachate pH of Cu and Cr should be between 4 and 11 to keep the heavy metal concentration steady, whereas for Pb the optimum pH was 4. The results for Cd were an exception in that the concentration of Cd increased greatly when pH was more than 7, and the curve of pH was variable and did not present a stable leaching concentration related to the pH. Therefore the final leachate pH for Cd was taken as 7. The leaching concentration of Hg decreased when pH was less than 4 and thereafter remained nearly constant as the pH increased so that the Hg final leachate pH was greater than 4. The Mn concentration was almost unchanged, implying that changing the value of pH had no effect on the leaching concentration of Mn during 18 h leaching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10375588">Shim et al. (2005)</xref> also studied the leaching rate of these heavy metals as a function of pH from fly ash obtained from MSW incinerators. Their leaching rates for Cu, Cd and Zn sharply decreased in the pH range of 2–10 and remained steady when the pH was above 10. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375588">Figure 3</xref> the leaching concentrations of Cu and Cd in the present study were reduced below 7 initially and then increased as the pH increased. In the results of Shim et al. there was almost no leaching of Pb when the pH value was between 6 and 10 in both cases, which is the same as the result for lead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375588">Figure 3</xref>. The leaching rates of Pb depend on its solubility, which is minimized in the pH range between 6 and 10 due to its amphoteric nature.</p>

<title>The influence of the particle size on the leaching characteristics</title>
<p>Grain size exerts a significant impact on heavy metal release during leaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X10375588">Fig. 6</xref>). The concentrations of Cd, Cr and Pb increased initially and then decreased after reaching their peak values as the particle size increased. The leaching concentration of Hg increased with the particle size below 250 μm, but it was steady for particles exceeding 250 μm. The Cu and Mn concentrations showed opposing trends as the particle size increased. The leaching concentration of Cu decreased as the particle size changed, whereas the leaching concentration of Mn linearly increased. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10375588">Figure 2</xref>, it can be seen that the fly ash particle size was centred in the range 154–900 μm and 30% of the total fly ash had particle diameters between 250 and 355 μm. The original hope was that it would be possible to restrain heavy metal leaching by controlling the particle diameter – if there were some particle diameter at which each heavy metal particle in the fly ash leached little under simulated landfill conditions, then it would be easier to control the heavy metal pollution problem by making fly ash have that particle diameter. However, it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X10375588">Figure 6</xref> that the leaching characteristics of each heavy metal was different and there was little regular variation with grain size. A method of controlling the particle diameter therefore would not help to solve the pollution problems due to heavy metals.</p>

<p>The morphology of fly ash before and after melting is compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X10375588">Figure 7</xref>.

<p>The appearance of fly ash after melting changes distinctly. In the 200 × photo, the sinter appears to have become more compact than the original sample. In the 1000 × photo, the sinter has a netted configuration, which shows that the large block divided into many small blocks. Thus after melting the organic and larger blocks in the fly ash have been reduced and only inorganic and small blocks can be seen in the fly ash. The 5000 × and 10 000 × photos show much crystal matter in the sinter, which is much bigger than the original sample. This suggests that the solidified effect of fly ash is much stronger after melting. It appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X10375588">Figure 7</xref> that by melting the fly ash, most of organic components were transferred to inorganic components. In order to validate the photographic results XRD and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyse the sinter again.</p>

<title>EDS and XRD analyses before and after melting fly ash</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X10375588">Figure 8</xref>, the Ca and Si contents became more visible, which indicates that the fly ash mineralized after melting, and proves that the crystal matter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X10375588">Figure 9</xref> are calcic and silicic minerals. The content of Cl reduced a little from 18.44 to 16.30% after melting. The high content of Cl in the fly ash from incineration of Chinese medical waste is probably because Chinese medical waste materials include a large amount of plastic waste which contains Cl. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X10375588">Figure 8</xref>, it can be speculated that the Cl exists mainly in the form of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl in the original fly ash, but not as FeCl<sub>3</sub> because FeCl<sub>3</sub> decomposes at high temperature and furthermore, as the fly ash is derived from the medical waste incineration, the Cl will not be FeCl<sub>3</sub>. In order to prove this speculative result, the F*A*C*T software was utilized to compute the reactions of HCl and CaCO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> separately over a temperature range of 25–1200 °C at normal atmospheric pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X10375588">Fig. 10</xref>). The principle of F*A*C*T is based on the method of Gibbs free energy minimization. Under conditions of constant temperature and equal pressure, Gibbs free energy minimization is used as a criterion for establishing reaction equilibrium in a complex reacting system. So F*A*C*T can be used to compute the element balance and distribution under certain conditions. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X10375588">Figure 10</xref> that the decompounding temperatures of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, NaCl and FeCl<sub>3</sub> were about 840, 840 and 220 °C, separately. At 1100 °C, the relative contribution of Cl released from CaCl<sub>2</sub>, NaCl, and FeCl<sub>3</sub> was about 10, 18 and 100%, respectively. The result of about 10% shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X10375588">Figure 10</xref> is approximately the same as the content of the Cl reducing ratio from 18.44 to 16.30% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X10375588">Figure 8</xref>, confirming the speculative result for CaCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl in the fly ash before and after melting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X10375588">Figure 10</xref> shows that, under the influence of high temperature, the main chlorides in the fly ash were CaCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl.</p>

<p>The main components of sinter were Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, and CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X10375588">Fig. 9</xref>), confirming that the white crystal matter was these inorganic compounds. It has also been shown that melting had a remarkable effect on fly ash solidification and crystallization. In order to explain how the heavy metals were more stable after the fly ash had been melted, a heavy metals experiment to determine lixiviating toxicity was also performed.</p>

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X10375588">Table 3</xref> that the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate of sinter reduced enormously, which shows that the melting treatment was very efficient for the fixation of the heavy metals in fly ash. Therefore, melting appears to offer the good method of dealing with the fly ash or the hazardous waste which is needed to control the pollution of the heavy metals.</p>

<p><list id="list1-0734242X10375588" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The particle diameter of fly ash from incinerated Chinese medical waste was primarily in the range 154–900 μm. The elemental analyses of fly ash indicate that they contain Ca, Al, Fe, Na, K and Mg. The main species expected to form anions are Cl and S. Cu, Pb, Cr and Hg are the dominant heavy metals in the fly ash.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the increase of leaching time, the leaching concentrations of the heavy metals increased, and the leaching toxicity was also augmented.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the increase of liquid : solid ratio (L/S), the leaching rate of major heavy metals was greatly enhanced, with the rate for Cd being the highest. When the L/S ratio was 90, the leaching rate of Cd was about 50%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When pH was neutral, the leaching concentrations of most heavy metals in the leachate were lowest and when pH was alkali or acid, the leaching toxicity was enhanced greatly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When the particle size of most heavy metals was distributed in the range 250–900 μm, the leaching concentrations of heavy metals were high. The leaching characteristics of each heavy metal were different and bore no special relationship with the fly ash of various sizes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After melting, the leaching toxicity reduced enormously. This indicates that melting was a good means of fixation of heavy metals in the fly ash from the incineration of Chinese medical waste.</p></list-item>
