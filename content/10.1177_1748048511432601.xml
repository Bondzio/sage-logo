<abstract>
<p>In recent years, online viewing has become an important way for Chinese audiences to watch foreign TV dramas. This exploratory study investigated the predictive power of lifestyles, gratifications sought, narrative appeal, and demographics on the viewing preference for and frequency of American and Korean TV dramas among a sample of 455 Internet users in urban China. The results show that narrative appeal, viewing habits, and gender were predictors of viewing preference. Lifestyles were significantly linked to gratifications sought. Frequent American TV drama viewers tended to be motivated by learning about American language, culture, and fashion; attracted by the complicated plot; and preferred online viewing. The study supports and expands understanding of the uses and gratifications theory, and argues that viewing foreign TV dramas could be an index of social distinction in urban China. Practical implications for the media industry are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048511432601">Barker (1997</xref>) argued that TV dramas are uniquely capable of drawing a large and loyal viewer base, and are ‘one of the most exported forms of television viewed in a large number of cultural contexts’ (1997: 75). Foreign TV dramas introduce different appeals and gratifications from indigenous content, and now watching foreign TV dramas has become part of the everyday lifestyle in China. The distribution of TV dramas is experiencing fundamental changes because of the digital revolution. The convergence between computers and television is leading to the breakdown of the traditional distinctions between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748048511432601">Nicholas, 2006</xref>). Television networks have become part of the multimedia behemoths, including more new information communication technologies (such as VCDs, DVDs, iPads, iPhones, webcasts, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432601">Holland, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048511432601">Negroponte (1996</xref>: 48) wrote: ‘the key to the future of television is to stop thinking about television as television’.</p>
<p>Therefore the transnational consumption of foreign TV dramas does ‘not just breach cultural borders’, but also traverses ‘boundaries between traditional and new media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048511432601">Leung, 2009</xref>: 53). With the wide spread of inexpensive new technologies (such as broadband and WiFi) and enthusiastic fansub groups, Chinese audiences now have more access to foreign TV dramas. Fansubbing is a type of subtitling carried out by amateur translators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048511432601">Cintas and Sánchez, 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748048511432601">1</xref>
</sup> With the ever-increasing standards and release speed, a great number of Chinese fansubbed TV dramas are released online and also distributed on VCD or DVD formats, which have signaled a new phase for the popularization of foreign TV dramas in China.</p>
<p>Nowadays viewing foreign TV dramas online has become a mainstream recreational activity, especially among those urban youth with cultural and technological know-how. Internet provides a 24-hour uninterrupted stream of TV dramas at lower cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748048511432601">Nelson, 1997</xref>). Online viewing is more than a spillover; it can be regarded as a new niche for foreign TV dramas, which deserves special attention. The complex combination of digital technology, local demand, and audiences’ highly developed literacy with regard to foreign cultures has made the flow increasingly popular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048511432601">Nakano, 2002</xref>). Moreover, TV program exchanges are becoming more common as China seeks to manage its increasing international links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432601">Cunningham and Jacka, 1996</xref>). China is currently in a transitional period, which means somehow it lacks its own original popular cultural products, leaving the door open to foreign pop cultures. In the push for China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), foreign cultural products such as imported TV dramas will further flood into the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Exposure to foreign TV dramas has created a demanding audience in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432601">Fung and Ma, 2002</xref>), since the Chinese Internet population is the largest in the world with 457 million users and still rapidly increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432601">CNNIC, 2011</xref>). In the globalization of television, with the great potential for revenue based on this huge population, Chinese Internet users, as the unforeseen audience, represent an immensely attractive market, which is big enough to justify serious investigation.</p>
<p>Foreign TV dramas bring foreign images, cultures, languages, and values, which usually express a televisual version of modernity more intense than the current Chinese socioscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432601">Fung and Ma, 2002</xref>). With growing popularity of foreign TV dramas in China, the possible linkages between TV drama viewing and lifestyles are worth investigating. Therefore, this exploratory study attempts to fill the research gap by examining the relationship between the viewing of foreign TV dramas and lifestyles among Internet users in urban China.</p>

<title>American and Korean TV dramas in China</title>
<p>Shaped by the globalization of media economics and the pull of local and regional cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1748048511432601">Waisbord (2004</xref>) argues that television is simultaneously global and regional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432601">Chan and Ma (1996</xref>) also describe the rapid changing Asian television scene, of which a part is global, and a part uniquely Asian. Considering the popularity of the transnational TV dramas available in the Chinese market, this study focuses on those that originated in the US and South Korea.</p>
<p>American TV dramas are the undisputed leader in the international television marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048511432601">Bielby and Harrington, 2005</xref>) and nowadays quite popular in China, especially via the Internet. The fansubbing and free distribution of those huge international hits such as <italic>Desperate Housewives</italic> and <italic>Lost </italic>promote wider interest in American TV dramas in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432601">Hu, 2005</xref>). Due to fansub groups’ ardent work and even fierce competition, millions of Chinese watch American TV dramas season after season, and fan communities are flourishing online, voicing their feelings after viewing, although most of the dramas have not been aired on TV channels.</p>
<p>Despite the proliferation of American hot broadcasts, the quantity and quality of Asian-produced TV dramas have been catching up rapidly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432601">Chan and Ma, 1996</xref>), such as those from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. For example, media production capability in South Korea, once peripheral, has emerged and increased its exports and market share in the international audiovisual market in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432601">Cunningham and Jacka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048511432601">Keane, 2006</xref>). The Korean wave, as a metaphor, refers to the popularity of Korean media culture, including TV dramas, which has penetrated China and many other Asian countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048511432601">Jin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748048511432601">Mee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Japanese TV dramas were once very popular, and still have many fans in China, they were not chosen for this study partly because of consumer nationalism related to historical and political issues. Even though Japanese products and restaurants are quite common in China, Chinese people still do not publicly embrace Japanese culture due to the legacy of Japanese atrocities during its occupation in the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048511432601">Fung, 2007</xref>). Moreover, as non-western dramas, Korean and Japanese TV dramas share many similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432601">Endo and Matsumoto, 2004</xref>). Korean dramas actually absorb the cream of Japanese idol TV dramas blending Korean characteristics to create their own style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748048511432601">Shim, 2006</xref>). Therefore, Korean dramas, not Japanese or other regional TV dramas, were chosen as the counterpart of American ones.</p>
<p>The labels of American and Korean TV dramas used in this study are based on a practical definition, considering the different geographical, historical and sociocultural production backgrounds. This selection is out of both theoretical necessity and practical consideration, since both American and Korean TV dramas have attracted a huge number of fans in China, and the existing market structure based on this kind of compartmentalization is generally acceptable among the viewers. Foreign TV drama viewing in this article includes shows aired on terrestrial TV, pay-cable, basic-cable, broadband windows, mobile-TV and other outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748048511432601">Winslow, 2007</xref>) such as VCD, DVD, even pirated ones from roadside vendors, and online videos, for example those on YouTube or tudou.com. In this study, only Internet users were studied because online access is the major means of viewing foreign TV dramas in Mainland China, especially American TV dramas.</p>

<title>Domestic petit bourgeois lifestyle in China today</title>
<p>China’s structural reform over the last three decades has affected different social groups unevenly, generating instability of identities and aspirations for upward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>). The emerging urban middle class has become part of the reconstituted power bloc in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1748048511432601">Zhao, 2003</xref>). However, the urban middle class is still underdeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048511432601">He, 2000</xref>) and should not be seen as a unified entity but rather as a number of class factions in the current era of drastic social restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>). Taking the differences in consumer power and lifestyle into consideration, the meaning of middle class in the Chinese context is different from that in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Social differentiation reflects itself in distinctive patterns of behavior, including recreational activities and cultural consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432601">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). While the pattern of burgeoning consumerism and integration into the global economy resembles the process gone through by other Asian countries, what makes China special is the tremendous ideological transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432601">Hooper, 1998</xref>). Western cultures have been an increasingly strong presence in Chinese people’s daily lives since the ‘open door’ policy started in the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432601">Fung and Ma, 2002</xref>). Since the 1980s, public discourse has taken on varying degrees of hedonism with the proliferation of consumerism, individualism, and self-reliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048511432601">Ci, 1994</xref>). Targeting the emerging urban middle class, the mass media have created a highly visible culture of consumption through images of the ‘good’ life, beauty, and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>). Therefore, <italic>lifestyle</italic> has become a hot topic in people’s daily life, including experiences of international travel and familiarity with exotic flavors. Fashion magazines like <italic>Vogue</italic>, <italic>Elle</italic>, and <italic>Harpers </italic>have become the bibles of style, beauty, fitness, and relationships for Chinese young woman. Starbucks have mushroomed in urban China, which is traditionally a tea-drinking country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432601">Fung and Ma (2002</xref>) argue that the lagging-behind, yet forward-looking socioscape reflects the popular desire of post-socialist China to ‘leap’ into global modernity.</p>
<p>The term ‘domestic petit bourgeois’ (<italic>xiaozi</italic> in Chinese) is used to label this phenomenon in current China. Intensively criticized by the mainstream ideology in Chinese history, this term is now endowed with new cultural meaning, implying a lifestyle of economic prosperity, comfort, material and spiritual enjoyment, a keen interest in fashion, and a just little sentimentality. Many educated and young urban Chinese find a sense of belonging in this camp. It is the product of a flourishing market economy, the development of an urban culture, the rise of cultural consumption (Hu, 2005), and the popularity of foreign programs due to the introduction and appropriation of new media technologies (Chan and Ma, 1996).</p>
<p>As for the relationship between television programs, modernization, and identities in urban China, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu (2007</xref>) points out that some programs aim to satisfy the increasing domestic petit bourgeois tastes in urban China with images of western lives that encourage audiences to adopt modern lifestyles. Foreign TV dramas are regarded as the whole package, modeling and maintaining lifestyles to which many audiences aspire and are eager to catch up with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432601">Chan and Ma, 1996</xref>). Arguably, foreign TV dramas are used by local audiences to ‘articulate their local cultural identity and the emergent globalizing commodity culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048511432601">Leung, 2009</xref>: 52). Many viewers visit the destinations shown in foreign dramas, indicating the influence of imported TV dramas on tourists’ experiential value and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1748048511432601">Wang and Lin, 2010</xref>). This study seeks to investigate the social and cultural functions of foreign TV dramas, taking a snapshot of the different tastes, lifestyles, and levels of sophistication implied by audiences’ preferences for different TV dramas, which can be regarded as an indicator of social distinction or social identity in China today.</p>

<title>Theoretical frameworks</title>
<sec id="section5-1748048511432601">
<title>Lifestyles</title>
<p>With the decline of traditional types of social groupings, such as class and age, there has been some renewed interest in the notion of lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748048511432601">Machin and Van Leeuwen, 2005</xref>). Lifestyle is a system of classified and classifying practices as the expression of identity and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432601">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Previous studies demonstrate that lifestyles greatly influence one’s leisure behavior, including media use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048511432601">Donohew et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048511432601">Leung, 1998</xref>), such as TV viewing preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432601">Eastman, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Developed in 1978, Values and Lifestyles Segmentation (VALS) is a well-established instrument to examine consumption patterns. The original VALS system was created to explain changing US values and lifestyles in the 1970s, and was updated in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048511432601">Gunter and Furnham, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048511432601">SRI, 2009</xref>). VALS uses psychographics to segment people according to their distinctive traits, and to analyze and predict people’s choices. It is a way of viewing people based on their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs, and demographics. Primary motivation and resources are the main dimensions of the framework. The three primary motivations are ideals, achievement, and self-expression. Consumers motivated by ideals are guided by knowledge and principles. If motivated by achievement, consumers will look for products demonstrating success to their peers. Those motivated by self-expression desire social or physical activity, variety, and risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048511432601">SRI, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, consumers are categorized into eight groups: innovators, thinkers, achievers, experiencers, believers, strivers, makers, and survivors. After years of development and validation, VALS systems have been extensively used across cultures, such as in Japan and the UK, and the recently developed versions for Venezuela and the Dominican Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048511432601">SBI, 2010</xref>). VALS has been adopted to analyze the dynamics underlying consumer preferences including media use (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432601">Chan and Leung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432601">Fassett, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study mapping out Internet users, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432601">Fassett (1995</xref>) found that 50% were innovators, who are successful, sophisticated, change-leaders with high self-esteem, and generally receptive to new ideas and technologies, while 18% were experiencers, 13% were strivers, 11% were thinkers, 6% were achievers, and the remaining 2% were believers, makers, and strugglers. Inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432601">Fassett (1995</xref>), this exploratory study is aimed at finding out if the VALS categorizations can be identified among Chinese Internet users, and depicting the online viewing audience as well. Therefore, we ask the following question:</p>

<sec id="section6-1748048511432601">
<title>Uses and gratifications</title>
<p>Uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) became influential from the late 1950s to the 1970s in both the US, notably by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, and Britain, by researchers such as Blumler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048511432601">Casey et al., 2002</xref>). U&amp;G is an audience-centered approach to mass communication, which assumes people actively seek media to gratify their social, psychological, and cultural needs. Gratifications have a long history in media research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432601">Blumler and Katz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048511432601">Rosengren et al., 1985</xref>) and have been conceptualized as the utilities that explain media choice by consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048511432601">Dimmick and Albarran, 1994</xref>). U&amp;G theory explores the gratifications that attract and hold audiences to the kinds of media and the types of content that satisfy their needs or wants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432601">Blumler and Katz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048511432601">Katz et al., 1973</xref>). Some research has highlighted the significance of media use in identity expression, such as pager and mobile phone use for social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432601">Leung and Wei, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048511432601">2000</xref>), and the association between TV viewing motivations and potential for lifestyle traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048511432601">Ostman and Jeffers, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>There is no single or fixed list of gratifications obtained from media use; instead, multiple lists, categories, and classification systems abound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432601">Charney, 1996</xref>). Variables like entertainment, relaxation, acquisition, arousal, pastimes, diversion, escape, and sociality were used as references in previous U&amp;G research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748048511432601">Rubin et al., 1994</xref>), such as quiz show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432601">Herzog, 1940</xref>), television news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748048511432601">Palmgreen et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748048511432601">Wenner, 1982</xref>), and soap opera viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432601">Lemish, 1985</xref>), cable television and program choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048511432601">Heeter and Greenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432601">Jacobs, 1995</xref>), VCR use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748048511432601">Lin, 1993</xref>), etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432601">Greenberg (1974</xref>) developed the Viewing Motivation Scale to assess children’s television use in Britain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748048511432601">Rubin (1981</xref>) adapted Greenberg’s scale in the US.

Based on this conceptual framework, we ask the following question:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ2:</italic> What are the gratifications that urban Chinese Internet users seek from viewing foreign TV dramas?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748048511432601">
<title>Narrative appeal</title>
<p>TV dramas are predominantly and obviously narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048511432601">Fiske, 1989</xref>). Narrative can be split into two parts, story and plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432601">Holland, 2000</xref>). The story is what actually happens, and the plot is how the story is told (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432601">Kozloff, 1987</xref>). Narrative structure or storytelling is at the heart of the television experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432601">Holland, 2000</xref>), since it is the narrative that draws audiences in, engages them, and encourages them to keep viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432601">Hoppenstand, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>American and Korean TV dramas have many differences in narrative strategy. American drama forms are more diverse, including domestic sitcoms, crime thrillers, medical dramas, and other exotic fare such as horror and science fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432601">Hoppenstand, 2009</xref>), while Korean dramas are more homogeneous, typifying conventional episodic and serial forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048511432601">Mittell, 2006</xref>), with romantic drama as the most popular genre, especially romantic tragedies – commonly known as ‘tear bombs’ – such as <italic>Winter Sonata</italic>.</p>
<p>In general, American dramas adopt a more complicated storytelling mode. For example, crime thrillers such as <italic>CSI</italic> are usually very intense, full of profuse details about the characters, relationships, and mysteries requiring solving; or medical dramas, such as <italic>House M.D</italic>., which is about the brilliant but curmudgeonly House, who evolves as a character over time in complex stories; even romantic comedies are more compact and faster in pace, with more stories involved in the lives and loves of the characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432601">Hoppenstand, 2009</xref>). Following the conventional storytelling mode, Korean love stories follow a multi-episodic path, and usually do not reach a conclusion until the slow and lengthy plot twists end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048511432601">Mittell, 2006</xref>). However, the ‘pure love’ and characters’ relationships portrayed in Korean dramas strongly resonate with Chinese audiences due to their ‘cultural proximity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048511432601">Iwabuchi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1748048511432601">Straubhaar, 1991</xref>) and nostalgically remind viewers of their past and present lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048511432601">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432601">O’Sullivan, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Different styles of unfolding narratives may require different patterns of comprehension and literacy, and can offer different rewards and pleasures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048511432601">Casey et al., 2002</xref>). Based on this review, we ask the following research question:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ3:</italic> What narrative appeal of American and Korean TV dramas can be identified among Chinese audiences?</p>
<p>For those viewers who strive to distinguish themselves from others, preference also means taste or lifestyle. Constituted by a set of distinctive preferences, lifestyle can only be clearly understood through comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432601">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Although the prevalence and impact of foreign TV dramas on Chinese society have drawn much attention from a variety of perspectives, research on viewing preference, especially involving comparison between these two main types, is close to nonexistent in China. Therefore, the following research questions are proposed:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ4:</italic> How do viewers who prefer American TV dramas differ from those who prefer Korean ones in terms of lifestyles, gratifications sought, narrative appeal, viewing habits, and demographics?</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ5:</italic> To what extent can demographics, lifestyles, and viewing habits predict gratifications sought by viewing foreign TV dramas?</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ6:</italic> In what ways can demographics, lifestyles, gratifications sought, narrative appeal, and viewing habits predict the viewing frequency of (a) American and (b) Korean TV dramas?</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected through a web-based survey. Although there are a lot of challenges associated with online surveys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048511432601">Couper (2000</xref>) argues that if a survey targets Internet users only, it is a good decision to employ this mode. It is exactly the case for this study. During the three-month data collection period, a link to the survey was posted on Xiaonei.com (the name was later changed to Renren.com in August 2009) – the first Facebook-type and top social network site (SNS) in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432601">CCID, 2009</xref>) – and on top 10 popular online forums on nationally known websites such as Tianya, Sohu, 163, Sina, Xici, and so on. The invitations posted on these websites explicitly informed potential participants that it was a study about foreign TV drama viewing online with a focus on American and Korean dramas.</p>
<p>Of the 470 total responses collected, 455 were valid. The final sample closely resembled the majority (84.3%) of Chinese netizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048511432601">CNNIC, 2009</xref>), consisting of young adults aged between 18 and 34 with a mean age of 25.

<title>Viewing preference and viewing frequency</title>
<p>In assessing viewing preference, respondents were asked: ‘Of American and Korean TV dramas, which one do you prefer?’ and ‘Which channel (terrestrial TV, VCD/DVD, download/online, or others) do you prefer when watching (a) American and (b) Korean TV dramas?’ As for viewing frequency, respondents were asked: ‘How often do you watch (a) American and (b) Korean TV dramas?’ on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very often</italic>).</p>

<p>The 35-item VALS questionnaire was adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048511432601">SRI (2009</xref>). Due to cultural differences, two items (‘Just as the Bible says, the world literally was created in six days’ and ‘The federal government should encourage prayers in public schools’) were eliminated, and the remaining 33 were used to assess the different lifestyle types using a four-point Likert scale, where 1 meant <italic>mostly disagree</italic> and 4 meant <italic>mostly agree</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1748048511432601">
<title>Gratifications</title>
<p>As a qualitative preparatory stage, a focus group was conducted with 15 students who watched both American and Korean TV dramas regularly to gain a better understanding of their motivations in TV drama viewing. Participants were asked to list the gratifications sought from viewing foreign TV dramas. The results were combined with relevant items from the Television Viewing Motives Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748048511432601">Rubin, 1983</xref>). A total of 20 items were adopted using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1748048511432601">
<title>Narrative appeal</title>
<p>Respondents were asked: ‘How do you rate the narrative appeal of your most often watched foreign TV drama (American or Korean)?’ on five bipolar pairs of semantic differentials (i.e. intense/relaxed, diverse/homogeneous, complicated/simple, fast/slow, and compact/lengthy) that were derived from the same focus group. The answers were used to gain a better understanding of how the viewers evaluate or perceive foreign TV dramas in terms of the narrative appeal used in storytelling, pacing, story advancement, and editing.

<title>Lifestyles in urban China</title>
<p>All 33 VALS items were submitted to a principal components factor analysis with Varimax rotation. Six different lifestyle types emerged and were named after the VALS definitions: strivers, experiencers, survivors, makers, thinkers, and innovators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048511432601">Table 1</xref>
). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048511432601">SRI (2009</xref>), strivers are trendy and fun loving, have limited resources, are strongly concerned about others’ opinions, and favor stylish products that emulate the purchases of people with greater material wealth. Experiencers are young, enthusiastic, self-expressive, and highly resourceful, and those who seek variety and excitement. Survivors are cautious consumers with few resources, low innovation, and narrowly focused lives. Survivors are primarily concerned with safety and security, and are loyal to favorite brands, especially if they can purchase them at a discount. Makers are practical people with constructive skills who value self-sufficiency, are suspicious of new ideas, and prefer value to luxury. Thinkers are mature, satisfied, comfortable, and relfective individuals. They are well educated and open to new ideas, but are conservative, practical consumers, looking for durability, functionality, and value. Finally, innovators are at the top of the spectrum with abundant resources and high innovation. Innovators are successful, sophisticated, and receptive to new ideas and challenges with cultivated tastes. Due to cultural differences, some items might not be applicable in urban China; therefore, achievers and believers did not emerge. As a whole, the six lifestyle types were conceptually consistent with the theoretical descriptions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048511432601">SRI (2009</xref>).</p>

<p>A principal components factor analysis with Varimax rotation of 18 items (after two items were dropped) yielded four gratifications sought dimensions, namely entertainment, sociability, learning, and escape (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048511432601">Table 2</xref>
). The first factor was entertainment. This means that foreign TV dramas were watched for entertainment, relaxation, and passing time. The second factor was sociability, indicating that the dramas can be topics to chat about with family members and friends. Learning was the third factor, showing that respondents watched foreign TV dramas to learn foreign languages, be exposed to foreign cultures, or keep up to date about fashion. Finally, the last factor was escape, revealing that watching foreign dramas was to enter another world, which might facilitate adjustments to reality or an escape from responsibilities.</p>

<title>Narrative appeal of American and Korean TV dramas</title>
<p>To test the narrative appeal dimensional structure, a principal components factor analysis with oblique rotation was conducted to determine the potential grouping of the five bipolar adjective pairs on narrative appeal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1748048511432601">Table 3</xref>
). Factor analysis yielded a single dimension with an eigenvalue greater than 1 and a high reliability alpha of .83. The factor consisted of the five bipolar pairs: intense/relaxed, diverse/homogeneous, complicated/simple, fast/slow, and compact/lengthy. Based on the findings, Chinese viewers identify different types of narrative appeal when watching American and Korean TV dramas. The result suggests that the higher the participants scored in each of the five bipolar pairs, the more the viewers preferred Korean TV dramas, as Korean dramas tended to be slower in pace, lengthy in story, relaxed and simple in plot development, and homogeneous in drama type. Conversely, those who scored lower on each pair tended to favor American TV dramas, because the stories of American TV dramas are more likely to be intense, diverse, compact, complicated, and fast-paced.</p>

<title>Preferences for viewing American and Korean TV dramas</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1748048511432601">Table 4</xref>
, discriminant analysis correctly classified 74.1% of the cases. Results show that viewers who evaluated their favorite foreign TV dramas as ‘relaxed’, ‘homogeneous’, ‘simple’, ‘slow’, and ‘lengthy’ tended to prefer Korean dramas. Demographically, women preferred Korean TV dramas. Furthermore, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748048511432601">Pehadzur (1982</xref>), the structure coefficients or function loading values of .30 or above were treated as meaningful in interpreting as significant predictors, and education levels (loading at .29) were found to approach significance. This means that better-educated people tend to embrace American TV dramas more passionately. This may be related to English proficiency and cultural differences. However, there were no significant differences within VALS types and gratifications sought. This suggests that foreign TV dramas may attract different lifestyle types and for different motivations despite their viewing preference.</p>

<title>Predicting viewing frequency of American and Korean TV dramas</title>
<p>Results from two parallel multiple regression analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1748048511432601">Table 6</xref>
) show that for American TV dramas, among the lifestyle types, makers (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), who are practical and value self-sufficiency, watched American dramas more frequently. Two gratifications-sought factors were significant, specifically learning (β = .14,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .05) and escape (β = –.15,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .05), which means that the more respondents sought learning, the more frequently they watched American dramas; while the more the respondents watched for escape, the less frequently they viewed American dramas, since some narration can be quite complex and requires a high degree of involvement to parse out the web of relationships and back story evoked in the plot turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048511432601">Mittell, 2006</xref>). What’s more is that those who evaluated their favorite or most frequently watched foreign TV drama as complicated (β = –.15,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .05) rather than simple, chose online viewing (β = .28,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .001) rather than offline, and those with more monthly income (β = .22,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .001) tended to watch American dramas more frequently.</p>

<p>As for Korean TV dramas, strivers (β = .12,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .05), who are trendy, strongly concerned about others’ approval but have limited resources, watched Korean dramas more frequently. Those who preferred TV dramas that are slower in pace (β = .22,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .01) watched Korean ones more often. Two demographic characteristics were significant, specifically gender (β = .32,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .001), the most powerful predictor, and education (β = –.12,<italic> p </italic>&lt; .05). This implies that women watched Korean dramas more frequently than men, while those with higher education levels watched Korean dramas less frequently than those with lower education levels.</p>

<title>Linking foreign TV drama viewing to lifestyles, gratifications, and social distinction</title>
<p>With the emerging urban middle class, or domestic petit bourgeois in China, there is a highly visible culture of consumption, especially cross-border consumption of popular foreign cultural products. Against such a socially relevant backdrop, this study investigated the possible linkages between American and/or Korean TV drama viewing and lifestyles in the new media landscape. Analyzing lifestyles and different consumption patterns helps us better understand the reconstituted power bloc. Social stratification in China shares several underlying similarities with the West, such as proliferation of consumerism, individualism, and self-reliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048511432601">SBI, 2010</xref>). The classification of VALS types found in this study, to a large extent, coincides with the domestic petit bourgeois lifestyles and differentiation within the burgeoning middle class in urban China. Six lifestyles were successfully identified out of the original eight, which extends the empirical knowledge of VALS across cultures. The two missing types, achievers and believers, might be due to cultural differences, or the still-forming and changing social stratification in China, since some of the groups are more longstanding, while others are newly emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These lifestyles also provide a backdrop for ‘distinction’ in consuming imported TV dramas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048511432601">Leung (1998</xref>) suggested that lifestyles can be useful for supplementing demographics and reflect how consumption meanings are manipulated to fit social identity. The findings of this study supported this because lifestyles were found to be important predictors for gratifications sought. Well-educated and well-informed thinkers were more likely to watch for entertainment and learning. Strivers and innovators tended to watch for sociability. The former are concerned about others’ approval and opinions, while the latter are sophisticated and like to take charge. Those who have limited resources and are suspicious of new ideas watched for escape. In short, the study supported and expanded our understanding of the uses and gratifications theory, and argued that viewing foreign TV dramas could be an index of social distinction in urban China.</p>
<p>Apart from the gratifications sought as suggested in the previous literature, such as entertainment and escape (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432601">Greenberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432601">Lemish, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048511432601">Ostman and Jeffers, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748048511432601">Rubin, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748048511432601">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748048511432601">Rubin et al., 1994</xref>), this study found two other interesting gratifications: sociability and learning. Such results demonstrate that these gratifications sought are closely related to lifestyles. As a kind of recreational activity, viewing TV dramas can also serve as a means of gaining social recognition or influence, or being an opinion leader because the content viewed on foreign TV dramas is often a topic for discussion and exchange. Similarly, learning, as a strong motivation, gives clues to the imagination and imitation of modernity by consuming foreign TV dramas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748048511432601">Xu, 2007</xref>). Viewers were motivated to learn the language, and about the fashion and culture of a foreign country. Watching foreign TV dramas has become a way for Chinese viewers to enhance their ability to ‘modernize’ their lifestyles. In particular, the more viewers seek learning, the more American dramas they watch; while viewers watch fewer American dramas if they seek escape. Industry managers may want to understand the dynamics between gratifications sought in imported TV drama viewing and the lifestyles of their target audiences in China. Thus, future productions coming into the Chinese market could include specific elements to appeal to different segments of the audience.</p>

<title>Narrative appeal, demographics, and viewing preference</title>
<p>As a kind of cultural product, foreign TV dramas carry various lifestyle elements, western and eastern, global and regional. Narrative strategies are important for the popularity of TV dramas. The Chinese viewers’ evaluation indicates that American and Korean TV dramas have distinct and uneven bipolar narrative appeal. The Korean style is more mature but homogeneous, while the American style seems more diverse and dynamic. The differences in narrative appeal can help to build ‘brand’ for different foreign TV dramas. This study supports narrative appeal as a powerful predictor in explaining viewing preference and frequency. In the long run, it is important for producers to pay attention to their specific style of narrative or exotic flavor, and find the right niche for different viewers.</p>
<p>With regard to demographics, women preferred Korean TV dramas, partly because the main genre of Korean drama is the romantic soap opera. The better educated preferred American dramas, partly because the fast and complicated narrative appeal requires highly developed literacy. Cultural practices and preferences such as watching foreign TV dramas are also the product of upbringing and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432601">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Those with lower education levels preferred a simple, slow narrative style. Income was another strong predictor for viewing frequency of American TV dramas, because most American TV dramas are not officially imported or aired by the broadcasters, while Korean ones are usually broadcast provincially or nationwide. However, both can be found online in the latest fansubbed versions, but viewers still need the resources and skills to access the dramas. Different levels of resources can enhance or constrain the expression of primary motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048511432601">SBI, 2010</xref>). This is perhaps partly the reason why the predictive power of VALS falls more or less into demographic characteristics, like income and education levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432601">Bourdieu (1984</xref>) maintains that a society’s culture is as unequally distributed as its material wealth, and it also serves to identify class interests and to promote and naturalize class differences. In present-day China, as a stratified society in transformation, the middle class and lifestyles are still underdeveloped, greatly determined by related resources. Despite the shift in social formation, lower-class factions may be still poorer in cultural capital. Therefore, distinction is mainly led by or to demonstrate economic status, therefore resources might be more important in explaining their media use.</p>

<title>Limitation and suggestions for future research</title>
<p>As for future research, this study suggests that communication scholars should further analyze the lifestyle changes within the transformation of Chinese society in the context of globalization and modernization and the driving force behind it. This phenomenon is closely related to media use, media effects, and many social, economic, and political issues. Researchers may continue to develop and define the Chinese version of VALS to reflect cultural differences, which could be useful for media use studies and comparative research. Follow-up research might also compare Chinese viewers’ perception of domestic TV dramas, which would give us more information about the gratifications and narrative appeal of foreign content. The sample in this study is not very large, and this could give rise to some statistical and other limitations. Therefore, future studies that adopt longitudinal methods using probability samples or anthropological approaches are warranted to address alternative explanations for the significance of TV drama viewing in the construction of identities, such as cultivation or cultural imperialism.</p>

<p>Fansubbing is a new form of subtitling ‘by fans for fans’ in the Internet age. One of the self-imposed rules adopted by fansub groups is to stop the free distribution online of a particular drama once it has been licensed for commercial distribution. Therefore, one commonly sees the text ‘for fair use and stop distribution if this drama gets licensed’ appear on most fansubbed TV dramas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048511432601">Cintas and Sánchez, 2006</xref>).</p>
