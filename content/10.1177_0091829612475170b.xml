<p>Paul the apostle was an effective evangelist. However, his letters have left scholars debating whether or not he envisioned the churches he founded actively seeking converts and spreading the Gospel. James P. Ware continues the conversation by holding Paul’s letter to the Philippians in dialogue with the literature of Second Temple Judaism.</p>
<p>Ware divides his monograph into two major sections: “Conversion of Gentiles in Ancient Judaism” and “Mission in Philippians.” The author understands early Christianity’s missionary thrust to be rooted in Judaism, but not in an ancient Jewish missionary impulse. Instead, Ware situates the origin of Christianity’s drive to spread the Gospel in the Jewish hope for a final influx of Gentiles to the God of Israel, in anticipation of Israel’s coming restoration. Jews did not actively seek converts as early Christians did, but they welcomed them as a fulfillment of Isaiah 40–55 and other prophetic writings.</p>
<p>In his second section, the author presents a detailed yet engaging reading of Philippians, while holding it in enlightening dialogue with ancient Jewish sources. Ware situates his analysis of mission in Philippians against the backdrop of ancient Jewish eschatological expectation for the conversion of Gentiles to the God of Israel. In Philippians, this anticipation reaches fulfillment in the spread of the Christian Gospel. Ware finds that Philippians focuses at length on the mission of the Christian community, and he marshals from the letter significant evidence that Paul indeed envisions his churches actively sharing and proclaiming the Gospel.</p>
<p>One aspect of the book that may concern missiologists is Ware’s definition of mission as “the consciousness of a divine commission or command to bring about the conversion of others through proclamation of the message and associated activities” (9). Some might deem this a narrow definition. However, Ware is speaking of <italic>mission in Paul</italic>, and this concept of mission does not exclude the church also embodying the Gospel through its life.</p>
<p>Baker Academic has performed a vital service by making this book available for a readership wider than allowed by its more expensive earlier publication. A limitation is that, as a reprint originally published in 2005, the volume does not take into account research undertaken after 2004. Moreover, some readers will wish that the original manuscript had been adapted for broader readership, such as by translating the occasional quotations from Greek sources. However, the book is so well written and clearly argued that it is not too technical for non-specialists. I heartily recommend it for anyone desiring to study the biblical roots of Christian mission. It is a superbly researched piece of New Testament scholarship in the service of understanding the church’s mission.</p>
