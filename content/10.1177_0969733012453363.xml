<abstract>
<p>The use of traditional ethical methodologies is inadequate in addressing a constructed maternal–fetal rights conflict in a multicultural obstetrical setting. The use of caring ethics and a relational approach is better suited to address multicultural conceptualizations of autonomy and moral distress. The way power differentials, authoritative knowledge, and informed consent are intertwined in this dilemma will be illuminated by contrasting traditional bioethics and a caring ethics approach. Cultural safety is suggested as a way to develop a relational ontology. Using caring ethics and a relational approach can alleviate moral distress in health-care providers, while promoting collaboration and trust between providers and their patients and ultimately decreasing reproductive disparities. This article examines how a relational approach can be applied to a cross-cultural reproductive dilemma.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traditional ethical methodologies are inadequate in addressing pluralism and divergent values and do not address cultural differences. All ethical dilemmas involve more than one perspective. The perspectives of the health-care provider, patient, fetus, family, and the community and culture of the patient and the larger biomedical community can all influence the dilemma. Differences in intersectionalities can legitimize some epistemologies while silencing others and may be influencing the resolution of ethical dilemmas. Resolving ethical dilemmas requires attending to differing perspectives as well as considering how the dilemma is affecting the various people. This article will examine the way traditional ethics would approach a quintessential ethical dilemma and the inadequacies of these methods in a contemporary and pluralistic setting. Traditional and commonly used methods such as the Four Box Method of ethical analysis, as well as traditional conceptualizations of autonomy, will be applied to the case study described in the following sections. The concepts of power differentials, authoritative knowledge, and informed consent will be examined in the context of this case study. The benefits of ethics of care, relational ontologies, and cultural safety for both health-care providers and patients will also be considered.</p>

<sec id="section2-0969733012453363">
<title>Case study</title>
<p>The fictitious case is a 26-year-old pregnant woman, Amina, of Somali descent. Amina is a refugee, most recently from Dadaab, a refugee camp in Kenya, where she lived for the previous 5 years. This is her third pregnancy. Her first child is 7 years old and was born by vaginal delivery in Somalia and now resides in Seattle with his mother. Her second pregnancy was a miscarriage in Dadaab refugee camp 3 years ago. Amina is pleased with this pregnancy. She lives with her aunt and a cousin who also has two children. The father of the baby is involved, though currently out of state. Amina states that he is working and she expects him to return in the near future. Although Amina speaks some English, a certified interpreter is used for her prenatal visits and childbirth hospitalization. Amina is seeing a midwife because she has heard that midwives give the mother more time to labor without intervening. Her gestational age is 41 weeks and 4 days. Postdatism (pregnancy going past 41 weeks of gestation, which leads to an aging placenta and at times fetal hypoxia) is common in this community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012453363">1</xref>
</sup> It is well known that many members of the Somali community have a profound fear of cesarean sections (C-sections) due to the high maternal mortality rate in Somalia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012453363">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012453363"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012453363">4</xref>
</sup> and beliefs about delayed fertility after a C-section, which have been empirically confirmed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012453363">5</xref>
</sup> Additionally, many members of this community believe that the residents are merely practicing or gaining financial incentives when they recommend a cesarean birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012453363">6</xref>
</sup> Amina has been in latent labor for 6 h. Her cervix is 4 cm, fully effaced, and −1 station. Her contractions are every 2–5 min, spontaneous, and of moderate strength. Her cervix on admit, 11 a.m., was 2 cm, 50% effaced, and −2 station. It is now 5 p.m. The external fetal monitoring (EFM) indicates a fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline of 130, with minimal long-term variability. The FHR now indicates late decelerations, which are intermittent now but becoming more frequent. The midwife has requested an obstetrical consult in view of the increasing signs of fetal distress. Obstetricians are obligated by their training to recommend a C-section when one is indicated—even if it is likely that a recommendation for a cesarean delivery will be met with dismay or outright refusal. The resident on staff makes the recommendation accordingly, and Amina is visibly upset. She declines a C-section, saying that she needs more time to labor. She begins to pray out loud in Somali as the FHR continues its decelerations.</p>
<sec id="section3-0969733012453363">
<title>How should Amina’s health-care providers proceed?</title>
<p>This case can be considered a sort of prototype of ethical dilemmas that occur in our globalized and increasingly pluralistic world. Indeed, in an article on the subject, Essén et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012453363">7</xref>
</sup> query as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The paucity of advice available to practitioners might be due to the likelihood that qualitative research in this area is in need of much attention. How should the maternal care provider respond to this special situation when a woman has a valid perspective of apprehension based on fear and refuses the treatment, which is, conversely, the treatment most likely to prevent the adverse outcome she fears? (p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote> Cases such as these require innovative strategies. Comparing traditional strategies with newer strategies can guide health-care providers.</p>

<title>Clarifying and solving ethical dilemmas: the Four Box Method</title>
<p>The first approach used in the analysis of this case study was the Four Box Method.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012453363">8</xref>
</sup> The Four Box Method is a traditional tool commonly used by health-care providers to analyze biomedical ethical dilemmas. The method examines the case’s medical indications, patient’s preferences, quality of life, and contextual elements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012453363">9</xref>
</sup> This was the initial ethical method that was applied to this case using both the fetal and maternal perspectives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012453363">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733012453363">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Much of the text within each section of the box conflicted with text in another section. For example, patient preferences conflicted with medical indications. Furthermore, the addition of the fetal perspective created the paradigm of conflicted maternal–fetal rights. The Four Box Method was useful in organizing information; however, the following two problems arose: first, there was a lack of clarity on the direction in which to proceed, and second, the notion of conflicted maternal–fetal rights arose because, depending on whether the maternal or fetal perspective was used, the course of action could differ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012453363">
<title>Conflicted maternal–fetal rights and personhood</title>
<p>The ethical issue of contested maternal–fetal rights quickly emerged in this case study. In this scenario, the mother wishes to avoid a C-section. If we imagine that the fetus “wishes” to avoid morbidity and/or mortality, we would conclude that the fetus would also wish an expedited surgical delivery. (Obviously, this is based on conjecture, since we cannot identify fetal wishes.) Historically, in the United States, the fetus has not been recognized as a person with full rights; legal rights have been focused on the mother, with the fetus being considered an inseverable part of her body. In a statement that seems to support increased maternal and fetal surveillance, however, one legal dictionary states that in spite of fetal nonpersonhood, “Nevertheless, U.S. law has in certain instances granted the fetus limited rights, particularly as medical science has made it increasingly possible to directly view, monitor, diagnose, and treat the fetus as a patient.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012453363">10</xref>
</sup> Since advancing technology enables obstetricians to perform increasingly complex fetal interventions, mothers are increasingly viewed as obstacles to fetal survival when the mother declines a high-technology intervention that had a high probability of success.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012453363">11</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, in those cases, when the treatment is declined by the mother, it is often conceptualized as a maternal–fetal rights conflict. One of the factors in this dilemma is the question of which epistemological methods are being privileged, and by whom. Women from Somalia may be using traditional or “women’s ways of knowing.” Or they may be using historical knowledge to make decisions, while health-care providers are using Western and empirical epistemologies.</p>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Ethics and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee stated that in terms of newly available interventions on the mother that are designed to facilitate optimal <italic>fetal</italic> outcomes (such as intrauterine fetal surgery), it is critical to obtain informed consent, and if the mother declines, her autonomy must be fully respected. The recommendation regarding fetal interventions in utero is as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because it is impossible to treat the fetus without going through the pregnant woman either physically or pharmacologically, any fetal intervention has implications for the pregnant woman’s health and necessarily her bodily integrity and, therefore, cannot be performed without her explicit informed consent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012453363">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> This recommendation is clear that maternal autonomy must be respected; however, this traditional conceptualization still constructs a view of conflicted maternal–fetal rights.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733012453363">
<title>Alternatives to traditional maternal–fetal right conceptualizations: a relational conceptualization</title>
<p>Conflicted maternal–fetal rights occur more often than we realize, but due to the normalizing of standard procedures such as prenatal tests and fetal monitoring, we seldom notice how standard interventions can diminish maternal autonomy by making the intervention a standard expectation rather than an autonomous decision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012453363">13</xref>
</sup> If the fetus is considered to be a patient, these conflicts are apt to increase; however, “the patient status of a fetus is not always absolute, depending on the prevailing authority taking theological, philosophical or simply a consequentialist consideration” (p. 43),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012453363">13</xref>
</sup> giving much room for interpretation, especially when there are two cultures with differing values involved.</p>
<p>Women from Somalia often do not view Amina’s risk of fetal demise as a maternal–fetal rights conflict, but rather as an unfortunate possibility in childbirth. There are two conceivable reasons for this. First, the Somali culture does not view self-efficacy, determinism, and individualism in the same way as Western cultures; Somali culture is more communitarian and less individualistic.There is a high rate of maternal and infant mortality in Somalia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012453363">14</xref>
</sup> which may explain the sense of fatalism in this community. This fatalism in part is an expression of faith and is reflected in the often-heard phrase “Inshallah.” “Inshallah” means “as Allah wills”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012453363">15</xref>
</sup> and expresses the belief that life and death are in the hands of Allah. Thus, to say Inshallah is both an exclamation of faith in Allah and acceptance of the will of Allah. In the clinical scenario involving fetal mortality, many women from Somalia will stoically and quietly grieve the loss of their child. Grieving stoically is seen as a sign of faith and acceptance of God’s will.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012453363">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Relational ethics may enable the provider to contextualize the scenario and understand the perspective of the individual. A relational paradigm uses a view that “that which is good for the mother is good for the fetus.” Different cultures define personhood differently. Western legal and medical conceptualizations of personhood depend on notions of biology, and potential or actual moral agency, as well as the question of whether these characteristics reside within the individual. Other cultures may have a more relational and communitarian view of personhood than the Western culture. Pregnancy, for example, requires a nuanced approach to personhood, including a more communitarian and relational paradigm that respects the autonomy of the mother while promoting fetal well-being in the context of the mother’s situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012453363">11</xref>
</sup> Using relational ethics enables the provider to “care for the woman in the social sense of being situated within a web of relationships, not simply a member of a category” (p. 338).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012453363">11</xref>
</sup> Contextualized with cultural values, the maternal–fetal rights paradigm loses some significance in this case. The problem with over-legitimizing fetal rights is that it polarizes the best interests of both and privileges one perspective over another. In a nonpolarized view, it is better to provide comprehensive care for the mother because, by extension, care for the mother carries over to the fetus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012453363">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>An additional concern with over-legitimizing fetal rights is that it carries the risk of replication of gendered and racial inequalities and that a conflict-based paradigm may erode the trust women have in the health-care providers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012453363">17</xref>
</sup> This may be at work in the fictional case study of Amina, especially when we consider the reproductive disparities that have been documented in the Somali population<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012453363">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012453363">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012453363">18</xref>
</sup> as well as the findings that women from Somalia often have a sense of discrimination and mistrust in health-care services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012453363">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012453363">19</xref>

</sup> The reproductive disparities, perception of discrimination, and distrust in this community may be addressed by fostering an approach of relational ethics.</p>
<p>A paradigm that considers that “that which is good for the mother is also good for the fetus” is a paradigm that will go further toward finding a solution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012453363">17</xref>
</sup> Caring ethics and relational aspects of care offer a better description of what is needed to begin resolving this pluralistic ethical dilemma by addressing a view that does not replicate the maternal–fetal Cartesian split that arose out of traditional conceptualizations of mother and fetus. Proceeding with this caveat in mind may be productive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012453363">
<title>Informed consent, incomplete disclosure, and possible barriers to informed consent</title>
<p>This case is plagued with difficulties in achieving informed consent, including cultural and religious beliefs that conflict with medical care, full disclosure of risks and benefits of proposed interventions, constructed maternal–fetal rights dilemmas, and conflicts between the principles of autonomy and beneficence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012453363">27</xref>
</sup> Consenting women for EFM within the time constraints and the emotional acuity and duress of labor is difficult under the best of circumstances. It is further complicated when language and cultural barriers arise. Therefore, it may be best to address consent for technological interventions or diagnostics (such as EFM) in the prenatal time period.</p>
<p>There are several special concerns with the use of EFM. One concern is disclosure of relevant information regarding the use of EFM. Women are not typically informed of all the implications in the use of EFM, despite the high number of false positives in diagnosing fetal distress and increased C-section rates associated with the monitoring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012453363">28</xref>
</sup> The use of EFM should require informed consent, especially since it may lead (as a result of a false positive) to an unnecessary C-section.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012453363">29</xref>
</sup> Given that Somali women are typically even more concerned about C-sections than others, informed consent is even more critical for them. The partial disclosure of the EFM/C-section relationship is one of the ways that fully informed consent is not achieved, and it normalizes the use of Western epistemologies and technology. There are other factors to be considered in the dynamic of health-care providers and informed consent, including the factor of “accepted standards of care.” The full disclosure of consent can be constrained by both the possibility of experiences and feelings of moral distress in the health-care provider and legal influences in the context of a high incidence of litigation in obstetrics. Until these factors are evaluated and attended to, it is unlikely that current practices of informed consent will change.</p>
<p>The second concern with informed consent is the notion of providing a reasonable choice from a set of options provided. Too often the mother is presented with the polarized option of C-section or continuing labor. Possible intermediary steps might also be considered, including (a) promoting labor as an option for a specified amount of time with reevaluation after the elapsed time span or (b) using other diagnostic tests of fetal well-being, such as fetal pulse oximetry, fetal scalp pH, or fetal biophysical profile testing. Currently, these diagnostic tests are not used, and it is beyond the scope of this article to address this. However, these may be avenues worth exploring.</p>
<p>Many health-care providers are troubled when patients do not readily accept recommendations and may experience cultural conflict or moral distress as a result. If a patient declines a proposed plan of care or intervention, it is critical to continue to treat the patient with respect. As Thachuk explains, “Informed consent is presented as the right to relevant information and a predetermined set of options from which to choose. It emphasizes the individual’s right to opt out” (p. 45).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012453363">30</xref>
</sup> The rights of the patient may be weakened if issues of discrimination and oppression are not acknowledged and resolved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012453363">31</xref>
</sup> The intersectionalities of many women from Somalia (gender, ethnicity, refugee status, class, and so on) place them in a subordinate position compared to health-care providers. Hence, the following question arises: How do these intersectionalities, as well as any perceptions of racism, affect ethical decision making?
<disp-quote>
<p>In withholding consent the patient is often seen as acting contrarily to medical advice and deemed noncompliant. These issues of coercion should be seen at a macro-level not simply at the micro level of physician patient […] Broader social factors that may be inhibiting the individual’s sense of choice and freedom must be taken into consideration (p. 45).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012453363">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> If the decision is not deemed to be rational, or is perceived to be emotionally founded, the patient, especially a woman, may be perceived to be acting irrationally.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012453363">30</xref>
</sup> Irrationality is often suggested with greater facility if the patient is marginalized with multiple intersectionalities. Treating a patient’s decisions as noncompliance is in conflict with the principle of respect for autonomy.</p>

<title>Authoritative and legitimized knowledge</title>
<p>The analysis of this ethical dilemma would be incomplete without an examination of how authoritative knowledge is used in obstetrical settings. Jordan’s notion of authoritative knowledge is as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>In many situations, equally legitimate parallel knowledge systems exist and people move easily between them, using them sequentially or in parallel fashion for particular purposes. But frequently one knowledge gains ascendance and legitimacy. A consequence of legitimization of one kind of knowing as authoritative is the devaluation often the dismissal of other ways of knowing. Those who espouse alternative knowledge systems then tend to be seen as backward, ignorant and naïve or worse, simply as trouble makers (p. 56).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012453363">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Jordan explains how authoritative knowledge becomes legitimized and normalized while women's of knowing are devalued.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012453363">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The process of delegitimizing women's ways of knowing contributes to a situation where women who use other types of knowledge systems or resist complying with biomedical recommendations may have face legal enforcement of the biomedical knowledge such as in the case of court ordered cesarean sections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012453363">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> When authoritative knowledge is exclusively legitimized, conflicts with the premises of patient-centered care and cultural safety develop.</p>
<p>In an ethnographic study documenting this specific concern, this quote explicates what is happening:
<disp-quote>
<p>In terms of the disagreement between providers and patients surrounding treatment and care, the issue is hardly that providers do not have their patients’ best interest in mind; rather providers believe they know best and often implement their beliefs by force. Providers are aware that trust must be re-established with the Somali community, but are unwilling to give up their right to make the final decision (p. 101).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012453363">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> This idea of different types of knowledge being devalued can be seen when women from Somalia said to health-care providers that they thought that too many C-sections were being performed on Somali women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012453363">6</xref>
</sup> Initially, this met with some skepticism; however, this disproportionate high incidence of C-sections in Somali mothers (along with other reproductive disparities) was later confirmed by quantitative research, at both the local and global levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012453363">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012453363">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012453363">18</xref>
</sup> This fascinating confirmation of unlegitimized knowledge gives credibility to the idea that the knowledge systems used by Somali women should be valued. Compared to other systems like the biomedical system of knowledge, it is apparent that Somali women’s knowledge system is not legitimized.</p>
<p>If health-care providers are required to provide patient-centered care and Culturally Safe Care that may conflict with the legitimized and authoritative knowledge they have been acculturated to by virtue of their medical training, it stands to reason that they will need guidance and assistance in how to navigate the legal, moral, ethical, and emotional aspects that are part of this new scenario.</p>

<sec id="section10-0969733012453363">
<title>Moral distress in multicultural settings</title>
<p>Health-care providers may be experiencing moral distress in scenarios such as in Amina’s case study. The first definition of moral distress was given by Jameton (who also coined the term) as “the inability of a moral agent to act according to his or her core values and perceived obligations due to internal and external constraints.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012453363">35</xref>
</sup> The process of globalization brings people of widely differing values and belief systems into close communication, with little examination of the implicit and divergent values each party brings into the encounter. This absence of examination in turn significantly impacts the ethical dilemma. Being cognizant of the validity of differing values is a primary step in resolving ethical issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012453363">36</xref>
</sup> Therefore, it is important that health-care providers do not conflate moral distress with the <italic>emotional distress</italic> they feel that is inherent in patient suffering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012453363">32</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, it is critical for providers to be aware of any distress that is related to one’s discomfort with another’s subjectivity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012453363">37</xref>
</sup> Researchers of moral distress can distinguish the natural feelings of sadness and loss that health-care providers experience over the loss of a patient from the unique emotions attendant upon moral distress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012453363">32</xref>
</sup> With moral distress, the feeling is one of powerlessness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012453363">31</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012453363">37</xref>

<title>Respect for alternative conceptualizations of autonomy</title>
<p>Traditional ethics have privileged respect for autonomy, which requires both intellectual capacity and freedom from physical coercion. Traditional features of autonomy (e.g. principlism) consider autonomy at a single point in time (cross sectional), individualistically, independently, and with a paradigm of self-efficacy. These features of autonomy imply that the autonomous agent should simply be left alone and not interfered with, and that decisions are a single and categorical (snapshot) event. However, this conceptualization of autonomy fails to describe what is needed to stay respectful of autonomy in this hypothetical case study. The traditional descriptors of autonomy are inadequate here. In this case, one first needs to have understanding of the implications of the various decision options. Then, one needs freedom from emotional coercion, self-confidence, some financial security, and freedom from structural injustice (e.g. racism and sexism). All of which suggest that autonomy as it is traditionally defined is inadequate, because it implicitly conveys an idea that the patient should be left alone and not interfered with, that is, left alone to make an autonomous decision. Traditional conceptualizations of autonomy have been particularly inadequate in addressing ethical dilemmas around cultural differences where autonomy is considered in a more communitarian and relational manner (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0969733012453363">4</xref> for a contrast of the three ethical approaches).</p>

<p>The traditional conceptualization of autonomy directly counters the wishes of women from Somalia seeking reproductive care in Western settings, a population that has voiced concerns over inadequate support and communication from health-care providers and has expressed feelings of abandonment, loneliness, and neglect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012453363">26</xref>
</sup> Through a literature review, it was found that many Somali women want health-care providers to be cognizant of their situational and contextual life experience and have voiced perceptions of discrimination. Conversely, allotting more time for the relational aspects of caregiving and the development of trust was identified as a favorable characteristic in health-care settings.<sup>

</sup> In one study, the authors communicate their findings in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Nonverbal dimensions of communication—such as showing kindness and patience—emerged as important in culturally competent care among our group of participants. Such nonverbal cues, when occurring with other patient centered communication behaviors such as showing interest in the person’s context, life experiences, and cultural background are likely to improve comfort and satisfaction with preventive health care services. Patient-centered communication can improve shared decision-making about appropriate screening, alleviate anxiety, and improve trust. This is consistent with other studies showing that patients’ perceptions of the clinician of “knowing” the patient, recognizing and valuing their life experiences is important and may help to improve adherence, satisfaction and use of primary care health services (p. 342).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012453363">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> Perceptions of existing discrimination and the need to develop trust, rapport, and understanding of situational and contextual factors require an alternative to traditional ethics. Using a traditional conceptualization of autonomy would further the aloneness these women have identified as being problematic. These findings, taken as a whole, suggest that women from Somalia have identified several areas in which health care can be made more accessible, and that a new relational ethics might be helpful in resolving cases such as Amina’s hypothetical case study.</p>

<title>Relational autonomy</title>
<p>Relational autonomy is based on premises of interdependency and has varying degrees, which differ with different realms and times. It posits the notion that autonomy is a <italic>capacity</italic> that can be either undermined or bolstered by others. Respect for autonomy as defined by Sherwin “is usually interpreted as acknowledging and protecting competent patients’ authority to accept or refuse whatever specific treatments the health-care providers they consult find it appropriate to offer them” (p. 21).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012453363">31</xref>
</sup> Autonomy is greatly valued and endorsed in the North American context, which tends to be highly individualistic. Respect for autonomy assists in the navigation of situations where health-care providers are providing services for persons with vastly different experiences, values, and beliefs. As such, it can be a corrective maneuver when there are large gradients in social power such as would be found in multicultural encounters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012453363">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although it is important not to essentialize, there are some cultural norms worth noting in this ethical case. The Somali community in general has a more communitarian perspective than is typical in Western settings, for example. In this community, there is an expectation that the individual always be concerned with the welfare of the community and the Faith (Islam). This communitarian aspect indicates that individuals do not conceive of their individual desires/values/plans as being independent of their relations to others. Thus, the relational conception of autonomy would seem to be much more congruent with Somali cultural norms than would the traditional conception of autonomy. Relational aspects of care ethics facilitate learning both cultural norms and individual values in the relationship with the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0969733012453363">
<title>Relational ethics</title>
<p>We can take relational insight further than just autonomy. The theory of care ethics emphasizes the notion that humans are ontologically related and considers the postmodern perspectives of interdependence and subjectivity as its premises. The ethics of care has several premises. First, it assumes that we take responsibility for meeting the needs of others and value the emotional and relational aspects of the health-care provider–patient relationship. Relational ethics requires the respect for an epistemology of contextual understanding in caring for others. It rejects the value of impartiality in dominant moral theories and distinguishes between the public and private dimensions of ethical care, adopting a relational conceptualization of persons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012453363">42</xref>
</sup> For example, dominant moral theories conceptualize autonomy as individualistic and independent, which is biased toward a Western perspective. Relational ethics, which is closely related to care ethics, operates under a premise of interdependence, promotes relational ontologies, rejects impartiality, and is committed to the particular patient and the nuances of that patient’s life. Relational ethics is context responsive and attends to the specific contextual details (desire for many children, experiences of loss of family, and so on) involved in the dilemma. Characteristics that are part of a feminist and relational approach to ethics include caring as a way of interacting with others, uncovering bias against oppressed groups, examining inequities in power, using the lived experience to analyze ethical processes, and balancing impartiality with partiality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012453363">10</xref>
</sup> An ethics of care is a normative and feminist theory that legitimizes the context of the ethical dilemma and emphasizes relational aspects involved in the process of finding a resolution to the dilemma.</p>
<p>Engaging in relational ethics will assist health-care providers in understanding the context of the lives of Somali patients. Contextualizing the decisions of patients provides the opportunity to understand the plausibility of previously incomprehensible decisions such as refusing a C-section because of the desire for many children, beliefs around faith, fear about mortality and morbidity, and the high incidence of false positives in fetal monitoring. Understanding the plausibility of a decision (even when that decision seems counterintuitive) may help allay moral confusion for health-care providers. Understanding moral distress as interconnected and contextual and then using this understanding to act relationally can diminish the effects of moral distress. Practicing relational resistance to the dichotomy of ideals versus the reality of practice can help all members of the health-care team find ways to manage the root causes of moral distress.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012453363">44</xref>
</sup> Cultural safety is defined as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The effective nursing of a person or family from another culture by a nurse who has undertaken a process of reflection on own cultural identity and who recognizes the impact of the nurse’s own culture on own nursing practice. Unsafe cultural practice is any action which diminishes, demeans or disempowers the cultural identity and well-being of an individual (p. 4).<sup>

<p>Undoubtedly, what is defined as culturally safe will vary from patient to patient. The idea is to contextualize the scenario and develop relational aspects while legitimizing the patient’s perspective.</p>
<p>One way the premises of cultural safety could be instituted is by clinicians adopting the premises of patient-centered care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733012453363">52</xref>
</sup> The basic premises of patient-centered care are dignity and respect, information sharing, participation, and collaboration. Cultural safety is consistent with the principles of patient-centered care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012453363">53</xref>
</sup> The premises of cultural safety are participation, protection, and partnership. The reason cultural safety is considered by many to be critical to patient-centered care is that cultural safety requires the health-care provider to be cognizant of power differentials and the imposition of personal values onto the patient, thereby disadvantaging the patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969733012453363">54</xref>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Women from Somalia have voiced a wish for reproductive health-care that is responsive to context and includes relational aspects. A relational ontology can be developed using the premises of an ethics of care, relational autonomy, and cultural safety and is consistent with the expressed wishes of this community. The perception of a culturally unsafe environment, by contrast, may be a barrier in accessing care. Another question researchers may pursue would be the question of whether reproductive disparities are lessened when relational aspects of caring ethics are utilized early in prenatal care for this population.</p>
<p>The use of caring ethics and a relational ontology requires the systems level provision of educational and clinical environments that assist health-care providers to change the current paradigm. The change to a paradigm of cultural safety, Relational Ontology, and Caring Ethics will assist health-care providers to manage moral distress while promoting improved emotional and relational aspects of their work. The use of an ethics of care not only contributes to Culturally Safe Care for patients, but will also support health-care <italic>providers</italic>, by helping them gain contextual understanding, trust, and rapport with patients—which in turn may help alleviate moral and emotional distress, improve collaboration, and decrease litigation.</p>
<p>The use of traditional ethics has been inadequate in resolving this ethical dilemma, and in some ways has contributed to the construction of a maternal–fetal rights dilemma that occurs when women decline reproductive interventions. Traditional conceptualizations of respect for autonomy have not addressed relational aspects of autonomy that are used by many people and would in fact exacerbate the relational disconnect voiced by many patients. Furthermore, traditional ethics have not addressed power differentials that are manifested by the legitimacy of only certain types of epistemologies, such as authoritative knowledge. Finally, the way in which informed consent is implicitly assumed to be done requires further exploration. The use of cultural safety may be a way to develop relational aspects. Ethical methodologies that use an ethics of care and develop relational aspects of the provider–patient encounter may alleviate some of the mistrust, moral distress, and perception of discrimination, as well as the reproductive disparities prevalent in this community.</p>

<sec id="section16-0969733012453363">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Traditional paradigms used in pluralistic health-care settings, such as autonomy, cultural competency, and ethics, are inadequate at addressing new ethical dilemmas that require the use of new and innovative paradigms. As the case study illustrates, ethical dilemmas are complex and multifaceted. Ethical dilemmas often occur when there is insufficient attention to the conflicted perspectives of the people involved. In this case, we considered the perspectives of the Somali mother, her family, and her community, as well as that of the health-care provider. If we recognize that there are at least two cultures involved here (the biomedical culture and the Somali culture), it will illuminate some of the many facets of this ethical dilemma. With multiple cultures come multiple perspectives, perspectives on personhood, autonomy, and sources of legitimate knowledge. Critical paradigms such as cultural safety, ethics of care, and relational autonomy may be effective in alleviating both cultural dissonance and moral distress in both health-care providers and Somali community members.</p>
