<p>In tune with worldwide currents a great transformation started along a short strip on the coast of Oaxaca in 1990. Turtle fishing – which defined life and work, and the tempo and contours surrounding the village of Mazunte – was halted by presidential decree, its workers converted from predators into guardians of nature. This did not happen overnight but over a few years and under the stewardship of an emergent civil society that coordinated the efforts of environmental NGOs, the regulations of corresponding governmental agencies, and funding from private and public donors. According to one author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308275X12449102">Cathcart, 1997</xref>), this was nothing short of a miracle and she went on to name it ‘<italic>El milagro de Mazunte</italic>’ (the Mazunte Miracle). Here I discuss the transformation of the social relations of production under the class project that lent this ‘miracle’ resonance and meaning.</p>
<p>Cathcart is not the only myth-maker narrating a religious tale of epiphanies and conversions among the workers of the main turtle fishery on the coast of Oaxaca. Respected authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308275X12449102">Barkin, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308275X12449102">1998</xref>), committed enthusiasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308275X12449102">Baumhackl, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308275X12449102">2003</xref>) and the NGOs in charge of the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308275X12449102">Ecosolar, 1996</xref>) provided accounts in which the closure of the fishery created both a crisis and an opportunity for a win-win situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>). Jobless (as the slaughterhouses along with the rest of the infrastructure closed down) and unable to turn to any other productive activity, workers and fishermen had two choices: enlarging the black market for turtle eggs (among other illegal activities) or participating in the efforts of committed green activists in search of sustainable development in eco-tourism and turtle conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308275X12449102">Roldán, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>According to this narrative, most of the natives listened and converted to this gospel, changing their productive vocation from predators and marginal growers of foodstuffs into service sector tour guides, growers of organic products, and brothers and sisters committed to conservation. The hope was that this would lead to the prompt recovery of ‘the marine turtle’, the launching of profitable businesses and the healthy communion of different social groups from around the world and Mexican society. The framing of the transformation as a miracle was thus justified because social poverty and environmental degradation could be reversed through the working of small-scale capitalist ventures and a market economy of services based on consumer solidarity.</p>
<p>With the goal of peeling this social ‘onion’, with its multiple layers of meaning and lachrymose potential, in the 2007–8 academic year I led a research crew<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0308275X12449102">1</xref></sup> to Mazunte. In our preparations for the field, we framed the narratives about the miracle as a mean to build consensus. The transformation and its representation was partially informed by conservation biology as a discipline of crisis, but also tied to environmentalism as a daily practice of class rule embedded in the project of third way politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308275X12449102">Giddens, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The miracle brought different classes and groups of people into contact. Given the different resources and powers that produced them, and that they were able to mobilize, this invigorated an outdated colonial situation under the dominion of the third sector. Dark-skinned and poorly educated workers became ‘locals/natives’ for university-educated and often pale-faced freelance entrepreneurs from Mexican cities, NATO states and a few adventurers from the Global South. The labour-surplus classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0308275X12449102">Ruccio, 2009</xref>) were conscripted (not without quarrels and their own resisting voices) as forced conservationists into the imported schemas of the leading group.</p>
<p>The transformation of the region through the rise of the third sector has been an ideological success. The process interweaves changes from fisheries and agricultural production to touristic and conservation services, the rise of NGOs as mediators replacing the patron–client corporative structures of a state party with those of civil society, and an ideological shift that puts forward a new frame of relations among populations and between nature and society under a market logic. All this has been done, we are told, for the turtles’ sake.</p>
<p>The third sector is not a term used in common parlance but in literature dealing with consensus building and problem solving between governments (the first sector) and business (the second sector) dealing with vulnerable, resilient or subaltern classes. Regardless of this lack of usage, government officials, NGO staff, business people and workers have agreed on its contours. There is an ample literature on the emergence and virtues of the third sector as a progressive force and democratic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0308275X12449102">Salamon, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0308275X12449102">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0308275X12449102">Salamon et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0308275X12449102">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0308275X12449102">2000</xref>) and this is well known among political scientists and administration professionals in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0308275X12449102">Natal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0308275X12449102">Olvera, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0308275X12449102">Rojas et al., 2011</xref>). However its regional application followed a complex process of transculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0308275X12449102">Ortiz, 1995</xref>). Only the main idea, identifying a compromise between public and private sectors to be led by organizations for and from civil society, can be recognized.</p>
<p>In this article I argue an interpretation focused on the relation between coercion and consent in a hegemonic process of class rule. The Mexican state shifted the economic vocation of a region with force and eloquence. On the one hand, the navy worked as a clenched iron fist, while on the other environmentalist organizations from civil society acted as the velvet glove for the invisible hand of capitalist development. The data is original and produced collectively by the research crew from more than ten dozen interviews with regional social actors and thousands of hours of different forms of observation and archival work. The interpretations are mine and do not necessarily represent the views of the other researchers.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0308275X12449102"><title>The miracle of the third sector</title>
<p>The region under study has undergone dramatic changes during the past 20 years. The ending of the turtle fishery by presidential decree in 1990 was followed by the federal reform for the stimulation of a land market in 1992, which turned commons into real estate, and environmental devastation wrought by two hurricanes in 1997. Within this frame of time and events, the surplus-labour producing classes were forced into new arrangements with a nascent class segment – those who paved the way for the domination of the third sector – in economic and social organization. By the turn of the millennium, the success of the project was certainly mystifying.</p>
<p>The main event setting the process in motion was the aforementioned closing of the turtle fishery and slaughterhouse located in San Agustinillo, a hamlet adjacent to Mazunte. This was Mexico’s largest base for the turtle industry; it integrated a workforce of a few thousand people in the region, connecting a major beach for turtle landing and laying of eggs (Escobilla), a port to export commodities to international markets (Puerto Angel) and the processing plant for the captured turtles (San Agustinillo-Mazunte). The fishery started as a producer of turtle leather, which was in vogue worldwide during the early and middle 20th century for the manufacture of luxury products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308275X12449102">Early, 2011</xref>). Over time and under state direction it also produced industrial byproducts from the cartilage, bones and shell (mainly for fertilizers), and meat for a regional market. The fishery had a parasite activity in the banned practice of egg gathering from nests and turtle poaching (for undeposited eggs) for a national black market. The exploitation of the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle (<italic>Lepidochelis olivacea</italic>) on which the fishery was based, as well as the Black Turtle (<italic>Chelonia agassizii</italic>), Leatherback (<italic>Dermochelis coriacea</italic>) and Hawksbill (<italic>Eremochelys imbricata</italic>), of which poaching remains common, was the main activity on the coast of Oaxaca from the late 1950s to 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449102">Early, 2010</xref>). Their capture was organized by fishing cooperatives, which enjoyed state support.</p>
<p>The population that worked on the fishery, and poached turtles on a common basis, was composed of immigrants from the Sierra Sur and from other Mexican states along the Pacific coast. The region has a recent history of colonization under the federal policy known as <italic>la marcha al mar</italic> (the march to the sea), begun in the mid 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308275X12449102">Gatti, 1986</xref>: 26). In close proximity to the region were the older coffee districts of the Sierra Sur (Pluma Hidalgo and Juquila), which demanded seasonal labour from the Loxicha highlands, and for which maize has to be produced in small plots of land scattered between the coast and the start of the premium coffee lands (the band between 900 and 1200 metres above sea level). The land in which maize and other foodstuffs were produced has a violent history of conflict and confrontation between different settlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449102">Morales, 2009</xref>). Several families appropriated vast tracts which were continuously invaded and planted by waves of immigrants. Threats and killings were common until the Mexican state mediated local conflicts through its agrarian law and institutional apparatus for the establishment of a system of communal land tenure. This demanded the promotion and organization of a ‘social sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308275X12449102">Macip, 2005</xref>) – composed of fishing cooperatives and agricultural/land tenure governing bodies – for the administration of agro-industrial state-sponsored productive packages as the fabric of patron–client relations. The regional labour-surplus population was therefore simultaneously proletarianized and peasantized by the Mexican state, and integrated, in a subordinate position, into the government-led efforts known as ‘<italic>desarrollo estabilizador</italic>’ or ‘<italic>nacionalismo revolucionario</italic>’ (steady development and revolutionary nationalism respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308275X12449102">Bartra, 2007</xref>: 212). The waves of boom and bust of such commodities (turtle leather and coffee) in the international market and the national policies of food production (maize and beans) affected the daily life of the regional population. However, the state party political regime, whose economy supplied raw materials to the world economy, did provide some sense of security for social reproduction. Worldwide trends were therefore important for the main colonization of the region in the mid 20th century, and their shifts and changes have reshaped the regional dynamics and relations among its populations for a renewed integration under a different leadership.</p>
<p>By the 1980s coffee prices were on the decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308275X12449102">Bartra, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308275X12449102">Macip, 2005</xref>). At the same time turtle fisheries became a target for international conservation efforts. The extent to which ‘saving turtles’ represented a genuine shift in consciousness among former consumers of turtle byproducts and the reasons behind it exceeds the scope of this article. What is evident, however, is that the identification of sea turtles as a ‘charismatic’ species to rally behind was used against Mexican fisheries by the lobby of the United States Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishing fleet. Even if their arguments were sound – the Mexican shrimping fleet was old and obsolete, resulting in a large number of incidental captures of sea turtles on a daily basis, thus decimating their population – it was also true that lower production costs gave the decrepit Mexican fleet an advantage in a competitive and, to this day, growing consumer market for wild shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X12449102">Escobar, 2008</xref>: 86). The competing interests between shrimp fishing and turtle conservation made this discussion a pressing issue in the late 1980s/early 1990s and it was passionately debated in the Gulf of Mexico ports, yet the discussion seemed somewhat disingenuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308275X12449102">Macip, 1993</xref>). In a different but related register, the international campaign and lobby to halt the turtle fishery was well coordinated and concentrated on the Mexican presidency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449102">Early, 2010</xref>: 47–52). Its success came as a surprise to everyone; in 1990 President Salinas pronounced a total ban on turtle captures throughout the country, which was followed by the withdrawal of public support for all fisheries and therefore the effective dismantling of most fleets and associated infrastructure (ports, warehouses, refrigerating stations, vehicles and bureaucratic support).</p>
<p>Since then the enforcement of the ban has relied on the Armada de México (Mexican Navy), which switched from seasonal patrolling to permanently occupying turtle nesting areas. In the years between 1990 and 1994 the navy made clear to poachers that it was a crushing iron fist. Stories of abuses and extrajudicial brutality inflicted by naval officers against citizens breaking the law are still commonly invoked throughout the region to illustrate how extreme the changes were. People who were caught gathering eggs from nests and poaching turtles or storing them were flogged, forced to eat whole nests and sacks of raw eggs, and were imprisoned without being subject to any judicial process, among other illegal procedures. One consequence of the spectacular irruption in 1994 of the Zapatista guerrillas from Chiapas into public life has been the mass adoption of ‘human rights’ as a term to oppose specific forms of extrajudicial coercion and illegal state controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308275X12449102">Clara, 2010</xref>). Over the years, the navy reduced the intensity and frequency of such punishments, but remained on specific beachheads for the regular patrolling of land and sea. Its fist is one hand of the Mexican state for the assertion of rule in daily life.</p>
<p>The other hand came in the form of a green consciousness led by urban university graduate activists with third sector agendas.</p>
<p>The main Mexican organization to arrive on the coast immediately after the ban on the turtle fishery was Ecosolar, and, along with its cadres, it brought the idea of eco-tourism as an alternative to the harvest of turtle eggs. Well funded for a few years, this organization was key in the establishment of different projects that aimed to demonstrate the possibilities of community development frameworks. They began with the village of Mazunte because it contained the population most affected by sudden unemployment, impoverishment and the criminalization of the fishery. Ecosolar’s activities in the region have received sufficient attention and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308275X12449102">Barkin, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308275X12449102">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308275X12449102">Baumhackl, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308275X12449102">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308275X12449102">Roldán, 2002</xref>). My interest here instead is to underline that these efforts were not an isolated or sudden ‘awakening’ of ‘civil society’, as is often stated; rather, they echo a complicated relation between the coercive forces of the state (compulsion through violence) on the one hand, and the third sector initiatives under an urban and metropolitan leadership with the resources to launch eco-tourism as a class project for engineering a consensus on the other.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Oaxacan coast was not unknown to or unnoticed by different segments of the Mexican leisure classes and governmental planners. Early in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308275X12449102">Gullette, 2007</xref>) there had been federal plans to develop the Bahias de Huatulco as an international ‘sun and beach’ destination, and a slow but growing demand for tourist services in Puerto Escondido. Closer to Mazunte, Zipolite was a well-known beach for hippies and other counter-cultural groups from Mexican cities and the North Atlantic (i.e. North Amercia and Europe). What the region lacked was a steady flow of visitors throughout the year and the services for an alternative to mass tourism. Ecosolar’s main contribution in the region was the delimitation of the ‘eco-touristic corridor’ (in between Bahias de Huatulco and Puerto Escondido and along the coastal line). In other words, they helped to carve out a niche market for eco-tourism as an alternative.</p>
<p>However there was no possibility of developing a market in land on which to build up partnerships and businesses in hotels, restaurants and the like until the promulgation of the reform of Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution in 1992 (also during the Salinas Administration). The dividing up of land in the most scenic spots turned into a competition enabled by changes to federal law in land tenure and complicated by the status of the commons (which the reform did not abolish). The lending of names, secret purchases and other deals were part of a multilayered field of duplicity that moved toward a single result: the sale of land to incoming strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449102">Morales, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Focused on the building up of a beach spot to be linked to other attractions related to conservation and tourism, Ecosolar worked on different projects until 1997 when the region was hit by two hurricanes. Even though the degree of Ecosolar’s penetration in the region and the proportion of people in Mazunte persuaded to work with them is still cause for debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449102">Early, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449102">Morales, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>), the hurricanes put an end to the organization’s leadership. The governments of the state of Oaxaca and the federal government, through its Secretaría del Medioambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca (Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries) took the lead from then on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>). They adopted and adapted Ecosolar’s ideas to their own purposes. Eco-tourism, sustainable development and conservation became the buzzwords to which all efforts for simple reproduction and/or the search for profits were entangled. And, instead of creating a specialized bureaucracy to direct and coordinate the development efforts, a cluster of small NGOs worked as its proxy.</p>
<p>An implosion of initiatives ensued in which different groups, using this imported dialect, competed for the tourists and to attract public and private funds from different sources. There was a handful of successes, such as Cosmeticos Naturales de Mazunte (Mazunte’s Natural Cosmetics, producing and marketing beauty products) and Servicios Ecoturísticos La Ventanilla (La Ventanilla’s Eco-tourist Services, focused on mangrove recovery), not without strong contradictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>) and a large trail of ongoing initiatives from different organizations. However, the bulk of the profits went to the cosmopolitan class of urbanites and university graduates from Mexican cities and the North Atlantic, who started different businesses (mainly restaurants and hotels) in the tourist sector and took the political lead in Mazunte and San Agustinillo and tried to impact the whole ‘eco-touristic corridor’. As such they were able to portray and project the idea of the miracle advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308275X12449102">Cathcart (1997)</xref> – vulgarizing it through a legion of voices – to tourists and researchers.</p>
<p>In succinct terms what the miracle entails is the transformation of the regional economy and society towards the third sector; this process has turned workers and their families into the alleged beneficiaries and resilient populations who work in conservation. Eco-tourism and environmental management programmes and training made it obvious that there was no more negotiation between labour and capital but rather a careful tutelage towards a consensus with regard to nature as a fetish to be increasingly commodified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449102">Early, 2010</xref>). Even though these changes were introduced with force, they had to be internalized as the only possible and desirable outcomes in the form of the third sector.</p>
<p>The process of winning over the regional population was by no means easy. Not everyone agreed but those who did not had few options and little leverage. With a minority of sympathizers to begin with, the shift in vocation eventually grew, recruiting more individuals and creating new groups in a process of schism and factionalism. Scholars and activists contributed to the design of an engineered transformation combining global trends with local possibilities. Their point of departure was the use of consensus frameworks in order to work for ‘realistic’ market opportunities. Needless to say, even liberal ideas of equality and social justice (<italic>à la</italic> Rawls, Sen or Kymlicka) were out of the picture in the grounding of a ‘neoliberal citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0308275X12449102">Zamorano, 2008</xref>). A new world order since 1989 was in the making and a vanguard of well-funded, small-scale entrepreneurs with a green conscience arrived at the coast with specific projects to recruit workers, fishermen and peasants for alternative capitalist ventures.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0308275X12449102"><title>‘We come to object’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0308275X12449102">2</xref></sup></title>
<p>The ethnographic research began with a short survey (August 2006), was concentrated in a field season with recognizance (July to December 2007) and embedded (February to July 2008) phases, and continued with a follow-up (July 2009) and sporadic visits. Taking a specific term (eco-tourism [Morales], sustainable development [Zamora] and turtle conservation [Early]) as an entry point, each student reconstructed the history of the changes in more than one locality. I kept them on track. We deployed the same battery of qualitative methods – which included combining direct and participant observation, formal interviews with regular follow-ups and informal discussions – attended parties and made intensive excursions to fishing grounds and conservation camps, coupled with analysis of documents in governmental agencies and libraries, producing a rich archive for multiple corroboration of sources and data comparison following a <italic>Rashomon</italic> model of interpretation analysis. We discussed ‘the miracle’ at length among ourselves and with the regional population as we produced written reports, theses, papers, articles, photography and a documentary video. Our ethnographic evidence clearly contradicts the narrative of the miracle.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the – impossible to enforce – total ban of the fishery caused the recovery of the Olive Ridley Turtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308275X12449102">Early, 2011</xref>), that turtle conservation is working, or that the conflation of protection/conservation is well planned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308275X12449102">Crouse et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0308275X12449102">Meylan and Ehrenfeld, 2000</xref>) because the main aim is not the preservation of species and the environment but eco-tourism. The other three species of turtles are in a critical situation, with the Leatherback near extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449102">Early, 2010</xref>). This is due to incidental captures in shark and small-scale fishing, the rampant poaching of turtles and nests for eggs, under-funded public research stations, the sale of harmful ‘natural experiences’ as bait for tourists (such as in the careless manipulation of hatching turtles), the contradictory mandate of the navy and other policing agents of the state, and the irresponsible transf of environmental protection to severely impoverished ‘communities’, which have to live on the sale of experiences with ‘charismatic species’.</p>
<p>The notion that eco-projects have been successful in protecting turtles is deceptive; an effect of these projects, however, is that they hollowed out the idea of conservation of any consistent meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0308275X12449102">Macip and Zamora, 2009</xref>). Organic agriculture is nowhere to be found but different products are advertised in restaurants and markets using this empty signifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>). In the same way, successful business and makeshift projects use ‘eco’ prefix as a label devoid of any meaning beyond a gesture of agreement with dominant ideas. Beauty products that are advertised as organic and locally produced by people formerly employed in the slaughter of turtles are blended in the region using industrial and synthetic products brought from Mexico City metropolitan area. The most successful organizations in conservation – such as La Ventanilla – cannot provide steady jobs or income for their affiliates and there is constant infighting over this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449102">Zamora, 2011</xref>). Eco-projects and tourism simply cannot substitute a regional productive economy and people have to pool incomes from different sources (legal and illegal) for simple reproduction.</p>
<p>Out of a year’s 52 weeks, fewer than 20 are considered as falling within the tourist season and only 6 to 10 represent high demand, and they vary from year to year. People are considerably less protected in health coverage and employment than before the fishery ban, and have new and more pressing needs for consumer goods while there is less land to sell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449102">Morales, 2009</xref>). The market forces and models that were brought in to solve the problems have re-arranged things but the main effect is social polarization. The miracle involves little more than the displacement of social conflict from the contradictions between labour and capital to the adoption of consensus in exploitation without benefits within an economy and society based on services.</p>
<p>In ideological terms, however, the turn toward the third sector has been a success. The regional transformation involved a second wave of immigration, but this time by urban, formally educated and cosmopolitan groups from a global ‘middle class’ to demand changes. This meant an effective divorce of the previous settlers (who have since become locals/natives) from land control and their passage from waged workers into service employees/junior partners in conservation. Although everyone can recognize the social division between ‘locals’ and ‘strangers’ (foreigners and Mexican alike), they are not homogeneous groups. Some locals are in better bargaining positions than others (usually though land rights) while some strangers have more successful business than others. What brings them all together is the consensus that the change toward the third sector is for good and irrevocable; that they are on the right historical track and that any future has to balance the search for tourism profits against conservation.</p>
<p>The eco-touristic corridor is effectively a niche for alternative tourists. Glossed under the keywords ‘conservation’ and ‘sustainable’, its success draws from the World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308275X12449102">Nijkamp et al., 1991</xref>) conviction and funding principle that market-centred projects (assumed as their own by Mexican governments and organizations from civil society alike) alleviate poverty and reduce the pace and intensity of environmental degradation. In this case though, both poverty and degradation have grown, as is recognized by everybody in informal conversations. Still, in formal interviews or talking to outsiders, almost everyone plays the role of concerned environmentalist.</p>
<p>The successful transculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0308275X12449102">Ortiz, 1995</xref>) of global trends – environmentalism, third way politics and new age practices – was directly related to material changes in the control of property (land), strategic resources (turtles) and jobs under a renewed class project of rule, but it has unfolded following no clear script. The immigrants who arrived after 1990 brought good intentions, enthusiasm and commitment to Mazunte, as well as naiveté, dilettantism and ignorance within their class expectations and contradictions. Their involvement in civil society and their persuasive fostering of eco-projects in the region counterbalanced the other hand of the Mexican state, the navy’s coercive violence.</p>
<p>Although environmentalism can easily be dismissed today as ‘a fundamentalist religion adopted by urban atheists looking to fill a yawning spiritual gap plaguing the West’ (Morton in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0308275X12449102">Žižek, 2010</xref>: 351), this was certainly not the case at the end of the 1980s. ‘Green politics’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0308275X12449102">Radcliffe, 2000</xref>) developed as an opposition platform in the North Atlantic with radical branches within and outside party systems. The complexities of its agendas and their contradictory relations to state power, industry and capital at the international level played a role in the halting of the turtle fishery in Mexico. As such, green politics emerged as the semiotic banner with which the newcomers identified. To be an environmentalist meant to be simultaneously a righteous person concerned mostly about the well-being of turtles and ‘the eco-system’ while deeply ignorant of the dynamics and needs of the regional population. Even today the term ‘environmentalist’ is used with a double meaning: for bonding when self-applied and scornful when applied to others.</p>
<p>On one occasion we were asked if we were environmentalists (as we fitted the role perfectly: university-educated urbanites funded by a government grant meddling in other people’s affairs) and as we hesitated before saying no were invited to stay for a lunch of turtle eggs. Of course we knew that people eat them and were happy to confirm it. We had to be on constant guard for the first three months against acting the fools by either doing or eating things that were not done or eaten by others on request. We passed the test – though we may still be fools but of another sort – dividing environmentalists from ‘critical analysts of regional reality’, which is the way our host, a populist schoolteacher, presented himself.</p>
<p>In contrast to the schoolteachers of the radical Sección 22 del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (Local 22 of the National Schoolteachers Union), environmentalists are known throughout the region for their non-radical politics and as good mediators. This reputation is not without its advantages, as almost everyone involved with NGOs has to be a good fundraiser and is also expected to espouse a version of third way politics. There is a common-sense agreement that both extremes of the late 20th century (real existing socialism and the stock application of neoliberal reforms) must be avoided. Such a position eliminates all possibility of a thoughtful comparison or historical perspective. The main object of third way NGOers is to avoid socialist politics with the suggestion that they only lead to totalitarian regimes. Critiques of neoliberal excesses are carefully separated from democratic-liberal politics and free market capitalism. What is important to note here, apart from its inconsistency, is that environmentalism in Mexico is first and foremost an unscientific political-economic principle of multinational organizations (e.g. the World Bank, World Wildlife Fund, Inter-American Foundation) and the Mexican government (expressed through its federal agencies) and their proxy green-washing NGOs.</p>
<p>Just as important as this forced environmentalist consensus are the practices we identified as <italic>new age</italic> in the shaping of ideological contours. The mixture of ‘orientalist’ yoga, reiki and spiritualism, along with supposed pre-Columbian relics and importations such as ‘Aztec’ dances, <italic>temazcal</italic> bathhouses, and all sorts of quasi-religious practices work as playful spaces where most strangers to the region (foreign and Mexican) gather and mark themselves as a group. They also do so in restaurants and bars, but whereas in these they mingle with tourists and interact with locals working for them, they develop a sense of community in <italic>new age</italic> practices. The relevance of these practices and beliefs is based more on affect than reason. As such they naturalize their being there, apart from urban civilization, and in the process reinforce their political principles and self-anointed moral status. The civilizing influence of urban, fair -complexioned, university-educated strangers is not doubted at all: locals had the land and resources for themselves and did nothing good with them. This is a clear example of <italic>The Bland Revolution</italic> first criticized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0308275X12449102">Žižek (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>In the transformation towards the third sector, the first wave of immigrants became locals; this meant they were discursively indigenized. A major subjective shift was demanded of them, that they move from being workers with social rights and labour benefits recognized by the federal law to become an indigenous population of beneficiaries and associates of sustainable experiments. Buzzwords from the global NGO complex, such as ‘resilience’, ‘vulnerability’ and ‘empowerment’ are supposed to give meaning to life and labour on the coast as new social relations of production have been forced upon the regional populations. The process of adopting and identifying with the new meanings is complex and follows the usual pattern of patron–client relations, but it is also a powerful interpellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308275X12449102">Althusser, 1990</xref>) generating new political subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308275X12449102">Mamdani, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The very same trope of savagery used to denounce the ‘butchery of turtles’ in the late 1980s worked as a justification to subordinate the newly discovered ‘Indians’. Because the majority of the population immigrated from the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca they were easily categorized as Zapotec in the reductionist logic of ‘ethnic groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308275X12449102">Basch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0308275X12449102">Kymlicka, 1995</xref>). However the fishery also brought Mexicans from other states and within a couple of generations almost everyone used the same local Spanish vernacular, shared mores and intermarried. My main point, here, though, is not about whether people retain some forms of relation and identification with the highlands or an indigenous language (which some undoubtedly do), but that there are new meanings given to being an obligatory Indian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0308275X12449102">Stoll, 2011</xref>). As in many other places, to be indigenous came to mean the ‘guardian of nature and biodiversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0308275X12449102">Shiva, 1993</xref>) in hyper-real terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0308275X12449102">Ramos, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Putting aside the many contradictory layers that characterize the relationships between indigenized locals and strangers on the eco-touristic corridor along the coast of Oaxaca, these same relationships shape and give meaning to civil society and daily life. It is precisely in the countless contradictions within negotiations that hegemony – the active persuasion that the ruling class-alliance represents the best interests of society as a whole – takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308275X12449102">Gramsci, 2000</xref>: Quaderni 13, entries 2, 18, 26, 30). This hegemonic leadership is what we can document as daily life in the region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0308275X12449102"><title>Waiting for the tourists</title>
<p>San Agustinillo, the small hamlet adjacent to Mazunte (legally separated from it but organically bound to it), where we based our house and working station, has a small and beautiful beach. As I mentioned before, the largest slaughterhouse for turtles on the Mexican Pacific had been located there. As such it is also a prime location from which to appreciate the changes toward tourism. Located between the beaches of Mazunte and Zipolite, San Agustinillo’s business community has sought to differentiate it from both. Zipolite has been well known since the early 1970s as a ‘hippy’ and ‘libertine’ spot where open drug consumption and nudity are common; recently it has become a destination for gay men. Mazunte is where Ecosolar launched its bid for alternative tourism under the idea of the <italic>pueblito ecológico</italic> (ecological small village) and some of that aura remains but it is overshadowed by the budget needs and demands of young backpackers from Mexican cities and foreign hikers on ‘the gringo trail’. The way that San Agustinillo tourist entrepreneurs try to make it and market it as different – within the eco-touristic corridor – is by banning nudity and open drug use, camping and bonfires on the beach, closing everything very early at nights (by ten o’clock streets are deserted) and emphasizing garbage separation all over town. They have been successful in attracting couples of all ages and all sorts of families with small children. From San Agustinillo the team spread out to cover six locations of the corridor, the municipal seat, and the main tourist poles and areas in between.</p>
<p>San Agustinillo still retains two small-scale fishing cooperatives, but is without doubt a tourist spot. Most residents dedicate their energies to offering tourist services in hotels ranging from semi-luxurious cabins to budget rooms, restaurants and sightseeing tours to the sea. Both locals and strangers own businesses and, even though there is a clear line of demarcation in terms of investment and success, with the latter enjoying the better share, yet all interact in the shaping of the town. Public services have to privilege tourist infrastructure and therefore there is a great deal of negotiation and spaces for conflict. Fresh water is a case in point. It is scarce and rationed among most locals but unlimited for tourists and strangers with businesses. The main activities, however, are planning, building and speculating on tourism, and, when a few tourists are there, everybody gossips about who got how many and how they can all get some share of their spending. With the exception of the three weeks associated with winter break, when Mexicans, Canadians and visitors from the United States cram the place (that is devoid of Christmas paraphernalia/aura), most of the year is spent waiting. Even Holy Week (mayhem for Mexican beachgoers) does not generate full occupancy and in some years demand is very low indeed. Few tourists arrive during months such as February and October, but most of the year the numbers are too small to constitute a consuming force. Still, imaginative plans are discussed, land is bought and sold, new hotels and cabins are constructed and freshwater wells are secured for the future. We were told that the logical evolution is to move to semi-permanent residences for retired snowbirds from Canada and the US. That seemed to make sense, though when we ask where they would access physicians and specialists in geriatric care (as there is no nursing school in the region and hospitals in nearby Pochutla are both impoverished and overcrowded), most people say that would be sorted out along the way.</p>
<p>When we were not out looking for interviews and observing labour and interactions in turtle conservation camps, assemblies, governmental offices, social organizations, NGOs or shopping for food, the crew took part in the daily life of San Agustinillo. One student (Morales) would go fishing as much as he could with one of the cooperatives, gaining ritual kin by the end of fieldwork. Two others (Early and Zamora) attended yoga lessons and befriended expatriates and compatriot ex-urbanites with long residence in the region. I went regularly to the cybercafé for my daily fix. Over time (as we did not leave after the six weeks or three months expected for research teams in summer camps) we became part of the local society of strangers. We also received visitors every other month and fought openly among ourselves about how to interpret the changes forced on the region, how to represent groups of people interacting and the limits of ethnographic interpretation. Some villagers asked to be left out of the study whereas others wanted to be in prominent positions (for which we made a documentary video).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308275X12449102">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>What we can document, broadly, is a community very strongly differentiated by capitalist relations of production in which those individuals and families who control property exploit labour-surplus producing individuals and families without contracts, rights or minimal benefits. Tourist ventures and speculations in the tourist sector are the leading force reorganizing property and privilege. Access to strategic resources (beaches and scenic tracts of land but also spring water and wells) is no longer based on citizens’ rights or even purchasing power but complicated networks of relations spun around tourist development and land property rights blending locals and strangers. The eco-touristic corridor may be cheaper than mass tourism and hotel chains; it certainly offers some perks for those willing to be amused either by practising reiki on turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308275X12449102">Early, 2011</xref>) or listening to natives’ jokes and accents (as has been cynically promoted by governmental officials and NGO staffers alike), but it follows the same logic of any business venture in its search for profits. It is no alternative in favour of turtle conservation or the indigenized population, but normal exploitation within a comparative advantage. If anything, the third sector and third way are a sophisticated cover for market ideological domination, representing it as something different. The alliance between business people and green activists in eco-tourism works for the enlargement of their projects and budgets. Continuous growth depends on the effective control and subordination of the lumpenized labour-surplus populations ‘working on demand’ in tourist businesses, participation in conservation programmes and answering questions for research teams in training. Properly identified as civil society and legible to any state and multinational agency, they stand together as a hegemonic story of ideological success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0308275X12449102"><title>On hegemony</title>
<p>The regional transformation towards an economy of services and a market society is part of worldwide currents with specific forms of representation and particular understandings. Paramount among the political narratives the region has been tied to is the idea that there is a clear and radical break from the ‘past’, which fades into oblivion, giving way to a new epoch starting around 1989–91. There is no shortage of such versions across the political spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308275X12449102">Fukuyama, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0308275X12449102">Hardt and Negri, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308275X12449102">2004</xref>) and a few of them have achieved canonical stature such as ‘the democratic transition’ or ‘the new economy’, regardless of the evidence against them.</p>
<p>For this case study, I find the radical posturing around its alleged newness and the miraculous break with the past – in documents and narratives – to be effectively misleading. NGOers and environmentalists frequently shun social analysis, preferring to invoke commonsensical explanations of ‘awakening’ for regional change. There is the need to get the locals on board for their projects, and regardless of the outcome, their subordination has already been secured. Although many frontline NGOers may be characterized by their thoughtless enthusiasm, this is less the case in middle management and those decision makers who are engineering the shifts toward a service-based economy. For them it may be relatively unimportant if there are not enough consumers in the present. What matters is the appropriation by dispossession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308275X12449102">Harvey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449102">Morales, 2009</xref>) that is achieved along with the renewed proletarianization of a latent relative surplus population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0308275X12449102">Marx, 1976</xref>: 794; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0308275X12449102">Roseberry, 1997</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>In the portrayal of miraculous awakening, social misrepresentations constitute a basic means of justifying specific forms of intervention by governments and capital. The third sector literature did the trick for neoliberals, but it has to be coupled with postmodern new age sensibilities in a game of duplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0308275X12449102">Macip and Carreras, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308275X12449102">Nelson, 2009</xref>). Among postmodern theoreticians I find <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308275X12449102">Beasley-Murray (2010: ix)</xref> particularly useful to engage with. He opens his <italic>Posthegemony</italic> as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>There is no hegemony and never has been. We live in cynical, posthegemonic times: nobody is very much persuaded by ideologies that once seemed fundamental to securing social order. Everybody knows, for instance, that work is exploitation and that politics is deceit. But we have always lived in posthegemonic times: social order was never in fact secured through ideology. No amount of belief in the dignity of labor or the selflessness of elected representatives could ever have been enough to hold things together. The fact that people no longer give up their consent in the ways in which they may once have done, and yet everything carries on much the same, shows that consent was never really at issue. Social order is secured through habit and affect: through folding the constituent power of the multitude back on itself to produce the illusion of transcendence and sovereignty.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than taking issue with his evidence for Latin American Studies (as I have no space to do justice to his arguments), I want to oppose his representation of the present based on the case study. Beasley-Murray’s is a cerebral version of a representation of reality repeated by most activists, NGOers, tourists, researchers and wanderers found on the coast of Oaxaca. Its reiteration follows clear-cut class and generational terms, among those university-educated cadres, branded by the youth signifiers and semiotic banners of 1968 (Paris, Mexico City, Prague as heritage), 1989–91 (worldwide as coming of age) and 1994 (neo-Zapatistas as surrogate politics). I have no quarrel with the assertion that we live in ‘cynical times’. This cynicism is, however, the ideological product of specific historical developments and conjunctures that need to be explained, not assumed as a post-ideological awakening. Its spread and appeal among university-educated managerial classes is intimately linked to ideological processes of duplicity advanced over the last 20 years in order to secure consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0308275X12449102">Žižek, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We have seen how fishery workers were forced to accept environmentalists into their lives and region with the strong arm of the navy as negotiation’s starting point. People were then ‘free’ to ‘choose’ eco-tourism’s alternative/sustainable development. Their options were emigration to Mexican cities and the United States or participation in the black market of turtle eggs and drugs. In order to reproduce economically, most households engage in eco-projects and at least one informal/illegal activity. Cynicism is certainly a key feature of daily life, but this is the product of the many layers of incongruity, hypocrisy and double talk that characterize the interaction among classes in labour relations and market representations. On projects and blueprints, in tours and brochures, lies and half-truths are the norm. People have learned to pose and dissimulate, acknowledging that labour is exploitation and that environmental policies are meaningless. This cynicism is consensus.</p>
<p>This is most eloquently expressed in assemblies and meetings of the ‘brothers and sisters in conservation’ (as portrayed by one community leader) which state that more than the actual labour, what matters is how to ask for money: ‘to be able to demand, <italic>compañeros</italic>, we need a project in hand’. Such projects are not local initiatives but come directly from their associated NGOs, which in turn are bounded by the agreements of governmental ministries, multinational agencies and private foundations on ‘neoliberal conservation’. What matters, according to the same leader, is that ‘working on conservation, money will flow our way’.</p>
<p>Beasley-Murray implies that consensus is achieved solely on the grounds of ideological persuasion and that where this is not the case there is no hegemony and never has been. I disagree. The complex and mutually constitutive relation between coercion and consent in the production of hegemony has been repeatedly demonstrated by Gramscian scholars in anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308275X12449102">Binford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0308275X12449102">Crehan, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308275X12449102">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308275X12449102">Fitting, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0308275X12449102">Rebel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0308275X12449102">Roseberry, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0308275X12449102">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0308275X12449102">Sider, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0308275X12449102">Smith, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0308275X12449102">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0308275X12449102">2011</xref>) and the history of the shift from fisheries to tourist services on the coast supports their insistence that there is a fluid and always shifting relation between them. Coercion needs little elaboration in this case because it asserts itself through a fundamental act of sovereignty: the navy is the Mexican state at its most eloquent in terms of compulsion through violence. Consensus takes place in a conditioned social field; not in the political society composed of government agencies of the state of Oaxaca and the federation, nor the municipal administrations, much less the defeated state party regime (Mexico transited officially to democracy after the 2000 presidential election of Vicente Fox). It begins in civil society and its class structured privileges and differences. If this has a cynical nature and parallelisms worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308275X12449102">Agrawal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X12449102">Büscher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0308275X12449102">Tsing, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0308275X12449102">West, 2006</xref>), it is certainly a mark of the times. Habit and affect are constitutive elements of this consent even though they are intensely differentiated among classes of people in the region. ‘The multitude’ may be a proper term for referring to the lumpenized working population within the unbridgeable inequalities of specific relations of exploitation and domination woven into civil society. Transcendence is certainly invoked in the miracle for everybody to laugh at it. It is in the class rule of small and medium tourist businesses and the administration of conservation policies that this cynical consent based on duplicity takes hold. No term better captures its perversity than environmentalism.</p>
<p>Environmentalism in the region has come to mean a displacement of the contradictions and negotiations between labour and capital to those between nature and society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0308275X12449102">Harvey, 2010</xref>: 77). Class differences that were recognized and expressed through a language of rights have become a matter of affect in which, rather than scientific or political understandings, we are supposed to share the sensibilities and attitudes of an ideal world-citizen towards fetishized species. This effective de-politicization and mystification by affect may turn into habit, but it was not a possibility before 1990. The shift toward the production of a new consensus based on coercion and a renewed hegemony became evident in the region with the halt of the capture of marine turtles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0308275X12449102">Smith (2011)</xref> has proposed a frame for the much invoked ‘before and after’ as the passing from an expansive into a selective hegemony. Taking a much larger scale, he argues there were changes in the leadership of world capitalism long before they were manifested in the region. However, taking a multi-scale approach from world market to the nation-state and the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0308275X12449102">Smith, 2004</xref>), we can place the miracle in the change from a more inclusive and productive social arrangement to a selective and speculative-based framework with different consequences for surplus-labour classes and civil society. These times are cynically informed by a selective hegemony that dispossesses rural classes of their land wherever it has speculative value and manages labour-surplus classes as relative surplus populations. For the time being, those in the region are mostly in a latent state but they can easily turn out to be stagnant or obsolete and, accordingly, be discarded.</p>
<p>The cynicism of exploitation and deceit is certainly eloquent among the lumpenized workers and the infantry of civil society organized in NGOs, which depend on foreign and national funding (public and private). Even though there are actual believers – among those stationed in cities – who keep the miraculous tale alive in the realms of the academy and activism, their troops on the frontline, along with the naval personnel on beach-heads know perfectly well that they are just carrying water to keep things running. Armed with the analysis of cynical common sense in conservation, eco-tourism and sustainability – as the daily labour of duplicity – we criticize and object to the master signifiers and subjects of environmentalism.</p>
<p>Political ecology is a celebrated emergent field in anthropology. Among its many merits it has documented and criticized ‘neoliberal conservation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0308275X12449102">Igoe and Brockington, 2007</xref>) as a dominant technology of power. Even though I agree that most, if not all forms and experiments in conservation are neoliberal, this has become a simple truism. As such it has to be confronted in two ways. On the one side, political ecology is a derivative body of ideas and data following the development of conservation biology as a discipline of crisis: the political crisis of 1989 and the sudden ‘awakening’ to environmental degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0308275X12449102">Primack, 2008</xref>). On the other side, and as part of the very same conjuncture, political ecology is the ideological agreement regarding sustainable economic development by authoritative multinational bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308275X12449102">Nijkamp, 1991</xref>). There can be no other form of conservation because the contours for its very possibility are those of corporate globalization. My point is that we ought to move from identifying what has become obvious into a critique not only of neoliberalism but also of ‘environmentalism’ and ‘conservation’ for what they have come to mean.</p>
<p>The class segment that led the miraculous transformation in the small strip on the coast of Oaxaca is made up of university professionals trained for white-collar jobs in the public and private service sectors. Despite disagreements on the specifics of how the transformation should unfold, they share a very specific understanding of class relations and rule. The NGOs became the sole representatives of civil society and the space in which to frame and shape it. As such the leading class segment is able to broker between governments (local and federal, national and international), funding agencies and donors, as well as organized communities under their patronage. Its members are hardly among the decision-makers of hegemonic classes realized in the state, but they led the platform agreed upon by them by turning everything into a speculative business enterprise. In this case the miracle may be the creation of a touristic niche rather than conservation. Even if differentiated in its groups and interests, this class converges in the power of producing alternatives within a real existing capitalist regime of accumulation by dispossession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308275X12449102">Harvey, 2003</xref>) and a selective hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0308275X12449102">Smith, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We are certainly not <italic>Living at the End Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0308275X12449102">Žižek, 2010</xref>), regardless of the many ideological and hegemonic misrepresentations that are being produced to force a cynical consensus about it.
