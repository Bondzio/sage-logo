<p>In 2010, the NATO Research and Technology Organization (RTO) published the <italic>Guide to Modelling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) for NATO Network-Enabled Capability (“M&amp;S for NNEC”)</italic> (RTO, 2010), which brought together multiple perspectives on modelling in support of networked-enabled capability (NEC), including: acquisition and through life support; training and exercises; operations support; and experimentation. It was abundantly clear from the diversity of applications and from the sophistication of many of them that M&amp;S is a critical technology in developing and supporting the NEC concept. The idea for this special issue was substantially influenced by the enthusiasm with which the RTO guide was received.</p>
<p>Although the RTO guide comprehensively reviewed the state of the art in M&amp;S in support of NEC, the five papers published herein all add dimensions that were not significantly covered by the guide and, therefore, add both new perspectives and new guidance for practitioners and customers of M&amp;S alike. The analysis of defence experimentation provided by Arnott and Lindsay provides a rule of thumb estimation of the cost and style of experimentation that will be a helpful guide to those embarking on a programme of experimentation for NEC. The paper extends two significant publications: the COBP-E (Alberts and Hayes, 2002) and GUIDEx (TTCP, 2005) by collecting and analysing a considerable number of case studies to provide empirical guidance on how much time is required to understand a complex problem and how many resources will be required? The two foregoing publications (Alberts and Hayes, 2002) and (TTCP, 2005) were significant influences on the work of MSG062 (RTO, 2010) and so Arnott and Lindsay genuinely provide a valuable extension to the RTO guide. Their paper concludes with typical resource requirements for defence experimentation and some cautionary notes about the additional costs associated with trying to answer too many questions with one experimental program. Furthermore, they point towards the need for better re-use of expensive experimentally acquired data.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of NEC that may be modelled separately or severally. Effective communication, in the sense of efficient routing of data in complex and, sometimes, heterogeneous networks is an essential requirement for NEC. Haught, Hopkinson, and Hemmes describe an application of Kalman filters, called Dynamic Routing Queue Controller (DRQC), that estimates future network conditions to enable intelligent routing of data to support mission effectiveness. Their paper describes modelling at two levels. The first concerns the application of DRQC to estimate short- and medium-term network conditions in order to then guide decisions about routing of network traffic. The second is the application of the established NS2 simulation tool with additional modules to represent the DRQC. Through multiple simulations of four basic conditions they are able to demonstrate the potential of the DRQC approach for managing dynamic networks of the types relevant to military operations. An interesting feature of their simulation is the ability to visualize the network in action.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of communication networks, McLeod, Bai, and Meyer describe a modelling approach for operational use in rapidly estimating radio path-loss using Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN). They consider the extent to which compromises in accuracy might be accepted when weighed against the need for fast calculations. Indeed, they explicitly focus on the application of neural networks to improve speed, rather than fidelity. Their technique has the potential to enable better planning and management of communication networks needed for NEC.</p>
<p>Soban, Salmon, and Fahringer focus their attention on the analysis of the vast quantities of data that models and simulations may generate. Visual analytics is a fast growing area that is becoming an essential element of decision making both in terms of operational decisions and analysis of experimentation. With increasing use of <italic>the cloud</italic>, the need for effective frameworks through which to analyse enormous amounts of heterogeneous data is an urgent requirement. They propose an analysis framework which is illustrated through application to a trade space for the C-5A and C-5M aircraft, but argue that it can be extended for use within the NEC context. However, the main argument of the paper concerns the acceptability of visual analytics to decision-makers and their illustration of the power of the technique is largely to persuade the military modelling community of the benefits that this capability can offer for decision making and strategic analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, Tolk, Bair, and Diallo draw attention to the risks associated with different modelling and simulation communities developing their own frameworks without sufficient reference to each other. They introduce an Interoperability Maturity Model (IMM) that brings together approaches from a variety of NATO working groups to map between the operational interoperability levels and the technical interoperability levels. They assert that technical proposals cannot solve conceptual problems, but conceptual solutions require a solid technical foundation. They explain the manner in which the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model (LCIM) (Tolk et al., 2007), that was originally developed for the M&amp;S community, may be more generally applied both within the defence enterprise and the wider socio-technical environment. Their paper provides a formalism that may be applied to the identification of metrics for interoperability that will be of benefit to the community interested in M&amp;S for NEC.</p>
<p>The diverse use of modelling and simulation described by MSG062 (RTO, 2010) is further exemplified by this somewhat eclectic set of papers concerning the theme of M&amp;S for NEC. The interoperability required for NEC remains an essential requirement for NATO operations. NEC is a complex, system of systems challenge that exploits synergies across social and technical networks. It is being illuminated through the application of M&amp;S but, at the same time, the discipline of M&amp;S is, itself, being advanced through application to NEC. It is with pleasure that we present this special issue that illustrates this interplay of M&amp;S and NEC.</p>
