<abstract>
<p>Divorce is a highly stressful event, and much remains to be learned about the factors that promote psychological resilience when marriages come to an end. In this study, divorcing adults (<italic>N =</italic> 109) completed a 4-min stream-of-consciousness recording about their marital separation at an initial laboratory visit. Four judges rated the degree to which participants exhibited self-compassion (defined by self-kindness, an awareness of one’s place in shared humanity, and emotional equanimity) in their recordings. Judges evidenced considerable agreement in their ratings of participants’ self-compassion, and these ratings demonstrated strong predictive utility: Higher levels of self-compassion at the initial visit were associated with less divorce-related emotional intrusion into daily life at the start of the study, and this effect persisted up to 9 months later. These effects held when we accounted for a number of competing predictors. Self-compassion is a modifiable variable, and if our findings can be replicated, they may have implications for improving the lives of divorcing adults.</p>

<body>
<p>Imagine the following situation: Your spouse decides your marriage is over. You knew your relationship was not going well, but now it is <italic>really</italic> over. The prospect of a divorce is not so bad for some people, but you are distraught and find yourself wondering how to put your life back together. What steps can you take to start the healing process?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this situation is all too common: Nearly 2 million adults in the United States become divorced each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797611429466">Tejada-Vera &amp; Sutton, 2010</xref>). Most adults handle the transition well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611429466">Amato, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611429466">Mancini, Bonanno, &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>), but for a small percentage of divorcees, marital separation is associated with lasting decreases in psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611429466">Lucas, 2005</xref>) and an increased risk for physical health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797611429466">Sbarra, Law, &amp; Portley, 2011</xref>). For anyone experiencing divorce, a critical—perhaps <italic>the</italic> critical—question is how to recover over time.</p>
<p>When their marriage ends in divorce, many people turn a harsh light on themselves: “It was my fault—I should have acted differently”; “I wasn't good enough”; “I am not attractive enough.” These recriminations are essentially perceptions of causality, and it is well known that the more people focus their thoughts on regret and longing, the worse their outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611429466">Emery, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611429466">Hetherington &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797611429466">Sbarra &amp; Emery, 2008</xref>). Although researchers know a good deal about what happens when people become mired in negative appraisals of their marital separation, little is known about the correlates of adopting a different stance with respect to the end of marriage—one characterized by an empathetic and tender view of the self. In the study reported here, we examined whether self-compassion influences the course of psychological recovery following marital separation.</p>
<p>Self-compassion is an integrative construct that encompasses self-kindness (i.e., treating oneself with understanding and forgiveness), recognition of one’s place in shared humanity (i.e., acknowledgment that people are not perfect and that personal experiences are part of the larger human experience), and mindfulness (i.e., emotional equanimity and avoidance of overidentification with painful emotions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611429466">Neff, 2003a, 2003b</xref>). In distressing situations, people who are high in self-compassion tend to experience negative affect without becoming overwhelmed or mired in negative thoughts about their experiences; they view themselves and their actions empathetically and are able to see both the highs and the lows of life as part of the human experience. Self-compassion appears to be distinct from self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611429466">Leary, Tate, Adams, Batts Allen, &amp; Hancock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611429466">Neff, 2003a</xref>); the latter construct is more highly correlated with hubris and inflated views of self-worth.</p>
<p>It is well established that positive emotions have an “undoing” effect on negative affect by promoting a greater range of behavioral action and broadening people’s perspective on available coping resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611429466">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>). There is increasing interest in how self-compassion can reduce negative affect associated with stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611429466">Allen &amp; Leary, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611429466">Leary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797611429466">Tugade &amp; Fredrickson, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611429466">Allen and Leary (2010)</xref> recently proposed that one reason people high in self-compassion cope well with stressful events is that they tend to rely on positive cognitive restructuring when thinking about difficult experiences. For example, using an Internet-based experience-sampling procedure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611429466">Leary et al. (2007)</xref> found that participants who were higher in self- compassion were significantly less likely to endorse negative thoughts (e.g., to think that their life was more “screwed up” than other people’s lives) with regard to their recent negative experiences. Compared with people low in self-compassion, people high in self-compassion tend to use more emotion-focused strategies and fewer avoidance-oriented strategies when dealing with personal setbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611429466">Neff, Hsieh, &amp; Dejitterat, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although self-compassion has emerged as an important construct for understanding well-being, most of what is known about individual differences in self-compassion has come from self-reports on the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611429466">Neff, 2003b</xref>). It is clear that self-compassion is a reliably measured subjective state; however, as are all evaluative self-reports, subjective reports of self-compassion are vulnerable to a variety of response biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611429466">Paulhus &amp; Vazire, 2007</xref>). Using observational assessments instead of self-reports may obviate these biases, and observational assessments have proven useful in a variety of social and clinical contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611429466">Mehl, 2006</xref>). In the current study, we examined how well judges agreed about the degree to which recently separated adults exhibited self-compassion when discussing their relationship history and divorce-related experiences.</p>
<p>An important task in research on divorce is identifying moderating variables that predict positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611429466">Amato, 2010</xref>); we believe that the yet-unstudied construct of self-compassion may be one such variable. Asking people to speak directly about their relationship history and experiences with marital separation can provide rich data for examining variability in self-compassion, specifically with respect to how people view the end of their marriage. The ability to be kind to oneself in distressing circumstances, to view one’s divorce as part of the slings and arrows that challenge all people, and to experience the emotional pain of divorce without becoming entrenched in it appear to be vital for promoting well-being and protecting against lasting distress following divorce. But is self-compassion uniquely associated with positive outcomes following marital separation, or is the construct merely a correlate of feeling good in general?</p>
<p>Drawing on the literature we have just reviewed, we hypothesized (a) that judges would be able to reliably identify behavioral indicators of self-compassion in recently separated adults and (b) that self-compassion would moderate the course of these adults’ emotional adjustment over time, such that adults judged to be higher in self-compassion at the beginning of the study would exhibit greater declines in divorce-related distress over a 9-month follow-up period. We expected that this effect would hold after we accounted for self-reported indices of well-being (e.g., general mood, self-esteem, and optimism), traitlike variables that are generally associated with adjustment to divorce (e.g., attachment anxiety and avoidance), participants’ use of positive and negative emotion words when describing their divorce-related experiences, and the degree to which participants found talking about their separation to be emotionally difficult.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0956797611429466">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample and procedures used in this study are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611429466">Mason, Sbarra, &amp; Mehl, 2010</xref>). Participants were 105 community-dwelling adults (38 men, 67 women; mean age = 40.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 10 years), who reported having been in a relationship with their former partner for more than 13.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 103.10 months). On average, participants reported having experienced a marital separation 3.8 months before entering the study (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.1 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797611429466">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>During an initial laboratory visit, participants were asked to mentally recall a detailed image of their former partner for 30 s; then, for 4 min, they spoke into a digital recorder in a stream-of-consciousness manner about their thoughts and feelings regarding their separation experience. Four trained judges who were unacquainted with the participants and all aspects of the study coded the audio files and rated each participant on modified versions of all items from the Self-Compassion Scale–Short Form (SCS-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611429466">Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011</xref>). All judges were undergraduate research assistants who were blind to the our hypotheses but familiar with the literature on self-compassion; they were provided with detailed training and a scoring manual to aid them in scoring the items.</p>
<p>After the initial visit, participants returned to the laboratory for a 3-month follow-up assessment, followed by either a 6-month or a 9-month follow-up assessment. To decrease the burden on participants and reduce attrition, we used a planned-missingness design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611429466">McArdle &amp; Nesselroade, 1994</xref>). Eighty-five percent (<italic>n</italic> = 89) of the initial participants returned for the 3-month assessment, and 76% of participants were retained over the entire study period (6-month follow-up: <italic>n</italic> = 37; 9-month follow-up: <italic>n</italic> = 43). There were no significant differences in initial divorce-related distress among participants who completed the final (i.e., 6-month or 9-month) assessment and those who did not; however, participants who did not complete both follow-up assessments were judged to have evidenced significantly less self-compassion at the initial visit than did participants who completed all three assessments, <italic>t</italic>(103) = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> = .03.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0956797611429466">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>All self-report measures demonstrated adequate internal consistency (αs = .75–.93), and all but the task rated-emotional-difficulty (TRED) scale were completed at study entry. Divorce-related psychological adjustment served as the outcome variable; observer-rated self-compassion served as the focal predictor variable; divorce-related demographics and emotional difficulty during the stream-of-consciousness task were entered into the model as covariates; and the remaining measures were entered into the model as competing predictors.</p>
<sec id="section5-0956797611429466">
<title>Outcome variable: divorce-related psychological adjustment</title>
<p>During the initial laboratory visit, we assessed participants’ psychological adjustment to marital separation using the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797611429466">Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997</xref>); example items from this scale include “Any reminders brought back feelings about [the divorce]” and “I was jumpy and easily startled.” Higher scores on this scale reflect greater emotional intrusion of the separation into everyday experience, greater somatic hyperarousal in the aftermath of the separation, and a higher level of avoidance behaviors following the separation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797611429466">
<title>Focal predictor variable: observer-rated self-compassion</title>
<p>The four judges listened to each participant's 4-min audio recording about his or her relationship history and separation experience. Judges rated each participant's stream-of- consciousness recording using a modified version of the SCS-SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611429466">Raes et al., 2011</xref>). The SCS-SF was developed using multiple samples and includes a single, higher-order factor of self-compassion. Scores on the SCS-SF are highly correlated with scores on the full SCS.</p>
<p>In the present study, all SCS-SF items were reworded from a first-person perspective to a third-person perspective; when possible, items were made to apply specifically to divorce-related experiences. For example, the SCS-SF item tapping mindfulness originally read, “When something painful happens, I try to take a balanced view of the situation”; it was reworded to read, “When describing something painful about the divorce, this person seems to take a balanced view of the situation.” One modified (reworded) self-kindness item read, “When describing hard times during their divorce, this person tries to give themselves the caring and tenderness they need,” and a modified common-humanity item read, “This person seems to accept their failings as part of the human condition.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797611429466">Table 1</xref> shows example excerpts from transcripts of stream-of-consciousness recordings that received high and low scores for each subscale of the SCS-SF.</p>

<p>Judges scored each of the 12 modified SCS-SF items using the same 5-point Likert-type scale as used in the self-report inventory (from 1, <italic>almost never</italic>, to 5, <italic>almost always</italic>).

<p>Using multilevel modeling, we found systematic declines in IES-R scores over time, including a significant linear decrease, <italic>b</italic> = −0.87, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, as well as a significant quadratic increase, <italic>b</italic> = 0.21, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Together, the linear and quadratic effects reflect a systematic decrease in IES-R scores that slowed over the course of the 9-month assessment period; as time went on, the quadratic component of change increased IES-R scores at the final assessment.</p>
<p>In our first set of conditional models, we examined the effect of self-compassion on IES-R scores at the start of the study and whether change in IES-R scores was predicted by the interactions of self-compassion with time (i.e., initial assessment, 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up, and 9-month follow-up) and time-squared; these models included no control variables. Consistent with the cross-sectional correlation observed at the first assessment, results showed that participants judged to be higher in self-compassion reported less divorce-related emotional distress at study entry, <italic>b</italic> = −1.35, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Both two-way interactions (Self-Compassion × Time and Self-Compassion × Time<sup>2</sup>) were significant: Adults lower in self-compassion evidenced faster linear decreases in IES-R scores over time, <italic>b</italic> = 0.85, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = .005, and faster quadratic increases in IES-R scores over time, <italic>b</italic> = −0.22, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = .03. Thus, as time went on, participants’ IES-R scores increased, and this effect was stronger for participants judged to be lower in self-compassion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611429466">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Because the interactions between self-compassion and time are focal aspects of the model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797611429466">Table 3</xref>, we explored the possibility that the covariates and competing predictors interacted with time in a similar way, thus reducing the significant interaction between self-compassion and time. Because of the large number of covariates and competing predictors, we used a forward-selection stepwise procedure to determine if any of their interactions with time or time-squared would eliminate the significant Self-Compassion × Time and Self-Compassion × Time<sup>2</sup> effects. If the interaction between a covariate or competing predictor and time or time-squared was significant, it was retained in the model. Of these 24 interactions, only the Attachment Anxiety × Time interaction was significant, <italic>b</italic> = −0.06, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .01. Participants who reported higher levels of attachment anxiety evidenced slower linear decreases in IES-R scores over time. This effect did not eliminate the significance of the Self-Compassion × Time and Self-Compassion × Time<sup>2</sup> interactions; therefore, our final model included three significant interaction terms.</p>
<p>Finally, we conducted an end-point analysis by recentering time around the 9-month assessment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because the incidence of divorce is high, it is critical to understand the factors that promote resilience and enhance well-being when marriage dissolves. We found that self-compassion can be assessed observationally (with high interrater agreement) using adults’ verbal accounts of their relationship history and separation experience. Higher levels of self-compassion at the initial laboratory visit were associated with less divorce-related distress up to 9 months later. Over time, participants judged to be lower in self-compassion evidenced significantly faster rates of linear decline in their IES scores, but these participants also evidenced significantly faster rates of quadratic increase in these scores toward the end of the study period. We tested whether the effects of self-compassion would be eliminated when a wide range of covariates and competing predictors was included in the analysis (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611429466">Miller &amp; Chapman, 2001</xref>), but the effects remained robust after we accounted for relationship-specific demographics, self-reported mood states, habitual patterns of emotion regulation, attachment styles, self-reported emotional difficulty during the stream-of-consciousness task, and the positive and negative emotion words participants used during the stream-of-consciousness task. Thus, self-compassion evidenced a high degree of utility for predicting positive adjustment to marital separation.</p>
<p>From these findings, a critical question emerges: To what degree can adults experiencing marital separation or divorce <italic>become</italic> self-compassionate? Self-compassion is believed to be a teachable skill (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611429466">Neff, 2011</xref>), and the literature on loving-kindness interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611429466">Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, &amp; Finkel, 2008</xref>), compassion-focused interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611429466">Gilbert &amp; Procter, 2006</xref>), and mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611429466">Baer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611429466">Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, &amp; Oh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797611429466">Shapiro, Brown, &amp; Biegel, 2007</xref>) is growing quickly. Together with experimental research demonstrating that self- and other-forgiveness can speed the course of recovery from depressive symptoms after divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797611429466">Rye et al., 2005</xref>), our findings suggest that it may be advisable to encourage divorcing adults to cultivate self-compassion. Basic approaches to cultivating self-compassion could include noticing and accepting negative thoughts about the end of one’s marriage (without becoming mired in a cycle of self-recrimination), cultivating self-kindness even while experiencing emotional pain (e.g., moving from regret and self-recrimination to self-forgiveness), and acknowledging that difficult experiences, including divorce, are part of the ups and downs of the human experience.</p>
<p>To the extent that these processes induce positive mood states, divorcing adults may find opportunities to grow and even flourish from the experiences surrounding the end of their marriage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797611429466">Tashiro, Frazier, &amp; Berman, 2006</xref>). Thus, self-compassion may serve to disarm potentially noxious emotional states and, like other positive emotions, to exert an undoing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611429466">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>) on the negative mood states that can arise in the aftermath of difficult social transitions. People high in self-compassion may feel the pain of marital separation, but they avoid ruminating about their negative mental states, punishing themselves for real or perceived transgressions, and wallowing in their isolation and loneliness. Although future research is needed to determine the precise mechanisms linking self-compassion and positive adjustment to divorce, our results indicate that self-compassion serves a powerful protective function when marriage comes to an end.</p>
<p>In evaluations of the role of positive emotions in the context of adjustment to a stressful life event, care must be taken to avoid potentially tautological conclusions. For example, one possible criticism of the current research is that people who felt better at the start of the study would be expected to do better over time regardless of how the predictor or outcome variables were measured. Our approach to data analysis accounted for this concern: If judge-rated self-compassion merely reflected positive affect or the lack of negative affect, the effects of self-compassion would have been eliminated by the covariates and competing predictors, but including competing predictors in our models did not eliminate the effects of self-compassion at the start of the study or either of the interactions between self-compassion and time. Of course, care must be taken in interpreting the self-compassion variable and its interactions with time; it is most accurate to conclude that in the fully controlled model, participants who were judged to have more self- compassion than would be expected after accounting for relevant covariates and competing predictors evidenced the least distress at study entry, the slowest rate of linear decline, and the slowest rate of quadratic increase over time.</p>
<p>The durability of the effect of self-compassion was especially notable. At the 9-month assessment, the IES-R scores of participants whose judge-rated self-compassion scores were 1 standard deviation below the mean increased by 0.32 points, on average, relative to the initial assessment; this was an increase of nearly 0.5 standard deviation on the IES-R. Considering the role of attachment anxiety in our findings illustrates the significance of the effects of self-compassion. Attachment anxiety was strongly negatively associated with adjustment to divorce (for similar findings, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611429466">Birnbaum, Orr, Mikulincer, &amp; Florian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611429466">Davis, Shaver, &amp; Vernon, 2003</xref>) but was not uniquely associated with the IES-R intercept at the initial assessment (<italic>p</italic> = .06) or at the end of the study (<italic>p</italic> = .12). Thus, compared with a construct that has important implications for understanding well-being following social separations, self-compassion appears to be at least as useful for predicting future adjustment.</p>
<p>The findings from this study should be considered in light of its limitations. A primary limitation of this study is that it did not include a self-report measure of self-compassion, and it is difficult to determine how judge-rated self-compassion compares with subjective reports of the same construct. The planned-missingness design precluded assessments from all participants at all time points; although this design feature may have attenuated attrition over the 9-month follow-up period, it would have been ideal to include measurements of all participants at all assessments. Finally, the relatively small number of men in the sample relative to women prevented us from testing for whether the association between self-compassion and adjustment to divorce differed by sex.</p>
<p>This study is among the first to assess self-compassion observationally, and our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that may promote resilience in the face of marital separation and divorce.</p>

<p>Because of the planned-missingness design, it is possible that self-compassion at the initial assessment was significantly associated with IES-R scores in participants who completed the 9-month assessment, but not in those who completed the 6-month assessment. We tested for this possibility by recentering time around the 6-month assessment and observed a significant main effect of early self-compassion at the 6-month assessment, <italic>b</italic> = −0.32, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03; this effect is consistent with the effect of early self-compassion at the 9-month assessment.</p>
