<abstract>
<p>Comparative optimism – feeling at less personal risk for negative outcomes than one’s peers – has been linked to reduced prevention efforts. This study examined a novel debiasing technique aimed at simultaneously reducing both indirectly and directly measured comparative optimism. Before providing direct comparative estimates, participants provided absolute self and peer estimates in a joint format (same computer screen) or a separate format (different computer screens). Relative to the separate format condition, participants in the joint format condition showed (1) lower comparative optimism in absolute/indirect measures, (2) lower direct comparative optimism, and (3) heightened worry. Implications for risk perception screening are discussed.</p>

<p>People are often optimistic when judging their risks for experiencing negative outcomes. For example, people tend to believe they are at less personal risk of experiencing health injury and illness than are their peers – a bias known as comparative or unrealistic optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311434051">Weinstein, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311434051">1987</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311434051">Chambers and Windschitl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311434051">Helweg-Larsen and Shepperd, 2001</xref>). This belief has been demonstrated across a range of domains, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311434051">McCaul and O’Donnell, 1998</xref>), driving accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311434051">Svenson, 1981</xref>), HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311434051">Gladis et al., 1992</xref>), heart attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311434051">Weinstein, 1980</xref>), and natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311434051">Burger and Palmer, 1992</xref>). Critically, although comparative optimism is sometimes beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311434051">Taylor and Brown, 1988</xref>), the perception that one is comparatively invulnerable has been linked to decreases in worry, intentions, and behaviors associated with self-protection and prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311434051">Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311434051">Lipkus et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311434051">McCaul and O’Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311434051">Rose, 2010</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311434051">Klein and Zajac, 2009</xref>). Moreover, this bias also has implications for various models of health behavior for which risk perceptions figure prominently (e.g. Health Belief Model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311434051">Janz and Becker, 1984</xref>). Given the consequences of comparative optimism, the goal of the current research was to test whether comparative optimism (and subsequent worry) could be altered via a novel debiasing technique.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105311434051">
<title>Measuring and explaining comparative optimism</title>
<p>Two methods have been used to measure beliefs about comparative risk: the direct method and the indirect method. First, the <italic>direct method</italic> involves a single question in which a respondent explicitly compares his or her status on some dimension to a specified comparison group/ person (‘Compared to the typical person of the same age/sex, how likely is it that you will develop cancer?’) using scales with relative anchors (e.g. ‘Much less likely than others’). Second, the <italic>indirect method</italic> involves two separate questions wherein a person provides estimates about the self and a specified comparison group/person (‘How likely is it that you [the typical person of the same age/sex as you] will develop cancer?’) using scales with absolute anchors (‘Very unlikely’). For the indirect method, a difference score between the two estimates indicates comparative optimism/pessimism.</p>
<p>Recent evidence suggests these methods are not equivalent. First, direct and indirect comparative optimism are modestly correlated, and the incidence and magnitude of comparative optimism also differs across methods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311434051">Aucote and Gold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311434051">Covey and Davies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311434051">Hevey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311434051">Rose, 2010</xref>). In particular, comparative optimism is more consistently found when using the indirect method, whereas a mix of optimism and pessimism is sometimes obtained with the direct method. However, the <italic>magnitude</italic> of comparative optimism/pessimism tends to be larger when assessed with the direct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311434051">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311434051">Kruger and Burrus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311434051">Rose et al., 2008</xref>). Second, responses on direct and absolute/indirect measures sometimes differ in their ability to predict worry, intentions, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311434051">Gerrard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311434051">Gladis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311434051">Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311434051">Lipkus et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311434051">McCaul and O’Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311434051">Rose, 2010</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311434051">Klein and Zajac, 2009</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311434051">Rose (2010)</xref> showed that greater participant worry about experiencing serious health conditions (e.g. cancer, heart attacks) was better predicted by having low comparative optimism on direct than indirect methods. Third, responses on direct and indirect measures differ in the extent to which they correlate with other moderating variables (e.g. prevalence, severity), which suggests the bias may be explained by different underlying mechanisms for the two methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311434051">Chambers and Windschitl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311434051">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311434051">French and Hevey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311434051">Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311434051">Ranby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311434051">Rose et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311434051">2011</xref>). Special attention will be devoted to this last point, given its relevance to debiasing comparative optimism.</p>
<p>Researchers have articulated different accounts to explain comparative optimism when using direct vs indirect measures. First, direct comparative optimism has been most often linked to cognitive mechanisms, most prominently differential weighting – or providing more psychological weight or attention to self-relevant information than to information about the comparison group when making a direct comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311434051">Chambers and Windschitl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311434051">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311434051">Kruger and Burrus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311434051">Rose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311434051">Weinstein and Lachendro, 1982</xref>). Critically, differential weighting on thoughts indicating a low <italic>self</italic>-likelihood (which is the case for most negative events) would lead people to neglect that the comparison group is similarly invulnerable – producing <italic>comparative optimism</italic>. Second, differential weighting, however, should not affect the indirect measure because it is based on <italic>separate</italic> absolute estimates for self and peers and hence gives them equivalent ‘weight’. The removal of differential weighting as a mechanism suggests that other mechanisms guide risk estimates toward comparative optimism, such as defensive processing in the face of a threatening outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311434051">Rothman et al., 1996</xref>) or a reduction in self-presentational concerns due to physically separating absolute estimate questions.</p>

<title>Debiasing comparative optimism</title>
<p>Given the pervasiveness and importance of comparative optimism, many researchers have attempted to disabuse people of this bias. A first line of debiasing attempts has focused on people’s self-risk estimates. For example, several studies have tried to get people to focus on attributes that could increase their self-risks, or to increase people’s feelings of accountability when making self estimates. Some of these attempts have successfully reduced comparative optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311434051">Lipkus et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311434051">McKenna and Myers, 1997</xref>), other attempts have reported limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311434051">Robb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311434051">Weinstein and Klein, 1995</xref>), and still others have reported success only for subgroups of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311434051">Myers and Frost, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A second line of debiasing attempts has focused on the comparison group. For example, one study showed that restricting the ability of participants to select high-risk comparison groups or targets (i.e. extreme downward comparisons) successfully reduced comparative optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311434051">Brown and Imber, 2003</xref>). Another study showed that increasing the perceived similarity of the comparison group to the self reduced comparative optimism for some types of events but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311434051">Harris et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, other studies have instructed participants to more deeply consider the risk status of the comparison group or have provided feedback about the comparison group. This has been shown to change comparative optimism only under certain conditions and for certain comparative optimism measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311434051">Aucote and Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311434051">Sutton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311434051">Weinstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311434051">Weinstein and Lachendro, 1982</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311434051">Windschitl et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1359105311434051">
<title>Current research</title>
<p>Overall, the success of debiasing research in the context of comparative optimism can be characterized as mixed at best. One reason for the mixed success may be due to the robustness of self-positivity biases or the beneficial nature of comparative optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311434051">Taylor and Brown, 1988</xref>). Another reason may be the inherent difficulty in designing a technique that adequately addresses the link between the method (direct or indirect) and the underlying mechanism. Notably, a successful debiasing study should tailor the technique to the mechanism(s) for the specific measurement method under investigation. When attempting to debias comparative optimism, researchers have typically focused on one method and perhaps the most successful technique would tap into <italic>both</italic> methods. Moreover, it may be especially important to debias both forms of comparative optimism since the psychological relevance of one method over the other is not clear.</p>
<p>Given the mixed success of past debiasing techniques and the lack of research attempting to simultaneously debias both types of comparative optimism, the current research used a single technique that was believed to debias both methods and mechanisms. The goal was to reduce both directly and indirectly measured comparative optimism and also change subsequent worry. Participants made direct comparative estimates about how their own risks for several health outcomes (e.g. heart attack, cancer) compared to the typical student’s (heretofore referred to as ‘peer’) after estimating absolute self and peer risks in one of two formats. First, in the ‘separate format’ condition, participants provided absolute self and peer estimates on separate screens in a computer program. Second, in the ‘joint format’ condition, participants provided self and peer estimates on the <italic>same</italic> screen in a computer program.</p>
<p>The logic was that having participants estimate absolute self and peer risks in the joint format would have two beneficial consequences for debiasing comparative optimism. First, for indirect comparisons, the joint format would highlight the connection between self and peer and possibly inhibit self-enhancing responses. This might be due to self-presentational concerns or a less biased analysis of risk factors that contribute to self and peer risks. Second, because participants in the joint format condition evaluated self and peer risks in the same context (i.e. on the same screen), it was expected that participants would have prior activation of comparison-relevant evidence or information upon reaching the direct comparative estimates. This was expected to reduce differential weighting, and hence lower levels of comparative optimism. Moreover, due to the fact that the indirect comparison biases themselves are expected to be smaller in the joint format condition, this might lead participants to estimate similar comparative risks using the direct measure – either to maintain consistency or because their underlying risk representation has changed.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to attempting to debias comparative optimism, a second aim was to examine whether successfully debiasing these cognitive risk estimates may also lead to changes in worry. Critically, worry has been described as a key mediator between risk perceptions and behaviors, such that inflated risks increase worry which, in turn, affect whether people engage in self-protective behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311434051">Chapman and Coups, 2006</xref>). Thus, given the import of absolute and comparative optimism for worry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311434051">Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311434051">Lipkus et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311434051">Rose, 2010</xref>), participants in the current study indicated their worry after estimating their risks. The expectation was that debiasing participants to be less comparatively optimistic would also be associated with increases in worry.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1359105311434051">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 90 undergraduate students (25 male) from a large Midwestern U.S. university who participated in the study as part of a psychology course requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311434051">
<title>Measures and procedures</title>
<p>Participants were asked a series of questions about five widely assessed health events: heart attack; cancer; auto accident injury; arthritis; and high blood pressure. All portions of the study were conducted on computers.</p>
<p>First, participants made absolute risk estimates for the self and the average student of the same age/sex (‘peer’) on seven-point scales. Specifically, participants were asked ‘How likely is it that you will [develop cancer] before the age of 50?’ and ‘How likely is it that the average student at your university of the same age/sex will [develop cancer] before the age of 50?’ (1 = <italic>not at all likely</italic>; 7 = <italic>very likely</italic>). The order in which a specific event appeared was randomized. Critically, the format of answering absolute self and peer questions was manipulated between subjects. First, for the joint format condition, participants answered absolute self and peer questions on the same response screen. Second, for the separate format condition, participants answered absolute self and peer questions on different response screens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311434051">Figure 1</xref> displays screen shots for both of these conditions. Additionally, the order in which participants made self and peer estimates was counterbalanced in both the joint and separate format conditions. For half of the participants in the joint format condition, self questions were on the top of the screen and peer questions were on the bottom of the screen. This was reversed for the other half of the participants. Likewise, for half of the participants in the separate format condition, self questions were queried first for a given event, followed by the peer question for that same event (repeated until all events were queried). This was reversed for the other half of the participants in the separate format condition. Thus, a 2 (format: joint vs separate) X 2 (order: self first/top vs peer first/top) completely between-subjects design was used.</p>

</fig>
<p>Second, after providing absolute estimates, participants made direct comparative risk estimates for each event on seven-point scales. For example, participants were asked ‘Compared to the average student at your university of the same age/sex, how likely is it that you will [develop cancer] before the age of 50?’ (–3 = <italic>much less likely than the average student</italic>; 0 = <italic>as likely as the average student</italic>; +3 = <italic>much more likely than the average student</italic>). The order in which a specific event appeared was randomized.</p>
<p>Third, participants were asked about their worry and concern for each event on seven-point scales. For example, participants were asked ‘How worried and concerned are you about your level of risk for [developing cancer] before the age of 50?’ (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>; 7 = <italic>extremely</italic>). The order in which a specific event appeared was randomized.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311434051" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The counterbalanced order in which the absolute self and peer questions were assessed did not have any main or interactive influence on critical analyses (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 2.5, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). Thus, all analyses presented below collapse across this order variable. Also, all analyses collapse across gender because it did not systematically impact the results.</p>
<sec id="section8-1359105311434051">
<title>Indirect comparisons</title>
<p>Recall that absolute self- and peer-risk estimates were made on seven-point scales (1 = <italic>not at all likely</italic>; 7 = <italic>very likely</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311434051">Table 1</xref>). Indirect comparisons were calculated by subtracting the peer estimate for a given event from the self estimate for the same event. Comparative optimism was demonstrated if mean values were significantly lower than ‘0’, comparative pessimism was demonstrated if mean values were significantly higher than ‘0’, and mean values that did not differ from ‘0’ demonstrated a lack of comparative bias.</p>

<title>Relation between absolute estimates and direct comparisons</title>
<p>One potential reason for the successful debiasing of direct comparisons in the joint format condition may have been changes in differential weighting. In particular, it was expected that participants in the joint format condition would ‘weight’ absolute self and peer information relatively more equivalently – accounting for the reduction in comparative optimism. The contribution of this mechanism was tested via an idiographic approach, where separate regression analyses were conducted for each participant relating his/her absolute self and peer estimates (predictor variables) to his/her direct comparisons (criterion variable). The standardized beta weights were then averaged across all participants for <italic>t</italic>-test analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311434051">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311434051">Rose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311434051">Windschitl et al., 2008</xref>). When considering the separate format condition there was strong evidence for differential weighting, where more variance in direct comparisons was accounted for by self estimates (mean <italic>β</italic> = .42, SD = .87, <italic>t</italic>(38) = 3.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than peer estimates (mean <italic>β</italic> = .01, SD = .94, <italic>t</italic>(38) = .10, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). When considering the joint format condition, there was some evidence of less differential weighting. Indeed, although a large amount of variance in direct comparisons was accounted for by self estimates (mean <italic>β</italic> = .67, SD = .78, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 5.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), peer estimates also accounted for a substantial (although only marginally significant) amount of variance in direct comparisons (mean <italic>β =</italic> –.21, SD = .76, <italic>t</italic>(39) = −1.70, <italic>p</italic> = .09).</p>

<title>Risk perceptions as a mediator of the influence of format condition on worry</title>
<p>This section examines whether format condition produced a change in worry, and whether this effect was mediated by risk perceptions. To examine this issue, a path analysis and bootstrapping analysis were conducted using methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311434051">Preacher and Hayes (2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311434051">Hayes, 2009</xref>). The independent variable for these analyses was format condition (dummy coded: <italic>joint format</italic> = 0; <italic>separate format</italic> = 1), the dependent variable was worry, and the mediator was an aggregated risk perception index. In terms of the mediator, given that direct comparisons, indirect comparisons, and absolute self estimates all changed as a function of condition (see earlier) and were highly related (α = 0.80), these were standardized and aggregated to form a single risk perception index.</p>
<sec id="section12-1359105311434051">
<title>Step 1: Does format condition predict worry?</title>
<p>The first step was to establish that the independent variable (format condition) predicted the dependent variable (worry). Indeed, format condition was a significant predictor of worry (<italic>b</italic> = –.48, <italic>t</italic> = −1.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that worry was higher in the joint format condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1359105311434051">
<title>Step 2: Does format condition predict risk perceptions?</title>
<p>The second step was to establish that the independent variable (format condition) predicted the mediator (risk perception index). Indeed, as already established earlier, format condition was a significant predictor of risk perceptions (<italic>b</italic> = –.51, <italic>t</italic> = −2.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that risk perceptions were higher in the joint format condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105311434051">
<title>Step 3: Do risk perceptions predict worry?</title>
<p>The third step was to establish that the mediator (risk perceptions) predicted the dependent variable (worry). This analysis showed that higher risk perceptions were, indeed, associated with greater worry (<italic>b</italic> = .63, <italic>t</italic> = 4.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1359105311434051">
<title>Step 4: Was the effect of format condition on worry mediated by risk perceptions?</title>
<p>The fourth step tested the mediated path from format condition (IV) to worry (DV) through risk perceptions (mediator). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311434051">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>, an accelerated-biased-corrected bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 resamples. This procedure tests whether a path is different from 0, which is indicated if the confidence interval band does not include 0. Indeed, this bootstrap analysis showed that the mediation path via risk perceptions was significant (95% CI: –.68, –.10). In short, this analysis provides evidence that participants in the <italic>joint format condition</italic> were more worried because of their increased risk perceptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1359105311434051">
<title>Step 5: Was the effect of format condition on worry fully or partially mediated?</title>
<p>The final step establishes whether the inclusion of the mediator (risk perceptions) indicates partial or full mediation of the path between the independent variable (format condition) and the dependent variable (worry). Supporting full mediation, when controlling for risk perceptions there was no longer an association between format condition and worry (<italic>b</italic> = –.15, <italic>t</italic> = –.66, <italic>p</italic> = .50).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There were several key findings in the current study. First, participants in the joint format condition (relative to the separate format condition) showed reduced comparative optimism in both indirect measures (absolute self minus peer risk) and direct measures. Second, changes in direct comparative estimates appeared to be due, in part, to a reduction in differential weighting of self and peer estimates. Third, format condition had an influence on worry estimates, with participants in the joint format condition providing higher worry estimates. Moreover, the impact of format condition on worry was fully mediated by risk perceptions, suggesting that format affected cognitive risk assessments which, in turn, affected worry.</p>
<p>In short, this debiasing technique was quite successful in reducing directly and indirectly measured comparative optimism, as well as increasing worry. Thus, where past research has shown mixed success in reducing biases, this technique was fruitful and consistent across methods. It is suggested that this technique differs from extant techniques in at least a couple ways. First, as mentioned previously, most past work has focused on changing either the direct method <italic>or</italic> the indirect method (but not both), which is critical to the design of the technique since biases using both methods are driven by unique mechanisms. Second, most prior debiasing techniques have focused on changing the risk-related information that is recruited and used in the judgment. This has been accomplished, for example, by focusing people on attributes that highlight their own riskiness or by restricting participants’ abilities to select high-risk comparison groups. In contrast, the debiasing technique used here does not attempt to alter the information that is recruited; rather, it is intended to change the context in which people attend to, weight, and utilize the information when making the judgment.</p>

<title>Implications for health researchers and practitioners</title>
<p>These findings are informative to researchers and practitioners who are interested in screening for health risk perceptions. Indeed, one goal of many researchers/practitioners is to disabuse people of pervasive comparative optimism, perhaps as a way to trigger adaptive worry, intentions, and behaviors. To the author’s knowledge, this research is one of the first to use a debiasing technique that simultaneously impacts absolute self risk and two forms of comparison risk – each of which may hold unique psychological relevance. Health researchers and practitioners interested in debiasing direct/indirect comparative optimism or simply increasing absolute self-risk perceptions may thus benefit from using this joint format. Moreover, it is argued that this technique holds many desirable features relative to previous techniques used for debiasing comparative optimism. First, this debiasing technique is relatively simple, subtle, and does not involve manipulations of information about target characteristics. Second, as mentioned previously, this single technique attacks <italic>both</italic> directly and indirectly measured comparative optimism at the same time and, in fact, utilizes the optimism measures <italic>themselves</italic> (and their presentation) to promote reduction in bias. Third, this technique may be easily adopted via both computer- and paper-based methodologies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1359105311434051">
<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>There are notable limitations in this research. First, the fact that this research was conducted on relatively healthy college students, and inquired about specific health events that have traditionally been shown to produce less robust comparative optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311434051">Weinstein, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311434051">1987</xref>), has implications for the generalizability of the findings. In terms of the sample used, nominally healthy students may be unlikely to experience these health events in the near future and thus may hold little psychological meaning. In terms of the events used, it is possible that responses to this particular set of events (chosen because they are commonly assessed and important) may not be representative of responses to the entire range of health events. Although it is argued that this research offers insights about the general efficacy of this debiasing technique, it would clearly be beneficial to replicate this work using a more representative sample and diverse set of health events.</p>
<p>Second, throughout the article it is emphasized that risk perceptions can shape worry, intentions, and behaviors. Although aspects of the risk perception process were manipulated and shown to have a short-term effect on comparative optimism and subsequently measured worry, the causal and long-term impact of debiasing efforts cannot be verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311434051">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311434051">Weinstein and Nicolich, 1993</xref>). Prospective studies that use debiasing manipulations at Time 1 and examine relevant outcome measures at Time 2 (e.g. actual behaviors, changes in comparative optimism) would be useful in demonstrating whether there is long-term change in comparative beliefs and self-protective action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1359105311434051">
<title>Coda</title>
<p>This research has primarily focused on the disadvantageous nature of comparative optimism and the need to disabuse people of this bias. It is noteworthy that some researchers highlight the benefits of comparative optimism for positive coping and adaptive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311434051">Taylor and Brown, 1988</xref>). Given this perspective, it is debatable as to whether a researcher/practitioner might want to debias comparative optimism at all. Contemporary perspectives emphasize the need to identify moderating conditions under which comparative optimism might be beneficial vs harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311434051">Klein and Zajac, 2009</xref>). Dovetailing with this perspective, future research that identifies circumstances under which debiasing may be productive vs counterproductive would be useful. The current research offers a novel technique that may be used for these future endeavors and for more general uses such as health communication and screening efforts.</p>
