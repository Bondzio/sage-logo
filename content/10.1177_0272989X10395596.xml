<abstract>
<p>A concise and reliable composite quality score would be helpful in judging the quality of a hospital’s services, especially for pay-for-performance (P4P) initiatives. This study compared several nonlatent and latent composite quality scores to evaluate the quality of care using diabetes mellitus (DM) P4P data and discusses their characteristics and implications for P4P policy. The authors describe a cross-sectional study of the DM P4P data collected from the claims data of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan from January 2007 to December 2007. The DM patient outcome data, such as hemoglobin A1C values, were retrieved from the P4P database sponsored by the Bureau of NHI in Taiwan. The composite scores were derived from the following methods: 1) nonlatent scores methods (e.g., the raw sum score and the all-or-none score methods)and 2) latent scores methods (e.g., item-response theory-based Models I and II and the PRIDIT model). These scores are compared in terms of 2 aspects—agreement of hospital rankings (using Spearman’s rank correlation) and reliability (using bootstrap methods). The latent methods were superior to the nonlatent methods because they were more reliable and had specific weighting themes. The correlations among the 3 latent methods were moderately high. The use of the PRIDIT approach, which is moderately difficult compared with item response theory–based model, is recommended if the insurer wants to balance convenience and precision.</p>

<p>Government and insurers often judge the quality of a hospital’s service in terms of its performance rating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X10395596">1</xref></sup> However, quality of care is a multidimensional construct that cannot be measured directly. Thus, multiple indicators are used to construct a composite score to measure quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref></sup> A composite score/indicator is an aggregation of multiple underlying performance indicators into a single index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X10395596">3</xref></sup> Multiple summary or composite measures have been recommended by the Institute of Medicine to present quality data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X10395596">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Summary scores have many advantages. For example, in the care of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), if a hospital gets a higher grade on the process measure (e.g., annual A1C test) but a lower grade on the intermediate outcome measure (e.g., A1C level &lt;8%), we cannot draw a conclusion about the overall quality of this hospital. Yet, if we make a composite score based on a rigid weighting scheme, we can easily understand and track the summary of each hospital’s quality over time, which was previously not possible with piecemeal indicators based on individual performance measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X10395596">5</xref></sup> Moreover, reliable composite scores can be derived using samples smaller than those required for a single indicator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A concise and reliable composite score would be helpful in judging the quality of a hospital’s services, especially for pay-for-performance (P4P) initiatives. Increasing number of P4P initiatives established around the world are calling for more research on composite scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X10395596">8</xref></sup> In this study, we computed several nonlatent and latent composite scores, constructed using a number of process and outcome measures, to evaluate the quality of care using DM P4P data and then discussed their characteristics and implications for the P4P policy. Specifically, we compared the latent and nonlatent P4P composite scores in terms of 2 aspects: 1) agreement with the facility ranks and 2) reliability. Moreover, for the sake of sensitivity analysis, we set up different absolute cutoff points of patient volume of the facilities in our analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X10395596">9</xref></sup> Finally, we summarized the important characteristics of the latent and nonlatent composite scores (e.g., weighting scheme), constructed by using several process and outcome measures and made suggestions about how to supplement them in the structural aspect of P4P incentive design.</p>

<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>The DM P4P program is the most comprehensive P4P program of the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan. The new DM P4P policy was initiated in August 2006, launching fresh indicators, including the presence of 2 outcomes as an indication of poor care (i.e., providers were not rewarded for patients with undesirable intermediate outcomes because patients with these values were less likely to have received good care). The 2 undesirable outcomes used were the “percentage of A1C ≥ 9.5%” and “percentage of LDL ≥ 130 mg/dL.” The structure of incentives became a quality tournament (only the top 25% of performers received the rewards).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X10395596">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>Two secondary databases served as the sources of data for this study. The first database included data collected from the regular NHI claims data for the period from January 2007 to December 2007 and was used to obtain patient and hospital characteristics. The second was a P4P database, which was intended to supplement regular claims data. DM patients’ intermediate outcome data, such as A1C or LDL values, were reported by the facilities themselves and were entered into the P4P specific database automatically.</p>

<title>DM Patients, Plurality Provider Algorithm, and DM Measures</title>
<p>Patients bearing a primary or secondary diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9-CM 250) were selected. They were also required to have more than 4 outpatient visits to ensure an accurate diagnosis as suggested by Lin and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X10395596">10</xref></sup> To address the problem of patients’ multiple visits to different facilities and for provider accountability, the assignment algorithm called the <italic>plurality provider algorithm</italic> was applied to our study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X10395596">11</xref></sup> The algorithm assigns a patient to the physician (or practice) who billed for the greatest number of care visits in a given year. Ties between physicians were resolved by favoring the physician with the greatest total charges for that patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X10395596">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were 2 kinds of measures in our study: process/accountability measures and intermediate outcome measures (dichotomous measures). For process/accountability measures, we referred to the Diabetic Quality Improvement Program (DQIP) and new General Medical Services (nGMS) from the United Kingdom to define these 2 process indicators (A1C test annually and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] test annually).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X10395596">12</xref></sup> As for intermediate outcome/quality indicators, although negative indicators A1C ≥ 9.5% and LDL ≥ 130 mg/dL were launched by the P4P program, we applied a “more is better” philosophy (e.g., A1C &lt; 9.5%) and changed A1C &lt; 9.5% to A1C &lt; 8% (A1C &lt; 8% and LDL &lt; 130 mg/dL).</p>
<p>We adopted A1C &lt; 8% because this is a reliable and discriminating measure compared with A1C &lt; 9.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X10395596">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X10395596">14</xref></sup> After adjusting the A1C level, we also found that very few patients have A1C levels greater than 9% or less than 7%. These 4 measures were aggregated into composite scores using the different methods described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X10395596">
<title>Composite Score Methods</title>
<p>There are 2 kinds of methods for building composite scores: within-domain composite scoring and across-domain composite scoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X10395596">15</xref></sup> In the case of within-dimension scores, the measures associated with the domain are expected to be correlated and to measure the same latent construct, whereas across-domain scores represent summaries of different constructs (domains).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X10395596">16</xref></sup> In this study, within-domain composite scoring provided a way to combine individual indicators of the same disease (diabetes) into 1 domain (clinical). We only considered within-domain composite scoring in this study and first classified within-domain composite score methods into 2 groups: nonlatent v. latent approaches.</p>
<p>Nonlatent score methods include the raw sum score and the all-or-none score. The raw sum score approach is also called denominator-based weights (DBW)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> or overall percentage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref></sup> The raw sum score is simply the sum of units (patients) that achieved each measure divided by the sum of units that could have achieved each measure (e.g., eligible patients for each measure).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> If the number of units that could have achieved the measures is the same, then the raw sum score is the same as the indicator average or the raw average score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X10395596">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>An alternative simple method advocated by the Institute of Medicine has been called the all-or-none score because providers or hospitals are only given credit if all individual measures are achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X10395596">19</xref></sup> The approach is justified mainly on the grounds that accepting anything less than complete care is incompatible with the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Latent score approaches assume that categorical measures or “items” (e.g., clinical performance measures) reflect an underlying “construct” (e.g., quality) for a “subject” (e.g., hospital).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X10395596">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> Although quality of care is a multidimensional construct that cannot be measured directly, in 1987, Feinstein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X10395596">22</xref></sup> introduced the “clinimetric” approach. This approach was designed to choose the most important items that are not expected to be homogeneous in the composite score on the grounds that they indicate different aspects of a complex clinical phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X10395596">23</xref></sup> Thus, we still consider the selection of the DM process and the intermediate outcome measures to be included in the single latent composite score. There are 2 kinds of latent score approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X10395596">20</xref></sup> One is the item response theory (IRT)–based approach, which includes the Normal-Ogive model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> and the Bayesian hierarchical latent variable model proposed by Shwartz and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> and Landrum and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X10395596">24</xref></sup> The IRT-based approach usually gives more weight to the measures that have more self-variance or that are difficult to achieve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> The other is the principle component analysis (PCA)–based approach, which includes PCA with relative to an identified distribution (PRIDIT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X10395596">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X10395596">26</xref></sup> and other alternative approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X10395596">27</xref></sup> The PRIDIT approach usually gives more weight to the measures that have high correlations or covariances with other measures.</p>
<p>For hospital profiling, IRT models can describe the association between a hospital’s underlying level on a latent quality and the probability of achieving a specific measure using mathematical equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X10395596">28</xref></sup> For the IRT-based approach in this study, we adopted the 2-parameter model, a method based on 2 parameters for each DM measure. The first parameter reflects the difficulty of achieving the measure, for example, the difficulty in scheduling A1C screening for diabetic patients. The second parameter reflects how well the clinical measure differentiated between hospitals with different levels of quality. We applied the mathematical model of Normand and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> to this study and labeled this model IRT-based Model I.</p>
<p>We used another model called IRT-based Model II extended from IRT-based I by Shwartz and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> In IRT-based Model I, a hospital’s latent quality (θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and its true level of performance on measure <italic>j</italic> (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) is determined by the relationship β<sub>1<italic>j</italic></sub> (θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> −β<sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub>). However, in addition to variation induced by the measure’s (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) link to latent quality (θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), IRT-based Model II assumed random variation or noise in every measure <italic>j</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> and measured every indicator’s random variation by <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>j</italic>. For the purpose of comparison with IRT-based Model I, IRT-based Model II was assumed to be Probit (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>). This assumption was different from the logit link function of Shwartz and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> However, the original IRT-based model created by Landrum and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X10395596">24</xref></sup> used the probit link function because of the normalization assumption, and our data also verified that the parameter estimations from the 2 link functions were very similar (data not shown).</p>
<p>IRT-based Model II assumed that Probit (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) ~ N(β<sub>1<italic>j</italic></sub>θ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> −β*<sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub>, <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>j</italic>), where <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>j</italic> reflects the noise in Probit(<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> All of the distributions of priors in IRT-based Model II are the same as in Model I, except for the flat prior on the <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>j</italic> ~ N(0, 10<sup>6</sup>), which was restricted to positive values. Similarly, based on the latent quality (θ<sub>
<italic>i</italic></sub>) estimated by IRT-based Model II, we can rank hospitals.</p>
<p>We used the WinBUGS software, version 1.4.3, to compute the IRT-based model. The 2 long chains using the 10,000 runs were used for inference. The burn-in of runs was selected based on the convergence assessed by the Gelman-Rubin statistic. The deviance information criterion (DIC), D-bar (posterior mean of the deviance), and effective number of parameters (pD) were computed to measure the model fit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X10395596">29</xref></sup> In this study, we calculated these 3 parameters for IRT-based Model I and IRT-based Model II. We assumed that 3 models permitted different discrimination parameters β<sub>1<italic>j</italic></sub> for IRT-based Model I and IRT-based Model II. All models can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272989X10395596">Table 1</xref> of the appendix.</p>
<p>The other type of model is called the PRIDIT approach. When referring to a composite score, PCA with hospital measures may serve as a method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X10395596">30</xref></sup> However, the PRIDIT approach uses RIDIT scores instead of hospital measures. This study computed a RIDIT score for each hospital based on the 4 measures, using the method originally described by Bross,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X10395596">25</xref></sup> and adapted by Liberthal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X10395596">26</xref></sup> In addition, to avoid the need for the relative variance to affect the weights of the PRIDIT Model, the mean-corrected (variables centered on the mean) and standardized models (standardized variables) were both used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X10395596">31</xref></sup> Except for the IRT-based method, all other nonlatent and latent composite scores were constructed using the SAS software, version 9.1.3.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272989X10395596">
<title>Comparisons of Different Composite Score Methods</title>
<p>While exploring the agreement in the context of P4P, we assigned facilities to 5 tiers that were based on the reward structure used by Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration (HQID). This structure was designed to provide financial rewards and public recognition to hospitals that demonstrate high-quality performance in a number of areas of acute care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X10395596">32</xref></sup> HQID first sorts hospitals by their performance and then calculates the number of hospitals within each of the 10 deciles of each clinical area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X10395596">32</xref></sup> We obtained 5 tiers by grouping deciles: the best decile, the second-best decile, the middle 6 deciles (deciles 3–8), the next-to-lowest decile, and the lowest decile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> The agreement between each pair of methods was quantified by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X10395596">33</xref></sup> Finally, we captured the top 5 tertiary hospitals based on their raw sum score and showed that they are classified differently depending on the latent or nonlatent methods, to understand the impact of the scoring algorithms.</p>
<p>To explore the reliability among these composite score methods, we analyzed how a slight variation in the methodological rules used to aggregate the individual indicators into a composite score might have an impact on the P4P performance. We estimated the standard errors of the composite scores using a bootstrap method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X10395596">34</xref></sup> First, 10,000 samples were randomly drawn from the original data. If 1 patient had more than 1 record (outcome value), we included all of that patient’s records to make the bootstrap database. For each composite score, the standard error was computed from 1,000 bootstrap samples (replicates) of 10,000 with replacement. The reliability of the aggregation variable, derived originally from a generalized theory in psychological testing, is defined as the ratio of the true score variance to the observed score variance. These 2 variances were estimated from the bootstrapped standard error and the between-hospital variance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X10395596">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X10395596">36</xref></sup> We iteratively ran WinBUGS inside SAS to automatically compute the reliability of IRT-based models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X10395596">37</xref></sup> Other reliabilities of composite scores were derived using SAS software.</p>

<title>Risk-Adjusted A1C Level and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>Hospitals that treat seriously ill patients may have greater difficulty in achieving a good performance rating; therefore, we risk adjusted A1C values at the patient and hospital levels. Risk adjustment is a standard process for such a study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X10395596">38</xref></sup> and the details of our procedure are described in the appendix. In addition, facilities were excluded from the study if they had less than a given threshold volume of patients (10 or more, 30 or more, and 50 or more), according to the suggestion of Scholle and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X10395596">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The total number of DM P4P patients in our study was 146,481; 48.08% of the patients were male. The average patient age was 61.9 years, and the average number of patient visits in 2007 was 9.37. Although 3% of the facilities were tertiary hospitals, 70% of DM P4P patients were treated by such hospitals. The number of facilities reporting measures was 648. Restricting to 10, 30, and 50 eligible cases per hospital resulted in a loss of 7% (<italic>n</italic> = 603), 15% (<italic>n</italic> = 511), and 29% (<italic>n</italic> = 428) of the hospitals, respectively. These 4 measures had the same amount of eligible persons (number of patients being enrolled in the P4P Program), and the average value was 250, 292, and 341, under the different conditions of volume category greater than 10, 30, and 50, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X10395596">Table 1</xref>, the highest variance between those measures was for LDL Test Annually (0.046), and the lowest variance was for A1C Test Annually (0.019). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X10395596">Table 1</xref> also shows that A1C Test Annually was the most skewed measure (median and 95th percentile equal to 1), followed by LDL Test Annually (median = 0.88).</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X10395596">Table 2</xref>, for IRT-based Model I, A1C Test Annually had the highest discriminating parameter, 0.65, followed by LDL Test Annually, 0.51. In addition, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X10395596">Table 2</xref>, if we overlook the 15 most extreme outliers for IRT-based Model I (proportions of achieved A1C Test Annually below 0.50), then the discrimination parameter on A1C Test Annually decreased to the third position, 0.34 (0.65 → 0.34) compared with the first position, LDL Test Annually (0.51 → 0.71) (data not shown). This change showed that IRT-based Model I was easily affected by outliers and resulted in the inflated discriminating parameter.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X10395596">Table 1</xref>, the highest-variation measure, LDL Test Annually, varied 2.4 times higher than AIC Test Annually. However, the variance of A1C Test Annually on the RIDIT score was the highest (0.62)—about 5 times more varied than the second highest measure, LDL Test Annually (0.13) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0272989X10395596">Table 2</xref> in the appendix). This different result was due to the measure A1C Test Annually having a high ceiling effect that was given more weight based on the RIDIT score, which has significant impact on the mean-corrected PRIDIT approach described below.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X10395596">Table 3</xref>, for the mean-corrected data, the weighting of A1C Test Annually was around 1.7 times higher than LDL Test Annually, using the PRIDIT approach (0.78/0.46). However, using IRT-based Model I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X10395596">Table 2</xref>), A1C Test Annually achieves around 1.3 times as much weighting as LDL Test Annually. This is due to the mean-corrected PRIDIT approach giving more weight to the measures with more self-variance of RIDIT scores compared with IRT-based Model I. For the standardized data, the most highly weighted measure became LDL Test Annually because of the higher correlation with most of the other measures, LDL &lt; 130 mg/dL (correlation: 0.64) and A1C Test Annually (correlation, 0.29) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0272989X10395596">Table 2</xref> in appendix). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X10395596">Table 3</xref>, all of these first eigenvalues can account for the 44% to 46% variations of RIDIT scores whether the data were mean-corrected or standardized. Similarly, if we overlook the most extreme outliers for the mean-corrected PRIDIT model, (proportions of achieved A1C Test Annually below 0.50), the weighting on measures did not change significantly compared to IRT-based Model I. A1C Test Annually is still the most highly weighted measure with a weighting factor of 0.71 (0.78 → 0.71), followed by LDL Test Annually (0.45) (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used DM P4P data to examine the quality of care of hospitals in terms of composite score, evaluated by several process and outcome measures. We discussed the following 3 perspectives: aggregating mechanism (characteristics), agreement of hospital ranks, and the reliability of different latent and nonlatent methods in the P4P program. In addition, we made risk adjustments for patient A1C level and performed a sensitivity analysis after excluding facilities that had fewer than 10, 30, or 50 patients.</p>
<p>Previous research focused on the nonlatent or IRT methods and discussed more about the agreement of hospital ranks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup> Our study focused not only on IRT methods that demonstrated a better fit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272989X10395596">Table 1</xref> in the appendix) but also on the new PRIDIT approach. We provided not only the agreement of hospital ranks based on these methods but also the empirical testing regarding their significant characteristics, especially when used for the measure having a ceiling effect. In addition, we discussed their reliability, using the rigorous bootstrap method.</p>
<p>The primary method implications of this study emerge from the 3 perspectives mentioned above. From the aggregating mechanism, we knew that measures that have high variations should be weighted more for IRT-based Model I. However, the measures having ceiling effects or few outliers were more highly weighted and resulted in inflated variation or discriminating parameter. If we overlook the few extreme outliers for IRT-based Model I, then the discrimination parameter decreased rapidly. IRT-based Model II, which assumed random variation or noise in every measure, can consider the situation of ceiling effects and reduce the inflated discrimination parameter. Another approach—PRIDIT—has a weighting mechanism that differs from IRT-based models. In general, the measure that had higher correlation with other measures received more weighting for the PRIDIT approach, and because of the inclusion of PCA technique, PRIDIT was not easily affected by outliers. However, measures with ceiling effects still obtained higher weighting easily because the weighting mechanism of the RIDIT score gives more weight to measurement proportions that have more hospitals. The results therefore yielded an increased measurement self-variance. The mean-corrected PRIDIT model is affected by self-variance, because self-variance receives more weight for this model. If we had used the standardized PRIDIT model to eliminate the influence of measure’s self-variance, then the measures achieving the ceiling effect would have had lower weighting. The primary reasons for the measures obtaining the highest weighting using different latent composite score methods can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0272989X10395596">Table 4</xref> in the appendix.</p>
<p>Regarding the agreement of hospital ranks, our result can be validated by a previous study. For example, we estimated the correlation between IRT-based Model I and Model II would be 0.75 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X10395596">Table 4</xref>), and previous study found that it would be 0.73.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref></sup> We noted that there was a moderately high correlation between these 3 latent methods, IRT-based Model I, Model II, and the PRIDIT approach (&gt;0.67). This result may show that hospital rankings are moderately consistent using any of those latent methods.</p>
<p>The reliability of composite scores is very important. Our analysis has shown that among composite scores that were constructed several times (bootstrap), their precisions or reliability levels were not similar. The nonlatent scores had poorer reliability compared with any of latent scores, which had the highest the reliability of the scores (approaching 1).</p>
<p>We summarized the characteristics of these composite score methods based on the previous literature and our own findings (please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0272989X10395596">Table 5</xref> in the appendix).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X10395596">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X10395596">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X10395596">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X10395596">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X10395596">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X10395596">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X10395596">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X10395596">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X10395596">42</xref></sup> The latent methods may be superior to the nonlatent methods because they have the following characteristics: view of latent quality, better reliability, and weighting rationale, which can give more nuanced policy suggestions. Thus, the primary policy implications of this study are that latent methods can supplement the incentive design of P4P programs, especially for the handling of the measure achieving a ceiling effect. Undoubtedly, we can use latent methods to weight measures based on their different weighting drivers such as correlations or self-variances described above. However, it is possible that very few hospitals are still outside the borders of the basic performance level when most of the facilities that had achieved the top decile (ceiling effect), such as A1C Test Annually, are taken into account. There seem to be 2 options. The first is to weight this measure more, and the other is to weight the measure less or to just retire it. If we believe that the measure achieving a ceiling effect should be weighted more, then we can use IRT-based Model I or the mean-corrected PRIDIT approach. The PRIDIT approach weights the measures more than IRT-based Model I because the mean-corrected PRIDIT approach gives more weight to the measure with more self-variance of RIDIT score. The rationale for higher weighting is to treat the measure achieving a ceiling effect as a “basic threshold”; thus, the hospital that receives fewer rewards through the use of the 2 latent methods may be partly viewed as being penalized because it doesn’t achieve a higher score on this more discriminating measure (achieving a ceiling effect). However, the lower performers are punished significantly because they always achieve the lower score on these more discriminating measures. We can overcome such unintended consequences by using the latent score to supplement the P4P design, which is incorporated in the new P4P value-based purchasing (VBP) program in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X10395596">43</xref></sup> For these lower performers, we can reward performance on a sliding scale based on their prior performance and a benchmark attainment, which usually is set by using the mean value of the top-performing 10% of all hospitals in the previous year. On the other hand, if we believe that the measure achieving a ceiling effect should be weighted less, then we can use latent methods such as IRT-based Model II or the standardized PRIDIT approach or design a system to retire it. The rationale for weighting less or retiring is that the measure having a ceiling effect cannot differentiate quality. However, to retire or to decrease weighting on a measure achieving a ceiling effect may be an issue. The nGMS from the United Kingdom suggested retiring this type of measure and removing financial incentives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X10395596">44</xref></sup> However, recent evidence showed that removing financial incentives might reduce performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X10395596">45</xref></sup> Hence, the latent composite score may play an important role in coping with measures that achieve ceiling effects.</p>
<p>No matter what types of latent scores are implemented, their weighting rationale may highlight the importance of a single measure. However, currently no latent method is used in setting policy for P4P or other benchmark goals. The complexity of the latent methods is a primary reason that they are not being adopted and used.</p>
<p>A similar effect can be seen in single measures. For DM A1C measurement, many articles propose replacing the dichotomous measures (e.g., A1C &lt; 8%) with the continuous or longitudinal measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X10395596">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X10395596">48</xref></sup> However, very few health plans followed this suggestion in part because of the simplicity of the dichotomous measure. For a composite score, one article announced a simple approach to weight surgical measures based on variance and correlation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X10395596">27</xref></sup> However, it may be argued that the method is better based on a comparison with only the raw sum score and not on a comparison with other latent methods. Thus, choosing the latent or nonlatent composite score may be a trade-off between convenience and precision. We recommend the use of the PRIDIT approach that is moderately difficult compared with IRT-based Model if the insurer wants to balance convenience and precision.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. We do not know whether the administrative data are accurate. In this study, we used 2 databases from Taiwan, the National Health Insurance and P4P databases. We had 2 concerns with these sources. First, one study found that the accuracy of diabetes diagnosis in National Health Insurance database in Taiwan was only 74.6% using a survey questionnaire; thus, in our study, not only were patients bearing a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9-CM 250) selected, but these patients were also required to have more than 4 outpatient visits. This selection process ensured that the accuracy of diagnosis achieved was 99.16 times greater than that for patients with 1 outpatient visit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X10395596">10</xref></sup> but the results may not generalize to patients with fewer visits. The other concern was that because the P4P database was launched in 2001, its accuracy has not yet been investigated. In addition, in this study, we adopted the A1C&lt; 8%. The question of which threshold of A1C to adopt is still controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X10395596">49</xref></sup> An A1C value &lt; 8% is a reliable and discriminating measure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X10395596">13</xref></sup> and we consider the measure of A1C &lt; 8% suitable for patients with a larger deviance from optimal A1C level (7%) than with trivial deviance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X10395596">50</xref></sup> After adjusting the A1C level, we also found that very few patients have A1C levels greater than 9% or less than 7%, so an evidence-based measure such as A1C&lt; 8% may be suitable as a component of the composite score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X10395596">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X10395596">13</xref></sup> In fact, the choice of which individual indicators to include or change from a composite should be subject to a strict consensus-building process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272989X10395596">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X10395596">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272989X10395596">53</xref></sup> However, this issue was beyond the scope of this study. Finally, we did not approach the issue of whether the choice of aggregation method reflects the views of particular groups. The question of how these different group preferences should be elicited and weighted was outside the scope of this work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272989X10395596">54</xref></sup></p>

<title>Model Fitting Results for IRT-based Model I and II</title>
<p>We assumed that 3 models permitted different discrimination parameters β<sub>1<italic>j</italic></sub> for the IRT-based Model I and IRT-based Model II. We obtained 4 discrimination parameters (β<sub>11</sub>, β<sub>12</sub>, β<sub>13</sub>, and β<sub>14</sub>); 1 for each of the 4 measures. The first models are Model <sub>IRT1</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2</sub>, which have no limitations on the 4 discrimination parameters. The second models are Model <sub>IRT1–1</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2–1</sub>, which assume that all of the discrimination parameters of the 4 measures are equal. The third models are Model <sub>IRT1–2</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2–2</sub>, which assume that the measures that do not contribute to the latent score are eliminated from models because of their low correlation with other measures. Thus, the discrimination parameters of those measures of the Model <sub>IRT1–2</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2–2</sub> are changed to zero. In this study,only the discrimination parameter of A1C level &lt; 8% is changed to zero. All models can be seen <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272989X10395596">Table A1</xref>.</p>
<p>The A1C level &lt; 8% was eliminated from Model <sub>IRT1–2</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2–2</sub> because of its low correlation with other measures. Our Model <sub>IRT1</sub> showed a better fit compared with Model <sub>IRT1–1</sub> and Model <sub>IRT1–2</sub> because of the lower DIC values, and Model <sub>IRT2</sub> showed also better fit compared with Model <sub>IRT2–1</sub> and Model <sub>IRT2–2</sub>.

<title>Risk-adjusted A1C Level and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>We performed risk adjustment only for A1C values because we lacked data related to the LDL level, such as a patient’s body mass index (BMI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272989X10395596">55</xref></sup> In addition, among 5 composite scorings, only the all-or-none score should apply to the patient level, and the other 4 should apply to hospital level. If the adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics were done at the composite score level, then we could not conclude that there are associations between patient characteristics (level 1) and the dependent variable composite score (aggregated level). Even if we aggregated the patient characteristics (e.g., age) into the hospital level, the within-group agreement (e.g., r<sub>wg</sub> index)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272989X10395596">56</xref></sup> must be considered, and there are too many patient and hospital characteristics affecting the composite score level. Thus, the adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics was done at the intermediate outcome measure level but not at the composite score level. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was used to avoid violating the independence of the observations because every patient had repeated measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272989X10395596">57</xref></sup> The independent variables for risk adjustment were age, gender, comorbidity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272989X10395596">58</xref></sup> severity/complication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272989X10395596">59</xref></sup> number of visits, and hospital characteristics, such as patient volume and hospital level. The dependent variable was the continuous variable A1C level, which is better than a dichotomous measure because each patient had repeated A1C levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X10395596">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X10395596">48</xref></sup> We divided the A1C levels into 4 groups according to the 4 quarters of a year (2007). If there were more than 2 tests within 1 quarter, then we calculated the average of the A1C values as that quarter’s specific value. After executing the GEE model, which used A1C levels according to the 4 quarters of 2007 as 4 repeated measures, we could determine the average of the expected A1C values of 4 quarters for each patient. We took the average value as that patient’s annual expected A1C value, which was suitable for constructing different composite scores of hospitals.</p>
<p>We applied our risk-adjusted model only to patients’ A1C values and not to LDL values.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0272989X10395596">Table A3</xref>, the changes in ranks of 5 tertiary hospitals derived from the nonlatent score (raw sum score) and latent score (IRT-based Models I and II and PRIDIT score) are described. These 5 tertiary hospitals obtained their superior ranks (within the first tier) based on the raw sum score, but most of them obtained the middle high ranks (within the third tier) based on the latent methods. Tertiary Hospital D maintained the superior rank and even had an improvement in rank by IRT-based Model II and PRIDIT methods because it obtained 100% grades on the high-weighting measures of A1C Test Annually and LDL Test Annually.</p>

<td>How-to</td>

<td>Easy</td>

<tr>
<td>Advantage</td>
<td>The most transparency. Better reliability than all-or-none method.</td>
<td>Transparency and patient-centeredness. Quality is often an all-or-none property, which agrees with this score. It is concerned with the system perspective.</td>
<td>The model-based scores can perform extensions, such as inclusion of covariates. Using a shrinkage technique to get the reliability estimates. Probability intervals can be placed around any performance measures. Would be hard to game. Better reliability than nonlatent methods.</td>
<td>PRIDIT weights may not be affected by outliers easily; compared with the IRT-based model. Does not make any assumptions about the data (misspecification problems) compared with the IRT-based model. Can test the hypothesis that a quality measure could actually be associated with poorer quality. Can tolerate small hospital data because it is a relative measure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disadvantage</td>
<td>Does not differentiate between 2 measures that have the same number of eligible patients. May penalize measures that have more variability. Facilities may easily achieve top performance (insensitive scale). Overlooks the correlation structure of data.</td>
<td>The number of measures should be small within the measure set and each of them should be supported by strong evidence. Hardly provides providers the chance to increase their improvement. The least reliability. Certain individual measures may make larger impacts on scores.</td>
<td>Having the problems of misspecification of the link function compared with the PRIDIT model. Needs model fit. The assumption that quality is the one dimension may not be appropriate for some data. Discriminating parameters may be affected by outliers more easily vis-à-vis the PRIDIT model.</td>
<td>Some disadvantages of principal components analysis will appear in the computation of this score, such as loss of information. Could be sensitive to the number of observations and the distribution of measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Weighting rationale</td>
<td>No weighting theme or just denominator weight.</td>
<td>Implicit equal weighting.</td>
<td>Measures that have greater discriminating abilities should be weighted more for the IRT-based Model I, and if the measure has more variation when considering random variation, it seems that IRT-based Model II gives it more weight.</td>
<td>More consistent/correlated the RIDIT scores, the more weight measures have. The mean-corrected model gives more weight to measures with higher self-variances of RIDIT scores.</td>

<p>In this study, because each measure had the same denominator, the raw sum score was equal to the indicator average, which assumed that the achievement in 1 measure was as important as the achievement in another measure (it did not have any weighting theme).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X10395596">21</xref></sup></p>
