<p><italic>The Cultures of Alternative Mobilities</italic> is more than just another book featuring the word mobilities in the title. It represents a significant and timely departure from the focus on aero, auto and virtual ‘hypermobility’ concerns that many consider has been the main contribution of this genre to the social sciences. As Vannini makes clear, the collection of essays is a late response to James Clifford’s <italic>Routes</italic> that heralded the much-welcomed and equally maligned cultural critique of ethnography in the 1980s and 1990s. <italic>The Cultures of Alternative Mobilities</italic> continues the argument offered in <italic>Routes</italic> against regionally-fixated cultural critique but with a new twist. The book also – and this is where its charm lies – gives many fascinating examples of alternative mobilities that make a clever counterpoint to MIT-informed rapid, virtual and hi-tech transport futures (so-called hypermobilities) that crowd around the genre.</p>
<p><italic>The Cultures of Alternative Mobilities</italic> offers a template for those who still perhaps identify themselves with ethnography to show their work to a wider social sciences audience and in the context of more cutting edge topics. That these topics blend nicely with the discipline-previously-known-as-anthropology’s core business of globalization, migration, and the greatly diluted term ‘culture’ is both convenient and promising. The appropriate (albeit dated) roots/routes heteronym that binds the opening chapter to the case studies thus acknowledges the gradual collision between the disciplines of anthropology and other qualitatively-inclined disciplines such as mobilities.</p>
<p>To be sure, Clifford, it would be thought, would welcome this collision/collusion between mobilities and cultural critique and the newfound interest in journeys and travel in the peripheral ‘cultural’ contexts highlighted. Certainly <italic>The Cultures of Alternative Mobilities</italic> has many of these journeys, from canoe travel in the north of the US, to bus trips in the north of the UK and walking/sitting in about as far south as one could get (Antarctica). The book’s recurring theme of slow or reflective travel is maintained throughout including an insightful account of those in later life and the issues this group face with infrastructure inadequacies. Perhaps this change of direction towards slowness, reflection and immobility was inevitable in the mobilities genre; however, it should be noted that there have been precious few additions of this kind to the student or researcher’s heuristic arsenal so far.</p>
<p>In spreading the focus of mobilities research to all types of imaginable movement, and indeed to many topics traditionally associated with the domain of anthropology, the book’s raison d’etre (mobilities) is at risk of being diluted as significantly as the term ‘culture’. There is a wider issue here, which surely demands careful debate, about whether such terms as culture should be resigned to the dustbin of history; but, to be fair the book does not rely overly on the term and its intermittent use does not tax the reader. And thankfully the foreword by Ole B Jensen debates the issue and asserts – perhaps imprudently given the stockpile of relentless critique towards the term ‘culture’ in the academy – that ‘mobilities is culture’. It is in this almost offhand statement and collected research that the mobilities genre indeed seems to offer a ‘silver bullet’ for ethnographic inquiry in shifting the gaze of the researcher away from the field-site and away from issues of race/ethnicity/nationality to the socio-spatial practices and technologies that make up travel and movement.</p>
<p>The collection of essays reassuringly avoids protracted navel-gazing about what culture is and instead gives interesting and empirical accounts of alternative mobilities ‘in the field’. <italic>The Cultures of Alternative Mobilities</italic> is a testament to the fact that ‘slow is the new fast’ in the mobilities genre and chimes well with issues of sustainability, inequality and immobility now fashionable as research subjects.</p>
