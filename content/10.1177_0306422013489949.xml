<p>For Brazil, a more connected world means using small media to inform. But more is needed to combat ownership and concentration, says <bold>Rafael Spuldar</bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Media concentration has always been one of Brazil’s worst problems when it comes to free speech. But recent transformations in the country have turned some alternatives to traditional media, which is dominated by a few big companies, into a reality. The birth of the internet and Brazil’s embrace of cyberspace have been key to these shifts.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, living standards have improved for millions of Brazilians: almost 20m people once living in poverty are no longer considered impoverished, while another 32m entered the middle class. Many of those affected live in communities that have historically been ignored, like the <italic>favelas</italic> (shantytowns) in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Some people from these areas, most of them young, already use computers, mobile phones and the internet as their primary sources of news and information. They had their first online experiences as gamers and social media users, but now they act as true content generators, making their neighbourhoods known to the world.</p>
<p>In 2010, Brazilians became familiar with a Twitter profile created by a young man from Rio’s Morro do Adeus, a community located in the conjunction of favelas known as Alemão. Renê Silva, then 17 years old, created Voz da Comunidade (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/vozdacomunidade">@vozdacomunidade</ext-link>), using it as a tool to inform people about his neighbourhood. He became famous after reporting on the police operation that expelled drug-trafficking gangs from Alemão. In a few days, his Twitter followers shot up from a few dozen to over 50,000. Today, Voz da Comunidade has over 115,000 followers.</p>
<p>On his personal Twitter profile, Renê – who has 51,000 followers – reports on his community, often complaining about big media’s poor treatment of topics important to it.</p>
<p>‘Today a relative of the young man shot yesterday at Alemão by policemen came to me and said no one from the traditional media published [anything about it]’, he tweeted on 6 April.</p>
<p>Media really seems to be Renê’s destiny. He says his intention is to become a journalism graduate – and his fans seem to recognise his natural talent for journalism, tweeting congratulatory messages to him on Brazil’s Journalist Day, celebrated on 7 April.</p>
<p>In July 2012, 13-year-old Isadora Faber from Florianópolis, the capital of the southern state of Santa Catarina, created a Facebook page called Diário de Classe (‘Classroom Diary’) to denounce problems in her school. Through addressing serious issues – from exposed wires and damaged doors to a lack of transparency and improper teaching practices – she became a celebrity and a teen champion of free speech. Diário de Classe has over 580,000 Facebook fans. In February 2013, Isadora was featured on a list of ‘25 Brazilians to watch’, published by the <italic>Financial Times</italic>, which highlighted the ‘rising stars’ in Brazil, from sporting figures and artists to business leaders and social innovators.</p>

<p>She claims to have received death threats because of the page. In November 2012, she even posted a picture of her injured grandmother after her house was allegedly stoned, possibly in retaliation against the Facebook page.</p>

<title>Renewed focus on forgotten issues</title>
<p>Another example of Brazil’s process of media decentralisation is the explosion of independent websites and blogs that cover topics mostly forgotten by traditional media.</p>
<p>Take the Sul21 website, which was launched in 2010, emerging out of discussions by a group of bloggers and members of the cultural scene in Porto Alegre, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Originally created as a political site, Sul21 expanded, eventually covering topics like culture and sports and publishing stories about the city’s daily life.</p>

<p>Brazil’s mass media</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>Globo, Folha, Estado, Abril, SBT, Bandeirantes and Record are Brazil’s biggest media groups, controlling over a 100 companies and making profits in excess of 30bn BRL a year (around US$15bn).</p>
<p>In Brazil, it is legal for media conglomerates to own multiple media businesses in the same city or region, a practice that is significantly restricted and discouraged in many other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Folha (folha.uol.com.br), Globo (globo.com) and Record (r7.com) are the top three online news sites in the country, with 90,000,000 unique visitors a month.</p>
<p>Globo enjoys 43 per cent of the government’s advertising budget – a figure that used to be well over 60 per cent ten years ago.</p>
<p>In 2000, newspapers and small media outlets based outside big urban areas received 9 per cent of the government’s advertising budget. In 2011, this rose to 20 per cent, making a profit of 30mn BRL (US$15mn).</p>
<p>From 2000-2011, radio stations’ share of the advertising budget grew from 13 per cent to 23 per cent, with media outlets in the smaller towns commanding 80 per cent of the overall budget.</p>
<p>Internet websites enjoy 5.3 per cent of the federal government’s total advertising budget. In 2000, its share was close to zero.</p>

<p>‘Our effort is to deal with topics we see as of the biggest interest to society – social movements, human rights, minorities’ struggles, political campaign financing, continental integration and so on,’ reporter and editor Igor Natusch told <italic>Index on Censorship</italic>.</p>
<p>‘Our idea is not to treat differently the things other outlets already print. Instead we want to give a proper treatment to topics mostly ignored by traditional media,’ he added.</p>
<p>Sul21 has around 800,000 visitors a day, of which Natusch is extremely proud. Sul21’s stories are widely discussed and shared on social media; in some cases, there have been more than 5000 ‘shares’ on Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite its success, financing is now a problem for Sul21 – as it is for most small media outlets in Brazil. ‘We’re not in the red, but it’s a daily struggle to make ends meet. So we’re already discussing some changes in our business model’, says Natusch.</p>
<p>In some cases, financial solutions come from the government. From 2000 to 2010, the number of outlets supported by the federal government’s advertising budget grew from 500 to 8000. Most of them are small radio stations and newspapers from rural areas, as well as websites and blogs.</p>
<p>This policy began during Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s presidency (2003–2010) and has been maintained by his successor Dilma Rousseff since she took office. In 2011, more than 230 media outlets were listed as being supported by the government’s budget.</p>
<p>According to Brazil’s National Newspapers Association, the country has 380 daily newspapers with a circulation of 20,000,000.</p>
<p>‘Budget assignment to these minor outlets changes the media financing vector, and it’s positive to democratise information,’ says Celso Schröder, president of Brazil’s National Journalists Federation.</p>
<p>The government’s attitude to mass media has been erratic since Lula’s presidency. Lula was heavily targeted by the country’s biggest news outlets because of his plans for media and communication reform and ‘social control’ – which consisted of creating a legal framework in which civil society movements could observe and denounce media companies’ misconduct, a move that had already been introduced in Argentina and Venezuela. The plans were put on hold and President Rousseff openly rejected any kind of media reform even before she took office. But some powerful members of Rousseff’s party, the Workers’ Party, continued to make their wishes for reform heard, on the basis that media concentration and ownership was a serious problem that needed to be tackled. Those who oppose reform – mostly representatives from the big media companies – argue that the only thing it would achieve would be official censorship and a means of silencing the press, particularly when it is critical of the government.</p>
<p>The government did, however, show an inclination towards supporting online publishing, once again demonstrating its somewhat friendly attitude to so-called small media. President Rousseff supported the introduction of a legal framework guaranteeing basic rights for web users, content creators and online intermediaries, known as the ‘Marco Civil da Internet’ or the ‘internet Bill of Rights’. Supporters of the draft bill argued that it could have served as a blueprint for other countries in the region and around the world. The initiative was rejected by Congress’s lower house in November 2012.</p>
<p>It’s clear that, although Brazil’s media landscape is diversifying, there are still significant obstacles preventing it from being truly free and transparent. As Celso Schröder says, ‘Media concentration in Brazil is indecent and unbearable in terms of free speech.’</p>
