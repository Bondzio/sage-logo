<p>Gypsies and Travellers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396811425985">1</xref></sup> are one of the most excluded black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the UK across numerous domains. Despite the increased policy focus on levels of unemployment and economic inactivity among BME groups in recent years, little attention has been paid to the economic position of Gypsies and Travellers, not least because there is a lack of systematic data on the employment status and working patterns of these communities. Few of the programmes set up to tackle unemployment specifically target this population and, anecdotally, a mismatch exists in relation to mainstream back-to-work programmes and community needs. This article considers a series of related studies that explore the accommodation histories and adaptive strategies utilised by housed Gypsies and Travellers across four locations in southern England. One strand of these studies is concerned with employment opportunities and practices following the transition into housing. We draw on these findings to discuss the role of cultural adaptations in mediating the wider socioeconomic context and how recourse to collective responses helps to shape economic and labour market outcomes for members of this group.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The working lives and employment patterns of black and minority ethnic (BME) groups have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Sociologists and urban anthropologists observing the growth of ethnic populations, along with new flows of immigration into the urban centres of economically developed nations in recent years, have focused on the structure of ethnic enterprises; the role of social networks; and, the structural environment in which ethnic businesses operate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396811425985">2</xref></sup> The dissimilar labour market profiles of different ethnic groups and levels of unemployment and economic inactivity among some of those groups, meanwhile, have attracted concern among policy-makers and campaigners, who have highlighted ethnic disadvantage in the labour market as a matter of concern requiring urgent action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396811425985">3</xref></sup> New Labour’s approach to labour market inequalities was to promote race equality and implement a raft of measures aimed at tackling multiple disadvantages for <italic>all</italic> groups, rather than specifically targeting ethnic minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396811425985">4</xref></sup> A Cabinet Office report in 2003 emphasised a ‘spatial mismatch’, with low levels of labour market demand in areas where BME individuals are often concentrated and supply-side factors such as skills and qualification levels, language competence and poor health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396811425985">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recognition of the labour market disadvantages that many minority group members face, an Ethnic Minority Employment Task Force was established in 2006 with the remit of advising the government on how to reduce the employment gap. Furthermore, the Equality Act 2010 strengthens and consolidates previous anti-discrimination bills into one piece of legislation. The coalition government promises to increase employment levels through: promoting equal pay and ending workplace discrimination; moving all Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants facing the most serious barriers to employment onto the new Work Programme (which replaces the New Deal) immediately, instead of after twelve months; and, in addition, funding a mentoring scheme for BME members who want to start their own business.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396811425985">6</xref></sup> However, it is questionable whether these measures will offset the regressive nature of many of the proposed welfare reforms and spending cuts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396811425985">7</xref></sup> These are likely to disproportionately affect many BME members due to their overrepresentation among the poor, with many concentrated in structurally insecure low-paid jobs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396811425985">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the focus on improving the employment levels of BME groups is to be welcomed, there has been little attention paid to the economic position or working practices of Gypsies and Travellers, one of Britain’s longest established ethnic communities, with a population of approximately 300,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396811425985">9</xref></sup> A recent report has argued that the extent of economic dislocation following the collapse of traditional forms of work has been as far reaching for members of this community as have deindustrialisation and the decline of heavy industry for working-class communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396811425985">10</xref></sup> There is a lack of systematic data on Gypsies’ and Travellers’ employment and it is problematic to apply conventional employment categories to a group whose working practices have traditionally been characterised by informality, flexibility, diversity and family-based self-employment.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that unemployment is high among Gypsies and Travellers and, on several indicators, they are among the most deprived groups in the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396811425985">11</xref></sup> They have the worst health profile of any group, dying younger and experiencing higher levels of physical and mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396811425985">12</xref></sup> Adult literacy rates are well below the national average, with research indicating that 21 per cent of male Gypsies and 9 per cent of females sampled could not read, while one-third could only write their name.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396811425985">13</xref></sup> Although these rates are improving, Gypsy and Traveller pupils fare worst in the education system, have the highest levels of permanent exclusions and leave school with fewer GCSEs than other students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396811425985">14</xref></sup> The policy response to tackling unemployment, implemented by both the previous and current governments, has been based predominantly on general welfare-to-work programmes designed to achieve social inclusion through participation in the <italic>formal</italic> job market. Despite the rhetoric of inclusiveness and promotion of diversity, this agenda excludes Gypsies and Travellers, as they do not conform to dominant economic modes and have historically performed self-employed itinerant trades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396811425985">15</xref></sup> Few of the programmes set up to tackle unemployment make specific provisions for Gypsies and Travellers ‘who need training in practical skills as well as opportunities to obtain qualifications for skills they already have’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396811425985">16</xref></sup> The neglect of the employment and training needs of these communities is symptomatic of the pervasive social and institutional prejudice directed towards nomadic communities and the corresponding emphasis on sedentarism (other than for highly skilled, mobile, cosmopolitan workers) as a marker of social integration and, <italic>en passant</italic>, mode of social control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0306396811425985">
<title>Social change, itinerancy and settlement</title>
<p>The state has attempted to exert control and curtail nomadic lifestyles since the Tudor period, with vagrancy regarded as ‘the social crime <italic>par excellence</italic> … Their [vagrants’ and Gypsies’] status was a criminal one because it was at odds with the established order.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396811425985">17</xref></sup> Despite the enactment of centuries of draconian legislation, Gypsy and other nomadic groups have retained a constant presence in Britain since at least the sixteenth century. Until the early mid-twentieth century, the majority resided in tents or wagons and travelled for work purposes, the most important being trading, the provision of entertainment and seasonal agricultural work.</p>
<p>There is also a long history of housed travellers in urban working-class areas, with many spending winters lodging in towns or on the semi-permanent camps that grew on the edges of urban centres. The latter were becoming larger and more permanent by the late nineteenth century, as more families were travelling smaller distances for shorter durations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396811425985">18</xref></sup> In this period, distinctions between nomadism and settlement were less clear-cut, with large sections of the working classes considerably more mobile than today following the rise and fall of industry and the mass seasonal movement between town and country for temporary farm work. Mayhew, for example, estimated that, in the mid-nineteenth century, one-third of London’s street traders spent the summer months ‘tramping’ the countryside working in market gardens, farms and following the country fairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396811425985">19</xref></sup> As Raphael Samuel notes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The distinction between the nomadic life and the settled one was by no means hard and fast. Tramping was not the prerogative of the social outcast as it is today; it was a normal phase in the life of entirely respectable classes of working men; it was a frequent resort of the out-of-work; and it was a very principle of existence for those who followed the itinerant callings and trades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396811425985">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Large-scale social and economic changes in the postwar period which rendered many itinerant jobs obsolete, combined with government legislation, have resulted in profound changes in the traditional lifestyles and economic practices of Gypsies and Travellers. Several factors have made a nomadic life increasingly difficult to maintain: urbanisation; increasing demand for land; a decline in stopping places; and, planning laws and successive policies that have sought to outlaw nomadism and settle the travelling population either on permanent caravan sites or in housing. According to Brian Belton, the thrust of this legislation has a wider purpose than merely assimilating Gypsies into the general population. He points out that caravan dwelling has long been an option for those unable to find affordable housing. In the context of severe postwar housing shortages and a huge increase in homelessness, he highlights a correlation between media and political concern over the ‘Gypsy problem’, homelessness and the number of caravan dwellers. From this perspective, the aim of postwar legislation, such as the 1968 Caravan Act which required local authorities to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers in their area, was as a tool of social discipline: first, to ensure conformity to housing market norms among those who would not, or could not, live in conventional housing; and, second, to promote the isolated nuclear family over more communal ways of living. In this respect, the continuity between the 1960s legislation and the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which criminalised unauthorised camping, scrapped the 1968 Caravan Act and phased out government grants, leading to the closure of many council sites, can be seen as a more explicit attempt to force obedience on those who seek alternatives outside of the conventional housing market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396811425985">21</xref></sup> A lack of official sites and the constant cycle of evictions, as well as difficulties gaining planning permission for private sites, have led increasing numbers of Gypsies and Travellers to move into housing and it is estimated that around two-thirds of the population are now resident in ‘bricks and mortar’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396811425985">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite a housed population of at least 200,000 and extensive research into the housing experiences of other minority groups, there is very little research into the experiences of housed Gypsies and Travellers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396811425985">23</xref></sup> It was this lack of knowledge that led the authors to consider the settlement experiences of formerly nomadic individuals, families and communities more closely. A series of related studies in various locations across southern England examined: reasons for entering housing; social relations with neighbours; perceptions of place and neighbourhood; how cultural identities are maintained in housing; and, the strategies used to cope with what can frequently be an alienating and hostile environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396811425985">24</xref></sup> One strand of these studies was concerned with employment opportunities and practices following the transition into housing. In this article, we discuss how the intersection of wider economic and social changes has impacted on the accommodation options and employment patterns of Gypsies and Travellers. However, the aim is not to present an overly structural account that minimises the role of human agency and culture, as the economic organisation of itinerant groups possesses several features that could be considered advantageous in the contemporary phase of global capitalism. The failure of formal labour markets and welfare systems to meet their needs has led to the adoption of similarly flexible and informal economic dispositions and practices among other economically marginal groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396811425985">25</xref></sup> Organisational flexibility, a willingness to switch between different types of work and the use of family labour may facilitate the emergence of collective responses and adaptations that refashion these traditional economic orientations to a free-market postindustrial context.</p>
<p>For example, many Gypsies who settled in cities successfully adapted the traditional economic characteristics of family-based self-employment – low overheads, organisational flexibility and a multitude of occupations – to an urban context by moving into areas such as scrap dealing, market trading, car dealing and construction. Nevertheless, in terms of economic status and employment opportunities, our findings suggest that a polarisation of these communities is occurring, with many experiencing high rates of long-term unemployment, poverty and multiple forms of disadvantage. Despite its perennially marginal social status and historical association with scarcity and poverty, the social and economic exclusion of this community today is experienced in a fundamentally different spatial and social context from that of earlier generations. Whereas the 1968 Caravan Act settled and geographically segregated Gypsies and Travellers through the location of caravan sites, the more recent phase of settlement has been one element of a much wider spatial concentration and segregation of poverty and deprivation. Recent decades have seen social housing transformed into ‘welfare’ housing for the poorest sections of society – the unemployed, disabled, single parents, the elderly and other economically inactive groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306396811425985">26</xref></sup> – in a process that has placed many housed Gypsies and Travellers in a similar structural <italic>and</italic> spatial location to other deprived and marginalised groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306396811425985">27</xref></sup> Indeed, the process of spatial restructuring has a clear ethnic dimension: BME groups in the UK are nearly three times more likely than white households to live in a poor neighbourhood (27 per cent compared to 10 per cent). Approximately 28 per cent of BME members live in poor housing compared to 15 per cent of white households.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306396811425985">28</xref></sup> Spatial concentrations of BME groups, and the location of those areas <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> labour market structures and opportunities, have profound implications for the working lives of members of those groups. We explore below how the cultural adaptations that Gypsies and Travellers make in response to wider socioeconomic changes and, more specifically, their recourse to collective strategies and repertoires of culturally grounded skills and habits help to shape economic and labour market outcomes.</p>

<title>The study</title>
<p>The findings are based on four qualitative studies consisting of focus groups and in-depth interviews with fifty-five housed Gypsies and Travellers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306396811425985">Table 1</xref>). One study was conducted in a coastal town in south-west England on a housing estate consisting of over 50 per cent Gypsy and Traveller residents. A second comparative study was designed and implemented in south-east England in an area renowned for its large Gypsy and Traveller population. A third (ongoing) pool of interviews is being conducted with Irish Travellers in various inner-London locations. And, finally, further interviews with long-term (over twenty years) housed Gypsies in south London have taken place and will be referred to where appropriate. The article also draws on one focus group interview with young Gypsies and Travellers (aged 13–21) in the south-west and two focus groups undertaken with adults in the south-east.</p>

<p>Eighty per cent of participants were in social housing, while 10 per cent were owner occupiers, 4 per cent rented privately and 6 per cent were living in temporary accommodation. The sample may therefore underrepresent the more successful members of the community, who are more likely to be owner occupiers or have the resources to purchase their own land. It is notable that few people referred to work-related reasons for settling in housing and, of those who did, all were in urban locations and had been housed since the 1960s to 1970s. A theme in the London interviews was how, after moving into housing, many families continued traditional and gender-based working patterns, while taking advantage of new opportunities that a more permanent and urban location offered. This was recalled in interviews:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We were offered a flat on the estate and they [parents] went in because life was getting harder on the road. Dad set up in roofing and kept on with scrap work and my mother did some calling [door-to-door sales]. There was still industry in the area then and she got work in an electronics factory. (male, south London)</p>
<p>There was more to be made in the towns with totting, working the markets and the farms in the summer, we could earn more money than the old days. (male, south London)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By contrast, the most common reason for the more recent phases of settlement (which occurred in southern England between the 1980s and 2000s and was mentioned by over half of the participants in those regions) was a lack of spaces on local authority caravan sites; a shortage of temporary transit sites; or a failure to gain planning permission on privately owned land. One-fifth of respondents had entered housing from the roadside after being classified as homeless, meaning that the family were living in a caravan, but had no legal stopping place, and a further 16 per cent had entered housing to gain access to healthcare and/or education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306396811425985">
<title>Economic characteristics: location and gender</title>
<p>The findings show that a strong preference for self-employment, working for themselves or in family-based businesses, remains among 36 per cent of participants across all study areas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306396811425985">Table 2</xref>). In total, over one-third of working-age men were registered as unemployed or economically inactive, and over half of the women studied were economically inactive, although most were engaged in family caring. Males tended to be clustered within relatively low-skilled manual work or in skilled trades, with many following the same occupations as their fathers and other male relatives, despite opportunities for ‘traditional’ Traveller economic activities being in sharp decline.</p>

<p>Regional differences in working patterns were shaped by local structures of opportunity. Scrap metal dealing and market trading were more significant in urban and suburban areas, while, in rural locations, construction, block paving, gardening and tree felling were more common income sources, although a diversity of occupations were practised by many families, making generalisations difficult. Women tended to be concentrated in care work and in personal services, such as hairdressing, beauty therapy or in retail and cleaning. It has been argued that urbanisation and industrialisation weaken the economic role of women, as modern forms of work tend to be undertaken largely by men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306396811425985">29</xref></sup> However, women in all study areas appeared more willing than men to take paid employment rather than opt for self-employment, although attitudes towards married women working did make it difficult for some to find work outside family-based economic practices.</p>
<p>

</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, comparative anthropological analysis reveals that, in Gypsy and other itinerant communities throughout the world, women have always played a central economic role and generally have more interaction with outsiders during their work than males, which may explain their greater readiness to work outside the family-based economy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306396811425985">30</xref></sup> It is also clear that an adherence to traditional gender roles limits the work prospects of many women. The role of culturally shaped adaptations to economic changes and their relation to spatial location in shaping economic outcomes is elaborated below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306396811425985">
<title>Work strategies and social relations</title>
<p>The relationship between socioeconomic change and collective adaptations is relevant to understanding the social and economic position of different class and ethnic groups in at least two ways: first, cultural responses may promote the social and economic inclusion of marginalised groups or, alternatively, they may exacerbate and intensify forms of exclusion; and, second, they may reveal the particular social and economic position of individuals and groups by highlighting the ways that their economic practices are ‘embedded’ in social exchanges and shared forms of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306396811425985">31</xref></sup> In Gypsy and Traveller communities, knowledge about work and economic opportunity is rooted in kin-based networks, through which individuals and groups acquire sets of skills and dispositions allowing them to pursue particular lines of action and formulate responses to external change. Thomas Acton, a leading campaigner for Gypsy and Traveller rights and an authority on Romani studies, has provided a useful typology of various adaptations employed by Gypsies and Travellers in the face of external change. He identifies four main strategies: first, those who are <italic>conservative</italic> minimise contact with the outside world and resist change in their lifestyle; second, he identifies <italic>cultural disintegration</italic>, whereby Gypsies become demoralised and impoverished, while corrosion of their economic base weakens resistance to wider social influences; third, others may <italic>culturally adapt</italic> and accept influences from the outside that might be advantageous, but as a supplement to, rather than a replacement of, their own culture; and, fourth, Acton highlights <italic>passing</italic>, whereby Gypsies may compete with the wider society on equal terms by concealing their identity.</p>
<p>A strong element of conservatism was apparent in the interviews we conducted, with a preference, particularly among boys, for family-based self-employment expressed across all study areas. The advantages of family employment were expressed in terms of the intergenerational and informal transmission of skills and working practices through learning a trade from fathers and/or other male family members, which also serves to maintain group solidarity and identity. Second came flexibility: the capacity to respond to opportunities and rapidly adjust to changes in labour demand through tapping into localised networks to employ kin and other community members as and when required: ‘I’ll ask on the site or the estate. I’d always give work to Travellers first, but I’ll pay anybody if they do a good day’s work’ (building contractor, south London).</p>
<p>For some, an adherence to family working practices can make it difficult to conceive of alternative occupations or voice aspirations outside the norm. A recent study conducted by one of the authors sought to identify barriers to Gypsies and Travellers entering training in health and social care occupations. Here the teachers interviewed voiced frustration at the traditional nature of many of the boys’ aspirations:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Even the most able boys, there is a sort of glass ceiling and they don’t see beyond manual trades.</p>
<p>Their aspirations need to be raised, helping them to break out of stereotypes of working – having a little job until they get married [girls] and getting a well-paid job, preferably self-employed, and supporting their families [boys].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306396811425985">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>The impact of housing on working patterns</title>
<p>The stigma associated with giving a prospective employer a Gypsy site as an address is not faced by those in housing and some find it easier to compete for work by ‘passing’ (concealing their identity). Several reported hiding their identity in order to gain employment in mainstream occupations. One lady, an estate agent, commented: ‘I sell them houses. They don’t know who I am. I’m just a nice lady who finds them a home.’ Due to their pariah social status, Gypsies and Travellers have, through long experience, become adept at ‘passing’ when economic necessity requires, as noted by one man in a focus group interview: ‘We can fit in with society quite easily. We do it daily. We walk in, do our work, then walk out and we go back home. And that’s how I look at it. That’s what we’re doing on a daily basis’ (male, south-east England).</p>
<p>For a traditionally nomadic people, the division between workplace and home is not distinct, as in settled society and, on sites, communal areas have also tended to function as working areas. For those in public and social housing (and on most local authority caravan sites), restrictions on what activities are permitted have curtailed practices such as scrapping, car breaking and breeding animals, which were previously all major sources of income. One woman, who entered housing after losing a planning appeal on her family’s privately owned site, explained how the move into housing resulted in the loss of her livelihood and subsequent unemployment: ‘I used to keep chickens and sell eggs. When we moved here they says, “you’re not allowed to keep chickens here”, so we’ve got none ’cos we can’t keep them, so I can’t make my own money any more’ (female, south-east England).</p>
<p>In other families, living on estates where there were high levels of racism and frequent conflict with neighbours, males were reluctant to leave their homes to follow previous lines of work that involved long periods of travelling: ‘We can’t leave this house empty for long and I won’t leave them [family] without me, ’cos all the grief we get here, and that means I can’t get about to get more work now’ (male, south-east England). Two-thirds of participants reported that their economic situation had deteriorated since moving into housing. For many, a combination of higher housing costs, fewer opportunities for casual work and restrictions on conducting work-related activities at home means that settlement has led to a decline in employment and a rise in welfare dependency and long-term unemployment. In a study of 158 Gypsy and Traveller households conducted by one of the authors, 44 per cent of housed males of working age were unemployed and 10 per cent economically inactive due to poor health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306396811425985">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>Economic exclusion, spatial concentration and structural change</title>
<p>In the creation of a black urban underclass in the US, W. J. Wilson identified two causal processes: social concentration (the increasing spatial concentration of poor urban blacks); and, social isolation (their lack of contact with the wider society).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306396811425985">34</xref></sup> Many of our interviewees were living on estates where Gypsies and Travellers constituted a significant minority group and where levels of deprivation and unemployment were high. Many community members had transferred onto the same estates to live close to relatives and extended families, and cohesive spatially bounded networks had evolved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306396811425985">35</xref></sup> Because of the often antagonistic nature of social relations with their non-Gypsy neighbours, there was, for many, little daily interaction outside of those networks:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t have many <italic>gorjer</italic> [non-Gypsy] friends round here, I prefer to mix with the other Travellers. (male, south-east England)</p>
<p>Usually we avoid each other mostly. They stick together, so do we, some are druggy scumbags and thieves, but a few are nice – not many though. (female, south-east England)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Social networks comprising high proportions of workless members and the inward-looking nature of social relationships intensify economic exclusion and reduce opportunities for finding work. Thus, conservatism and cultural disintegration are closely related and reinforce one another. Examples of substance abuse, imprisonment and depression featured prominently in the interviews. Similar trends have been identified among various indigenous and nomadic communities throughout the world who have also experienced rapid social and cultural change and are subject to widespread racism and prejudice from the dominant society:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306396811425985">36</xref></sup> ‘The older ones, no offence like, but they don’t have a job, they’re all on the dole and sit around all day and have kids and basically that’s it’ (female, south-west England).</p>
<p>Surveys reveal that more people (35 per cent) admit to feeling prejudiced towards Gypsies and Travellers than to any other group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306396811425985">37</xref></sup> The more the external world is perceived as hostile and threatening, the more people seek refuge from it and withdraw into their own community. Consequently, their needs are not articulated or met within mainstream society or public institutions. One man discussed the institutional racism that he felt was directed at members of his community by local government officials, social workers, police officers, teachers and other public agency employees: ‘What it does is make us withdraw even further, so, in the end, we don’t say nothing because we feel there’s no point saying it. Be quiet. Don’t upset anyone because they’ll treat us worse’ (male, south-east England).</p>
<p>Structural changes have had a far-reaching impact on the material foundations of Gypsy and Traveller culture. For those who may have earned an income through seasonal farm work, calling and other forms of casual work in the past, several changes have combined to reduce available opportunities. Most obvious is the demise of seasonal agricultural work as it has been replaced by machinery and, more recently, by migrant labour from Central and Eastern Europe, which has had a profound and generational impact on Gypsy and Traveller culture. The Traveller Economic Inclusion Project (TEIP) found that approximately 80 per cent of the ninety-five interviewees had parents who had undertaken farm work, compared to just over 1 per cent who still did this work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306396811425985">38</xref></sup> Of the housed interviewees in the four study areas, most of those aged over 35 had experience of farm work and recalled travelling with their families for such employment when younger. A strong sense of nostalgia for field work and a sense of sadness at its passing were apparent in many interviews. An unintended result of the decline in agricultural employment is the reduction of social contact with non-Gypsy labour now they no longer work together in the fields, resulting in greater social distance and a worsening of relations between the groups:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone used to be on farms, whether they be Traveller or <italic>gorjer</italic>, we were all on farms and we all worked together. But nowadays that’s not there, that’s gone. And because that’s gone, I think that is the reason attitudes towards us have got worse. (female, south-east England)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Work opportunities are also framed within a regulatory framework and, for a group whose working patterns have been characterised by flexibility and temporariness, the formalisation of casual work, which has advanced further in Britain than in other EU countries, has had a damaging impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306396811425985">39</xref></sup> Increasing bureaucracy, complex employment regulations, the requirement to provide National Insurance numbers and complete application forms for the most menial short-term work all create significant barriers to work for those accustomed to more informal working agreements, particularly when combined with poor literacy skills:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>They go home and show their families the forms and they say, you need your National Insurance number and you gotta fill out this form and that form and they go, ‘well, all I want to do is pick some fruit’ and that’s it. They don’t bother going back because half the time they can’t read the forms. (female, south-west England)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It has also been argued that crime reduction strategies, such as Neighbourhood Watch and restrictions on ‘cold calling’ introduced in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (2008), have led to the police and Trading Standards officers harassing Gypsies and Travellers who have long secured work through doorstep calling:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll be doing a bit of calling. Next thing you know, along comes the gavvers [police] because someone in their Neighbourhood Watch has seen a stranger knocking doors. Lift up the bonnet, take all me tools out, check all me numbers, check me motor all over … He’ll look for evidence, he’ll check for anything. Then two hours later he says, ‘Go on, get off. And make sure you don’t come back working in this area again’. (male, south-east England)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The TEIP project found that one-third of respondents voiced concern at these restrictions, regarding it as a direct attack on their traditional lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306396811425985">40</xref></sup> Another male pointed out that many remain unaware of the myriad of regulations and restrictions contained in legislation such as the 2008 Act until they fall foul of it:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because of the abolition of agriculture, we’ve had to diversify, so we’re going out knocking doors, but even that now, you can’t even knock a door. The boys are arrested and their vans impounded and they’re arrested for three days. What for? All they’re doing is looking for a living to provide for their family … but we’re caught up in a web and that’s what happens with these laws. We’re caught up in a web that we know nothing about.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rules that weaken trading networks and relations with the wider community can result in the increasing economic redundancy of many Gypsies and Travellers and are an important, but often overlooked, factor in the increasing social intolerance displayed towards this community. Mayall notes that, until the nineteenth century, Gypsies played an important function in the provision of merchandise and services for isolated rural populations and for the urban poor, arguing that: ‘such trading between travellers and members of settled society suggests a relationship of trust and respect rather than intolerance and abuse’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306396811425985">41</xref></sup> On the estates where the studies were conducted, however, there was a fair amount of trading and informal economic activity occurring between neighbours, this being one of the few areas where differences between Gypsies/Travellers and the largely economically redundant and/or inactive sections of the population who lived in close proximity to them could be transcended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306396811425985">42</xref></sup> One man, for example, commented that he didn’t socialise with non-Gypsies, ‘unless they have a good deal where we can all make some nice money’, while a female in the focus group interview observed that, ‘I don’t know many Travellers that mix outside their own community other than for work reasons’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0306396811425985">
<title>Settlement and economic adaptations</title>
<p>Economic decline was not the full story, however, with some interviewees successfully adapting elements of the traditional Traveller economy to new contexts. Those in regular work, and often with multiple sources of income, tended to have a wider and more diverse range of social contacts outside of their own community and were generally more confident in negotiating class and cultural boundaries when seeking work than those who were not working. It is ‘weak’ social ties, according to Granovetter, that are vital in harnessing economic opportunities and that ‘the fewer indirect contacts one has the more encapsulated he will be in terms of knowledge beyond his own friendship circle’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306396811425985">43</xref></sup> One 28-year-old builder, housed from the roadside three years previously, had expanded his construction firm since moving into housing by utilising local Gypsy and <italic>gorjer</italic> contacts for a steady supply of work and casual labour. He recalled that it had been easier to establish his firm with a stable address, commenting that: ‘the <italic>gorjers</italic> that work for me are okay really, we get on fine. If we didn’t, I’d have to sack them.’ A female care assistant displayed a more instrumental attitude towards her colleagues, but reported generally positive relations at work: ‘Some are racist arseholes, but most of them are good. They pay my wages and we work together, so we need to get on’ (female, south-east England).</p>
<p>While conservatism was associated with cultural disintegration, it also featured in strategies of adaptation, with those adjusting most successfully in economic terms often espousing the values of entrepreneurial, self-employed, family-based work: ‘We buy lost property at an auction and bankrupt stock. My husband sells the electrical and the new stuff on the [market] stall and I sell the bric-a-brac and old clothes at the boot fairs’ (female, south London). A few women had adapted the traditional nomadic merging of home and workspace and were engaged in home-based work, repairing and adjusting clothes or making bedding and curtains, with these micro-businesses relying largely on localised networks of information: ‘I sew all the old girls’ clothes for them. When anyone needs something fixing they bring it to me and I’ll do it’ (female, south-east England).</p>
<p>Attitudes towards education and qualifications also embrace and combine elements of cultural adaptation with conservatism. Most recognise the value of education in contemporary society instrumentally, insofar as it is useful for individual and group survival. Greenfield’s study highlighted the tension between working styles that valorise independence from wage labour and the limitations imposed by poor literacy skills and a lack of qualifications in an increasingly credential-based job market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306396811425985">44</xref></sup> These tensions have been mitigated in some families by encouraging young people to access post-school training that will benefit the wider family as a collective economic unit: ‘He is going to college to be a mechanic, then he will have the piece of paper even though he knows how to do it along of [taught by] his daddy’ (female, south-west England). As discussed, the relative anonymity of residence in housing has allowed some to enter jobs from which they would previously have been excluded, although these are still very much the minority. The majority are either not working or have adapted long-established working patterns, skills and orientations that are ‘permeable to the acceptance of precariousness and flexibility in the labour market making the daily construction of survival strategies possible’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306396811425985">45</xref></sup> In the words of one participant, ‘times have changed, but we haven’t. It’s just about turning a penny in a new way.’</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has attempted to highlight the combined impact of changing patterns of labour demand, the formalisation of previously flexible forms of work, the criminalisation of nomadism and policy-induced efforts to geographically settle nomadic communities on the working lives of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK. These external factors are mediated at the level of individual economic activity by culturally grounded collective responses, which also play an important role in shaping economic outcomes. Some families have successfully refashioned traditional economic traits of flexibility, diversity and family-based self-employment to the demands of postindustrial capitalism and a more sedentary existence. For many others, however, settlement on public caravan sites, which are often low quality and frequently the focus of local prejudice and police surveillance, or on equally stigmatised and deprived housing estates, has led to concentrations of Gypsies and Travellers that are largely unqualified, unskilled and with low or non-existent literacy levels. Despite the lack of systematic data (referred to at the beginning of the article), results from Gypsy Traveller Accommodation Assessments (GTAAs), as well as smaller-scale qualitative research such as the present comparative studies, indicate that rates of unemployment and economic inactivity are high, with many Gypsies and Travellers virtually unemployable in an increasingly formalised job market, where qualifications and a basic level of literacy and/or computer proficiency are required for most jobs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306396811425985">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a period of poor macroeconomic performance, welfare retrenchment and widespread financial uncertainty, it is low-paid and low-skilled workers who have been disproportionately affected by the events of recent years and for whom the future appears particularly bleak. Workers from ‘elementary trades’ account for 30 per cent of the unemployed, and their numbers grew by 58 per cent between 2008–2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306396811425985">47</xref></sup> With the recently announced demise of Connexions services and no increase in apprenticeships or opportunities for youth training and employment, the emergent Gypsy and Traveller generation is likely to experience even greater exclusion than their elders. It would appear self-evident that specific policy initiatives that target this minority are required to place them on a more equal footing with other members of the workforce. This appears unlikely under the current government, whose stance towards Gypsies and Travellers was revealed in Prime Minister David Cameron’s support for Basildon Council’s eviction of the Dale Farm site in Essex and the pledging of £1.2 million of central government funds towards the estimated £5 million eviction costs.</p>
<p>The scrapping of regional strategies for new sites, meanwhile, reflects the decentralisation agenda of the Localism Bill through placing more decision-making powers over site development in the hands of local councils, neighbourhoods and communities. Previous evidence on site applications and planning approvals suggests that, without central government directives, localism could give free rein to local expressions of prejudice and a rise in planning refusals and evictions, pushing more Gypsies and Travellers either onto the road or into housing and intensifying their social exclusion. This was indicated in a recent report to the House of Commons citing evidence from academics, community activists and various professionals working with the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306396811425985">48</xref></sup> The widespread support for localism across the political spectrum and the potential implications for Gypsies and Travellers also raise more fundamental questions about the social inclusion of BME groups, community cohesion and the extent to which localised decision-making can encompass increasing diversity at the local level. While supporters of localism claim that it gives a voice to the marginalised sections of society, who have become progressively disengaged from the top-down nature of the political process, evidence shows that devolving power to local communities often deepens and perpetuates social, economic and political inequalities. In a recent article, Phil Parvin highlights the growing polarisation in political engagement between manual and non-manual workers, on the one hand, and between deprived and affluent areas, on the other. It is the unskilled, low-paid and economically marginalised sections of all ethnic groups that display much lower levels of engagement, which means that their needs are not articulated or met within local decision-making bodies and that they have minimal influence over political decisions that affect their lives. Given the socioeconomic position of many BME groups, of which Gypsies and Travellers represent the most extreme example, localism could ‘merely replace one form of tyranny with another, by giving engaged, articulate, advantaged members of local communities the power to dominate and marginalise disengaged, disaffected disadvantaged members of that same local community’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306396811425985">49</xref></sup> increasing social divisions and reversing the limited gains that have been made in facilitating the social inclusion of minority groups over recent years.</p>

<comment>In both academic and policy debates, defining Gypsies and Travellers has proven notoriously difficult. Under the Race Relations Act (1976) and the Race Relations (Amendment) Act, Gypsies and Irish Travellers are recognised minority groups. Previously, nomadism was a key feature of legal definitions, but, more recently, with the settlement of many members of those communities, the focus has shifted to ‘persons with a cultural tradition of nomadism and/or caravan dwelling’ (Department for Communities and Local Government (2006), GTAA Draft Practice Guidance, p. 6). One authoritative report refers to ‘Gypsies’ as ethnic groups created through a diaspora of commercial, nomadic and other groups from India from the tenth century and their subsequent mixing with European and other groups. ‘Travellers’ refer to members of indigenous European ethnic groups whose culture is distinguished by self-employment, occupational fluidity and nomadism. The author points to a history of contact and mixing between the groups who share a common cultural base (J. P. Liegeois and N. Gheorge, <italic>Roma, Gypsies, Travellers</italic> (Strasbourg, Council of Europe, 2004))</comment>.</citation>
