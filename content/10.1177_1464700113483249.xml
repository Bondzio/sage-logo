<abstract>
<p>Beauty is constantly lived and incorporated as a meaningful social category in Brazil and intersects with racialised and gendered ways of belonging to the Brazilian nation. In this article, I deploy ethnographic material to show how middle-class women self-identifying as black embody and experience beauty and how, through practices and discourses centred on physical appearance, they both reinforce and challenge broader social and racial inequalities in Brazil.</p>

<body>
<p>In the early morning traffic in the coastal city of Salvador, Brazil, women emerge from buses and cars looking feminine and fresh, smelling of perfume and wearing clothes that reveal a glimpse of the bikini lines of a weekend spent sun-tanning at the beach. Gyms exist on almost every corner of the city, offering a wide variety of exercise and nutrition regimes for toning the bodies of women and men. Beauty and physical appearance are matters of daily concern for Brazilians from a range of backgrounds, many of whom spend considerable amounts of time and money caring for their hair, skin and nails.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464700113483249">3</xref></sup> In this article, I argue that practices centred on styling and managing the body have particular connotations for black middle-class women.</p>
<p>This article is part of a larger ethnographic project that explored strategies of social mobility and identity formation among emerging elites self-identifying as black in Salvador. Concerns to do with ‘race’, beauty and physical appearance emerged as central themes, especially in the everyday lives of women living and working in upscale areas of the city. In the social stratum in which I moved, practices and discourses surrounding beauty and body presentation were particularly significant and underscored deeper, politicised issues about ‘race’, visibility, social mobility and citizenship in contemporary Brazil. These struggles are racialised and gendered in ways that position the black female body as particularly problematic.</p>
<p>Recent economic growth combined with a fairly successful social democratic programme has fuelled the expansion of the middle class in Brazil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464700113483249">4</xref></sup> Some authors suggest that previously marginalised African descendant populations are increasingly participating in middle-income occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464700113483249">Burdick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483249">Figueiredo, 2003</xref>). However, an ‘elitist profile’ of racial discrimination exists which might particularly affect women. For example, Peggy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483249">Lovell (1999: 150)</xref> has argued that black women who rise to the top of the occupational hierarchy often experience heightened inequalities and discrimination. This suggests that the sites and types of discrimination, as well as the kinds of responses to them, may differ between black lower- and middle-class women. Thus the question arises: does the use of techniques to modify the body by black middle-class women work as a way to widen (or diminish) the gap between women from different classes/skin colours? Coming from a relatively more powerful socio-economic position, do black middle-class women play a potentially significant role in establishing and perpetuating, or even challenging Brazilian social hierarchies?</p>
<p>Feminist theories have long contributed to approaches to beauty within the social sciences. However, beauty’s meaning in women’s lives continues to be a problem. On the one hand, feminists have argued that beauty ideals and practices reflect patriarchal domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483249">Bordo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464700113483249">Wolf, 1991</xref>). These analyses stress slightly different arguments but seem to coalesce on the point that beauty practices act as a means of social control over the female body. On the other hand, beauty is also seen as a potentially pleasurable instrument of female agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483249">Cahill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483249">Gimlin, 2002</xref>). These writers emphasise women’s subjective experiences of beauty and how they might derive personal satisfaction from body work. This view of beauty as a tool of female agency has proved illuminating for my work. Beauty practices and discourses represent an important means through which respondents could have a constructive impact on their everyday experiences, defining a space for individual action and for circumventing traditional inequalities.</p>
<p>Focusing on the ‘pragmatics’ of beauty – ‘how is beauty defined, deployed, defended, subordinated, marketed or manipulated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483249">Colebrook, 2006</xref>: 132) – is a particularly useful approach for examining beauty in Brazil. The racialised production of social difference in the region has historically hinged on specific notions about physical appearance. What might this contribute to feminist theorising more generally? Firstly, it underscores how beauty needs to be analysed as emerging out of particular contexts, thereby challenging analyses based on an implicit Euro-American reading of the subject. Secondly, this article builds on the move in feminist theory to address beauty as an empirical question, rooted in the practical experiences emerging out of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483249">Coleman and Moreno Figueroa, 2010</xref>). To introduce the readers to the ethnographic material used for this analysis, I will briefly sketch out the context in which this research took place.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1464700113483249"><title>Fieldwork in Salvador, Brazil</title>
<p>This article draws on sixteen months of ethnographic research focusing on seven families and their social networks, carried out in Salvador from 2005 to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464700113483249">Gordon, 2009</xref>). The capital of the north-eastern state of Bahia, Salvador is the third largest Brazilian city with 2,675,656 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464700113483249">IBGE, 2010</xref>). Referred to as the ‘Black Rome of Brazil’, Salvador has long been associated with a strong black identity and culture, due to its history as one of the New World’s most important slave and commercial ports. In recent decades, this representation of the city has taken on magnified proportions with the growth of tourism and black cultural organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483249">Dos Santos, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While Salvador appears more favourable than most places in the country towards African descendants, social inequalities have long been described as extreme and entrenched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464700113483249">McCallum, 2005</xref>). The majority of the population are both poor and visibly darker skinned, while economic power resides in the hands of a Euro-Brazilian elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483249">Figueiredo, 2003</xref>). Therefore, blackness can be experienced as ambiguous. Empowering symbols of beauty and female vanity rooted in notions of blackness are evident in popular religious festivals celebrated throughout the year. There are instances (today and in the past) of powerful, black female religious leaders and personalities who exercise much social influence and stand out as icons of beauty in Salvador. However, black female bodies are increasingly commoditised in the city’s growing tourism, entertainment and sex industries which capitalise on Salvador’s image as the most ‘African’ city of Brazil. Images of black women appear in advertisements, pamphlets and tourist brochures all over the city – for example, as traditional <italic>Baianas</italic> (women who sell <italic>acarajé</italic>, a typical street food); as spiritual leaders of <italic>candomblé</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464700113483249">5</xref></sup> and as dancers and singers. These images were sometimes problematic for research participants who felt that alternative images of successful and educated black Brazilians contributing to national development were few and far between.</p>
<p>On arrival in Salvador, I stayed with friends and moved along their social networks until I met the families and individuals involved in this research. My Jamaican nationality aroused some attention, as Jamaica is celebrated as a primary symbol of black pride and resistance, associated with reggae music and the Rastafarian religion. My Jamaican social milieu is one in which there is strong debate around issues of ‘race’, identity and slavery. This discourse is not absent in Salvador. However, in a rapidly changing society, class and ‘race’ are frequently unstable identities, even though they are often implicated in social relationships. A flexible methodology was required. I lived in different neighbourhoods and interviewed people of different generation, gender and background, leading to a more complex picture of social stratification. Adopting a Weberian approach, I incorporated both subjective and objective measures of ‘class’. The Brazilian economist Marcelo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464700113483249">Neri (2008)</xref> identified five social class categories in Brazil, ranging from A to E. Class C is the category that is said to be growing rapidly in contemporary Brazil, with an average household income per month of between US$136.42 to US$596.30. Research participants earned a salary corresponding with Class C and higher.</p>
<p>The national census collects data on the racial composition of the population according to five categories: <italic>branco</italic> (white); <italic>pardo</italic> (brown or mixed race); <italic>preto</italic> (black); <italic>amarelo</italic> (Asian); and <italic>indígena</italic> (indigenous). However, classic studies on race relations have emphasised that Brazilians classify themselves into a range of flexible groupings along a spectrum of colour and other phenotypic attributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464700113483249">Harris, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464700113483249">Sanjek, 1971</xref>). This falls in line with long-standing ideologies of racial democracy, although these discourses are tempered in a city like Salvador that is so powerfully associated with blackness. Furthermore, recent shifts in racial politics reveal an increased tendency to identify with blackness, especially among the youth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464700113483249">6</xref></sup> Research participants self-identified and/or were identified by others as black and middle class.</p>
<p>I collected thirty-five life histories and fifteen semi-structured interviews, in addition to participating in respondents’ lives – such as attending birthdays, baptisms, weddings and holiday vacations as well as socialising in malls, bars, restaurants, theatres and religious institutions. In order to illustrate the importance of physical appearance in respondents’ everyday lives, I would like to introduce the Teixeira family, whose members participated in this research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464700113483249">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464700113483249"><title>Keeping up appearances</title>
<p>On a breezy afternoon in November 2006, I stood in the foyer of the Teatro Castro Alves, a historically important theatre located in the busy transport hub of Campo Grande in the city centre. The theatregoers chatted while drinking cups of coffee or nibbling on delicious <italic>coxinhas</italic> – a fried, savoury delicacy usually served at parties. The women in particular were dressed in their finest evening wear, with slim bodies and salon-straightened hair.</p>
<p>When members of the Teixeira family walked into the foyer, they represented some of the fewer darker-skinned faces in the crowd but they did not look out of place. Indeed, they were described by their friends as a particularly stylish, sophisticated and educated family. On this afternoon, they were dressed elegantly, makeup carefully applied, a hint of perfume, smart handbags, high-heeled shoes and expensive sunglasses perched on top of their well-coiffed hair. In a country obsessed with svelte and sensual bodies, they blended easily into the crowd, exuding confidence, style and glamour. Eventually, Juliana, the matriarch of the family, introduced me to a tall man standing beside her, ‘This is Alberto, the plastic surgeon who totally reformed my breasts and stomach after my divorce. His hands are like magic, he is a great artist. I am very happy with my results’. Alberto smiled and lifted his cup of coffee to hers.</p>
<p>I noticed that one of the more distinctive things about the Teixeiras was the manner in which they presented themselves and managed their bodies – their dress, physical appearance, body language and speech. In subsequent conversations, Juliana stated that she never left her house without her hair being well-groomed (meaning, chemically straightened and dyed black), her skin looking good, and her clothes fashionable. I was first introduced to Juliana’s three daughters, all in their thirties, at the party of a Brazilian friend who explained to me that, ‘They are different from the common person here in Salvador. You can tell because they are <italic>bem educado</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1464700113483249">8</xref></sup> Look at how beautiful they are!’</p>
<p>According to Juliana, the Teixeira family is descended from an original union between a slave woman from Africa and the son of a wealthy Dutch sugar plantation owner. This man subsequently married a white woman but all of the children from the former union were well taken care of. The Teixeira family maintained a relatively privileged position for generations, living in grand houses with many servants. Juliana acknowledged that they no longer have this lifestyle and have had to downscale in the current economic environment. But none have become poor. Indeed it could be said that they have reformulated their status over time. For example, they moved from a larger, more elegant house to a smaller and more affordable apartment – but located in a fashionable part of the city. By selective consumption of particular items of cultural value and by qualitative social networking, the Teixeiras manage to negotiate their status in the middle classes.</p>
<p>Juliana stated that in the past, family members preferred to refer to themselves as <italic>mulato(a) claro(a)</italic> (light skinned). She remembered that as a child, she sometimes heard relatives make disparaging remarks about the physical features and moral traits of darker-skinned persons. These racialised discourses surrounding appearance and the valuation of particular, physical traits possibly indicate strategies among persons of colour to distance themselves as much as possible from the negative valuation of blackness and racial discrimination. Some generations later, the growth of an increasingly vocal black movement – as well as the adoption of legislation against racism and policies directed at reducing racial inequality – have led to a more positive valuation of blackness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483249">Sansone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464700113483249">Telles, 2004</xref>). The younger generation of the Teixeira family claim a more politicised, black identity – symbolised by their use of the Brazilian Portuguese term <italic>negro</italic> – while challenging others in their family to take on this identity. For example, they criticised their mother’s brother, Bruno, for describing himself as <italic>Brasileiro</italic> (Brazilian), which is a way of stating his claim to a mixed race identity, in line with dominant national discourses prevalent amongst his generation. Younger people, however, would be more familiar with an international, multicultural discourse of ‘race’, especially since the UN Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the subsequent implementation of multicultural policies into the constitutions of many Latin American nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464700113483249">Kymlicka, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike her brother, Juliana identified as <italic>negra</italic> and indicated that racial prejudice persists, illustrating her point by referring to the discriminatory way that lighter-skinned shop owners treat her when she enters their expensive stores to shop. Yet she emphasised the family’s indigenous heritage when explaining the frequent comments made by others about their ‘good looks’. She made reference to the high cheek bones, petite frame and ‘finer’ hair that many women in the Teixeira family possessed, associated with an indigenous rather than an African background. Here, a statement is being made about culturally preferred physical features, in which the lowest rank is assigned to an appearance associated with an African heritage – such as tightly-curled, kinky hair. A darker-skinned person might therefore distance themselves from unflattering associations with blackness, claiming an indigenous heritage instead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1464700113483249">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, it was not uncommon for contradictory discourses about ‘race’ to exist within the same context – an identification with blackness and a distancing from the more stigmatising meanings of blackness, which largely have to do with notions about physical appearance. More specifically, certain racialised characteristics historically were (and still are) stigmatised, highlighting special issues for upwardly mobile black Brazilians. For example, full lips and wide noses are specifically associated with African physical features and are generally assigned a low aesthetic value.</p>
<p>As a person climbs the social ladder, one is expected to transform one’s physical appearance into socially acceptable, upper middle-class ideals that emphasise the submersion of ‘African’ characteristics. Blackness and poverty are gendered in particular ways, underscored by the predominance of darker-skinned women in low paid and low status jobs such as domestic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464700113483249">Lima, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483249">Lovell, 1999</xref>). This association hyper-emphasises the desire of black women in higher social positions to distinguish themselves from the blackness symbolically associated with poverty.</p>
<p>While members of the Teixeira family identified with being black, their everyday practices also indicated a desire to distance themselves from the masses. Note that the masses are symbolically associated with blackness, even though persons of a range of skin colours might be implicated. This is because moving up the social ladder associates a person with symbolic whiteness, while moving down the social ladder associates a person with symbolic blackness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464700113483249">McCallum, 2005</xref>). Itaparica, off the coast of Salvador and once the island getaway for the lighter-skinned elite, is now a popular destination for the middle class. The Teixeiras own a holiday beach house where they often go with friends and family. However, they were becoming increasingly alarmed at the gradual invasion of a set of young people. Disapproving of what they regarded as loud and vulgar behaviour as well as the taste of many of the women for blonde hair extensions, one of their friends exclaimed, ‘<italic>Aqui é muito misturado</italic>’ (It is very mixed here) – meant as a reference to the crowd’s lower-class status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1464700113483249">10</xref></sup> Here, the conflict between a more traditional and established middle class (the Teixeiras) and an upcoming class of uncertain status and values seemed clear. On any excursion to the beach, dressing appropriately became an act of distinction – stylish hairstyles and sunglasses, expensive bikinis, beach wraps tied securely around the waist, beautifully decorated slippers and bags – as did conducting oneself like a ‘respectable’ lady on the beach (for example, avoiding excessive drinking and dancing). That beauty practices might be deployed to stress/erase differences seems obvious enough – but for respondents this had particular, racialised meanings – it could be used to distinguish their blackness from the blackness associated with poverty.</p>
<p>Studies on the black middle classes in the United States, although not straightforwardly comparable, offer some relevant insights. Authors have pointed to their heterogeneous nature, where people adhered to different constellations of values, perspectives and lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483249">DuBois, 1899</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483249">1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464700113483249">Pattillo-McCoy, 1999</xref>). They have also analysed the relationship between middle-class and lower middle-class blacks. Issues surrounding black upward mobility were often described as being highly contentious, frequently involving delicate negotiations, practices of differentiation and solidarity, and possible accusations of abandoning their poorer relatives and of taking on the values and lifestyles associated with whites. The complex issues of black social mobility are not entirely different in Brazil. Self-styling and consumption practices centred on the body were important ways for respondents to negotiate these conditions. In Juliana’s case above, an ability to have plastic surgery signalled to others her economic power, thus ensuring ‘visibility’ in the public sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1464700113483249">11</xref></sup> In a study of black youth culture in Salvador, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483249">Sansone (2003: 92)</xref> suggests that, ‘consumption has been turned into an instrument to gain civil rights (<italic>cidadania</italic>) and consuming (conspicuously) makes one feel like a <italic>cidadão</italic> (citizen)’. Strong notions of national belonging and citizenship are expressed through an ability to consume and participate in an ideal of Brazilian modernity that has particular resonance for upwardly mobile black Brazilians, given their previously marginalised status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1464700113483249"><title>The aesthetics of ‘race’ in Brazil</title>
<p>Although an uncomfortable topic, the ‘aesthetics of race’ has been central to ideas about social difference in Brazil, as was recognised in the 1980s by the social scientist Oracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483249">Nogueira (1985)</xref> when he argued that Brazil was characterised by <italic>preconceito de marca</italic> (racial prejudice based on physical appearance) as opposed to <italic>preconceito de origem</italic> (racial prejudice based on descent). Bahian descriptive terms reflect fine distinctions in appearance. For example, <italic>branco da terra</italic> or <italic>branco da Bahia</italic> (Bahian white) refers to someone who could be classified as ‘white’, but is perceived to have ‘indigenous’ or ‘African’ physical features. <italic>Cabo verde</italic> refers to a person who is lighter skinned than someone who would be called <italic>preto</italic> (someone with very dark skin), with features considered to be <italic>fino</italic> (fine), such as thin lips, straight hair and a narrow nose. Another example is <italic>sarará</italic>, referring to someone with light skin, freckles and kinky or very curly hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464700113483249">Hutchinson, 1952</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>In this folk taxonomy of colour, terms referring to darker skin colour have traditionally been negatively valued. So, for example, a person described as <italic>sarará</italic> is someone who has not escaped the imprint of ‘African’ features, evidenced by the texture of the hair and/or the shape of the lips and mouth. These terms have been the target of a growing black movement in Brazil since the country’s democratic opening in the 1980s, where previously stigmatised terms are invested with positive meaning, as in the tune composed by Macau for the popular soul singer Sandra de Sá in 1994, called <italic>Olhos Coloridos</italic> (Coloured Eyes). In this song, the singer expressed pride in her physical features, such as her darker skin colour and curly hair.</p>
<p>Brazil’s preoccupation with ‘race’ can be traced back to colonial times, when the country’s racial mixture was seen as a problem for national development. Ideas of biological racism, emanating from Europe and prominent in Brazil up until the early twentieth century, condemned racial mixture as the cause of ‘degeneration’ in the country. Arthur de Gobineau, who spent fifteen months in Brazil as France’s envoy, commented that, ‘We are dealing with a totally mulatto population, corrupt of flesh, and frightfully ugly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464700113483249">Schwarcz, 1993</xref>: 5). These ideologies had various strands, but converged on the idea of European superiority and beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483249">Jarrín, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464700113483249">Wade, 1997</xref>). In response, Brazilian elites established an ideological differentiation between the civilised and superior part of the population, identified as white, and the inferior and non-civilised portion of the population, identified as indigenous peoples, blacks and <italic>mestizos</italic> (those of mixed race) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464700113483249">Skidmore, 1999</xref>: 67–73). For those who believed that it was impossible to achieve a civilised state with a predominantly mixed-race population, the solution presented itself in the promotion of European immigration schemes. The aim was to ‘whiten’ the population, thereby marking the evolution of Brazil into a modern, industrialised nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464700113483249">Skidmore, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the phenotypic reality of the population was far from a white ideal. The tactic turned to finding a positive meaning in racial mixture. Beginning around the 1930s, national elites systematically sought to portray to the world a modern Brazil that had avoided the racial tensions present in other societies such as the United States. Thus Amerindian, European and African ‘races’ and cultures were portrayed as mixing harmoniously in the formation of the Brazilian nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483249">Freyre, [1946] 1964</xref>). Today, the image of Brazil as a ‘racial democracy’ remains powerful among Brazilians and foreigners alike, despite documented evidence of the existence of racial inequality and discrimination in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464700113483249">Reichmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464700113483249">Twine, 1998</xref>). In particular, the icon of the sensual <italic>morena</italic> (mixed race woman) came to represent this national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464700113483249">Freyre, 1984</xref>). For example, the meteoric rise of Brazilian celebrity Andressa Soares in recent years, whose stage name is Mulher Melancia (Watermelon Woman), epitomises this national obsession with the mixed-race woman. A dancer, singer and model known for her unique style of dance, Mulher Melancia seems to possess the desirable traits of the <italic>morena</italic>: tanned skin; long, flowing hair; large, rounded bottom; and ability to dance in an erotic manner. This presents an alternative scenario for feminist theory. While studies on the relationship between ‘race’ and beauty exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483249">Banet-Weiser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483249">Banks, 2000</xref>), feminist writers have tended to emphasise the dominance of Euro-American beauty standards that reinforce the desirability of fair skin, small noses and lips, and long hair. While this discourse is not absent in Brazil, a cultural logic of ‘race’ exists that celebrates mixture and eroticises brownness.</p>
<p>The social value of whiteness, however, coexists with this national discourse of race mixture and is related to historically important strategies of social mobility. In the past, upwardly mobile black Brazilians were expected to ‘whiten’ as they moved up the social ladder – that is, they acquired the education, wealth and lifestyles associated with the lighter-skinned elite, or married into their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483249">De Azevedo, [1953] 1996</xref>). Such persons were associated symbolically with whiteness – not only by virtue of adopting the above strategies, but also because they circulated within the physical spaces of the privileged classes. It has been argued that it was easier for lighter skinned persons to move up the social ladder than darker-skinned persons – a theory called the ‘mulatto escape hatch’. Such persons were held to distance themselves as much as possible from blackness and the communities of their origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483249">Degler, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>This discourse of whitening could be traced as a presence in respondents’ family life. For example, Maria was adopted into a modest, land-owning family. Her first marriage was to a man she described as <italic>branco</italic> (white), with whom she had a daughter. Today she is re-married to a man she described as <italic>negro</italic> (black). However, in informal family gatherings, she rarely referred to her sons resulting from the second marriage. Maria talked mostly about her daughter – who is lighter skinned with blonde hair. She indicated that her daughter was beautiful and would <italic>fazer sucesso</italic> (make a success of herself). Here she makes a link between her daughter’s socially acceptable physical appearance and her potentially successful mobility in the future, underscoring the gendered character of upward mobility.</p>
<p>The old colour hierarchies illustrated above reappear in Salvador’s contemporary, highly competitive work market, in the hyper-emphasis on <italic>boa aparência</italic> (good appearance). Traditionally, <italic>boa aparência</italic> meant having lighter skin combined with certain signs of a higher social class position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1464700113483249">12</xref></sup> This concept has particular meanings for female employees in the modern service and financial sectors that have blossomed to cater to Salvador’s up and coming middle class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483249">Edmonds, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464700113483249">Telles, 2004</xref>). Employees have to reflect an image of modernity, cosmopolitanism and glamour associated with city centre lifestyles. Varying in shade from dark brown to light, shop assistants, cashiers and salespersons are mostly slim, smooth skinned and young with straight or long hair.</p>
<p>In tension with discourses on whitening/modernity and racial mixture is a more multicultural one of ‘race’ that promotes blackness as a source of pride. Since the 1970s, black feminists have brought attention to issues of black women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as sexual, racial and domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464700113483249">Caldwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483249">Dos Santos, 2008</xref>). Black women’s organisations (largely composed of middle-class women) are involved in efforts to build self-esteem among black women through workshops, self-help groups and community outreach. Workshops on hair-braiding underscore efforts to challenge dominant prejudices regarding the hair texture of black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464700113483249">Caldwell, 2007</xref>: 159). These efforts have had varying effects. The popularity of blonde hair extensions among women who are the target of these efforts underscores the need to evaluate more closely conditions of power in the lives of lower- versus middle-class women.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the increased promotion of beauty practices that express pride in blackness has challenged hegemonic models present in Brazilian society that have tended to highlight lighter skin colour and hair. An expanding black beauty industry (occurring in Brazil and elsewhere) seems to have arisen to address this need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483249">Dos Santos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464700113483249">Gomes, 2006</xref>). The contemporary concept of <italic>beleza black</italic> (black beauty) – which derives from African American civil rights struggles during the 1960s – is associated with these black movement discourses. It also reflects links between the black movement in Brazil and a more broad-based pan-African movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483249">Sansone, 2003</xref>). Cultural organisations in the city emphasise blackness as a source of pride and beauty as their members march through the streets in African-style fashion featuring bold prints and colours, their hair in braids and decorated with bright beads.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464700113483249"><title>Hair</title>
<p>Hair texture is regarded as one of the most important, visible signs of the social-aesthetic power of a woman and is related to culturally meaningful symbols of femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464700113483249">Machado-Borges, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483249">Malysse, 2002</xref>). Long, wavy hair or salon straightened hair – associated with a ‘European’ appearance – is generally preferred. Meanwhile, tightly-curled, kinky hair – associated with an ‘African’ heritage and defined as socially ugly and unfeminine – is often referred to as <italic>cabelo ruim</italic> (bad hair), <italic>cabelo duro</italic> (hard hair), or <italic>cabelo feio</italic> (ugly hair). Indeed, it was not long ago when, in July 1996, an album was released that included a song ‘<italic>Veja os cabelos dela</italic>’ by Tiririca, a Brazilian singer, comedian and politician.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1464700113483249">13</xref></sup> While popularly regarded as playful and humorous, the song included a number of negative stereotypes about black women, highlighting the gendered dimensions of racism. The song refers to a woman who initially captures the singer's attention, but whose hair he finds undesirable, likening it to a scouring pad used to clean pots and pans. His description of her also makes reference to her smell and skin colour, such as:</p>
<p>The song associates black bodies with ugliness and stench – and in particular, stigmatises the texture of black women’s hair. The lyrics created an outcry amongst black activists and resulted in both Tiririca and his recording label, Sony Music, being sued for racism. However, the song was not seen as offensive by most Brazilians, but rather as a <italic>brincadeira</italic> (joke). Indeed, Brazilian discourses of ‘race’ have frequently used humour in order to transmit racist stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464700113483249">Goldstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483249">Sheriff, 2001</xref>). Popular acceptance of racist humour in Brazil indicates that joking often provides a culturally sanctioned means of articulating ideas that reproduce dominant notions of white superiority and black inferiority.</p>
<p>Such negative valorisations of black bodies have contributed to an ongoing stigma and sense of low self-esteem among black youth, though people seldom accept these notions without resisting or defying their meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464700113483249">Pinho, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, the idea of at least ‘taming’ the black characteristics of the body took on added significance for the upwardly mobile. Straightening the hair (through hairstyling or by the application of chemicals) was one such beauty practice that could modify appearance. The link between straight hair and a kind of raced and classed femininity (closely associated with a ‘European’ appearance) was enacted by participants' beauty practices but not explicitly stated. One of the more popular hair techniques was the <italic>alisamento Japônes</italic> (Japanese straightening), where hair is blow dried until it supposedly looks like the shiny hair of Japanese women. Other practices involved the application of creams and gels to the hair so that it came out long and wavy – in keeping with feminine ideals of beauty.</p>
<p>However, the politics of ‘race’ in Brazil has led to moral arguments that those with straightened hair want to cultivate a ‘European’ appearance and are therefore suffering from low self-esteem and a mutilated black consciousness. Some black activists insist that aesthetic affirmation is necessary to overcome internalised racism. Yet participants asserted their right to style themselves in whatever way they felt like without being judged for it. Research participants might reject, or experiment with, practices that emphasise an ‘African’ aesthetic – such as styling the hair in braids or dreadlocks. They stress that they have the right to choose how they want to look. From a post-feminist perspective, these participants might be seen to be adopting de-politicised stances towards social inequalities in their country. In <italic>The Aftermath of Feminism</italic>, Angela <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464700113483249">McRobbie (2009)</xref> argues that consumer culture in contemporary society offers the illusion of ‘freedom of choice’ when in reality, new forms of power are enacted that re-establish patriarchal hegemony and the cultural dominance of whiteness. However, elements of creative play involved in participants' beauty work are neglected in this perspective. Applying blonde highlights or implanting long hair weaves are also ways of inverting dominant beauty standards. In other words, some participants resisted their positioning by others to a certain racial category or appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483249">Malysse, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Hair was clearly a very delicate subject for participants who lived, worked or went to school in areas associated with whiteness. Clara, the owner of a vegetarian restaurant, recounted that learning to care for her daughter’s hair was one of the most important identity-forming experiences of her life. Clara had always identified with being <italic>morena</italic>, due to her unusual green-brown eyes, wavy brown hair and golden coloured skin. Her daughter is darker skinned, the product of a first marriage. After this marriage ended, Clara moved to one of the newer neighbourhoods in Salvador to establish her current business. She encountered problems with her daughter’s self-esteem as she was one of the few darker-skinned pupils at the prestigious school she attended. Her daughter went through painful experiences that in large part had to do with the texture of her hair. She was ridiculed, teased and made to feel unattractive by her peers. Concerned about her daughter’s confidence, Clara tried to find ways of taking care of her hair, showing her daughter different hairstyles she could try, makeup that would complement her dark skin, fashion styles she could experiment with, all the while telling her that she was beautiful just the way she was. Today, Clara’s daughter is a successful model in São Paulo, appearing in fashion events and commercials advertising credit cards and mobile phones. It is questionable whether she would have had this kind of success in Salvador, even though it is the city most associated with a celebration of blackness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1464700113483249">14</xref></sup> Clara's struggles with her daughter's racial identity led to Clara's strong identification as <italic>negra</italic> (black), despite the protests of close friends and family, for whom she was <italic>morena</italic> (brown/mixed race).</p>
<p>The idea of unstraightened hair has gained currency among some participants, especially with the increased availability of hair care products now on the market. Furthermore, in Salvador, blackness is perceived as a ‘cool’, mobile resource: lighter-skinned people are seen wearing ‘<italic>100% negro</italic>’ T-shirts or adopting the hairstyles associated with an ‘African’ aesthetic. These include hairstyles such as the afro, braids and dreadlocks, which signify the embrace of an alternative ideological code of value. Some professional women – like educators, doctors and lawyers – wore their hair in this way. However, it should be noted that women in a more powerful, socio-economic position perhaps have more options to challenge the racial status quo than women in low income communities whose options for social mobility are more constrained.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1464700113483249" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Beauty and a preoccupation with physical appearance have long been associated with mass culture, femininity, frivolity and imposed consumption in academic debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464700113483249">Machado-Borges, 2009</xref>: 208). The potentialities of beauty as a tool of social change have received less attention in the literature on race relations in comparison with more radical processes, for example, studies of social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464700113483249">Burdick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483249">Hanchard, 1994</xref>). Yet the material in this article underscores the ways in which respondents engage with Brazilian social hierarchies in potentially revolutionary ways. However, the contradictory position of black middle-class women – as representing both a marginalised and an economically better off stratum of the population – poses some complex issues for interpretation. Notions of femininity in particular are tied to traditional ideas that privilege a ‘European’ appearance. However, recent shifts in racial thinking in Brazil have made it less problematic to identify with blackness. Alternative notions of beauty emanating from the West – such as the African-American concept of ‘black beauty’ – have mixed with local black movement discourses to produce a more positive valorisation of blackness. Some respondents embraced these discourses, while others resisted being classified as belonging to any particular racial category when it came to their beauty practices. They asserted the right to choose from a variety of options, which is suggestive of the need to further examine the impact of rising consumer culture and neo-liberalism on local subjectivities. Writers who analyse the contemporary dynamics of post-feminism such as McRobbie (2009) suggest that consumer culture appeals to ideas about female success and choice while it in fact reinforces traditional power dynamics and ties women into new, neurotic tendencies (such as eating disorders). In the case of research participants, consumption through the body (fashions, diets) and consumption around the body (beauty treatments, surgery) represent symbolic and material ways of positioning themselves within contemporary Brazilian society – thus becoming `visible' and therefore a citizen like any other, lighter-skinned Brazilian.
