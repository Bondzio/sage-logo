<p><bold>Level of Evidence:</bold> Level V, case report, expert opinion.</p>
<p>Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP) is a rare condition first defined by Nora et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712469336">4</xref></sup> in 1983. The lesion is characterized by the exophytic outgrowth from a cortical surface consisting of bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue, although its pathophysiological features are yet to be fully defined. It classically affects the phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals, with a 4:1 predominance for the hand, and most commonly occurs in patients in their 20s and 30s. The average age in a case series published by Abramovici and Steiner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712469336">1</xref></sup> was 30.3 years. The lesion has shown an unenviable propensity for recurrence, with recurrence rates reported by Meneses et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712469336">3</xref></sup> as high as 55%. Because of its rare presentation, a BPOP lesion can easily go unrecognized and therefore be inappropriately managed. BPOP is an uncommon lesion; Joseph et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712469336">2</xref></sup> reported only 13 cases over a 26-year period on the Scottish Bone Tumour Registry. BPOP is frequently initially managed as an exostosis, which is more common, representing almost 5% of all bone tumors. A subungual exostosis is typically a benign acquired tumor of cartilaginous bone occurring on the medial surface of the distal hallux. It begins as a reactive growth of cellular fibrous tissue and metaplastic cartilage that undergoes enchondral ossification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712469336">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 10-year-old boy first attended the outpatient clinic in June 2010 with increasing discomfort and swelling on the medial aspect of the distal phalanx of his right great toe. It was associated with some nail bed growth disturbance and was slowly increasing in size; there was no history of trauma. The clinical and radiological features were consistent with a subungual exostosis, and it was excised in June 2010 without complication.</p>
<p>The patient returned in August 2010 with further swelling. Clinically and radiologically there was complete recurrence of the exostosis. Revision surgery was performed in September 2010 and included excision of the base of the lesion with a burr in an attempt to ensure complete excision. Biopsy showed unremarkable trabecular bone with distinct cartilage with adjacent reactive bone and proliferating spindle cells. The conformation was consistent with a subungual exostosis, but the possibility of a florid mesenchymal lesion such as a BPOP was raised. At 3 months post surgery, there were no signs of recurrence and the patient was discharged.</p>
<p>The patient returned in August 2011 with a second recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712469336">Figure 1</xref>). He underwent an en bloc excision with nail bed reconstruction, and at 12 months there are no signs of recurrence and he has been discharged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712469336">Figure 2</xref>). Histopathological examination demonstrated proliferating bone with increased osteoblast activity. Below the bone there was cellular mesenchyme consistent with recurrent Nora’s lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712469336">Figure 3</xref>). There were clear bony margins, which showed no evidence of BPOP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fewer than 180 cases of BPOP have been reported in the literature to date. This case is unique in view of the clinical and radiological presentation as a subungual exostosis and particularly in someone of such a young age. BPOP represents a surgical dilemma on 2 levels: first the diagnosis and second the surgical management. Rybak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712469336">5</xref></sup> reported that BPOP cannot be reliably diagnosed by radiological features alone. Also, although BPOP has a characteristic histological appearance, it may be confused with several benign or malignant conditions such as parosteal osteosarcoma, osteochondroma, or periostitis ossificans. Nora’s lesion has recently been reported to have an association with a specific translocation t(1:17)(q32;q21), and this may help with the diagnosis in the future.</p>
<p>For symptomatic lesions, the first line of management is likely to be intralesional excision because at first surgery there will be no previous histopathological result. The problem arises after first recurrence; the next surgical intervention should be an en bloc negative margin excision including the pseudocapsule, periosteal tissue beneath the lesion, and decortication of abnormal bone. Wide resection should be avoided at this instance given the risk of instability and segmental amputation, particularly in the long bones of the fingers and toes.</p>
<p>This case is presented to highlight BPOP as a potential diagnosis in subungual exostosis, with particular regard to hands and feet of the adolescent population, and to explore the difficult management problem this condition presents. Other issues raised include the need for focused histopathological evaluation, because Nora’s lesions can clinically and radiologically appear as classical subungual exostosis. This allows for a more informed discussion with patients and parents in view of the high likelihood of recurrence and need for more aggressive excision and longer term review. Increased awareness of the Nora’s lesion also allows for a more focused evaluation by a musculoskeletal pathologist, because on initial inspection the findings can be consistent with a subungual exostosis. In this case, the histopathological examination showed unremarkable trabecular bone with distinct cartilage and proliferating spindle cells, which could have represented a subungual exostosis. However, the slide was reviewed by a musculoskeletal histopathologist when the possibility of a Nora’s lesion was raised.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this case underlines the need for all intraoperative surgical samples to be submitted for histopathological evaluation to ensure appropriate surgical planning for any subsequent recurrence. BPOP should be considered in any case with a rapidly recurring subungual exostosis, and the treatment of choice is en bloc resection.</p>
