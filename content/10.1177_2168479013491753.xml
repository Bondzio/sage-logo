Sixty-one of the patients experienced negative symptoms such as pain, eye redness, blurred vision, and other symptoms of local reactions. This incident received attention in the Chinese media and was dubbed the “Shanghai ophthalmic door” scandal.</p><p>Avastin is a newly developed endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody that can slow the growth of blood vessels and inhibit angiogenesis. Avastin (bevacizumab) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Presently, it is only approved for colon cancer treatment in the US and China, and manufacturers have no intention of expanding the scope of application. But the adverse events that occurred in Shanghai First People’s Hospital showed that Avastin had been widely used in China for eye treatment. The practice of local hospitals in China using Avastin for ophthalmic treatment, not declared and approved beforehand, is considered illegal, because this involves an off-label drug use.</p><p>Off-label use has become an important part of mainstream, legitimate medical practice worldwide and is especially common in oncology, obstetrics, pediatrics, infectious diseases (notably HIV), and rare diseases. Depending on the circumstances, off-label use of medication can be viewed as experimental or controversial, or it can be considered standard practice and even state-of-the-art treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013491753">1</xref></sup> New drugs are tested for safety and efficacy. A key element of the drug regulatory process is the package insert, or “label.” The label serves two important functions: It explains the indications for which a drug is approved, and it provides information on safety and efficacy obtained from clinical trials. Drug labeling is an ongoing process, and frequent revisions are made to expand or restrict the indications for a drug, or even its availability, as more clinical experience is gained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013491753">2</xref></sup></p><p>Off-label drug use is the practice of prescribing a pharmaceutical for an unapproved indication; physicians use their own judgment in deciding how to use an approved agent. Off-label use might stem from an irresponsible and unfounded decision by a physician, or it might be considered an “evidence-based” treatment required by the patient’s condition. Effective off-label drug prescribing may lead to innovative new uses of old medications, avoiding the lengthy and expensive process of modifying approved drug labeling. There are many examples of this in internal medicine: One is the use of β-blockers for congestive heart failure. Although this use may be supported by clinical experience, off-label use nonetheless implies that both the physicians and patient will face more risks. As long as drugs are safe, well tolerated, and relatively inexpensive, off-label drug use generates little concern. But when an off-label drug use has costly, adverse consequences it becomes the focus of attention, such as in the case of the “Shanghai ophthalmic door” incident.</p><p>Off-label drug use is very common in medical practice, accounting for 7.5% to 40% of all drug use. It has been more common with pregnant women, children, and other patient groups as a result of limitations of clinical research data. Statistics have shown that rates of off-label drug use are up to 50% to 90% in hospitalized pediatric patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013491753">3</xref></sup> One continuous sample survey conducted at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, UK, assessed 17,000 prenatal prescriptions and found that 75% of the prescriptions were for off-label use, most of which were considered safe; they involved drugs such as betamethasone (to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature neonates), erythromycin ethylsuccinate (to prevent chorioamnionitis after ruptured membranes), and magnesium sulfate (for eclampsia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013491753">4</xref></sup> Conroy et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013491753">5</xref></sup> in a study of pediatric wards in 5 European countries, found that almost half of all drug prescriptions (46%) were either unlicensed or off-label. A study of 13,426 pediatric patients by ’t Jong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013491753">6</xref></sup> concluded that 2502 (19%) received 5253 prescriptions for respiratory drugs in 1998. A total of 882 drugs (16.8%) were unlicensed for use in children, and 1065 (20.3%) were prescribed off-label. The 1-year cumulative risk of receiving an unlicensed or off-label prescription was 45% among children with at least 1 prescription for a respiratory drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013491753">6</xref></sup> A study in the level 3 neonatal intensive care unit at Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, found that a total of 1442 prescriptions were administered: 42% were licensed, 11% were unlicensed, and 47% were off-label. Twenty-one percent of these prescriptions were off-label for 2 or more reasons. Eighty percent of infants received either an unlicensed or an off-label prescription or both, and this proportion rose to 93% of extremely low-birth-weight infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013491753">7</xref></sup> A study by Shah et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013491753">8</xref></sup> showed that at least 1 drug was used off-label in 297,592 of 355,409 patients (78.7%) discharged in 31 tertiary care pediatric hospitals in the US from January 1 to December 31, 2004.</p><p>Considerable concern exists within Europe and the US about the use of unlicensed and off-label drugs. There is, however, little information available on the scale and scope of off-label drug use in China. Chi and Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013491753">9</xref></sup> investigated 4200 prescriptions between June and December 2010 from a pediatric outpatient department and found that 259 (6.17%) involved off-label use. In a study by Zeng and Zhou,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013491753">10</xref></sup> 507 of 1112 prescriptions (45.59%) from the pediatric inpatient department involved off-label uses, which are frequently seen in underage children. </p><p>We wanted to determine the scale and scope of unlicensed and off-label drug use in China. This study aimed to explore the incidence, nature, and implications of unlicensed and off-label drug use in a hospital in Shanghai.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013491753" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data for this study were obtained from the Shanghai East Hospital Affiliated with Tongji University in 2009. This hospital does not include pediatric or psychiatric wards. The study was approved by the Departmental Ethics Committee, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Shanghai East Hospital. A total of 493 discharge case histories were randomly sampled. After reviewing patients’ hospitalization records, we analyzed the prescribing doctor’s recommendation for each prescription according to the patient’s clinical diagnosis, laboratory tests, and special examination reports, and then we searched for strong research evidence and/or the “suggestion for use” by official and authoritative sources. The following sources were selected: the contents of medicine package inserts (patient leaflet), the <italic>China Pharmacopeia Clinical Medication Notice</italic> (2010),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479013491753">11</xref></sup> and <italic>New Pharmacology</italic> (16th edition).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013491753">12</xref></sup></p><p>We collected related data including the gender, age, and diagnosis of each patient, as recorded in the records, as well as details of all drugs administered (route of administration, dose, and indication for use). In keeping with most (but not all) published work on this subject, we did not include prescriptions for parenteral nutrition, standard crystalloid intravenous fluids, glucose transfusion, oxygen, perioperative drugs, blood products, and drugs being used as part of clinical trials. After consulting official and authoritative sources to clarify the empirical basis for the selected therapies, we assessed all drugs administered to determine whether their use was unlicensed and off-label. Off-label and unlicensed drug use entailed use of a drug in ways not covered by the product license or the summary of product characteristics—that is, at a different dose or frequency, in different clinical indications, in different age groups, by an alternative route of administration, in the presence of contraindications, or in a formulation not approved for use. Use of an antimicrobial drug is considered off-label only if the patient has no evidence of infection; segmentation of the antibacterial spectrum is not considered in classifying a prescription as “off-label.” Prescriptions for antibacterial drugs, which do not meet the “Guidelines for Clinical Application of Antibiotics” and the “Guidelines of Perioperative Antimicrobial Prophylaxis,” are excluded from being considered off-label. All prescriptions were classified regarding their licensing status. As a reference source for classification, the official product license was used, as approved by the State Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Drug prescriptions were considered “long-term orders” and “temporary orders” based on the number of drugs administered daily, or drug treatment days. The average number of days of therapy, the average number of daily medications, and the days spent in therapy (versus hospitalization) were calculated. The percentage of off-label drug use was calculated as follows: number of off-label drugs/number of total drugs × 100%.</p><p>Descriptive analyses were conducted for patient demographics, prescription data, and outcome. Statistical comparisons consisted of independent unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for discrete variables.

Vasodilator agents, such as alprostadil and buflomedil hydrochloride, were inappropriately prescribed for unapproved indications in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Statins, which have pleiotropic effects, decrease concentrations of serum cholesterol, as do the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, but they are also used in coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular injuries; these uses are mostly off-label uses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2168479013491753">17</xref></sup> The treatment of stroke in our study is similar to that in other hospitals in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2168479013491753">18</xref></sup> There is excessive use of neuroprotective agents and traditional Chinese medicine. However, the most appropriate treatment (thrombolytic therapy) is not sufficient in treatment of stroke. In the hospital, there were many off-label uses of drugs that had no curative effect on stroke. These drugs include meclofenoxate, naloxone, betahistine, huperzine A, and oxiracetam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2168479013491753">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479013491753">20</xref></sup> Expectorants such as ambroxol, bromhexine hydrochloride, and montelukast sodium were mostly used for unapproved indications and constituted excessive medication. Nebulized chymotrypsin, terbutaline sulfate, and gentamycin sulfate were often used in respiratory diseases, which is an unregistered use. Many antimicrobial drugs were used with no indication or exceeded approved dose amounts, regardless of whether their use was consistent with the antibacterial spectrum specified by published guidelines for use of antibacterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2168479013491753">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2168479013491753">22</xref></sup> Insulin was mixed in the same infusion solution with other drugs; however, there have been concerns about both the compatibility and stability of mixtures. The tendency to mix as many drugs as possible in the same infusion solution is understandable but not always rational or safe. Most interviewed physicians take this problem into serious account, but information on compatibility and stability of drugs is insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2168479013491753">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2168479013491753"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2168479013491753">25</xref></sup> In the investigation, off-label use based on scientific clinical evidence was rare, such as the SSRI medication sertraline (Zoloft), commonly prescribed off-label to treat premature ejaculation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2168479013491753">26</xref></sup> and the use of sildenafil to treat pulmonary hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2168479013491753">27</xref></sup></p><p>During a new product launch, manufacturers aggressively promote their product in order to gain a foothold in the marketplace. This can include distributing promotional materials, directly to physicians, concerning the latest studies of off-label drug use. Drug representatives in China use this method to improve the market position of the product, and it leads to many off-label uses of drugs. The off-label use of antimicrobial drugs is an example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2168479013491753">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2168479013491753"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2168479013491753">30</xref></sup> A key concern for clinicians is the impact that off-label use may have on patient safety. Studies show that some physicians base their prescribing decisions on promotional materials rather than scientific research, prescribing inappropriate or dangerous drugs when there are more effective, safer alternatives available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013491753">2</xref></sup> Some studies have found that 73% of off-label uses had little or no scientific support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479013491753">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2168479013491753">32</xref></sup></p><p>Off-label use of drugs for unapproved indications is a serious concern. Clearly, the more “untested” the use, the greater the risk for serious and unexpected side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013491753">2</xref></sup> Many of these drugs are complementary therapy, which can be an issue of contention between hospitals and patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2168479013491753">33</xref></sup></p><p>From a legal/ethical point of view, the off-label use of medication represents a delicate balance between the statutory regulation of medication (which aims at safeguarding patients against unsafe and ineffective medications) and the prerogative of a physician to prescribe medication that, in his or her medical opinion, will be beneficial to the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2168479013491753">34</xref></sup> Although many physicians can competently weigh the risk of serious adverse effects against the severity of the condition and the potential benefits of a drug, off-label use of any drug with potential serious adverse effects merits close attention owing to concerns for patient safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2168479013491753">35</xref></sup></p><p>In the US, FDA policy currently prohibits the direct promotion of products for off-label uses, but the FDA recently published guidelines for the distribution of medical journal articles and scientific reference publications on unapproved new uses for approved drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2168479013491753">36</xref></sup> Off-label prescribing is widespread in many countries and is legal in the US and many other countries. But Chinese law does not currently allow drugs to be prescribed for indications for which they have not been approved. The law expressly provides that the package insert is the statutory basis for the correct use of medicines. The Ministry of Health Prescription Management Policy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2168479013491753">37</xref></sup> provides that “in the prescription of the drug, physicians should consider medical, prevention, health care needs, according to the diagnostic and treatment practices, drug indications, pharmacological effects, usage, dosage, contraindications, adverse reactions and precautions in the package insert” (Chapter 4, Section 14). The Hospital Prescription Comment Management Practices (Trial)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2168479013491753">38</xref></sup> expressly provides that “administration and dosage of drugs should be in accordance with the drug package insert for administration and dosage of drugs. Without any justifiable reason, the drug off-label use belongs to the irrational use of drugs” (Chapter 4, Section 9). </p><p>Off-label drug use is too common in China. To this end, some professional societies have issued related recommendations or consensus statements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2168479013491753">39</xref></sup> Their focus is that off-label drug use requires medical experimental data and the patient’s informed consent, but these issues are controversial. Patient informed consent and scientific evidence to back up the prescription are required by law for off-label prescriptions, but the final decision is left to individual physicians, who often seem unaware of this responsibility and even of the existence of a specific law. The recommendation for informed consent is probably not workable, because most of these patients are very sick or are cognitively impaired. This highlights the need for shared international directives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2168479013491753">40</xref></sup></p><p>It is utmost importance that medical practitioners have the latest accurate and nonmisleading medical and scientific information on medication, including off-label uses, when deciding on a patient’s treatment. By missing one or two important articles, the practitioner may be unable to choose the best option. Anecdotal data are not the equivalent of clinical tests. The available recommendations or guidelines from professional societies often provide rigorous assessment of evidence beyond the capability of any individual physician and thus can play a useful role in determining an individual physician’s level of certainty. Although the groups that promulgate professional recommendations can have conflicts of interest, professional society recommendations are still likely to represent a deeper understanding of and reflection on the evidence than would be attainable by the individual physician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2168479013491753">41</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013491753"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study specifically investigated unlicensed and off-label drug use in general hospital in China. The results have shown that unlicensed and off-label drug prescribing is common in China. Vitamins, potassium, and other nutritional supplements are the drugs most frequently prescribed off-label, while off-label use of vasodilators, lipid-lowering drugs, and adjuvant therapy medications in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions is also common. There is no clinical evidence of safety or benefit in most off-label use. Off-label use is an important area of practice in which evidence gaps should trigger more reflection and scrutiny. Some of the identified off-label uses may demonstrate a deficiency in physicians’ understanding of the risks associated with the incorrect use of a drug: for example, using drugs in the presence of contraindications, disregarding infusion incompatibilities, exceeding approved dose amounts, using antimicrobial agents for noninfectious indications, or using an unlabeled dosing regimen. Off-label use with inconclusive evidence should be limited. For situations in which off-label use may have clinical benefit, prescribers must thoroughly examine the risks and costs associated with such use. This information would allow medical practitioners make informed decisions when considering off-label use for their patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"
