<sec id="sec1-0004865811432819b"><title>Ronald Berger, <italic>White-Collar Crime: The Abuse of Corporate and Government Power</italic>, Lynne Rienner Publishers: Boulder, CO, 2011, 269 pp.: 9781588267658</title>
<p>In an era marked by growing public-sector cynicism and the ongoing fallout of a set of dramatic financial collapses and Middle Eastern conflicts, Ronald Berger’s latest book represents both a welcome and timely review of a criminological field that has traditionally given way to more common categories of crime in public consciousness. While the author might be slightly over-reaching when referring to an emerging ‘social movement’ against white-collar crime, the notion of white-collar crime has increasingly captured the attention of academicians, regulators and the general public in the past decade.</p>
<p>The book is positioned as a reference textbook in courses on white-collar crime, or as a supplemental text for courses on general criminology, deviance and social problems, and for the most part, Berger skilfully walks the line between academic rigour on one hand and accessibility and engagement on the other. The review of the evolution of thought in the broad category of white-collar crime is breezy yet comprehensive. The author manages to describe the conceptual ambiguity surrounding the notion of white-collar crime without becoming bogged down in the definitional pot-pourri. Reviewing all of the major contributions in the field, stretching back to Edwin Sutherland’s seminal early work, Berger’s account of the history and development of the concept is excellent, contextualized and well researched.</p>
<p>From an academic viewpoint, Chapter 2 of the book is perhaps the most interesting chapter, providing a review of various theoretical approaches to corporate crime and the corruption of the machinery of government by business. In organizing the discussion of white-collar crime around the internal environment of organizations (the so-called ‘microsociological’) and the external environment of an organization (the ‘macrosociological’), Berger, a professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, places the emphasis of the book not on individual acts of corporate criminality, but rather on organizational acts – those crimes committed in the pursuit of financial rewards and government policies, or those crimes involving a network of co-offenders acting in concert. This organizational emphasis stands in contrast to much prior research that has taken the individual as the unit of analysis. Berger deals with all of the major theoretical developments in earlier research by looking at differential association, opportunity structures and anomie in white-collar crime research and capture theory, the disaster-capitalism complex and agent provocateuring in articulating the corrupting influence of corporate power on the state.</p>
<p>The middle part of the book reads largely as a list of different categories of crime with short examples, cases and illustrative examples. It is divided into two parts: the first (Chapters 3 and 4) dealing with conventional corporate crime categories, while the second (Chapters 5 and 6) is concerned with crimes involving the state. While the book aims to move between white-collar crimes in the public and private sectors, the two strands never quite come together as smoothly as the author might have wished. The nexus between state and corporate crime is never taken up with the same detail as in say <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811432819b">Michalowski and Kramer’s (2006</xref>) <italic>State-Corporate Crime: Wrongdoing at the Intersection of Business and Government.</italic></p>
<p>Chapters 3 and 4 are a little pedestrian at times as a result of the (perhaps inevitable) result of trying to cover so much ground in so short a space, as the author surveys a range of crimes including Ponzi schemes, anti-trust violations, price fixing, insider trading, embezzlement and fraud, as well as a range of other crimes against workers, consumers and the environment. Both chapters are characterized by clear exposition and the thoughtful use of both classic and contemporary case studies, including the likes of Microsoft, Enron, Haliburton and Goldman Sachs in Chapter 3 (dealing with corporate financial crime); and the Ford Pinto case, the Johns-Manville Corporation asbestos case, and high-profile crimes committed by the tobacco and mining industry in Chapter 4 (dealing with corporate crimes against workers, consumers and the environment).</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 provide a more interesting and critical coverage of political corruption as well as illegal acts of political repression aimed at maintaining social order or fomenting disorder. Recent episodes in US history provide fertile ground to explore these issues and again, there is a thoughtful inclusion of indicted former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, corrupt military agent Jack Murtha and disaster relief fraud in Chapter 5 (on political corruption); and the Iran-Contra affair, the BNL scandal, drug-trafficking during the Cold War and the recent Abu Ghraib atrocities in Chapter 6 (relating to state crimes of foreign policy). The integration of topical, well-researched examples is perhaps the book’s greatest strength, ensuring that the book flows easily and holds the reader’s interest.</p>
<p>The lengthy treatment of the military-industrial complex in the US is a consistent theme in Chapters 5 and 6, reflecting growing recognition of the scores of corporations conducting business with the US government that collectively reap billions of dollars through unethical and illegal practices. Here the author draws heavily on Naomi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811432819b">Klein’s (2007</xref>) critique in <italic>The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism</italic> and points the finger squarely at a number of notorious US figures in this realm, including Dick Cheney and James Baker. The steady flow of highly recognisable political figures drawn from the past decade should strike a chord with students of US politics.</p>
<p>The final chapter deals with a range of potential responses to white-collar crime, however the coverage is competent rather than inspired (limited primarily to whistle-blowing, challenges posed by the realities of law enforcement and generic treatment of regulatory reform and current and prospective criminal and civil sanctions). It features a provocative and critical treatment of rulings in the United States relating to attempts to circumvent the buying of political influence by major corporates, which the author infers is increasingly compromising effective debate. In the conclusion, there is a call to arms for conscientiously-minded citizens to involve themselves in mitigating the abuse of corporate and government power in contemporary societies, bringing together the critical thrust of the book.</p>
<p>The book’s positioning as a college or university text necessarily limits its scope. That is, the intention is to provide a general overview rather than a review of recent academic research and viewpoints. Although the focus is almost exclusively American, the book deals primarily at a conceptual/sociological rather than black letter law level. That said, the inclusion of international perspectives and cases would have improved the book further and rounded out some of the discussion. Other areas where the discussion might have been expanded include the role of groups and collectives in white-collar crime and the operation of institutions, control agencies and officials designed to ensure the integrity of the functioning of the public purse in the US and elsewhere (and how these may have been systematically perverted in the past). Moreover, while white-collar crime now constitutes an increasing proportion of the federal prosecutor’s workload in the US, a number of issues remain poorly understood, including the complex machinations that give rise to white-collar criminal acts in the first place, the methods, characteristics and rates of white-collar prosecutions, and post-sentencing processes and outcomes.</p>
<p>All in all, this book stands as a comprehensive and well-written overview that does an excellent job in priming the reader with an understanding of white-collar crime and a range of crimes committed by governments. Perhaps it would be most useful as a text for an undergraduate course, to be positioned alongside more critical and theoretical material for the relevant jurisdiction. Scholars in the field are unlikely to find too much that is new here, other than to appreciate the breadth, flow and the intelligent organization of the offering.</p>
