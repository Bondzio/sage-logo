<p><italic>Purpose</italic>. To compare immediate outcomes for patients who receive and those who do not receive heparin during lower limb endovascular intervention. <italic>Methods</italic>. A retrospective case series of 330 procedures for lower limb peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patient records were interrogated for bleeding or thrombotic/embolic complications during or immediately after endovascular intervention for peripheral arterial occlusive disease. <italic>Results</italic>. Of the 220 patients who received heparin, 21 (9.6%) suffered an access site bleed compared with 2 of the 110 patients (2%) who did not receive heparin (odds ratio [OR] = 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-25; <italic>P</italic> = .01). There were 6 embolic/thrombotic complications in the patients who received heparin (2.7%) compared with 4 in those that did not receive heparin (3.6%; <italic>P</italic> = .74). In 187 cases, a closure or compression device was used (StarClose, n = 109; Angio-Seal, n = 42; FemoStop, n = 35; ProGlide, n = 1), of which there were 3 access bleeding complications (2%). One hundred and forty-three cases did not have a closure or compression device associated with 17 (12%) access bleeding complications (OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.09-0.64; <italic>P</italic> = .004). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. In this study, heparin use and nonuse of a closure or compression device was associated with an increased risk of access site bleeding. Embolic/thrombotic complications were uncommon.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ever since the first description of percutaneous angioplasty by Dotter and Judkins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512459889">1</xref></sup> heparin has been used during endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. However, heparin use may be associated with bleeding complications and thus some practitioners avoid using heparin during endovascular procedures. Currently, there is no level I evidence to support the use of heparin during peripheral arterial endovascular intervention, a conclusion likely to be confirmed in a Cochrane review (personal communication from author Saurav Chatterjee). The aim of this study was to compare bleeding and thrombotic complications between those patients who received heparin during endovascular treatment for peripheral arterial occlusive disease and those that did not in a single vascular unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1531003512459889" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective case note review was performed on all patients undergoing endovascular treatment for peripheral arterial occlusive disease between July 2007 and July 2011. The setting was that of a single statewide department of vascular and endovascular surgery based in an Australian tertiary level teaching hospital, providing services at 2 sites. The 2 sites were state-funded public hospitals and serve a population of just more than 500 000. Patients were identified from the prospective logbook in each angiography room maintained by the radiographers. These data were confirmed and supplemented by a prospective unit database. The following patients were excluded from this study:
<list id="list1-1531003512459889" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Patients undergoing diagnostic imaging only</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients undergoing endovascular treatment for aneurysmal disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients undergoing thrombolytic treatment, where this was the planed primary treatment modality</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients undergoing upper limb, carotid artery, mesenteric, or renal artery interventions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients requiring upper limb arterial access</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Patient demographics were recorded, but body mass index was not recorded as this was an infrequent entry in the patients’ medical records. The inpatient notes, procedural reports, and clinic correspondence were interrogated to establish the indications for intervention, to identify the interventionalist (vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist), the site and direction of arterial access, the maximum size of arterial sheath placed, the dose of heparin given during the procedure, whether an arterial closure or compression device was used at completion, and whether there had been any bleeding or thrombotic complications within 24 hours of the procedure. An access site bleeding complication included all documented hematomas. A hematoma was defined as any subcutaneous groin, abdominal wall, or retroperitoneal collection of blood as assessed clinically. Bleeding complications were graded as 1 = hematoma treated conservatively but did not delay discharge, 2 = hematoma treated conservatively but delayed discharge, 3 = hematoma treated conservatively but required a blood transfusion, and 4 = hematoma requiring surgery. A thrombotic or embolic complication was any event documented where there was a new vessel occlusion on the postprocedural angiogram as documented in the procedure report.</p>
<p>It was established that all interventionalist use 1000 IU of heparin per 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride as the flushing solution during these procedures. The volume of flushing solution used was inconsistently recorded and thus not included as part of this investigation. There were no unit policies or protocols for the indications for intervention or for the techniques used to perform peripheral endovascular interventions. Thus, the size of sheath used by individual practitioners will be dictated by personal preference and sheath size limitation of angioplasty balloons and stents. The choice of access (antegrade vs retrograde) was also at the discretion of the interventionalist. Generally speaking, iliac interventions are performed through a retrograde access and superficial femoral artery and below interventions through an antegrade access to the common femoral artery. Use of heparin was also determined by each interventionalist, there currently being no unit policy on anticoagulation during peripheral endovascular intervention. In those patients who received heparin, the dose was determined by the interventionalist, and activated clotting times (ACT) were not used during this study period.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Over the 4-year period, 330 procedures were performed on 237 patients.

<p>Overall, there were 21 arterial access bleeding complications (6.9%), resulting in 2 deaths. The 2 access bleeding–related deaths warrant further description. In the first, a 75-year-old woman presented with gangrenous toes. She had a history of diabetes, ischemic heart disease with left ventricular failure, gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Given a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed she was not taking an antiplatelet agent but on admission was commenced on a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily). She was an ex-smoker and lived in a nursing home. After a period of failed conservative management, she reluctantly agreed to an attempt at an angioplasty of her occluded superficial femoral artery. The left common femoral artery was accessed antegradely and a 6-F sheath placed. After 5000 units of intravenous heparin and a prolonged procedure, a subintimal angioplasty was performed. A FemoStop (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was applied to the access site. On return to the ward, the patient complained of increasing abdominal pain and suffered a cardiovascular collapse. She was immediately transferred to the operating theatre. It took a considerable length of time for intravenous access to be established and general anesthesia to be commenced. Just prior to anesthesia, she had an unrecordable blood pressure, a heart rate of 150 beats per minute, and had become unconscious. At the time of operation, there was a large retroperitoneal hematoma with active bleeding from the arterial access site, which was in the distal external iliac artery, just proximal to the inguinal ligament. This required a single suture for control. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively. The following day the left foot was mottled and cold. Her cardiovascular condition was very poor requiring large doses of inotropes. A decision to palliate the patient was made, and she died a few hours later without regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>In the second case, a 91-year-old woman with dialysis-dependant renal failure presented with a painful gangrenous toe. Two months previously she had suffered a myocardial infarction, treated with coronary stenting and dual antiplatelet treatment. She lived in a nursing home. After careful consenting, she elected to have an attempt at angioplasty of an occluded superficial femoral artery. Under local anesthetic a 6-F sheath was placed antegradely into the left common femoral artery with difficulty because of heavy arterial calcification. A subintimal angioplasty of the occluded superficial femoral artery was performed after 5000 units of heparin had been given. Given the access vessel calcification, no closure device was used and manual compression was applied. This required an extended period of compression, up to 30 minutes, before the interventionalist was satisfied with hemostasis. The patient had been cardiovascularly stable throughout. On arrival at the recovery ward, the patient coughed and, despite instructions to lie still, suddenly moved on the bed. This was associated with rapid development of an access site hematoma and bleeding from the wound. Manual compression was reapplied. It was decided to transfer the patient to the operating theatre for formal vessel control. At the time of surgery, there was a large abdominal wall hematoma arising from the arterial puncture site, which was located in the lateral wall of a very calcified common femoral artery. A single suture was required for vessel control. Postoperatively, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and a decision was made to palliate the patient and not to restart dialysis.</p>
<p>There was one further death in this series that was attributable to the intervention. A 49-year-old woman presented with short distance intermittent claudication. She had previously had a left external iliac angioplasty, and duplex imaging had suggested a restenosis. After retrograde 6-F common femoral arterial access, the external iliac occlusion was crossed with guidewire and a 6-mm diameter self expanding nitinol stent (SMART, Cordis, Miami, FL) was deployed. No heparin was given. On completion angiogram there was an extravascular blush of contrast from the proximal external iliac artery. A 6-mm angioplasty balloon was inflated at the site of the extravasation and left in place for 10 minutes. On deflation of the balloon and further angiogram, there was no further extravasation of contrast. The patient was admitted to hospital for observation. The following day, she was comfortable with no abdominal tenderness, cardiovascularly stable, and had normal hemoglobin level. She was therefore allowed home. That evening, at home, she complained of lower abdominal pain but did not seek medical attention. The following day, she was found dead at home by a relative. Postmortem examination revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to external iliac vessel perforation.</p>
<p>One patient in this series had a 4-F sheath and suffered no complications. Seventy-eight patients had a 5-F sheath, of which there were 6 hematomas managed conservatively, 1 retroperitoneal bleed requiring hospital admission but treated conservatively, and 1 retroperitoneal bleed requiring surgery. Two hundred twenty-eight patients had a 6-F sheath, in whom 12 hematomas and 1 retroperitoneal bleed were managed conservatively. Two of these patients suffered a bleed that required urgent control in the theater, but they subsequently died, as reported above.</p>
<p>Ten patients had a 7-F sheath with no bleeding complications. One patient had an 8-F sheath with no complications. In 12 cases, it was not recorded what size sheath had been used, but in none of these cases were there any reported bleeding complications.</p>
<p>In 222 cases, the arterial access was antegrade into the common femoral artery. In this group, 13 hematomas were treated conservatively, 2 retroperitoneal hematomas were treated conservatively, 2 cases required urgent operative arterial repair (resulting in death of both patients as reported above), and 1 retroperitoneal hemorrhage that required open surgery with survival of the patient. Of the 108 patients where arterial access was retrograde into the common femoral artery, there were 5 hematomas, all managed conservatively.</p>
<p>In this series, there were no documented pseudoaneurysms or iatrogenic access site arteriovenous fistulas.</p>
<p>No patients in this study were managed preoperatively or immediately after intervention with therapeutic heparin. Of the 220 cases who received heparin during the procedure, 21 (9.6%) suffered an access site bleed compared with 2 (2%) of the 110 patients who did not receive heparin (odds ratio [OR] = 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-8.1; <italic>P</italic> = .02). There were 6 embolic/thrombotic complications in the patients who received heparin (2.7%) compared with 4 in those that did not receive heparin (3.6%; OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.2-2.7; <italic>P</italic> = .65).</p>
<p>The was no difference in the incidence of bleeding complications between those patients taking antiplatelet agents at the time of the intervention and those not taking antiplatelet agents (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.55-4.16).</p>
<p>Fisher’s exact test revealed no difference in the use of heparin when compared with sheath size, <italic>P</italic> = .329.</p>
<p>In 187 cases, a closure or compression device was used. Of the 109 cases where a StarClose device (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) was used, it was reported that the device failed in 6 cases, but there were no complications as a result of this. There was 1 hematoma managed conservatively in the StarClose group. In the 42 cases that had an Angio-Seal device (St. Jude Medical), there were 4 reported failed cases and 1 common femoral thrombotic occlusion. In the 35 cases where a FemoStop was used, there were 2 hematomas that were treated conservatively. One ProGlide (Abbott) was used, which resulted in an embolus requiring an embolectomy. Thus, there were a total of 6 access bleeding complications where a closure or compression device had been used (3%). Of the 143 cases where no closure or compression device was used, there were 15 (10%) access site bleeding complications (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.11-0.75; <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Progress in the field of peripheral arterial endovascular treatment has been rapid in the past few decades. This has been aided by improved guidewires, catheters, angioplasty balloons, and stent technology. The advent of arterial closure devices has also resulted in increased uptake of these devices to control arterial access sites. However, many of these interventions have not been subjected to close scrutiny in the form of randomized blinded studies, the gold standard in the assessment of efficacy and safety in medicine and surgery. In particular, the use of heparin during endovascular interventions lacks evidence, with not a single randomized study to support its use. For this reason, within our unit and we suspect in others, there is variable use of heparin during peripheral endovascular interventions. There are good theoretical reasons why heparin might be beneficial, namely, prevention of thrombus formation on intravascular devices and reduced incidence of thrombosis at the site of arterial injury due to angioplasty or stent placement. There is some evidence that angioplasty and peripheral arterial stent placement is associated with a prothrombotic state, which may favor early vessel occlusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512459889">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512459889">3</xref></sup> In addition, there have been reports of ultrasound detected emboli during angioplasty and stenting procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512459889">4</xref></sup> However, heparin use increases the risk of procedural and postprocedural bleeding. Thus, there needs to be a careful balance between the risks and benefits of heparin use. A survey of members and fellows of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology in 1988 failed to show a clear consensus regarding the use of heparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512459889">5</xref></sup> Even if heparin was administered, there was a large variation in dose ranging from 500 to 10 000 international units. There has also been a report that stated that there was no statistical relationship between heparin doses and hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1531003512459889">6</xref></sup> In a study published by Zaman et al in 1996, the authors recommended that a bolus dose of 3000 units of heparin be given when the lesion to be treated had been successfully crossed, larger doses being reserved for longer or more complex procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1531003512459889">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The lack of universal agreement on the use of heparin during endovascular procedures has also been highlighted in a recent survey of members of the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512459889">8</xref></sup> This survey focused on abdominal aortic aneurysms and reported that 87% of respondents who performed elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms administer heparin during the procedure.</p>
<p>This retrospective study suggests that arterial access bleeding may be associated with the use of heparin and the nonuse of arterial closure devices. However, the incidence of thrombotic complications was evenly distributed between those patients who did and did not receive heparin during the procedure. A randomized trial is needed to clarify the role of heparin during endovascular procedures. Given the reported safety of bivalirudin, Shammas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1531003512459889">9</xref></sup> recommended a randomized trial of bivalirudin versus heparin. If such a trial were to be undertaken, we would like to see a control arm to this study. A cost-effectiveness assessment would also be required given the increased costs of bivalirdin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1531003512459889">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1531003512459889">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1531003512459889">2</xref> are important in their detail, as they show a number of interesting features that depend on individual interventionalists. For example, the indications for intervention vary widely, with vascular surgeon 4 intervening on more claudicants (66%) compared with vascular surgeon 5 (10%), whereas vascular surgeon 4 used heparin in only 19% of patients compared with 100% for vascular surgeon 5.</p>
<p>The incidence of bleeding in this study may seem higher than reported in other studies. Shammas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1531003512459889">11</xref></sup> reported an incidence of major bleeding in 4.6% of patients; however, definitions of major bleeding vary between studies. In this study, we have included all reported access bleeding complications, most of these hematomas being treated conservatively and did not delay hospital discharge.</p>
<p>Wheatley et al have reported that antegrade arterial access and larger sheath size are associated with higher complication rates. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1531003512459889">12</xref></sup> This is consistent with the findings in our study. However, in the report by Wheatley, only 12% of cases had antegrade arterial access compared to 67% in our report.</p>
<p>The fact that there were very few thrombotic complications in both groups but especially in the no heparin group is interesting and raises the question of whether the theoretical propositions for the use of heparin are correct. This may also represent the nature of this study in that this study has involved a review of medical charts only. There has been no prospective evaluation of emboli in this study, and the diligence of interventionalists in looking for such complications will be variable. It may be that small emboli may have occurred within this study, but these were either not imaged on the completion angiograms or not reported on the procedure reports. Even if completion angiograms were performed, there is still a possibility that small emboli could be missed. Notwithstanding these comments, there were very few clinical adverse events of emboli/thrombosis in this study. One factor that we were unable to measure was the length of the procedure. It may be that a quick procedure where intraarterial sheaths, catheters, and guidewires are placed for a short period of time does not increase the risk of thrombosis, unlike long protracted cases where sheath, catheters, and guidewires are a potential thrombotic source. To add to the difficulty is differentiating on imaging fresh thrombus embolization versus atheromatous embolization when performing an angioplasty. Those events where embolization were documented may well have been atheromatous emboli as a consequent of arterial wall disruption, an event unlikely to have been influenced by the use of heparin.</p>
<p>A publication from Hanna et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1531003512459889">13</xref></sup> suggested that giving protamine prior to sheath removal was advantageous. However, their conclusion was based on a practice of not removing arterial sheaths until the ACT was less than 220 seconds. They claimed that the current standard of practice is to delay sheath removal until deemed safe, as determined by measurements of the ACT. They went on to state that sheath removal is often delayed for several hours. We have found no evidence to support this practice and would suggest that leaving a sheath inside for several hours would not be common practice for vascular surgeons and radiologists. Although using protamine in this study reduced the time until sheath removal (8.9 minutes vs 188 minutes, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), there was no difference in the bleeding complications between the 2 nonrandomized groups.</p>
<p>It was reassuring that we experienced no clinically evident pseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the use of heparin and the nonuse of arterial closure or compression devices increase the risk of arterial access bleeding complications after endovascular lower limb intervention. However, heparin use did not seem to significantly reduce the thrombotic or embolic complications. This suggests that a randomized study is required to answer the question of whether heparin is required or not for lower limb endovascular interventions.</p>
