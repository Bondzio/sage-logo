<sec id="section1-0020764011408651">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>There is abundant empirical evidence of a surplus risk of suicide among the unemployed, although few studies have investigated the influence of economic downturns on suicidal behaviours in an employment status-stratified sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011408651">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>We investigated how economic inflation affected suicidal behaviours according to employment status in Italy from 2001 to 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011408651">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Data concerning economically active people were provided by the Italian Institute for Statistical Analysis and by the International Monetary Fund. The association between inflation and completed versus attempted suicide with respect to employment status was investigated in every year and quarter-year of the study time frame. We considered three occupational categories: employed, unemployed who were previously employed and unemployed who had never worked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764011408651">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The unemployed are at higher suicide risk than the employed. Among the PE, a significant association between inflation and suicide attempt was found, whereas no association was reported concerning completed suicides. No association was found between completed and attempted suicides among the employed, the NE and inflation. Completed suicide in females is significantly associated with unemployment in every quarter-year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764011408651">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The reported vulnerability to suicidal behaviours among the PE as inflation rises underlines the need of effective support strategies for both genders in times of economic downturns.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current economic downturn is the most serious since the Great Depression of 1929 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011408651">Barber, 2008</xref>) and is expected to have adverse effects on unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408651">Gunnell, Platt, &amp; Hawton, 2009</xref>). Although some argue that this will clearly lead to a rise in suicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408651">Parry &amp; Humphreys, 2009</xref>), questions remain about the relationship between the economic indicators and suicide.</p>
<p>For example, there are many studies examining the relationship between unemployment and suicide rates, but their conclusions are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408651">Boardman, Grimbaldeston, Handley, Jones, &amp; Willmott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408651">Dooley, Fielding, &amp; Levi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764011408651">Morrell, Taylor, &amp; Kerr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0020764011408651">Wilson &amp; Walker, 1993</xref>). While the economic trends of the 1990s appeared to demonstrate a causal link between suicide and unemployment in Britain, an association was not found during the same period in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011408651">Mäkinen, 1999</xref>). In Finland, one study found a correlation between suicide rate and unemployment from 1981 to 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011408651">Martikainen, 1990</xref>), while a different study from 1985 to 1995 showed no correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408651">Hintikka, Saarinen, &amp; Viinamäki, 1999</xref>). There is also an analysis of unemployment and suicide rates from 18 countries that demonstrated a negative correlation overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408651">Mäkinen, 1997</xref>). Despite these discrepancies, a number of researchers have quantified the contribution of unemployment rates to suicide rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0020764011408651">Stuckler, Basu, Suhrcke, Coutts, and McKee (2009)</xref> showed that every 1% rise in unemployment was associated with a 0.79 % rise in suicides, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408651">Blakely, Collings, and Atkinson (2003)</xref> showed a two- to threefold increase in the relative risk of suicide among the unemployed compared to the employed.</p>
<p>Mental illness is one factor that may mediate the different findings across studies of this kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011408651">Mäkinen &amp; Wasserman, 2009</xref>). Without adjusting for confounds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408651">Lewis and Sloggett (1998)</xref> attributed a contribution of 0.11 of unemployment to the suicide rate, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764011408651">Mortensen, Agerbo, Erikson, Qin, and Westergaard-Nielsen (2000)</xref> reported that the contribution was no more than 0.03 after adjusting for mental illnesses.</p>
<p>The presence of inflation may be another important factor in determining how unemployment affects suicide rates. Inflation affects the everyday life of individuals, their purchasing power and the consumer price index. Consumers perceive inflation as an upward trend in the prices of goods and services and a devaluation of their savings, which contribute to feelings of helplessness and loss.</p>
<p>In this paper, we test the hypothesis that inflation is an important moderating factor on the relationship between unemployment and suicidal behaviour. Specifically, we analyse the different effects inflation exerts on completed and attempted suicides in an employment status-stratified sample. To that end, we investigated such relationship among the employed and the unemployed, dividing the latter category into ‘never employed’ (NE; those who were unemployed and had never worked) and ‘previously employed’ (PE; those who had worked before but were now unemployed).</p>
<p>This ecological study tests the idea that suicide risk is highest in that portion of society that is experiencing the greatest financial loss. If this idea is correct, we would expect to find that the unemployed population is at a higher risk for suicidal behaviours than the employed population, and, during times of inflation, those who were previously employed are at a higher risk for suicidal behaviours than those who were never employed. We used national statistics of completed and attempted suicides in the different occupational categories as well as Italian inflation rates from 2001 to 2008. This study builds upon earlier studies in several ways. While several studies have considered the association between unemployment and suicide, this one uses more recent data. More importantly, no other study has used such a large and nationally representative sample to investigate the relationship between inflation and suicidal behaviours while stratifying for employment status.</p>

<title>Method</title>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The Italian Institute for Statistical Analysis (ISTAT) provided data concerning all reported suicidal behaviour from 2001 to 2008 within Italy. Reported behaviour included completed suicides, in which the suicide is fatal, and attempted suicides, in which the subject survives, and both of these outcomes were included in this analysis. Data pertaining to Italian citizens living abroad were not included because of possible differences in reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011408651">O’Carroll, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0020764011408651">Värnik et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The ISTAT collects data from emergency department reports, interviews with key informants that are carried out whenever the medical examiner or pathologist suspects suicide, and any other submitted report regarding a completed or attempted suicide. These interviews aim to ascertain the circumstances of the suicide and collect information regarding the time of the act, the method used and the hypothesized reason for it. However, ethical sensitivity restricts what can be collected. These data are entered into ISTAT after certification and cataloguing by the state or military police. Classification of suicides was completed according to the ICD-10.</p>
<p>Census data were used to determine employment status. The sampling method for the census is a continuous weekly survey and a two-step process is used: the first is the inclusion process of municipalities and the second is the identification of the families in each municipality. Municipalities are divided into (1) self-representative, i.e. main towns and municipalities whose population is higher than a reference value calculated for every province, and (b) not self-representative, including all the municipalities having a number of citizens lower than the reference value. All self-representative municipalities were included, while those that were not self-representative were organized into levels and one family in each level was randomly chosen to be included in the sample.</p>
<p>Vital statistics of the families living in each of the included municipalities were provided by the Office of the Census where a ‘family’ refers to a group of cohabiting people who are bound by marriage, emotional ties, affinity, guardianship or adoption. Every family in the sample was interviewed four times, twice consecutively and twice six months later, using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Every census includes data from an 18-month period. This practice may have reduced inaccuracies due to the transitional nature of employment status because it shortens the time lag between the census taking during which people’s employment status might change.</p>
<p>Data concerning employment are routinely coded by ISTAT. In the ISTAT database, ‘Employed’ refers to all subjects aged 15 or older who, in the week before the interview, worked for at least one hour in a rewarded activity, in their own business or profession, or as an unpaid worker on a farm or in a business operated by a member of their family. It also referred to those who had a job and received at least 50% of a full wage, but were not working at the moment of the interview due to illness, vacation, bad weather, a dispute between labour and management, or personal reasons. ‘Unemployed’ refers to all the subjects between ages 15 and 74 who did not have any job but who had engaged at least once in any specific job-seeking activity in the month prior to the survey (such as registering at a public or private employment office, meeting with prospective employers, checking with friends or relatives, placing or answering advertisements and writing letters of application), were available to start working within two weeks from the interview, were waiting to report to a new waged or salaried job within three months from the interview, or were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been laid off. This category was further divided into those who were never employed (NE) and those who were previously employed (PE).</p>
<p>The census also collected data on those in the ‘non-active labour force’, which refers to those who do not belong to any other category, such as homemakers, students, the retired and the disabled. However, for the purposes of this study, only subjects belonging to the categories ‘employed’ and ‘unemployed’ were included in the analysis. In addition, to focus on the population that was most likely to be economically active, only subjects in the database aged 18 to 65 were considered.</p>
<p>Data concerning Italian inflation from 2001 to 2008 were provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which estimates inflation by calculating the inflation rate of the consumer price index, which measures prices of a selection of goods and services purchased by a typical consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764011408651">Mankiw, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764011408651">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Spearman’s correlation coefficient and scattergraphs were used to test the association between inflation and both completed and attempted suicides in each occupational category. This association was analysed in respect to every quarter-year of the considered period using Spearman’s rho (ρ) and scattergraphs. As factors that predict suicide may differ between genders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011408651">Kposowa, 2000</xref>), grouped scattergraphs were used to study this association in males and females. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to evaluate the trend of completed and attempted suicides in each occupational category considering the genders together and apart.</p>
<p>The probability of committing suicide in the broad categories ‘employed’ and ‘unemployed’ was studied using the χ<sup>2</sup> test, the Cochran-Armitage test for trend and the standardized residual χ<sup>2</sup> test. The risk for suicide in the two categories was compared year by year within the time frame of the study.</p>

<p>For both employed and unemployed subjects, the χ<sup>2</sup> test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) showed a significant difference between the prevalence of completed suicides in every year, and the Cochran-Armitage test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) showed a significant linear trend of the proportions.

<p>Our findings of a greater suicidal risk in males than in females match worldwide suicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408651">Cantor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011408651">Hawton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764011408651">Preti, Lentini, &amp; Maugeri, 2007</xref>). In developed countries, the male–female ratio is between 2:1 and 4:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408651">Hawton &amp; van Heeringen, 2009</xref>). In most European countries, females are more likely to attempt suicide than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020764011408651">Schmidtke et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0020764011408651">Wasserman &amp; Wasserman, 2009</xref>), however, our findings show virtually no gender difference. This could be due to the characteristics of a sample that did not include the category ‘non-active labour force’, which encompasses homemakers, a large group of females reported to be at elevated risk for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408651">Kposowa, 2001</xref>) but not for suicide mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408651">Beautrais, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011408651">Niemi &amp; Lönnqvist, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020764011408651">Schwartz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0020764011408651">Wasserman &amp; Wasserman, 2009</xref>). Thus, the male–female ratio of completed suicides is less likely to be affected by the sample characteristics than the male–female ratio of attempted suicides.</p>

<title>Inflation, occupational status and suicidal behaviour</title>
<p>This study contributes to the existing literature by indicating a higher risk for suicide among the unemployed compared to the employed in every year of the time frame studied. This parallels international evidence of a two- to fourfold surplus risk for suicide due to unemployment, which was reported even after controlling for other variables both in individual-level studies based on national mortality registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408651">Blakely et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408651">Blakely et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408651">Kposowa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764011408651">Qin, Agerbo, &amp; Mortensen, 2003</xref>) and from twin registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0020764011408651">Voss, Nylén, Floderus, Diderichsen, &amp; Terry, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This study also found that there is an interaction between inflation and employment history for those who <italic>attempted</italic> suicide, but not for those who <italic>completed</italic> suicide. The PE group had a uniquely heightened risk for attempted suicide during times of increased inflation when compared to the NE and employed groups. However, there was no association between inflation and completed suicide in any of the three employment status categories. This finding conflicts with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764011408651">Preti and Miotto (1999)</xref> who showed a higher risk for suicide among the NE in Italy from 1982 to 1994. This is to be understood in the light of the different focus of the studies, since Preti and Miotto did not investigate the influence of inflation on suicides in the three occupational groups. It is not clear why there should be a uniquely increased risk of attempted suicides but not completed suicides for the PE during times of inflation. Perhaps this group contains more people who are driven to attempt suicide mainly because of financial losses and that this motivation (in the absence of other factors) can lead to a less serious suicide attempt.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that models of suicide risk that include an interaction between inflation and employment history may not be of clinical utility. There is evidence that the association between unemployment and suicide is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011408651">Kraut &amp; Walld, 2003</xref>) or vanishes after adjusting for mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408651">Beautrais, Joyce, &amp; Mulder, 1998</xref>). Including inflation in the analysis did not clearly make employment status a more useful indicator of population-wide suicide risk. Unfortunately, our data set does not include complete information about mental illness and so we cannot explore the potentially fruitful interaction between mental illness, employment status and suicide risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764011408651">Platt &amp; Hawton, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results largely parallel those of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011408651">Kraut &amp; Walld, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011408651">Lester &amp; Yang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011408651">Platt, 1984</xref>), for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408651">Hawton, Fagg, and Simkin (1988)</xref> estimated a seven to ten times higher risk for suicide attempts among unemployed women compared with those who were employed, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408651">Platt and Kreitman (1984)</xref> reported an eleven times higher risk for attempts in unemployed men than employed. However, one should be careful when comparing the results of these studies because none investigated the influence of inflation on suicidal behaviours and few of them evaluated PE and NE separately.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Reporting suicidal behaviours and employment status to ISTAT is mandatory in Italy, and so the validity of our findings is bolstered by the large sample size, which encompasses all suicidal behaviours registered in Italy during the study time frame.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large national databases concerning suicide are not wholly reliable. Bias is introduced during data collection. The process of death certification is unreliable, because it is often unclear whether death was self-inflicted and whether suicide was the victim’s true aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011408651">O’Carroll, 1989</xref>). Evidence shows a misclassification of suicides within the group of ‘death by accidents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408651">De Leo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020764011408651">Stanistreet, Taylor, Jeffrey, &amp; Gabbay, 2001</xref>) and within the category ‘undetermined deaths and open verdicts’, which is suggested to be among the major sources of underreporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011408651">Goldsmith, Pellmar, Kleinman, &amp; Bunney 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408651">Linsley, Schapira, &amp; Kelly, 2001</xref>). This could be related to the great stigma surrounding suicide in countries with a strong Roman Catholic and Orthodox culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020764011408651">Pritchard &amp; Baldwin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020764011408651">Rockett, 2010</xref>), as well as in Islamic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011408651">Pritchard &amp; Amanullah, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the data set analysed in the present study pertaining only to deaths registered as suicides is likely to underestimate the phenomenon, although Italian suicide reports in the last 30 years have been much more accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011408651">De Leo, Conforti, &amp; Carollo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020764011408651">Pritchard &amp; Hean, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, few significant differences were found when comparing suicide and undetermined deaths among Catholic and non-Catholic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020764011408651">Pritchard &amp; Hansen, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020764011408651">2005b</xref>). Reporting across different geographical regions is unlikely to be consistent. However, studies examining the consistency and reliability of population-wide suicide data based on death certificates suggest that these sources of bias are not so widespread as to invalidate official rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408651">De Leo, Burgis, Bertolote, Kerkhof, &amp; Bille-Brahe, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The data regarding employment status may also be unreliable. Census data are based on self-report and people may overstate their employment status out of a sense of embarrassment. Also the data set did not include information concerning history of previous suicide attempts and mental illness. Thus, their role in suicidal behaviours and suicides within the different employment categories cannot be investigated.</p>
<p>This study includes cross-sectional data, and so the interpretation of the results is susceptible to the ecological inference fallacy. This is an error in the interpretation of statistical data when conclusions are drawn about specific individuals based solely on aggregate statistics collected for the group to which those individuals belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020764011408651">Robinson, 1950</xref>). Furthermore, being ecological in nature, this study cannot establish any causal link among observed phenomena.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, unemployment and completed suicides in women were significantly associated in every quarter-year, whereas no association was reported in men. This is noteworthy since most previous studies report that unemployment has a greater effect on men, who have been socialized to view themselves as the breadwinners of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408651">Canetto 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020764011408651">Qin, Agerbo, Westergård-Nielsen, Eriksson, &amp; Mortensen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764011408651">Qin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020764011408651">Stack, 2000</xref>). Consistent with our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408651">Kposowa (2001)</xref> noticed a strong association between suicide and unemployment among American women from 1979 to 1989 and demonstrated, with years of follow-up, that this association remained consistent. This phenomenon was explained as a function of increased female labour force participation: women would invest more of their psychosocial identities into their socioeconomic status, thus becoming progressively more affected by stress typical of the working group, such as unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408651">de Castro, Pimenta, &amp; Martins, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020764011408651">Stack, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0020764011408651">Stack &amp; Danigelis, 1985</xref>). The change of female labour force participation throughout the decades is mirrored by the findings of different studies investigating its relationship with female suicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408651">Burr, McCall, &amp; Powell-Griner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011408651">Milner, McClure, &amp; De Leo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011408651">Newman, Whittemore, &amp; Newman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0020764011408651">Trovato &amp; Vos, 1992</xref>). Interestingly, up until the 1950s and 1960s, female labour force participation is reported to be associated with higher suicide rates as female employment was considered a violation of social norms, leading to a change in women’s social integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011408651">Newman et al., 1973</xref>). However, as female labour force participation has become normal for industrialized countries in recent decades, its adverse effects on suicide rates have vanished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408651">Burr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0020764011408651">Trovato &amp; Vos, 1992</xref>), while, consistent with our findings, unemployment has become strongly associated with suicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011408651">Milner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research evaluating the pathways leading from unemployment to psychological maladjustment are needed and strategies aiming at preventing the most negative outcomes of job loss should be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011408651">Lundin &amp; Hemmingsson, 2009</xref>).</p>
