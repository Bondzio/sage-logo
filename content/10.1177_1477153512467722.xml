<p>When meeting people outside the world of lighting I am often asked what I do. My reply is that I work in the field of lighting research, specifically the interaction of people and lighting. This almost always causes the listener to respond ‘Really?’ The words ‘Why would anyone do that?’ hang in the air. I then explain that a significant amount of all the electricity generated is used for lighting and if we are serious about sustainability and climate change finding means to reduce electricity demand is important. I also point out that lighting impacts people in many ways, from visibility, comfort and safety to human health and wellbeing. This usually results in a grudging acceptance that lighting may be worthy of study, much in the way that the archeology of the iron age is, interesting but not really relevant to the fast moving world of 24-hour news, paternity leave, ready meals and celebrity.</p>
<p>What lies behind such a response? The answer is that, for many, light has become so accessible that it is taken for granted. Light has become like oxygen. It is only when it is in short supply that we recognise how much we need it. This is a pity because lighting research is characterised by both breadth and depth and its relevance to lighting practice is growing. This issue certainly demonstrates the breadth of lighting research. It contains papers relevant to the lighting of streets for pedestrians, the value of lighting to horticulture, the extent to which the use of LEDs for road lighting will increase sky glow, as well as developments in the technology of control systems and light sources. But breadth alone is not enough. If a field of study is to advance it also has to have depth. This, too, is evident in this issue. There are papers setting out a model of the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system as well as a study of stroboscopic effects, a topic that has been dormant for many years but has been awakened by the fast response times of LEDs. As for relevance, there are papers on a method for applying the CIE mesopic photometry system and a field study of the energy savings possible with different types of control system.</p>
<p>All this suggests that lighting research is thriving. In response, I am pleased to tell you that starting in 2013, <italic>Lighting Research and Technology</italic> will be published six times a year. This will enable more quality papers to be published. It will reduce the time between publication on-line and in print and it should allow the reintroduction of the occasional discussions of published papers that have been missing for the last few years. These discussions were often very useful is placing the paper in context, identifying its limitations and, sometimes, in exposing a fundamental disagreement. The outcome of this expansion should be to fully reveal the breadth, depth and relevance of lighting research today.</p>
