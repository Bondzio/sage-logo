<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the structure of the fissure fundus on occlusal surfaces with respect to the detection of possible irregularities below the enamel-dentin junction (EDJ). Occlusal surfaces were examined by micro-computed tomography (µCT). In total, 203 third molars with clinically sound occlusal fissures or non-cavitated lesions were selected. All specimens were scanned with µCT. Subsequently, each tooth was sectioned, and each slice was investigated by stereomicroscopy. In 7 of 203 molars (3.4%), demarcated radiolucencies below the EDJ were detected by µCT. These defects were obviously of non-carious origin, because the µCT images revealed no gradient of demineralization in the dentin. In all cases, a direct pathway between the oral cavity and the dentin was evident. The comparison of the µCT sites with conventional histological images also revealed defects in the dentin. These results demonstrate that demarcated radiolucencies below the EDJ may not necessarily be caries lesions according to µCT images and may be classified as possible developmental irregularities. To avoid misinterpreting µCT data, dental researchers should carefully consider this condition when analyzing µCT images. The clinical significance of this finding is that these defects may predispose molar teeth to early-onset caries in occlusal pits and fissures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The frequent appearance of hidden caries lesions in occlusal pits and fissures was first recognized by dental practitioners at the beginning of the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512458688">Stean, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512458688">Usher, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512458688">Lavin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512458688">Millman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512458688">Lewin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512458688">Ball, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512458688">Page, 1986</xref>). However, the phenomenon of hidden caries has been known for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512458688">Hyatt, 1931</xref>). Clinically, the caries process mostly develops under a seemingly sound layer of enamel, which may hide a dentinal lesion of considerable size and activity. Contrary to this clinical appearance, it is not uncommon for bitewing radiographs to show radiolucencies approaching the dental pulp on clinically intact occlusal surfaces. Therefore, routine clinical examinations may lead to a significant under-estimation of occlusal caries lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512458688">Creanor <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512458688">Kidd <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512458688">Lussi, 1996</xref>). Concerning the high susceptibility of pits and fissures to caries, the following possible etiological factors have been identified: a highly plaque-retaining fissure morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512458688">Nagano, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512458688">Heinrich-Weltzien <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), the presence of micro-organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512458688">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>), and a reduced enamel thickness at the fissure fundus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512458688">Rohr <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>). Surprisingly, only a few studies have investigated enamel thickness at the bottom of a fissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512458688">Rohr <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512458688">Hirano and Aoba, 1995</xref>), and no studies are currently available that investigated the presence of possible irregularities below the enamel-dentin junction (EDJ) in dentin. Consequently, this study aimed to use micro-computed tomography (µCT) to detect possible irregularities below the EDJ on occlusal surfaces.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512458688">
<title>Tooth Material</title>
<p>A sample of 203 seemingly sound or (non-)cavitated upper and lower third molars was selected from a pool of teeth that had been freshly extracted from young male and female Caucasian patients for surgical or orthodontic reasons in several dental practices in Munich and Upper Bavaria, Germany. All teeth were collected anonymously; therefore, no information about medical history of the patients, tooth retention, age, and gender was available. Molar teeth with incomplete root formation, dental anomalies on any surfaces (<italic>e.g</italic>., hypomineralization, hypoplasia, fluorosis, amelogenesis, and dentinogenesis imperfecta), wear, abrasions, sealants, fillings, and artificial damage were excluded. After gross debris was removed, all teeth were carefully cleaned with an airflow device (ProphyFlex, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) and a rotating bristle brush. To prevent drying and bacterial growth, all teeth were stored immediately after extraction in containers with physiological saline containing 0.02% sodium azide. Prior to all other investigation steps, a color photograph of each surface was taken to support the subsequent histological examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512458688">
<title>Determination of the Visual Consensus Diagnosis</title>
<p>All teeth were examined visually with compressed air and the illumination of a dental light. The visual inspection was carried out according to the guidelines of UniViSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512458688">Kühnisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512458688">2011</xref>) and adhered to the following principles: For caries lesions detectable in the fissure pattern, the severity (first signs, established lesion, microcavity, or dentin exposure) and the discoloration (white, brown, or white-brown) were assessed. Additionally, the ICDAS score was registered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512458688">Pitts, 2009</xref>). Two dentists (M.G. and M.S.) performed independent visual inspections. All assessments were confirmed 2 wks later by an experienced dentist (J.K.), leading to a consensus diagnosis for each surface. In cases of differing findings, all examiners discussed the discordant results and reached a consensus agreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512458688">
<title>Determination of the Radiographic Consensus Diagnosis</title>
<p>A digital radiograph was taken of each molar with a CCD system (Sidexis, Sirona, Bensheim, Germany). The exposure time was 0.06 sec, with a cathode voltage of 60 kV and amperage of 7 mA. A standardized alignment fixture was used to reproduce the exact object-to-film distance. All digital radiographs were analyzed independently by two dentists (M.G. and M.S.) in a darkened room using the available system-related analyzing software (version 1.53, Sirona, Bensheim, Germany) with the option to adjust brightness and contrast. Each examiner performed a semi-quantitative (D-score, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512458688">Marthaler, 1966</xref>) and quantitative diagnosis (CE Index, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512458688">Kühnisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) for each surface. All radiographic decisions were re-assessed 2 wks later in collaboration with an experienced examiner (J.K.) to achieve a consensus diagnosis. When the examiners came to different conclusions, they re-assessed the corresponding radiograph, discussed their points, and modified the diagnosis accordingly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512458688">
<title>Micro-computed Tomography (µCT)</title>
<p>We used a high-resolution µCT system (µCT40, Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) to obtain digital 3D datasets of the teeth. The x-ray source was set at 70 kV and 114 µA. The sample time was 600 ms. The image resolution was fixed at a voxel size of 20 x 20 x 20 µm. For further evaluation, the reconstructed datasets were imported into ImageJ (ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; downloadable at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>), and every slice was examined for diagnosis of enamel and dentin below the fissures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512458688">Abramoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Each 3D dataset was analyzed by two blinded dentists (M.G. and M.S.). The analysis first included the detection of radiolucencies, followed by the differentiation between radiolucencies that were associated with caries lesions in the dentin compared with those with possible non-carious defects. While a gradient of demineralization was associated with a dentin caries lesion, demarcated defects in the dentin below the EDJ were associated with possible irregularities below the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512458688">Fig. 1</xref>). In cases exhibiting the presence of a demarcated defect below the EDJ, the greatest extension into the dentin was determined, and the percentage of dentin involvement was quantified. Two blinded dentists (M.G. and M.S.) measured the dentin thickness and defect extension. All datasets were re-assessed 2 wks later by a third examiner (J.K.), and decisions were finalized for each specimen. In cases of different findings, all examiners discussed their discordant measures to reach a consensus agreement.</p>

The developmental defect (left) is characterized as a sharp, demarcated defect in dentin. The caries lesion is typified by enamel demineralization and a gradient of demineralization in the dentin. The mineral loss of the caries lesion is much more pronounced adjacent to the EDJ. Toward the pre-dentin/pulp, the mineral content and the tissue density increase continuously. Nevertheless, both features can be observed at a single fissure.</p></caption>

<title>Histological Examination</title>
<p>Before each tooth was sectioned, the area of interest was determined from the available photographs and µCT-data. Based on this information, 2 cuts with a 200-µm microtome saw (Leica-SP1600, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany) resulted in 4 surfaces, which included 2 from 1 slice (200- to 300-µm thickness) and 2 from the remaining 2 sections. For precise assessment of the extension of the carious defect, all slices were examined by light microscopy (Stemi SV11 stereomicroscope, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). In this context, irregularities below the EDJ could be identified as hard-tissue defects without the presence of typical histological signs of a dentin caries lesion (<italic>e.g.</italic>, dark zone). The slice with the greatest extension for each specimen was identified, measured, digitally photographed, and stored. Following this step, the quantitative extension was determined by two blinded dentists (M.G. and M.S.). All slices were re-assessed 2 wks later, and final decisions for the presence and quantitative extension of such dentinal disorders below the EDJ were made (M.G., M.S., and J.K.). In cases of discordant findings, all of the examiners discussed their findings and reached an agreement. In addition, surfaces of the specimen with possible irregularities were prepared histologically. The sections were immersed for 24 hrs in ethanol (80%), with basic fuchsin added to achieve block staining. Then, they were fixed on a glass slide, ground further to ~20 µm, and contrast-stained with acetic light green for 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512458688">Rodrigues <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Additionally, SEM images were performed (Supra-55VP, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512458688">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed the data with Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) to perform descriptive analyses. The percentages of extension into dentin as well as width in the mesio-distal and oro-vestibular dimensions were determined following the principles of the CE Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512458688">Kühnisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). To calculate this measure, we combined the defect in the dentin (base value = 1.x/y) with the ratio of the defect extension between the EDJ and the deepest point toward the pulp (x), divided by the overall dentin thickness (y). All µCT and histological image measurements were performed with ImageJ software.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>No irregularities were detected by visual, radiographic, or stereomicroscopic examination of all molar teeth. Conversely, analysis of the µCT data revealed demarcated dentin radiolucencies below the EDJ in 7 of 203 third molars (3.4%). Because no gradient of demineralization was detectable, these cases were classified as non-carious defects. In addition, in 4 of these cases, no signs of a carious process were detected visually. Two molars were associated with an early detectable lesion stage, and 1 occlusal surface was linked with an established caries lesion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512458688">Table</xref>, Appendix Fig.). Two of 7 radiographs were associated with dentin radiolucencies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512458688">Table</xref>, Appendix Fig.). With the help of 3D analyses from the µCT datasets, it was possible to visualize a direct pathway between the bottom of the fissure and the demarcated radiolucency beyond the EDJ (Appendix Fig.) in all of these cases, which means that no protective enamel over the dentin was detected. The corresponding conventional stereomicroscopic images showed lesion characteristics comparable with those of active caries lesions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, no dark discoloration and, if applicable, a hard-tissue defect). Interestingly, in none of the rhodamine-B-enhanced slices was carious-like staining observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458688">Fig. 2</xref>, Appendix Fig.). No hard-tissue defect in dentin was observed in stereomicroscopic images of 2 cases (Appendix Fig.; tooth identification numbers 08, 53), which can be explained by a divergent section plane.</p>

<p>These irregularities lacked any clinically detectable dental anomalies as well as any visually detectable signs of carious processes in most of these cases, and the location of these irregularities in the dentin was below the EDJ. Thus, these defects may have been due to developmental disorders and/or mineralization disturbances below the EDJ during early tooth development. With respect to the missing enamel and the dentin at the bottom of the fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458688">Fig. 2</xref>), it can be speculated that these irregularities are due to cellular mechanisms that failed to establish a tight alignment between the ameloblast and odontoblast cells prior to the establishment of the EDJ. The missing mantle dentin may indicate a delayed onset of dentin development. The obviously missing inter-globular substance further specifies that dentin mineralization might be disturbed as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458688">Fig. 2</xref>). Another theory could be that clinically undetectable hypomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512458688">Dowker <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) or hypoplasia in fissures is linked with the presented disturbances below the EDJ. However, these hypotheses need to be proven in future histological investigations.</p>
<p>These findings can be further discussed with respect to 2 principal considerations. First, the clinical presence of such defects could explain the early onset and rapid progression of caries lesions on occlusal surfaces. Thus, as a consequence of direct communication between the oral cavity and the outer dentin layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458688">Fig. 2</xref>), an infection of the dentin may be inevitable immediately after tooth eruption. Hence, the initiation of caries starts below the EDJ and without a preceding enamel demineralization process. This aspect of our findings may explain the sometimes rapid progression of hidden caries lesions on pits and fissures. Second, these defects may influence the validity of the commonly used histological reference standards for the detection and diagnosis of caries. Because such irregularities cannot be obviously distinguished from caries lesions by conventional histological slices, they may be interpreted as active dentin caries lesions. Therefore, conventional histological techniques may overestimate the presence of caries, which will influence the diagnostic performance of the evaluated methods. With respect to this finding, such defects act as confounding factors that should be considered in future validation studies. Third, in 2 cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512458688">Table</xref>), radiolucencies were detected on the corresponding radiographs. Misinterpretation of such defects as caries lesions may lead to an overestimation of the patients’ caries experience and will also act as a confounding factor.</p>
<p>From the methodological point of view, the strength of the present study is the systematic histological investigation of 203 occlusal surfaces by stereomicroscopy and µCT. To our knowledge, no previous study has included such a large number of samples for the investigation of occlusal surfaces. Another unique feature of the current study is that all of these specimens were scanned three-dimensionally by µCT. This technique clearly provides more detailed information about the tooth anatomy, due to the high number of slices <italic>per</italic> tooth (nearly 400), in comparison with the reduced number of slices utilized by conventional histological examinations.</p>
<p>A possible limitation of the present study is that all of the teeth were third molars, which are generally characterized by a much more irregular fissure pattern in comparison with that of first or second permanent molars and premolars. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis is that the documented irregularities may be associated with third molars only. However, verification of this alternative hypothesis will be difficult, due to the limited availability of sound and untreated permanent molars for <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations. Therefore, our findings cannot be transferred one-to-one for first and second permanent molars or other teeth. However, we assume that the presence of such irregularities may very likely affect all types of pits and fissures. Furthermore, µCT imaging is a new technology which is not generally available. Thus, since more µCT studies with different regional tooth samples and types will be conducted in the future, it may be necessary to re-interpret these early findings. Further, a distinct prevalence rate of this irregularity cannot be deduced from this study. The number of affected teeth (3.4%) must be understood as a proportion of the investigated sample only and is not representative of a larger population, since the sample was limited to third molars only. Whether it is possible to design a representative population-based study depends on the development of a clinically applicable µCT device. As another possible drawback, investigators must determine why the methodology used has not resulted in exact pairs of images in all cases (Appendix Fig., <italic>e.g</italic>., ID nos. 08, 53). These shortcomings are due to the different laboratory requirements for each histological method as well as the divergent number of µCT scans (N ~ 400) and histological slices/sections (N = 4).</p>
<p>In summary, the described demarcated radiolucencies in the dentin below the EDJ on µCT images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512458688">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458688">2</xref>) may be interpreted as being of non-carious origin. Therefore, these demarcated radiolucencies may be explained as possible developmental irregularities. The observation that there is a direct pathway that exposes the dentin directly to oral micro-organisms could explain the increased susceptibility to caries and the phenomenon of hidden occlusal caries lesions. With respect to the possibility of such defects being misjudged as caries lesions on conventional histological images, it seems important for these findings to be taken into account when future histological studies are considered.</p>
