<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: There is a lack of prospective studies comparing the long-term outcome of endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with either a patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autograft.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: This prospective longitudinal study compared the results of isolated endoscopic ACL reconstruction utilizing a 4-strand hamstring tendon (HT) or patellar tendon (PT) autograft over a 15-year period with respect to reinjury, clinical outcomes, and the development of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Ninety consecutive patients with isolated ACL rupture were reconstructed with a PT autograft, and 90 patients received an HT autograft, with an identical surgical technique. Patients were assessed at 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years. Assessment included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament evaluation including radiographic evaluation, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, and Lysholm knee score.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Patients who received the PT graft had significantly worse outcomes compared with those who received the HT graft at 15 years for the variables of radiologically detectable osteoarthritis (grade A: 46% in PT and 69% in HT; <italic>P</italic> = .04), motion loss (extension deficit &lt;3°: 79% in PT and 94% in HT; <italic>P</italic> = .03), single-legged hop test (grade A: 65% in PT and 92% in HT; <italic>P</italic> = .001), participation in strenuous activity (very strenuous or strenuous: 62% of PT and 77% of HT; <italic>P</italic> = .04), and kneeling pain (moderate or greater pain: 42% of PT and 26% of HT; <italic>P</italic> = .04). There was no significant difference between the HT and PT groups in overall IKDC grade (grade A: 47% of PT and 57% of HT; <italic>P</italic> = .35). An ACL graft rupture occurred in 17% of the HT group and 8% of the PT group (<italic>P</italic> = .07). An ACL graft rupture was associated with nonideal tunnel position (odds ratio [OR], 5.0) and male sex (OR, 3.2). Contralateral ACL rupture occurred in significantly more PT patients (26%) than HT patients (12%) (<italic>P</italic> = .02) and was associated with age ≤18 years (OR, 4.1) and the PT graft (OR, 2.6).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using ipsilateral autograft continues to show excellent results in terms of patient satisfaction, symptoms, function, activity level, and stability. The use of HT autograft does, however, show better outcomes than the PT autograft in all of these outcome measures. Additionally, at 15 years, the HT graft–reconstructed ACLs have shown a lower rate of radiological osteoarthritis.</p>

<body>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is an injury commonly seen in young athletes. Treatment is aimed at eliminating episodes of instability, returning patients to a preinjury level of function, minimizing further meniscal or chondral damage, and reducing the risk of developing osteoarthritis. Treatment options include nonoperative rehabilitation programs and surgical reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511430375">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430375">12</xref></sup> In the young, active population, ACL reconstruction is indicated to achieve the stated treatment goals, and with modern techniques, endoscopic reconstruction is the standard of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430375">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the high frequency of the injury, ACL reconstruction is a commonly performed procedure, but debate continues over the technical aspects, in particular, the choice of graft used. Grafts in common use consist mainly of autografts such as bone–patellar tendon–bone (PT) and 4-strand hamstring tendon (HT) grafts, both ipsilateral and contralateral. Allografts and synthetic grafts are also being used, but less data are available on their efficacy and durability.</p>
<p>This prospective study looks at the long-term results of ACL reconstruction, comparing multiple outcomes after reconstruction with ipsilateral PT and HT autografts.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511430375" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained from an independent hospital Human Ethics Committee. This study is an ongoing prospective cohort study, with 15-year results being reported.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511430375">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was offered to patients who demonstrated clinical ACL instability with at least grade II Lachman and pivot-shift test results. The acute injury was managed with physical therapy to regain near full range of movement with minimal pain and swelling. After this, repeat clinical assessment was performed to confirm near or full range of movement as well as clinical instability before proceeding with surgery. Failure to achieve near full range of movement after 12 weeks was an indication to proceed with arthroscopy. At the time of surgery, it was then determined if significant meniscal injuries were present, and those requiring removal of more than one third of one meniscus were excluded from the study. There were 17 cases included in the study that had meniscal suturing. Those patients meeting all the selection criteria were then included. The process of patient selection for this study has been previously documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430375">7</xref></sup> and the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511430375">Table 1</xref>. The large number of exclusions is because of the strict criteria, which were designed to minimize the confounding variables and allow a true comparison of results between graft types.</p>

<p>From January 1993 to April 1994, 333 patients were prospectively examined and underwent surgical reconstruction of the ACL using a PT autograft. Of this group, 90 patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and were included in this study. In October 1993, the senior author (L.P.) started using the HT autograft and, after April 1994, used the HT graft exclusively. There were 39 patients who underwent surgery during the 6-month overlap period; 15 received the HT autograft, and 24 received the PT autograft. The decision of which graft to use during this period was based on the initial consultation where patients who were seen from mid-October 1993 were offered the HT autograft. From October 1993 to November 1994, 372 patients underwent ACL reconstruction using a 4-strand HT autograft. Of this group, 90 met the selection criteria and were included in this study. The patient demographics are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511430375">Table 2</xref> and have been reported in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430375">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430375">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430375">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>All procedures were performed by the senior author (L.P.). The technique was standardized for all patients and has previously been described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430375">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430375">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430375">19</xref></sup> In the PT group, the ipsilateral middle-third bone–patellar tendon–bone graft was used, and the tunnel diameter was 1 mm greater than the measured bone block diameter (range, 8-11 mm). In the HT group, a 4-strand gracilis and semitendinosus tendon graft was used, and the tunnel diameter equaled the measured diameter of the graft (range, 6-9 mm).</p>
<p>The femoral tunnel was drilled before the tibial tunnel via the anteromedial arthroscopic portal, with the knee in maximal flexion, and positioned 5 mm anterior to the posterior capsular insertion. The tibial tunnel was centered on a line between the anterior tibial spine and the posterior margin of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus, half a graft diameter lateral along that line. In all cases, the fixation consisted of a 7 × 25–mm titanium cannulated interference screw (RCI, Smith &amp; Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, Massachusetts) for both femoral and tibial fixations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511430375">
<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Both groups were treated with the same rehabilitation program. Patients began weightbearing and co-contractions of the hamstrings and quadriceps immediately after surgery. No brace was used, and crutches were discarded as soon as possible. An accelerated rehabilitation program was instituted by physical therapists, focusing on achieving full extension ideally by 14 days after surgery and full flexion and extension by 6 weeks. Jogging was commenced at 6 weeks, and return to competitive sports was restricted until 6 months and only after reconfirming knee stability on clinical examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546511430375">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>All patients were assessed by an experienced, independent examiner before surgery and 6 and 12 months after surgery, then annually for 5 years, and again at 7, 10, and 15 years after surgery. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511430375">2</xref></sup> was used, and symptoms and signs of knee function were assessed to determine the IKDC grade. From 2003 onward, the updated IKDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430375">3</xref></sup> evaluation form was used. The Lysholm knee score was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511430375">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430375">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511430375">29</xref></sup> Clinical assessment of knee stability was performed and recorded as a side-to-side difference compared with the normal contralateral knee, using the Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot-shift tests. Instrumented laxity testing was determined using the KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Corp, San Diego, California) measuring side-to-side differences in displacement on manual maximum testing. Range of motion was determined using a goniometer. Pain from kneeling on a standard carpet surface and hamstring muscle discomfort were recorded for site and severity using a visual analog scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain). Single-legged hop test was also performed as a further assessment of function.</p>
<p>Radiographs were taken at 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years after surgery including weightbearing anteroposterior (AP), 30° of flexion posteroanterior (PA), lateral, and 45° Merchant views. These were assessed by an independent, experienced musculoskeletal radiologist for evidence of degenerative change in the medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments and classified according to the IKDC guidelines as follows: A, normal; B, minimal change and barely detectable joint space narrowing; C, moderate changes and joint space narrowing of up to 50%; and D, severe changes and more than 50% joint space narrowing. The worst grade of the 3 compartments was used to assign the overall radiographic grade.</p>
<p>The radiographs were also reviewed to assess tunnel position, using methods previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430375">20</xref></sup> The radiographs were assessed on lateral view to determine the sagittal position of the femoral and tibial tunnels and reported as a percentage of the distance from the anterior to the center of the tunnel along the Blumensaat line for the femoral tunnel and from the anterior to the center of the tunnel along the tibial plateau for the tibial tunnel. On the 30° of flexion PA view, the coronal position of the tunnels was recorded, with the tibial tunnel position reported as a percentage from medial to lateral along the tibial plateau and the graft inclination angle recorded to assess overall coronal position of the graft. The ideal tunnel position has been defined as being a sagittal tibial tunnel 40% to 50% anterior, sagittal femoral tunnel 80% to 90% posterior, and coronal graft inclination greater than 17°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430375">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546511430375">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The outcomes of the continuous measurements (KT-1000 arthrometer, range of motion, Lysholm score) were compared between the 2 groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Ordered categorical variables (IKDC categories) were compared with the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relative contribution of the selected variable on the outcomes of ACL graft rupture, contralateral ACL injury, and radiographic osteoarthritis. Statistical significance was assessed at the 5% level.</p>

Within the follow-up patients, certain results within the analysis have been removed to avoid bias. The objective components of the IKDC require comparison of the reconstructed knee with the contralateral normal knee; however, 34 patients sustained a contralateral ACL rupture within the follow-up period of this study.

<p>This 15-year study provides the results of HT and PT grafts in ACL reconstruction and provides the longest prospective follow-up data currently available on endoscopic reconstructive surgery. Both techniques have shown excellent results in terms of knee symptoms and function as well as a low rate of osteoarthritis. There is, however, a high reinjury rate for both groups in terms of graft rupture and contralateral ACL rupture.</p>
<p>In this study, given that the procedure and fixation techniques were the same (other than graft choice), any differences in outcome should be attributed to the choice of graft. Earlier follow-up in this study showed no difference,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430375">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430375">18</xref></sup> as have other similar studies in the short term to midterm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511430375">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430375">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511430375">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511430375">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511430375">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511430375">28</xref></sup> It has now been shown that the HT graft is significantly better than the PT graft over the long term with respect to subjective assessments, activity level, fixed flexion deformity, and radiological osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>It appears that from 10 to 15 years of follow-up, there is a decline in several parameters in the PT group, which accounts for the emerging differences between the groups. At 10 years, there was no significant difference in extension deficit between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = .35), but at 15 years, significantly more of the PT group had an extension deficit compared with the HT group (<italic>P</italic> = .03). A similar decline in performance of the single-legged hop test was seen in the PT group between 10 and 15 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0363546511430375">Figure 9</xref>). The reason for these late-onset deficits is unclear but may be related to the onset of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The PT group showed a higher rate of radiological osteoarthritic change compared with the HT group. It is noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0363546511430375">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0363546511430375">13</xref> that the degree of osteoarthritic change in the PT group at 10 years is similar to the HT group at 15 years’ follow-up. There is a gradual progression of radiological degenerative change, which is more accelerated in the PT group than the HT group.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have assessed osteoarthritic change after ACL reconstruction. Holm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430375">11</xref></sup> compared HT and PT grafts in ACL reconstruction and found no difference in the rate of arthritis at 10 years but an increased rate compared with the contralateral knee. Liden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430375">14</xref></sup> found similar results at 7 years, with increased risk if an associated meniscal injury was present. Shelbourne and Gray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511430375">24</xref></sup> presented data with a mean of 14 years’ follow-up that found a reduced range of movement compounded the other risk factors for osteoarthritis, such as meniscal and articular cartilage injury. This association between extension deficit and osteoarthritis may well explain some of the findings in this study, but it is not possible to account for all the other variables and differences in the studies to extrapolate the results of one study to another. Oeistad et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430375">17</xref></sup> performed a systematic review and found variable rates of osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction and that there was no universal method of radiological classification, making it difficult to draw conclusions, other than that combined injuries had a higher rate of osteoarthritic change than isolated ACL injury. Louboutin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511430375">15</xref></sup> reviewed the risk factors for developing osteoarthritis 20 years after injury and again reported a higher rate of osteoarthritic change if meniscal injury was present. The same study also compared reconstructed knees to knees with cruciate ruptures managed nonoperatively and found the reconstructed knees to have a significantly lower rate of arthritis. Our study has used selection criteria that exclude cases with articular cartilage or significant meniscal injury, and therefore, differences in the rate of osteoarthritis because of these variables have been removed, leaving the graft choice as the major variable.</p>
<p>The vast literature on ACL reconstruction and osteoarthritis has not drawn any conclusions relating graft choice to the rate or degree of arthritis. The data in this study would suggest that given time and longer term follow-up, these differences are becoming evident. Why the PT graft is associated with a higher incidence of osteoarthritis than the HT graft is another area for further investigation. Joint kinematics studies comparing ACL reconstruction with the HT and PT grafts have shown that altered tibial rotation during walking is associated with the PT graft, which may account for the increased rate of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511430375">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 15 years after surgery, 29% of the HT group and 32% of the PT group had either an ACL graft rupture or contralateral ACL injury. The high rate of reinjury in either knee has been documented and investigated in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430375">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430375">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430375">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430375">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430375">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511430375">31</xref></sup> The incidence of ACL graft and contralateral ACL injury appears highest in the first 3 years after reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511430375">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511430375">3</xref>). While the overall incidence of injury to either knee seems alarmingly high, over a 15-year review period, this equates to an average 2% per annum rate of further ACL injury.</p>
<p>This study has identified risk factors for graft rupture as being nonideal tunnel position and male sex, risks for contralateral injury being age less than 18 years, and PT graft compared with HT graft. Nonideal tunnel position has been identified as a risk factor for graft rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430375">20</xref></sup> The high rate of reinjury in either knee has been documented and investigated in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430375">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430375">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430375">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430375">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430375">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430375">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511430375">31</xref></sup> It has been suggested that inappropriate ACL graft position is the most common cause of ACL graft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430375">1</xref></sup> In this study, the procedures were all performed in 1993 to 1994. At that time, the techniques for ACL reconstruction were still in the developmental stage, and the ideal tunnel position and its anatomic landmarks were still unknown. This is reflected in the finding in this study that only 37% of the HT group and 39% of the PT group had ideal tunnel placement on radiological assessment. Over time, the ideal tunnel position and the importance of achieving it have been identified and reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430375">20</xref></sup> As tunnel position improves with better understanding, it may be expected that graft rupture rates will decrease.</p>
<p>We found male sex was associated with ACL graft rupture. In contrast, Shelbourne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430375">25</xref></sup> recently reported a higher rate of ACL graft rupture in women. The higher rate of ACL graft rupture in men over women may be related to activity levels. At 2 years after surgery, a higher proportion of men than women had returned to level 1 or 2 activities (87% of men vs 71% of women; <italic>P</italic> = .01). A similar sex difference was seen preoperatively, with 79% of women compared with 93% of men reporting participating in level 1 activities before their knee injury. A study by Salmon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430375">23</xref></sup> identified a return to high-level sports as being the primary risk factor for reinjury in either knee but no difference between graft choice or sex. If men return to higher risk sports in larger proportions, it would be expected that a higher rate of graft injury would be seen.</p>
<p>There was a trend toward a higher incidence of ACL graft rupture in the HT group (17%) compared with the PT group (8%), which did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .07). However, regression analysis revealed that ACL graft rupture was not associated with graft type but rather tunnel position. Indeed, there were subtle differences between groups with respect to the placement of the tibial tunnel. The HT graft tunnels were more posterior along the tibial plateau in the sagittal plane than the PT grafts (<italic>P</italic> = .003). It has been shown previously that posterior placement of the tibial tunnel is associated with a higher incidence of ACL graft rupture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430375">20</xref></sup> and this may explain the discrepancy between the groups. In addition, there was a higher rate of return to level 1 and 2 sports in the HT group, which may also account for the trend of graft rupture.</p>
<p>The reason for the increased rate of contralateral injury in the PT group is undetermined in this study but can be speculated that because of the lower functional scores achieved in the reconstructed knee, there is more reliance placed on the contralateral knee. In addition, because of the poorer performance of the reconstructed knee, there may be overall poorer conditioning, making the contralateral knee more susceptible to injury.</p>
<p>Criticisms of this study are that the patients were not randomized and that there was a bias present because of the change in the treatment regimen. The PT group was taken as a consecutive group of patients after significant experience had been gained in the surgical technique. The HT group, however, were consecutive patients using a new graft technique with no prior experience for the surgical team and a novel fixation technique for this graft type. This leads to a bias toward the PT group. It has been noted that since the completion of the recruitment and procedural phases of this study, the techniques of fixation have been improved, which should lead to better outcomes for patients with HT grafts than those recorded in this cohort. Other areas of bias have been minimized in that all other technical aspects were standardized by having the same surgeon, same tunnel placement, same fixation, and same rehabilitation program as well as strict selection criteria removing other variables that may confound the results.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Long-term follow-up of ACL injury has shown a high reinjury rate of approximately 30% when considering graft rupture and contralateral injury. Nonideal tunnel position and male sex, but not graft type, are associated with an increased rate of graft rupture, and age less than 18 years and PT autograft are associated with contralateral ACL injury.</p>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using an ipsilateral autograft continues to show excellent results in terms of patient satisfaction, symptoms, function, activity level, and stability. The use of HT autografts does, however, show better outcomes than PT autografts in all of these outcome measures. Additionally, at 15 years, the HT graft–reconstructed ACLs have shown a lower rate of radiological osteoarthritis. The results seen in this study have led to our recommendation to use HT autografts for ACL reconstruction.</p>
