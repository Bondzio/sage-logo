<abstract>
<p>The role of the amygdala in the mediation of fear and anxiety has been extensively investigated. However, how the amygdala functions during the organization of the anxiety-like behaviors generated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) is still under investigation. The basolateral (BLA) and the central (CeA) nuclei are the main input and output stations of the amygdala. In the present study, we ethopharmacologically analyzed the behavior of rats subjected to the EPM and the tissue content of the monoamines dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and dorsal striatum (DS) of animals injected with saline or midazolam (20 and 30 nmol/0.2 µL) into the BLA or CeA. Injections of midazolam into the CeA, but not BLA, caused clear anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM. These treatments did not cause significant changes in 5-HT or DA contents in the NAc, DH, or DS of animals tested in the EPM. The data suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam in the EPM also appear to rely on GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms in the CeA, but not BLA, and do not appear to depend on 5-HT and DA mechanisms prevalent in limbic structures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several studies have focused on the anatomical connections between limbic structures involved in the generation and elaboration of the defense reaction to innately aversive stimuli for rodents, and they have provided important contributions to our understanding of the way in which these neural substrates of aversion are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881110389209">Brandão et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881110389209">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881110389209">Vianna and Brandão, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881110389209">Vianna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269881110389209">Walker and Carrive, 2003</xref>). Much evidence suggests that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) functions as a filter for unconditioned and conditioned aversive information that ascends to higher structures from the brainstem, whereas the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is mainly involved in the expression of the autonomic and somatic components of fear reactions through major projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881110389209">Campeau and Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881110389209">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110389209">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881110389209">LeDoux, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110389209">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110389209">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881110389209">Rizvi et al., 1991</xref>). Although behavioral studies have shown that enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine mechanisms inhibit the conditioned fear integrated at these amygdaloid nuclei, precisely how they operate in the BLA and CeA in the regulation of the innate fear of height and open spaces in the elevated plus maze (EPM) remains unclear. The present study is a direct extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al. (2007)</xref>, in which injections of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol into the CeA, but not BLA, produced an anxiolytic-like effect. Muscimol acts directly on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas benzodiazepines act on their own receptors. As benzodiazepines have anxiolytic actions, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity in the CeA and BLA may likely mediate the expression of behaviors associated with anxiety. In this respect, it is also of interest to examine the neurochemical changes in key structures of the limbic system after injections of benzodiazepines into the abovementioned amygdaloid nuclei of rats submitted to the EPM.</p>
<p>The mediation by dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) of affective responses has been studied extensively. Using animal models of anxiety, the tissue concentrations of DA and 5-HT and their metabolites have been examined in several limbic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881110389209">Graeff and Deakin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881110389209">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881110389209">Handley and McBlane, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881110389209">Maisonnette et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881110389209">Martijena et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881110389209">Millan, 2003</xref>). Indeed, a single exposure to diverse stressful situations causes changes in these neurotransmitter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881110389209">Carvalho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881110389209">Cuadra et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881110389209">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881110389209">Martijena et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269881110389209">Zurita et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study from our laboratory showed that injections of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol into the CeA, but not BLA, caused clear anxiolytic-like effects evaluated in the EPM without changing monoamine content (5-HT and DA) as well their metabolites DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (DH), or dorsal striatum (DS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). A natural step forward in this line of investigation is determining whether injections of a benzodiazepine have similar effects. Thus, the present study was aimed to examine the effects of microinjections of the anxiolytic midazolam into the CeA and BLA on exploratory behavior of rats exposed to the EPM, and to analyze the tissue content of DA and 5-HT and their metabolites – DOPAC and 5-HIAA – in the DH and dorsal and ventral striatum. These structures were chosen because they have important anatomical connections and are involved in interdependent functional modalities that coordinate emotional and cognitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110389209">Jackson and Moghaddam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881110389209">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>). The NAc provides an interface where stimuli with affective and emotional value access motor effector sites, and is considered to be necessary for the expression of exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110389209">Jackson and Moghaddam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881110389209">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>). The DH is associated with the formation of memory traces and emotion-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881110389209">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881110389209">Mongeau et al., 1997</xref>). The DH has also been considered to be part of a so-called behavioral inhibition system, has important anatomical connections with the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881110389209">Kemppainen et al., 2002</xref>), and exerts a crucial role in the control of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881110389209">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>). Since the DH, NAc and amygdala are part of the mesocorticolimbic system and because of the non-limbic nature of the DS and its involvement in exploratory behavior, this latter structure was also included in the study to serve as an additional control.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881110389209">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>The experiments were performed in accordance with the Brazilian Society of Neuroscience and Behavior Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In total, 82 male Wistar rats, weighing 250–300 g, from the animal house of the Campus of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Brazil, were housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± 1°C) room maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 07:00–19:00). Animals were kept in Plexiglas-walled cages and given free access to food and water throughout the experiment. The rats were randomly assigned to one of two surgery groups: BLA or CeA. In each group half of the animals were exposed and half were not exposed to the EPM test as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881110389209">
<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>The animals were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg, i.p.) and fixed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). The upper incisor bar was set 3.3 mm below the interaural line, such that the skull was horizontal between bregma and lambda. A unilateral guide-cannula (through which an injection cannula could be inserted for midazolam or saline infusions 1 week later) was stereotaxically implanted over the right BLA or CeA. With bregma as a reference point, the coordinates for the BLA were the following: 2.5 mm posterior to bregma, and 5 mm lateral to the midline (right) and dorsal/ventral, 7.7 mm. The coordinates for the CeA were the following: 2.4 mm posterior to bregma; 4 mm lateral to the midline (right); dorsal/ventral, 7.0 mm. For all groups, the cannulae were fixed to the skull with acrylic resin and two stainless steel screws. At the end of surgery, each guide-cannula was sealed with a stainless steel wire to protect it from blockage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881110389209">
<title>Microinjection procedure</title>
<p>In animals in free movement, a thin dental needle (outside diameter 0.3 mm) was introduced through the guide-cannula until its lower end was 1 mm below the guide-cannula. The injection needle was linked to a 5 µL Hamilton syringe using polyethylene tubing. The solutions were injected into the BLA or CeA at a rate of 0.2 µL/min for 1 min/site using an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The displacement of an air bubble inside the polyethylene catheter (PE-10; Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) connecting the syringe needle to the intracerebral needle was used to monitor the microinjection. The needle was held in place for an additional 1 min to maximize diffusion away from the needle tip. This procedure has been successfully used previously in this laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881110389209">Macedo et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881110389209">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0269881110389209">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>Midazolam (Roche Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos S.A., São Paulo, SP, Brazil) was dissolved in 0.9% saline solution shortly before use. We assessed exploratory behavior and neurochemical changes in rats injected with saline or midazolam (20 nmol/0.2 µL) and exposed to the EPM. Therefore, the present study involved two experiments. To analyze the effects of GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms in the BLA and CeA on exploratory behavior, animals were randomly allocated to two groups for each nucleus (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per group): (i) saline and (ii) midazolam. The animals were tested in the EPM 15 min after the injections. The injections were always performed in the right amygdala of male rats. Substantial evidence indicates sex- and hemisphere-related differences in emotional behavior. The right amygdala was chosen because the right hemisphere is specialized in emotional behavior, particularly negative affect, compared with the left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881110389209">Adamec, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110389209">Andersen and Teicher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881110389209">Cahill et al., 2004</xref>). The selection of the midazolam dose and time of testing were based on previous studies from this and other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881110389209">Castilho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881110389209">De Luca-Vinhas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110389209">Gonzalez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881110389209">Motta and Brandão, 1993</xref>). A second dose (30 nmol) of midazolam was also used to determine the dose-response curve for injections into the BLA and CeA of animals tested in the EPM. These animals did not pass through the neurochemistry study.</p>
<p>In the neurochemical study, for each nucleus, two additional groups of non-exposed rats were used: (i) saline and (ii) midazolam. These control groups were taken to the experimental room where they received injections of saline or midazolam, and they remained in their cages for 20 min before sacrifice for the monoamine assays described below. Thus, in total for each amygdaloid nucleus four groups were formed (<italic>n</italic> = 8 rats per group): saline non-exposed, saline exposed to the EPM, midazolam non-exposed, and midazolam exposed to the EPM.</p>

<sec id="section7-0269881110389209">
<title>Behavioral study</title>
<p>An EPM, described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881110389209">Anseloni and Brandão, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881110389209">Cruz-Morales et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>) was used, consisting of two open arms (50 cm × 10 cm) crossed at right angles with two closed arms of the same size. The two closed arms were enclosed by walls 50 cm high, with the exception of the central part of the maze (10 cm × 10 cm) where the open and closed arms crossed. The entire apparatus was elevated 50 cm above the floor. To prevent the rats from falling, a rim of Plexiglas (0.5 cm high) surrounded the perimeter of the open arms. The experimental sessions were recorded by a video camera interfaced with a monitor and a VCR in an adjacent room.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after the injections, each rat was gently placed in the central area of the EPM with its nose facing one of the closed arms and was allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. Before the next rat was tested, the maze was cleaned with a 20% ethanol solution. Conventional EPM measures (i.e. number of entries and time spent in the arms) were recorded. In addition, the frequency of the following ‘novel ethological categories’ were measured: (i) <italic>head dipping</italic> (dipping the head below the level of the maze floor), (ii) <italic>stretched-attend postures</italic> (the animal stretching to its full length with the forepaws, keeping the hind paws stationary, and returning to its previous position), (iii) <italic>peeping out</italic> (stretching the head and shoulders from the closed arms to the central platform or open arms), and (iv) <italic>end-arm exploration</italic> (number of entries into the end of an open-arm). These categories were previously defined for rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881110389209">Albrechet-Souza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881110389209">Anseloni and Brandão, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881110389209">Anseloni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881110389209">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881110389209">Cruz-Morales et al., 2002</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881110389209">Rodgers and Johnson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881110389209">Rodgers and Shepherd, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Monoamine assays</title>
<p>Immediately after exposure to the EPM, the animals were anesthetized with carbon dioxide for 2 min. Shortly before sacrifice by decapitation, Evans Blue (2%) was microinjected into the amygdaloid nuclei in the same volume as drug microinjections, in order to mark the site of drug injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). The brains were removed from the skull, placed on ice, and sliced (2 mm), with bregma as the reference point. Four areas from each side of the brain were then dissected, with the following plates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881110389209">Paxinos and Watson (2005)</xref> used as references: NAc (plate 15), hippocampus (plate 38), and DS (plate 15).</p>
<p>The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was equipped with a reverse-phase column (Hypurity Elite C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm and 100 Å pore diameter particle size; Hypersil, Cheshire, UK), coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). The samples were homogenized in 0.2 M perchloric acid containing dihydroxybenzylamine (DHBA), centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 6°C, and stored at −70°C for 15 days. A volume of 50 µL was then injected into the HPLC-EC system. The addition of DHBA to the tissue extracts from rats exposed and not exposed to the EPM served as an internal standard to control for the loss of tissue content. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10 AD chromatograph, with a CBM-10A communication bus module, an online DGU-14A degassing unit, and an L-ECD-6A electrochemical detector with a glassy-carbon electrode and an LC-10 AD pump. The potential was set at 850 mV (vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode). The mobile phase containing 150 mM chloroacetic acid, 120 mM NaOH, 0.67 mM EDTA, 0.86 mM sodium octylsulfate, 3.5% acetonitrile, and 2.6% tetrahydrofuran, adjusted to pH 3.0, was filtered and pumped through the system at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. All substances were quantified by comparing the peak areas to standard curves. The 5-HIAA/5-HT and DOPAC/DA ratios were used as indices of serotonergic and dopaminergic activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881110389209">Dominguez et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881110389209">2003b</xref>). For each animal, a coronal section of about 1 mm corresponding to the amygdala (0.5 mm anterior and 0.5 mm posterior to the point of guide-cannula implantation) was sliced for histological analysis as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881110389209">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>The fragments of prosencephalon were maintained in 4% formalin solution for 1 day followed by 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Serial 60 µm brain sections were cut using a microtome, thaw-mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and subjected to Nissl staining to localize the sites of injection according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881110389209">Paxinos and Watson (2005)</xref>. Groups of animals of the experiment with 30 nmol of midazolam did not pass through the neurochemistry study and received an overdose of urethane (Sigma, USA). Afterwards, the animals were intracardially perfused with saline followed by buffered 4% formalin. The brains were removed and maintained in formalin solution for 1 day and then maintained in 30% sucrose for another 3 days and subjected to the histological procedure as described above.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. For the EPM and neurochemical analyses, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, without repeated measures) was used to assess the effects of midazolam and saline injections into the BLA and CeA. Treatment (saline and midazolam) and targeted amygdaloid nucleus (BLA and CeA) were the factors. This analysis was conducted on each conventional and novel ethological measure and on data for each substance (DA, 5-HT, DOPAC, and 5-HIAA) measured in the NAc, DH, and DS of all groups of animals. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).

<p>Considering that the effects of the 20 nmol dose of midazolam on exploratory behavior in animals subjected to the EPM depended on the targeted amygdaloid nucleus, we examined the effect of a second dose (30 nmol) of this benzodiazepine to determine the dose-response curve for injections into the BLA and CeA.

<p>The effects of 30 nmol midazolam also produced a pattern of effects qualitatively similar to the 20 nmol dose on end-arm exploration and head dipping (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881110389209">Table 1</xref>, lower part).

As mentioned above, these results may be attributable to a reduction in general locomotor activity caused by this dose of midazolam, since treatment caused a trend toward a significant effect on closed-arm entries. A higher dose (40 nmol/0.2 µL) of midazolam would be expected to produce a locomotor deficit, which we previously reported after injection into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881110389209">De Luca-Vinhas et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The amygdaloid complex is composed of many functionally distinct nuclei, and GABA-benzodiazepine-mediated mechanisms in the amygdala play a regulatory role in the processing of information during fear processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110389209">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110389209">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881110389209">Vazdarjanova et al., 2001</xref>). The BLA and CeA are the main input and output stations of the amygdala. Filtering mechanisms for sensory information in the BLA were shown to be crucial for the acquisition of conditioned fear, whereas the CeA has been shown to be crucial for the expression of innate and learned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110389209">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110389209">Gonzalez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881110389209">Killcross et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881110389209">LeDoux, 1994</xref>). Behavioral studies in animals have suggested that the amygdala is involved in mediating the anti-anxiety-like effects of benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110389209">Gonzalez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110389209">Hodges et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881110389209">Kopchia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881110389209">Pesold and Treit, 1995</xref>). However, unclear are the types of anxiety-like responses that are sensitive to intra-amygdaloid infusions of benzodiazepines. For example, evidence shows that intra-amygdaloid injections of benzodiazepines increased the rate of punished responding in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110389209">Hodges et al., 1987</xref>). Passive avoidance of the open arms of the EPM, but not the passive avoidance of the burying of a shock-probe in the defensive burying test, is sensitive to local injections of benzodiazepines into the BLA whereas the opposite occurs with similar injections into the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881110389209">Pesold and Treit, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110389209">Gonzalez et al. (1996)</xref> showed that midazolam injections into the BLA caused anxiolytic-like effects in the social interaction test, but not in the EPM test. Moreover, rats with lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala exhibited a significantly greater latency to initiate and shorter duration of defensive burying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881110389209">Kopchia et al., 1992</xref>). However, electrolytic lesions of the amygdala of rats which damaged both CeA and BLA did not affect the behavioral measure in the EPM as compared with the non-lesioned animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881110389209">Treit and Menard, 1997</xref>). Thus, conflicting results may be explained on the basis of differences on the parameters used to assess fear in the different animal models of anxiety.</p>
<p>The novelty of this study is to characterize the way these amygdaloid nuclei modulate fear responses elicited by the height and open spaces of the EPM in connection with changes in the biogenic amines in key limbic structures. The present results show that unilateral injections of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam into the CeA decreased open-arm avoidance in rats in the EPM. A recent study from this laboratory showed similar anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM obtained with local injections of muscimol, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, into the CeA, indicating that these effects were caused by activation of GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, similar injections of these agents into the BLA did not cause any significant effects on the conventional measures of the EPM. The results obtained using midazolam parallel and extend the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110389209">Gonzalez et al. (1996)</xref>, who investigated the role of the BLA in the EPM. The anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam are also a confirmation of the anxiolytic-like effects caused by another benzodiazepine receptor agonist, flurazepam, in the social interaction and punished drinking tests following intra-amygdaloid injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881110389209">Higgins et al., 1991</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that the benzodiazepine component of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors within the CeA mediates the anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam in the EPM. Therefore, the involvement of BLA and CeA nuclei appears to be different when the defensive behavior is generated by the open spaces and height of the EPM.</p>
<p>The present data support the hypothesis that the CeA is the main output for the autonomic and somatic components of fear and appears to be more directly related with the expression of anxiety-related responses in the EPM. The CeA functions as a link between the amygdala and brainstem motor regions that control fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881110389209">Amaral and Price, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881110389209">Nader et al., 2000</xref>). The CeA appears to have more appropriate neural substrates to trigger fear of the height and open spaces of the EPM, since it belongs to the phylogenetically old part of the amygdala while the BLA has been referred to as the newly developed part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881110389209">Krettek and Price, 1978</xref>). The anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines in conditioned fear tests may result from enhancement of GABAergic mechanisms in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110389209">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110389209">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>). In fact, electrolytic lesions of the amygdala or injections of muscimol into the BLA have been shown to inhibit freezing behavior triggered by contextual cues previously associated with footshock or induced by dPAG aversive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881110389209">Martinez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881110389209">Oliveira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881110389209">Vianna et al., 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881110389209">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269881110389209">Zanoveli and Brandão, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269881110389209">Zanoveli et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, dysfunction of the BLA has been associated with generalized anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110389209">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881110389209">De Oca et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881110389209">Fanselow, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, one might conclude that benzodiazepine receptors in the BLA do not play a role in the anxiety-like behavior elicited by the EPM. However, the present data show that the effects of BLA injections of midazolam reduced the frequency of peeping out. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the sensitivity of peeping out to the action of benzodiazepines. Peeping out behavior reflects the reluctance of the animal to leave the security of the closed arms of the EPM. By definition, peeping out occurs exclusively in the closed arms and in the central platform, and has been related to decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881110389209">Anseloni and Brandão, 1997</xref>). Increasing the dose of midazolam injections into the BLA may increase exploratory behavior. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881110389209">Pesold and Treit (1995)</xref> detected anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam injections into the BLA at a dose of 10 µg/0.5 µL (which is five-fold larger than the dose used in the present study). In conclusion, the present study shows that the behavioral effects of intra-amygdaloid injection of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam on anxiety-like behavior depend on the specific amygdaloid nucleus.</p>
<p>The data obtained from the present neurochemistry study shed light on the relationship between the exploratory behavior of rats in the EPM, the effects of benzodiazepines in two amygdaloid nuclei that have been implicated in the organization of fear, and the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT in the DH, NAc, and DS. The findings can be summarized as the following: (i) a decrease in DA and DOPAC content was observed in the NAc of rats injected with midazolam into the BLA regardless of whether they were subjected to the EPM; (ii) midazolam injections into the CeA did not change DA or 5-HT content in the NAc, DH, or DS; and (iii) these changes in DA neurotransmission in the NAc cannot be attributed to enhanced metabolism in rats subjected to the EPM because the turnover rates of this biogenic amine were not different from those of control animals not tested in the EPM.</p>
<p>DA and 5-HT have been suggested to play a role in the regulation of emotional responses in limbic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881110389209">Graeff and Deakin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881110389209">Millan, 2003</xref>). In the present study, 5-HT and DA levels in the structures studied were not associated with the anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam injections into the CeA of animals exposed to the EPM. The NAc serves as an interface where stimuli with affective and emotional value access motor effector sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881110389209">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>). The EPM evaluates the emotional reactivity of animals through the combination of locomotor activity and fear of open spaces and height. The NAc has been suggested to be an important output center for emotional responses, and changes in monoamine content in the NAc may be implicated in several brain disorders, including anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881110389209">Sesack and Pickel, 1992</xref>). As components of the limbic system, the amygdala, hippocampus, and NAc are involved in interdependent functional modalities that coordinate emotional and cognitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881110389209">Goldstein et al., 1996</xref>). The present results showed that microinjections of midazolam into the BLA decreased DA and DOPAC concentrations in the NAc. The only behavioral category affected by this treatment was peeping out, and these changes in DA transmission in the NAc could be related to the expression of peeping out and eventually to risk assessment behavior. However, this argument may be contradicted by the fact that similar effects were also obtained in rats that were not subjected to the EPM. Both groups of rats were exposed to some degree of novelty of the experimental conditions on the test day, and the decrease in dopaminergic activity innervating the NAc may be the result of a local action of midazolam in the BLA regardless of the defensive behavior engendered by the EPM. A significant reduction in DA content was also observed in the NAc after muscimol injections into the BLA, without changing the exploratory behavior of rats subjected to the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). The BLA appears to send a dense glutamatergic projection to the NAc that synapses in close apposition to mesoaccumbens DA varicosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269881110389209">Wright et al., 1996</xref>). The flow of information in the BLA–NAc pathway, rather than playing a direct role in defensive responses to danger stimuli (e.g. the height or open spaces of the EPM), may represent functional interrelationships between mechanisms of evaluation of new stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881110389209">Goldstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881110389209">Millan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881110389209">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881110389209">Morrow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269881110389209">Wright et al., 1996</xref>). A previous study from our laboratory showed that a dopaminergic agonist and antagonist, such as apomorphine and sulpiride, respectively, did not change risk assessment behaviors in rats in the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881110389209">Garcia et al., 2005</xref>). A motor effect, attributable to the involvement of the nigrostriatal system, may also be discarded as a possible explanation for the present results because of the lack of changes in DA and 5-HT content in the DS following manipulation of the BLA and CeA.</p>
<p>The anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam in the EPM test appeared to rely on benzodiazepine–GABA mechanisms and did not appear to depend on 5-HT and DA mechanisms prevalent in limbic structures. The current findings suggest that distinct patterns of defensive behavior are differentially regulated by the CeA and BLA, with the CeA more involved than the BLA in the expression of defensive responses to the height and open spaces of the EPM. Thus, the present findings integrate these factors and may contribute to our understanding of some types of anxiety-related disorders. We purport that the analysis of biogenic amine tissue content provided useful information. The use of other techniques, such as in vivo microdialysis, may augment post mortem analyses. However, in vivo microdialysis is usually performed in one structure at a time, whereas the post mortem analysis in the present study provided an overview of concurrent changes in several limbic structures. Nevertheless, microdialysis may directly support the present findings with the use of an animal model in which animals are exposed to prolonged stressful events rather than the EPM. The aversive stimuli of a 5-min test in the EPM may not lead to sufficient changes in the BLA to alter biogenic monoamine concentrations in the structures examined in the present study. Indeed, previous studies have shown that synaptic plasticity in the BLA contributes to mechanisms underlying long-term changes in the regulation of affective behaviors. For example, during periods of stress, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is released into the amygdala, and local CRF receptor activation has been postulated to be a substrate for stress-induced alterations in affective behavior. This neuropeptide profoundly influences serotonergic and dopaminergic outputs from the raphe and ventral tegmental area, both of which innervate the NAc, DH and DS, leading to long-term synaptic plasticity and increases in the excitability of BLA neurons (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881110389209">Shekhar et al., 2005</xref>). In future studies, we intend to perform microdialysis with the use of animal models based on more prolonged exposure to aversive stimuli compared with the EPM.</p>
