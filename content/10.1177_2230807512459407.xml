<p>Indian languages are important for the understanding of debates and ideas in history in a multicultural landscape. Since English has established itself as a preferred scholarly language, Indian languages have been reduced to a mere source material for academic explorations which are easily translated or mistranslated. This whole exercise tends to lead to inaccurate interpretations of history. The world of ideas in different languages of India, therefore, is hardly known outside the given language area. This is the central argument of the present book. The author examines the ideas of Phule, Vinoba and Savarkar, associated with three different ideologies—non-Brahman, Gandhian/Vedantic and Hindu nationalist, respectively, and compares their contribution to debates on the questions of religion, caste, philosophy and nationality—subjects which have been ignored by mainstream scholarship as well as the present political discourse in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, the author introduces various themes of historical and philosophical thought which writers from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were preoccupied with. The author argues that modern Indian historiography refers to India as a one history area to form a grand national narrative. This approach tends to ignore or misinterpret the plurality of culture and discourse, traditions of modernity and locates movements and individuals as merely ‘national’ or ‘international’, ideas which may not have any bearing on these histories. This tendency has grown in the ex-colonial times. This neglect of culture-specific and language-specific avatars of modernity leads to a gap in the understanding of cultural history and treats ideas in a language as mere source material to fit into already accepted notions of modernity or national discourse. Vernacular discourse is essential to capture the volatility and nuances of thought that the English writings with their preoccupation with national histories fail to capture.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author discusses the problem of Indian philosophy. Western philosophers have not given a high philosophical status to Indian thought. Indian classical tradition in Sanskrit/Prakrit was considered of a somewhat philosophical nature while contemporary Indian thought in Indian languages has not gained that privilege, not even in India. Philosophic discussion in Marathi was concerned with a critique of dharma wherein Phule was the first to point out the bipolarity in society between the brahmanical and the non-brahmanical. Tilak was the earliest amongst the conservative modernists of twentieth century to have interpreted the Gita from an anti-Shankaracharya perspective, and made the orthodoxy furious in 1915. However, the project of modernising dharma and society seems to have failed as Marathi rationalism drew inspiration from European liberalism instead of historicising thought on dharma and modern rationality. Similarly, the role of medieval bhakti poets as the theoreticians of the rise of Maratha state has also been neglected by historians and so is the Gandhian philosophical discourse in Marathi which provides ample discussion on state, authority and socio-political change. Marathi philosophy, according to the author, needs to update itself and the classical philosophy needs to be read in terms of contemporary readings.</p>
<p>The third chapter is about Phule’s Analysis of Varna/class in the Indian society. Phule identified ‘Brahmanism’ as the ideology of dominance of Brahmans over the non-Brahmans or shudra-atishudras, which is upheld by various texts that render it as ordained by god. Therefore, his idea was to smash the ideology along with the texts associated with it as dharma in his opinion had to be equalitarian. Phule talks about the existence of a dichotomous social structure where there are two varnas or classes in opposition to and interdependent on each other. To him both peasantry and women were an undifferentiated mass and together constituted an oppressed group or shudra-atishudras. His main emphasis was to demonstrate the basis on which the oppressed can unite and annihilate the social system established by Brahmans. Therefore, Phule cannot be called a social reformer (since he was not concerned with making dharma more humane) but a revolutionary system builder with a complete system of ideas. The author concludes that in today’s context, all forces which desire and need a fundamental transformation of our society are shudra-atishudras and those who oppose them are Brahmans.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter is about Vinoba Bhave’s critique of Dharma. Vinoba was the only thinker who began his critique of religion with the argument that all dharmas are incomplete systems, a pack of tentative beliefs that human societies need, and attacked their self-assumed perfect state. Vinoba further argued that the existing structures of religion have no future if no creative praxis emerged from their body politic. For a devoted Hindu, it was quite an iconoclastic position to deny that Hinduism is a dharma even though he was not rendering religion redundant. Vinoba distinguishes the varna system as an institution sanctioned by the Dharmashastras, from caste system which is associated with hierarchies and discriminations in society and has no such sanction. However, he was neither a reformer like Ranade and nor a rebel like Phule but a follower of Shankaracharya who tried to incorporate the category of labour in the Indian metaphysics, in order to make Vedanta a complete and contemporary system and to provide Gandhian politics as an alternative to the rival ideologies. He, therefore, played a significant role in changing the Marathi discourse on dharma.</p>
<p>In the fifth chapter, the writer explores the various paradigms in debates in Marathi on Savarkar, the Hindu nationalist leader. Savarkar opposed domination of Brahmans in society, but saw caste as unavoidable with scope for reform, so that all castes can peacefully coexist. Savarkarites insist that he envisaged a nation where Hindus have an identity of their own and articulate their interests as a community in a multi-religious country. He wanted their organisation to be political and not cultural like that of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), but often used religious concepts to further his political position. Since there was nothing even remotely Hindu about him in the ‘religious’ sense, Hindu nationalists labelled him a reactive political but not Hindu, while Savarkarite scholarship in Marathi insists that his position was not communal or anti-Muslim. There is also an attempt by Savarkarites to show that there were similarities in ideas of Ambedkar and Savarkar regarding Muslim separatism and support to Partition. However, evidence shows that Savarkar visualised India as a Hindu rashtra. To establish this argument, therefore, Savarkar needs to be studied in order to be critiqued.</p>
<p>The author has identified a whole gamut of ideas, concepts and linguistic usages in Marathi and the changes they underwent over a period of time which have been entirely missed or neglected by English language scholarship and by anti-mainstream movements in Maharashtra. What is available to the readership is a confusion of discourses which are markedly different from one another. The political discourse in Maharashtra has been self-absorbed and does not respond to debates at the national level nor has a critique of this culture-specific discourse been attempted from the outside. It is imperative to understand the character of particular modernities in India before a grand narrative is talked about.</p>
