<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was twofold and involved examining the viability of using the Organizational Dissent Scale as an other-report instrument, and developing additional perceptual data related to dissent expression. A sample of 291 people completed survey questionnaire measures of organizational dissent. Equal-sized groups (<italic>n</italic> = 97) completed either a self-report, a workplace colleague other-report, or an organizational outsider other-report. Results indicated the Organizational Dissent Scale performed reliably as an other-report, but it showed some tendency for social desirability. In addition, findings suggested that certain indicators of proximity to the dissenter reduced discrepancy between self- and other-reports for upward dissent, but not lateral dissent. By comparison, lateral dissent produced the most discrepant reports of dissent expression, while displaced dissent produced the most coherent reports.</p>

<p>There has been considerable research examining organizational dissent over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2011</xref>). By definition, organizational dissent refers to “expressing disagreement or contradictory opinions about organizational practices, policies, and operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1998</xref>, p. 183). There are three important aspects to this definition: dissent must be expressed to someone, dissent must include the discussion of disagreement or opposing opinions, and disagreement or opposing opinions must be against organizational practices, policies, and/or procedures/operations. An important aspect of dissent, inferred but not explicitly discussed in this definition is the audience to whom individuals dissent. Subsequent research has identified three forms of dissent differentiated by the audience that hears dissent: upward dissent expressed to management and supervisors, lateral dissent expressed to coworkers of a similar rank, and displaced dissent expressed to family and friends outside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318913476142">Avtgis, Thomas-Maddox, Taylor, &amp; Patterson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318913476142">Croucher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913476142">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318913476142">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318913476142">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318913476142">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This line of research, however, has been limited in two fundamental ways: first, by an emphasis on self-reported dissent almost exclusively, and second by the attendant lack of perceptual data that considers how others in an interaction respond to dissenting employees. While dissent unfolds as an interactive communication process within organizations, our understanding of it has been predominantly one-sided, informed almost exclusively by self-report data. The purpose of this research then is twofold: to explore the viability of measuring dissent via other reports and to enhance perceptual data relevant to the study of dissent as an interactive process.</p>
<p>Scholars studying organizational dissent typically employ the Organizational Dissent Scale (ODS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1998</xref>). This 24-item self-report measure has been shown to have high reliability and to be an accurate measure of organizational dissent. As with other measures used in the social sciences though (specifically measures related to self-perceived conflict, argument, and verbal expression), some scholars have pointed to a potential limitation of the ODS that it functions as a self-report measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318913476142">Croucher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009</xref>). Self-report measures have been criticized for not being the most reliable indicators of one’s actual communication behaviors, particularly in comparison to other-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318913476142">Oetzel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913476142">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318913476142">Spitzberg and Hecht (1984)</xref> recommended that scholars use other-reports instead of, or in collaboration with, self-reports to reduce the bias inherent in self-reports measures.</p>
<p>In organizational research particularly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913476142">Podsakoff and Organ (1986)</xref> identified several potential problems with self-report measures. Common method variance is a well-known problem in social scientific analysis that manifests when measures used are not valid or reliable or when shared variance results simply from similarities between measures and not because of a significant relationship between constructs. A second potential problem is the consistency motif that plays out when respondents “maintain a consistent line in a series of answers, or at least what they regard as a consistent line” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913476142">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986</xref>, p. 534).</p>
<p>Social desirability represents the most notable problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318913476142">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318913476142">Ganster, Hennessey, &amp; Luthans, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913476142">Lakey &amp; Canary, 2002</xref>). Social desirability is the tendency for individuals to answer survey questions in ways that make themselves appear more culturally acceptable or positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318913476142">Ganster et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913476142">Lakey &amp; Canary, 2002</xref>). Social desirability has three effects on self-reports: it can produce spurious correlations between variables, be a suppressor variable, or be a moderator variable that conditions the relationship between variables. There are various measures used to evaluate the influence of social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318913476142">Edwards, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318913476142">Nicotera, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913476142">Podsakoff and Organ (1986)</xref> identified three additional procedural methods that could possibly remedy bias produced by self-reports: escalating the unit of analysis, separation of measurement, and scale reordering.</p>
<p>In a review of the dissent literature we found that self-reports were rarely cited as a methods limitation (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318913476142">Chung &amp; Moon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner &amp; Wargo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318913476142">O’Fallon &amp; Butterfield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318913476142">Park &amp; Keil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318913476142">Somers &amp; Casal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913476142">Taylor &amp; Curtis, 2009</xref>) and that only two studies using the ODS identified and cited it as a limitation (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner &amp; Wargo, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner (2009a)</xref> argued that respondents’ overly positive self-perceptions coupled with their positive portrayals of events may have caused dissenters to report more use of rational dissent messages. Garner’s suggestion was for researchers to incorporate more direct observation in their research methods. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner and Wargo (2009)</xref> recognized social desirability as a likely weakness. They, however, did not suggest solutions to these problems. Thus, scholars studying organizational dissent seldom discuss self-report data and do so even more rarely in relation to the ODS.</p>
<p>Other reports of dissent could provide valuable perceptual data that, with few exceptions, has been essentially absent in dissent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner &amp; Wargo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913476142">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318913476142">2009</xref>). Exceptions include examination of employees’ perceptions of organizational members depicted using either upward or lateral dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2001</xref>), employees’ perceptions of upward dissent competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2005</xref>), and subordinates’ perceptions of their supervisors responses to repetitious dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2009</xref>). Other work has considered differential perceptions of dissent expression between church leaders and members of their respective congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner &amp; Wargo, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is limited research then that examines perceptions of dissent expression and even less that directly compares people’s self-reports of dissent to other’s reports of their dissent. Collecting data that allows for the comparison of self- and other-reports of dissent expression is overdue. In an effort to establish the utility of using the ODS as an other-report, we pose the following research question:</p>
<list id="list1-0893318913476142" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>RQ1: How internally consistent is the ODS as an other-report measure?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Though there has been little research evaluating how dissent is perceived by observers of dissenting behaviors, previous research indicates that people perceive certain dissent strategies to be more favorable than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2005</xref>) and that people perceive those who express upward dissent to be more satisfied and better situated within their respective organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2001</xref>). Upward dissent tends to be positioned as a proactive communicative practice that provides valuable corrective feedback to organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318913476142">Hegstrom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2011</xref>). In contrast, lateral dissent tends to be practiced by discouraged employees seeking to vent their frustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1998</xref>). Displaced dissent is the choice of employees who are new and less seasoned in the dissent expression norms of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>). All of this suggests that some forms of dissent expression are seen more favorably than others, which could result in differential reporting of dissent. We offer a second research question to explore this possibility:</p>
<list id="list2-0893318913476142" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>RQ2: How will self- and other-reports of dissent expression vary?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Discrepancy (i.e., the difference between self- and other-reports) in dissent expression is likely the consequence of many factors, but at a fundamental level it should result from proximity to the dissenter. As such, examining proximity allows us to evaluate the way people perceive others’ dissent in the workplace. Proximity refers to structural and relational closeness or facets of the work environment that would afford one the opportunity to see and hear more or less dissent expression. Thus, proximity will be a function of how much time one spends in the company of a colleague thereby creating more opportunities for observing dissent expression. Discrepancy should be reduced when workplace colleagues spend more time together. This is less likely across ranks (e.g., when a subordinate reports about a supervisor) than within ranks (e.g., when peers of the same rank report about one another), as the power relationship between superiors and subordinates influences openness of communication across ranks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318913476142">Klaas &amp; DeNissi, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318913476142">Morand, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research suggests that organizational rank is a clear determinant of dissent expression, with supervisors and managers consistently reporting greater levels of upward dissent expression compared to those who hold nonmanagement positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2001</xref>). Conversely, nonmanagers report expressing dissent more readily, to coworkers and to family members and friends outside of work than their managerial colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, organizational status combined with perceptions of fairness to predict the type of dissent employees expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008</xref>). Clearly, one’s rank in an organization influences how employees express dissent. But does it affect the way people perceive that others in the workplace express dissent?</p>
<p>Similarly, relational closeness may influence the likelihood one will see and hear dissent expression among coworkers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing (1997)</xref> argued relational factors were an important predictor of dissent expression. Others confirmed this in subsequent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318913476142">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>). Employees are more apt to express dissent to supervisors when they have a higher quality relationship with that supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, employees rated concerns about coworker treatment as an important dissent trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>), and they considered coworker relationship quality to be one of the most important factors when expressing lateral dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2008</xref>). Given these findings, it is likely that relational factors lead to variation in how much dissent expression others in the workplace perceive. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner (2009a)</xref> found that employees chose particular messages to express dissent. At least two of these reflect the influence of relationships on dissent expression. Venting emotion and seeking emotional support assume some degree of relational backing from those who comprise the dissent audience. All of which leads to the likelihood that perceived dissent expression will fluctuate because of relational factors too. To assess the degree to which proximity (operationalized as time colleagues spend together, differences or similarity in organizational rank, and relational closeness) relates to discrepancy in dissent expression we offer the following research question:</p>
<list id="list3-0893318913476142" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>RQ3: Will discrepancy between self- and other-reports of upward and lateral dissent expression vary as a function of proximity (i.e., time colleagues spend together, differences or similarity in organizational rank, and relational closeness)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>By definition, proximity is ensured when one expresses displaced dissent as it is directed toward family members and nonwork friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1997</xref>). That is, the audience for displaced dissent already has an established degree of proximity to the dissenter. As such, we would expect greater coherence between self- and other-reports of displaced dissent when compared to dissent expressed within organizations (i.e., upward and lateral). What variation there is in coherence between self- and other-reports ought to result from the amount of time people spend together outside of work. To test these assumptions, we forward the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list4-0893318913476142" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>H1: There will be greater coherence/less discrepancy between self- and other-reports of dissent expression for displaced dissent compared to upward and lateral dissent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H2: Time spent together outside of work will be negatively relatedto discrepancy in self- and other-reports of displaced dissentexpression.</p></list-item>

<p>Two hundred ninety-one (<italic>N</italic> = 291) people participated in the study. An equal proportion of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 97) completed either a self-report of dissent expression, an other-report about a workplace colleague’s dissent expression (i.e., a colleague report), or an other-report about a family member/nonwork friend’s dissent expression (i.e., an organizational outsider report). Those who agreed to participate located both a workplace colleague to complete the colleague report and a family member or nonwork friend to complete the organizational outsider report. All three groups of participants were directed to online survey questionnaires through a cover letter that detailed the purpose and procedures of the study.</p>
<p>The initial participants were contacted through a snowball sample as part of an extra credit assignment in a communication course at a small college in New England. Of the 200 invitations sent out, 97 full sets of completed questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 48.5%.

<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The 24-item ODS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1998</xref>) measures people’s inclination to express their disagreement about workplace policies and practices to three distinct audiences. The measure uses a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranges from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree)</italic> to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The articulated/upward dimension assesses the likelihood that employees will share dissent with supervisors and management. It includes nine items (e.g., “I speak with my supervisor or someone in management when I question workplace decisions”). The latent/lateral dimension contains eight items including “I join in when other employees complain about workplace changes” and accesses the degree to which employees share dissent with coworkers. The displaced dimension, comprised of six items (e.g., “I make it a habit not to complain about work in front of my family”), gauges how often employees share dissent with nonwork friends and family members.</p>
<p>In this study, we administered the original self-report ODS to a sample of working adults. The scale achieved acceptable reliabilities for all three dimensions: upward dissent (α = 0.86, <italic>M</italic> = 30.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.72), lateral dissent (α = 0.91, <italic>M</italic> = 24.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.54), and displaced dissent (α = 0.84, <italic>M</italic> = 20.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.57). Respondents also completed a set of demographic questions.</p>
<p>The colleague report included an 18-item version of the ODS that used all items from the upward and lateral dimensions. Items were edited so that they began with “My colleague” and adjusted as necessary for pronoun use (i.e., he/she was substituted for I) and verb tense. Thus, the item “I am hesitant to question workplace policies” became “My colleague is hesitant to question workplace polices.” The upward dimension of the colleague report produced a coefficient α of 0.84 (<italic>M</italic> = 28.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.71), while the latent dimension generated a coefficient α of 0.90 (<italic>M</italic> = 25.28, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.03).</p>
<p>The dissent items were followed by a series of demographic questions and a final set of questions that asked about the colleague’s relationship with the person about whom they reported. Colleagues reported how many years they had known the person, which ranged from 1 to 20 years (<italic>M</italic> = 4.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.79), and about the average number of hours they spent daily at work with this person, which ranged from 1 to 20 hours (<italic>M</italic> = 4.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.91). Then they answered the question “How much time do you spend with this colleague outside of work?” by choosing one of the following responses: none (0), very little (1), some (2), or a considerable amount (3). The reported responses for this question ranged from 1 to 3 (<italic>M</italic> = 2.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.95). Participants also characterized the relationship they had with the workplace colleague by choosing from one of the following descriptions: we merely work together (1), we are workplace friends (2), or we are friends outside of work (3). Scores on this measure ranged from 1 to 3 (<italic>M</italic> = 2.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.68), with higher scores indicating greater relationship quality. Finally, they reported about the position of the person relative to them by selecting from the following possibilities: your supervisor, your subordinate, someone at your own rank, or other. The large majority of people reported about a coworker at the same rank (<italic>n</italic> = 71), but others reported about subordinates (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and supervisors (<italic>n</italic> = 11).</p>
<p>The organizational outsider report included modified items from just the displaced dimension of the original ODS. Thus it was comprised of six items that were altered to allow for the respondent to report about a friend or family member (“My friend or family member refuses to discuss work concerns at home”). It yielded a coefficient α of 0.84 (<italic>M</italic> = 20.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.57).</p>

<p>Regarding the first research question, reliability analysis revealed the ODS produced consistently high reliabilities in both the self-report version and in the various other-report versions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0893318913476142">Table 2</xref>). Coefficient reliabilities remained strong across all administrations and versions of the scale. This suggests the measure is adaptable to use as an other-report.</p>

<p>The second research question assessed the degree to which self- and other-reports of dissent expression varied. To determine this scores on the upward, lateral, and displaced dimensions of the ODS were compared to the same dimensions contained within the colleague and organizational outsider reports. Independent sample <italic>t-</italic>tests indicated respondents reported an inclination to use significantly more upward dissent than colleagues perceived that they used <italic>t</italic>(96) = 2.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and they reported an inclination to use significantly less lateral dissent than colleagues perceived that they used <italic>t</italic>(96) = −6.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.

<p>The third research question concerned whether discrepancy between self- and other-reports of dissent expression would vary as a result of proximity. We operationalized proximity via three variables drawn from the colleague other-reports: the amount of time employees spent together, similarity or difference in organizational rank, and relational closeness. The first of these was a colleague’s indication of the average number of hours spent in the company of the dissenter on a daily basis. The second involved consideration of the rank of dissenter relative to the employee who provided the other-report, which was either a report about a colleague at a different rank (a subordinate or supervisor, <italic>n</italic> = 26) or a peer at the same rank (<italic>n</italic> = 71). This variable was dummy coded for analysis. The third relied upon responses to the question about one’s relationship with the dissenter, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of relational closeness. A series of <italic>Pearson correlations</italic> were computed to examine the relationships between these indicators of proximity and discrepancy between self- and other-reports for both upward and lateral dissent.</p>
<p>Results indicated discrepancy between upward dissent reports related significantly to two of the three proximity indicators. Upward dissent discrepancy correlated negatively with both time spent together (<italic>r</italic> = −0.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and relational closeness (<italic>r</italic> = −0.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating there was greater coherence between self- and other-reports of upward dissent expression when employees spent more time together and when they had more friendly working relationships. Whether or not they reported about a colleague of a different rank or a peer of the same rank did not appear to influence discrepancy in upward dissent expression (<italic>r</italic> = −0.16, <italic>p</italic> = .11). Likewise, none of the proximity variables related significantly with discrepancy between self- and other-reports of lateral dissent. This suggests that discrepancy in reports about lateral dissent expression do not vary as a function of proximity to the dissenter (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0893318913476142">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To test H1, we conducted a set of <italic>paired t-</italic>tests that compared discrepancy between self- and other-reports of displaced dissent to discrepancy between self- and other-reports of both upward and lateral dissent. As suspected discrepancy was significantly lower for displaced dissent (<italic>M</italic> = 3.72) when compared to upward dissent <italic>M</italic> = 4.92, <italic>t</italic>(96) = 2.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and lateral dissent <italic>M</italic> = 6.33, (<italic>t</italic>(96) = 4.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. By comparison self- and other-reports of displaced dissent showed greater coherence than reports of either upward or lateral dissent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0893318913476142">Table 5</xref>). To address H2, we computed a <italic>Pearson correlation</italic> between displaced dissent discrepancy and time spent together outside of work. Results indicated there was a significant and negative correlation between discrepancy and time spent together (<italic>r</italic> = −0.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), suggesting that self- and other-reports displayed greater coherence as time spent together by the people who provided those reports increased.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of the current study indicate that the ODS remains internally consistent when transformed into an other-report scale, as reliability coefficients remained high in both organizational colleague and organizational outsider reports, and this held for all three dimensions of the original ODS (upward, lateral, and displaced). However, there is evidence to indicate there may be a certain degree of social desirability embedded in the ODS. Previous work characterizes upward dissent as a proactive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318913476142">Hegstrom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2011</xref>) and lateral dissent as the favored routine of aggravated employees simply looking to vent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1998</xref>). Thus, upward dissent often gets positioned as more socially acceptable than lateral dissent—with upward dissenters championing causes and lateral dissenters merely complaining about workplace problems. The current findings—with people indicating they would use more upward dissent expression and less lateral dissent expression than their colleagues corroborated hearing—buttress these distinctions and align with previous work that identifies a possible social desirability bias in people’s reports of dissent expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913476142">Garner &amp; Wargo, 2009</xref>) and with findings that indicate people know and understand that dissent messages can and are perceived as more or less appropriate and effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318913476142">Garner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913476142">Kassing, 2005</xref>). Thus, we conclude there is evidence here to suggest the ODS will reflect and perpetuate social desirability biases associated with dissent expression.</p>
<p>These findings, however, need to be qualified with regard to proximity. The overall inclination of people to express dissent is only one, potentially limited, way to understand the differences in self- and other-reports. A more refined understanding of perceptual differences apparent between self- and other-reports of dissent expression involves consideration of the discrepancy between these two reports and the proximity to the dissenter of those providing other reports. Our analysis of these factors helps qualify the differentiations noted in overall inclination to express dissent.</p>
<p>With regard to upward dissent, findings suggest that coherence between self- and other-reports is a function of proximity based on time colleagues spend together and relational closeness. Apparently, the time workplace colleagues spend together and their relational closeness make for more accurate assessments of upward dissent. Perhaps this happens because this audience is more likely to be involved in the planning of upward dissent before it is expressed, in the direct recounting of it once it has been expressed, or both. Contrastingly, those who spend less time with and are relationally distant from particular colleagues may be relying on hearsay rather than direct observation when reporting about others’ dissent expression.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the potential for proximity to reduce discrepancy between dissent reports does not appear to hold, at least with the current data set, for organizational rank. However, there was a notable bias evident in the sample with the clear majority of respondents (73%) choosing to report about a peer of the same rank, which may account for the absence of a relationship between differences in organizational rank and discrepancy in dissent reports. Indeed, the disproportionate reporting about a peer at the same rank underscores the influence of people’s comfort level and assurance in reporting about a dissenting coworker in one’s organization. The fact that people tended to choose peers of the same rank to report about versus those of a different rank suggests that many respondents gave some initial consideration to proximity when deciding about a dissenter to evaluate.</p>
<p>Future research efforts could remedy these issues by stipulating that respondents report about colleagues they directly observed dissenting compared to those they learned about through hearsay and that they report about colleagues at the same rank compared to those at different ranks. These approaches could help decipher the reasons why proximity influences the degree to which self- and other-reports of upward dissent expression differ from one another. Thus, while employees overestimated their inclination to express upward dissent, the degree of over-reporting seems to have been limited by certain indicators of proximity.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing (1997)</xref>, lateral dissent occurs out of a need to voice one’s opinions when opportunities to do so with management or supervisors remain blocked or inaccessible. In these instances, employees seek the company of colleagues to vent their frustrations. Interestingly, employees appeared to underreport the amount of lateral dissent they were inclined to express when compared to the amount their colleagues reported hearing. Subsequent analyses of proximity to the dissenter did not seem to qualify this finding. That is, neither time spent together, shared organizational rank, or relational closeness brought greater coherence between self- and other-reports of lateral dissent. This is interesting because it suggests that despite the regularity with which lateral dissent occurs, it remains the most discrepant form of dissent expression in the current data set, with less coherence between self- and other-reports than either displaced dissent or upward dissent. We confirmed the latter comparison by running an additional paired sample <italic>t-</italic>test <italic>t</italic>(96) = −2.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, which appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0893318913476142">Table 5</xref>. So, we can conclude that while lateral dissent is an important facet of coworker communication within organizations, serving specific purposes and meeting particular goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318913476142">Garner, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1997</xref>), it ends up being comparatively incongruous with regard to self- and other-perceptions. The implications of this finding should be further explored in future research by considering the repercussions of this lack of coherence on coworker relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318913476142">Sias, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparison, people appear to be most accurate in reporting displaced dissent. This can be seen in the fact that there were no significant differences between self- and other-reports of displaced dissent and in the finding that self- and other-reports of displaced dissent showed the least amount of discrepancy. The presence of a relationship between the time spent with the person about whom one reported and decreases in the discrepancy between self- and other-reports reinforced this trend. When expressing displaced dissent, people seek out audiences that are external to the organization including nonwork friends and family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1997</xref>). A contrast effect of sorts may be at work here whereby dissent expressed to these audiences stands out in greater relief amidst a backdrop of personal interaction (vs. lateral or upward dissent expressed amidst a backdrop of work related talk). Additionally, displaced dissent gets expressed to certain audiences because they are deemed safe and insulated from organizational influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913476142">Kassing, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913476142">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>). These audiences are chosen strategically because they can lend a sympathetic ear and provide some measure of counsel. In addition, they can do so without the fear of reprisal or concerns about the professional implications of discussing dissent openly. These factors contribute to a context which affords others the possibly to attend closely to dissenters and to do so without reservation. These particular contextual features likely contribute to greater coherence in the expression and perception of displaced dissent.</p>
<p>While this study makes some interesting contributions to dissent research, it does so with some apparent limitations. As mentioned above, a greater sampling of self-reports about coworkers at different ranks would help to round out what we have unearthed here. So too would a more extensive instrument that considered other variables that may influence the discrepancy in dissent expressions. Furthermore, the ODS measures employees’ general tendencies regarding the inclination to express dissent rather than actual dissent expression related to specific incidents. The research design could be refined further by considering reports about specific dissent episodes collected from both supervisors and subordinates involved in those episodes (i.e., a supervisor hearing upward dissent and a subordinate expressing it) or from two equally ranked workplace colleagues involved in an episode of lateral dissent. Doing so would narrow the focus to specific interactions and to predetermined dyads, both of which would help advance an interactive perspective on dissent expression.</p>
<p>Given these ODS shortcomings, this work advances dissent research in key aspects. In particular, it invites dissent research forward by implicating the social desirability suspected but now confirmed in the ODS and by offering viable other reports to be used in future research. Confirmation of the social desirability bias suggests future scholars be aware of and take it into consideration when collecting self-reports of people’s inclination to express dissent. Substantiating the ODS as a viable other report measure encourages the development of an interactive perspective of dissent expression—one that authenticates the communicative nature of organizational dissent. In both cases, dissent research can move forward with confidence and vitality.</p>
