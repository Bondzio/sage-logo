<p>A challenge of health technology assessment is integrating the information from different disciplines. This talk focuses on the evidence-based medicine perspective and challenges 3 assumptions of health technology assessment: assumptions about effectiveness, assumptions about coverage by health technology assessment, and assumptions about costs being immutable. Challenging these assumptions has several implications. First is the need for better evidence on effects: both low-volume, high-cost technologies and low-cost, high-volume technologies that are ineffective drains on health care systems’ resources. Second, cheap but effective technologies should be better promoted, as they can displace high-cost technologies. Finally, for effective but expensive technologies, we should work to lower the price and/or costs.</p>

<body>
<p>Health technology assessment is a young discipline, and predicting its future is a risky venture. Its past illustrates this unpredictability. In the 1800s, there was little regulation of, and no requirement for evidence of effectiveness of, drugs or other health technologies. In 1906, the first Pure Food and Drug Act in the United States (US) was concerned only with whether the label matched the contents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11424925">1</xref></sup>: “the standard of strength, quality, or purity”. In the 1930s, an outbreak of kidney toxicity from the vehicle diethylene glycol, used for “Elixir Sulfanilamide,” led to over 100 deaths and was the trigger to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) examining the safety of new drugs. Then, in 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment added the third hurdle of efficacy: the requirement that new drugs demonstrate “substantial evidence” of the drug’s efficacy for a marketed indication. These 3 standard hurdles for pharmaceuticals—(manufacturing) quality, safety, and efficacy—are not all required for many other health technologies, such as surgery, physiotherapy, diagnostics, and others.</p>
<p>With the expansion of health technologies in the last few decades, the consequent rising costs of health care have led to the “fourth hurdle” of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). While CEA has been adopted for drug subsidy in Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11424925">2</xref></sup> Canada, and more recently the United Kingdom (UK),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11424925">3</xref></sup> its use has been patchy in the rest of the world, including the US. The latter is ironic given the US contribution to methods of CEA. However, even in countries where CEA is routinely used, it is mostly limited to pharmaceuticals and only erratically used for other health technologies.</p>
<p>Currently, health technology assessment (HTA) focuses on CEA. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) focuses on evidence of effectiveness and applicability to individuals with variants of the same illness. These disciplines are complementary, and each needs to learn from the other. This article will focus on how EBM may contribute to a more efficient and useful HTA process. In particular, I want to challenge some assumptions of many CEAs: that both the efficacy and the costs are fixed and known. Efficacy and generalizability are more uncertain, and costs are more malleable than appear in many HTA reports.</p>
<p>So what can EBM bring to HTA? There are 3 main points I wish to address. First, most new technologies do not work as expected, so first of all, we need strong evidence. Second, the standard health technology approach of a CEA often ignores the clinical context and ignores many of the health technologies that sneak in “under the radar” beyond the rather limited areas that health technology focuses on currently. Thirdly, both prices and real costs are usually changeable and sometimes may be reduced by an order of magnitude.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X11424925">
<title>Most Innovations are not Advances</title>
<p>To address both unsolved old and emerging new problems, health care is constantly innovating. This innovation is laudable. However, many innovations are based on our poor understanding of the causes of health care problems and often do not work as well as expected or sometimes not at all. We also usually fail to predict all the downsides of the proposed interventions. As a consequence, most innovations do not deliver the expected net benefits promised. That may be disappointing but is a necessary element in the evolution of health technologies. We must expect that most things will not work and that we will need to weed out the ones that do not. An historical analog is Edison’s development of the light bulb filament. Edison did not invent the electric light bulb, but his genius was in the persistence to pursue a filament that would last for long enough to make it practical. When asked about his failure to find a working filament, he replied, “Young man, why would I feel like a failure, and why would I ever give up? I now know definitively over 2000 ways in which an electric light bulb does not work. Success is almost in my grasp.” Medical innovation may now be more efficient, but still many of the innovations that we propose in medicine do not work as well as we might expect or even at all and sometimes are even harmful.</p>
<p>A recent innovation is vertebroplasty, a new procedure in which cement is injected into fractured vertebrae to help stabilize it internally, which is used to treat back pain from osteoporotic fractures. The number of vertebroplasties has steadily risen over the last decade. In 2009, however, 2 randomized trials were published in <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11424925">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11424925">5</xref></sup>: both compared standard vertebroplasty against a sham vertebroplasty (a needle was inserted but no cement injected) and found no difference in effect. For a simple procedure that appeared to make good sense, the results of the vertebroplasty trials are disappointing. Its popularity illustrates that ineffective procedures can be introduced into health care and become widespread.</p>
<p>This failure of innovations is common. For example, a reanalysis of 136 consecutive trials in myeloma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X11424925">Figure 1</xref>) showed that, on average, there was only a small net benefit of the treatment, with 16 treatments being significantly worse, 82 treatments being about equivalent to standard therapy, and only 38 of the treatments showing that they were better than standard treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11424925">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11424925">7</xref></sup> Hence, progress in the treatment of myeloma rests on doing the appropriate trials of new suggested therapies against standard therapy in order to identify the occasional— about 1 in 4—small advance in treatment and the even rarer breakthrough.</p>

</fig>
<p>Even within the area of pharmaceuticals, the fairly rigorous process of technology assessment still occasionally fails: around 1.5% of new pharmaceuticals are withdrawn each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11424925">8</xref></sup> largely because of unexpected adverse effects identified in the postmarketing phase, and many of the new approvals have little or no advantage over standard therapies.</p>

<title>Most Innovations Bypass HTA</title>
<p>While the FDA processes described earlier have led to robust procedures for HTA for new pharmaceuticals or vaccines, this is not true for many nondrug interventions such as new surgical procedures, new physical procedures, new diagnostic tests, alternative medicine, or indeed management interventions within health care. The situation is much worse for other types of technologies.</p>
<p>Most surgical innovations, such as vertebroplasty, do not pass the “4 hurdles” required of pharmaceuticals. Some elements, such as an implant or prosthesis, may require some of the hurdles, but full-scale effectiveness trials are much rarer. However, the stages and processes of evaluation for surgery are likely to differ from the familiar 4-phase process for drugs. To allow for the development and learning processes that occur in surgery, an alternative evaluation model has recently been suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X11424925">9</xref></sup> Similarly, diagnostic test evaluation is a complex process, which sometimes requires randomized trials, but these can also be inappropriate or inefficient for some diagnostic questions. But many uses of tests are nondiagnostic. Among the other uses, monitoring is probably the most common, but methods for evaluation have only recently been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11424925">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Self-monitoring of blood glucose illustrates some of the problems. Self-monitoring first arose in 1975 in London: a diabetic woman wished to avoid being hospitalized for the last weeks of her pregnancy. She persuaded her doctors to be trained in monitoring at home. Within a few years, a case series in pregnancy had demonstrated that the home monitoring led to better control and shifted practice. Subsequently, the Diabetes Control and Complications trial (DCCT) showed that intensive control, in which home monitoring was an essential component, improved outcomes for insulin-dependent diabetics. Guidelines extrapolated these results and recommended self-monitoring for diabetic patients not using insulin, although the evidence for this was weak. Recent randomized trials have reversed this: the Diabetes Glycaemic Education and Monitoring (DIGEM) trial showed no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin A1C at 12 months but some worsening of aspects of quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11424925">11</xref></sup> The world market for blood glucose monitoring in 2008 was US$8.8 billion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11424925">12</xref></sup> a substantial proportion of which would have been for ineffective blood glucose monitoring in non–insulin-dependent diabetics.</p>
<p>Despite the often weaker evaluations, there are numerous effective nondrug interventions, many of which are ignored even when there is good evidence of effect at low cost. For example, exercises for chronic obstructive airway disease, heart failure, and chronic fatigue syndrome have been shown in randomized trials to have beneficial effects but are underused.</p>
<p>The nature of the evidence can also be a barrier. For example, a cheap, effective nondrug treatment is the “mother’s kiss.” Foreign bodies in the nose in young children can be very awkward to remove, sometimes requiring a general anesthetic to be able to access the foreign body and remove it physically. A recently developed technique is the mother’s or parent’s kiss in which the nostril without the foreign body is occluded and the mother blows into the mouth, forcing air up the back of the nose and pushing the foreign body out. There have been no randomized trials of this procedure, but a case series showed success in 15 of 19 attempts at using the parent’s kiss technique to remove a foreign body. The dramatic effect of the parent’s kiss technique, however, suggests an “obviousness” to the procedure that does not require testing within a randomized trial. While many methodologists have accepted the concept that some treatment effects are “obvious,” the rules of “obviousness” have been poorly described. Recently, we compiled a list of proposed interventions not requiring randomized trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11424925">13</xref></sup> to attempt to glean the rules, under which this was true. The list included many nondrug treatments including blood transfusion for severe hemorrhagic shock, defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation, closed reduction and splinting for fracture of long bones with displacement, tracheostomy for tracheal obstruction, suturing for repairing large wounds, drainage for pain associated with abscesses, pressure or suturing for arresting hemorrhage, one-way valve or underwater seal drainage for pneumothorax and hemothorax, and phototherapy for skin tuberculosis.</p>
<p>A critical feature of most of these obvious interventions is the steadiness of the natural history of the condition that is either a steady or progressive nature of the condition, resulting in high signal-to-noise ratio. By considering the time frames of the intervention and the natural history, it is possible to show a case where the relative risks are often in the order of more than 100 to 1. The nature of the rules of “obviousness” means the size of effect is generally large: large enough to exceed any plausible bias or chance. So while the exact effect size may not be known, we will usually have a reasonable lower limit that would allow an approximate weighting of benefits and costs. For example, the “mother’s kiss” for nasal foreign bodies is clearly both effective and would be, on average, cheaper (because, in successful cases, a general anesthetic would be avoided): both benefits and costs here are clear enough that a formal CEA seems unnecessary. “Obviousness” may occur for costs also. A new treatment may have at least equal effect but be “obviously” cheaper. For example, a randomized trial of an information booklet for irritable bowel syndrome showed a significant reduction in patients’ perceived symptom severity and an average of 1.5 fewer general practitioner consultations per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11424925">14</xref></sup> compared with the control group. Because the study booklet cost around £8, it clearly was both effective and cheaper (a formal CEA was also done, which confirmed this “obvious” result). Sometimes, an effective intervention may cost a little more but be so “obviously” cheap that again a formal CEA is not needed. For example, a randomized trial of an instruction sheet for women providing sputum for tuberculosis testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X11424925">15</xref></sup> increased the tuberculosis case yield from 8% to 13% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002); the (reusable) instruction sheet is so cheap, and the yield so high, that a formal CEA is not needed.</p>

<title>Costs can be Reduced, Sometimes Dramatically</title>
<p>A CEA is only applicable for the short period of time when the current price or cost is the correct one. However, the prices of drugs will change as patents run out and generics become available, and improvements in technologies can often make them cheaper. For example, analyses in the 1990s that assessed the cost-effectiveness of statins for cholesterol reduction have been radically altered by the appearance of generic statins during the current decade.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, when large randomized trials (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S], Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease [LIPID], Cholesterol and Recurrent Events [CARE]/ West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study [WOSCOPS]) showed that cholesterol reduction by statins reduced mortality, the price of statins was a concern. At several dollars per day, the statins appeared only cost-effective in very high risk groups, such as those with established coronary disease. However, prices of many statins have dropped to a few cents per day, and the cost-effectiveness results dramatically changed. In the 5 years after it came off patent in 2002, the price of simvastatin in the UK dropped by about 96%. The price reduction has not been uniform globally: prices in Australia are much higher than in the UK but even lower in New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X11424925">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lapse of patents and global competition mean that drug prices will generally decline over time. A UK study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X11424925">17</xref></sup> of 373 drugs showed a real decline in price of about 4% per year over the period from 1980 to 2000. This decline varied (standard deviation, 2.5%), with some drugs showing minimal decline (or increases) and others more rapid declines. This decline in price is just one of several reasons why using the current apparent price in a CEA might overstate the real costs of drugs. Other reasons include discounting that may occur with bulk purchases by payers and transfer payments for support of innovation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X11424925">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assuming that the costs in CEAs are immutable can lead to blinkered policy thinking. For example, in the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) policy for tuberculosis treatment in poorer countries was to give first-line treatment only, and second-line treatment of drug-resistant cases was not cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X11424925">19</xref></sup> However, this attitude risked an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis so Partners in Health convened a global meeting of experts and organizations to address the problem. The result was a global pooled procurement procedure that was able to increase supply but at reduced prices. Within a year or two, prices had dropped by 95%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X11424925">19</xref></sup> changing policy and access.</p>
<p>Such price reduction can occur for drugs but is even possible for procedures such as surgery. For example, when Australian ophthalmologist Fred Hollows tried to provide cataract surgery in Eritrea, he discovered training local doctors was not enough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X11424925">21</xref></sup> The high cost of imported intraocular lens limited access. So he worked to have a local factory built that could supply lenses at around $1 each. The process spread, with replication in Nepal and Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X11424925">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To help cope with the increasing expansion of medical treatments, tests, and procedures, HTA has been an important and necessary advance. As with any method though, it brings explicit and implicit assumptions that need challenging. This article has looked at 3 of those: assumptions about effectiveness, assumptions about coverage, and assumptions about costs being immutable. These can be summarized and analyzed by the dimensions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11424925">Table 1</xref>. The boundaries are an artificial dichotomization of 2 continuous variables. However, for the clearly effective and cheap treatments, implementation seems a safe bet; for the clearly ineffective and expensive treatments, disinvestment seems wise. For the effective but expensive, formal CEA may be needed. For some borderline cases, such as cheap treatments with unclear effectiveness, a “value of information” may help clarify what further evaluation of benefits or costs would be most worthwhile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X11424925">22</xref></sup></p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11424925">Table 1</xref> has several implications. First is the need for good evidence. While that is particularly true for high-cost technologies (upper-right quadrant), low-cost but high-volume technologies (lower right) can also be a drain on the health care system, as exemplified by the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose for non–insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Second, cheap but effective technologies (lower left) need better promotion, as they can displace high-cost technologies, as illustrated by the mother’s kiss for nasal foreign bodies. Finally, for truly worthwhile but high-cost technologies (upper left), we should work to lower the price and/or costs.</p>
