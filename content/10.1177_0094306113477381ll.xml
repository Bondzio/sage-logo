<p><italic>Strip Club</italic> offers an engaging, if bleak, portrait of gender inequality in a small-town strip club in the northeast of the United States. “The Lion’s Den” is a “run down and dirty dive,” a white “working man’s strip club,” where both the venue and clientele have fallen on hard times. Based on 14 months of participant observation research as a cocktail waitress in The Lion’s Den, Kim Price-Glynn demonstrates how organizational hierarchies, rules, and practices consolidate authority in the hands of male patrons and management.</p>
<p><italic>Strip Club</italic> includes interesting interview materials with patrons and discusses their interactions with dancers. But those interactions are not the primary focus of the book in the way they are, for example, in Katherine Frank’s <italic>G-Strings and Sympathy</italic> (2002). The book also includes interviews with dancers (and a 10-page appendix with more lengthy excerpts) which are used to good effect. In particular, the interviews with strippers reveal harm reduction strategies employed by workers, for example the cleansing rituals following a night of work at the club. But <italic>Strip Club</italic> is not an examination of the lives of women working in the sex trade as is Bernadette Barton’s <italic>Stripped: Inside the Lives of Exotic Dancers</italic> (2006). Instead, what distinguishes <italic>Strip Club</italic> from other important work on the sex industry is the deeply detailed organizational analysis it offers of one specific sex work venue.</p>
<p>Price-Glynn reports that in The Lion’s Den, employment is strictly gendered—men occupy all positions except cocktail waitress and stripper. Managers, bartenders, bouncers, doormen, and deejays all contribute to reinforcing and reproducing gender inequality. As Price-Glynn demonstrates, “male co-workers continually asserted their influence over female workers through their work routines [using] … gender and sexuality stereotypes as ways to capitalize on their dominance” (p. 18).</p>
<p>That a strip club is a “highly gendered organization” is hardly surprising. But Price-Glynn provides interesting insights into the complexity of those deeply-embedded gender and sexual dynamics. For example, while restricting the kinds of employment available to women in The Lion’s Den ensures that they lack structural authority and power, strippers also make significantly more money than their male colleagues in the club. In an instance of what Price-Glynn refers to as a “gender paradox” (producing both benefits and drawbacks), women’s higher earnings amplify the harassment they receive by male colleagues as men attempt to level the social playing field and to save face by denigrating and disciplining the women workers.</p>
<p>The author also suggests that the hostile work environment encountered by women in The Lion’s Den reflects the ways in which sex workers serve as “surrogate targets” within a broader “rape culture” (p. 96). While all women share a kind of “collective liability” under a system of male supremacy, as contemporary culture moves toward greater gender equality, Price-Glynn argues that strip clubs serve as an increasingly important sanctioned refuge for men. Those desiring access to hegemonic performances of masculinity without fear of rejection or negative repercussion can simply pay “for interactions structured to their advantage” (p. 72).</p>
<p>The strip club studied in this book closely mirrors existing stereotypes about the sex industry in which men occupy all positions of authority and women are paid, and punished, for embodying positions of sexual subordination. But Price-Glynn is careful not to make sweeping generalizations about the sex trade based on her site-specific study. She argues against “totalizing visions of stripping… without regard to the conditions under which the work is performed” (p. 152) and points to the need for comparative research with contrasting arrangements of power. Such research, she suggests, would expose “how different arrangements may produce or mitigate performances of masculinity” (p. 99).</p>
<p>Despite her palpable loathing for both the management and clientele of The Lion’s Den, the author explicitly rejects strategies that criminalize sexual performance and commercial transitions on the grounds that such policies not only ignore important differences within the trade but are also ineffective and likely to create an even greater risk of violence for sex workers. Instead, Price-Glynn offers recommendations for how to “rework” the organization of strip clubs to ensure greater safety for women workers.</p>
<p>Many of the proposed changes involve basic worker rights protections, including the right to a clean and well-maintained work environment and an end to strict gender segregation. Some changes, however, would involve broad social transformation. As Price-Glynn notes, it is not enough to put “a woman (or even a few women) into a position of power [in a strip club]… Change must also affect patrons” (p. 196). Patrons, she suggests, “should be encouraged to treat strippers and other females, with respect, even in sexual play” (p. 196).</p>
<p>The phrase “<italic>even</italic> in sexual play” is telling; women engaged in sexual play and performance are still too often viewed as “not respectable.” Insisting on respect for sex workers is a potent challenge to slut-shaming and whore-hating. In what might be called a “sexual paradox,” commercial sex venues can both reinforce the second-class status of sexualized women but can also, in Price-Glynn’s words, “reveal trajectories for the future” where “open spaces for women’s sexual expression” might exist (p. 2).</p>
<p>Indeed, such spaces, though few and far between, already exist. Reading <italic>Strip Club</italic> made me long for a comparably rich ethnographic study of a contrasting commercial sexual venue—perhaps the feminist worker-cooperative The Lusty Lady in San Francisco, a neo-burlesque performance space, or a gay or lesbian strip club in which gender does not divide audience from performer. Price-Glynn’s work should encourage a new generation of sex work scholars inspired by this compelling account to conduct precisely that kind of comparative research.</p>
