<abstract>
<p>The ever-increasing amount of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a global problem. In view of the deleterious effects of WEEE on the environment and the valuable materials that can be reused in them, many countries have focused their attention on the management of WEEE and the recovery technologies of WEEE. The Chinese government has been active in creating a legislative and institutional framework to realize WEEE recycling. In June 2009, Chinese government launched home appliances and electronics trade-in implementation solution. This paper elaborates the home appliances trade-in policy and its significant impact on the WEEE management. The trade-in policy is not only conducive to expanding the consumption demand and promoting the balance of domestic and overseas demand, but also favorable to improving the energy efficiency and reducing environmental pollution. Under this policy, China has successfully established an effective WEEE recycling system, using the financial means and network design. Experiences gained from the trade-in policy have shown that management systems of WEEE need to be designed and implemented in a multi-stakeholder dialogue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Technological innovation and intense marketing strategies engender a rapid turnover of electric and electronic equipment (EEE). At the same time, the lifespan of EEE is becoming shorter. Consequently, large amounts of waste EEE (WEEE) are constantly generated worldwide. Recent statistics indicate that the global annual volume of WEEE was expected to reach 40 million metric tonnes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12437568">UNU, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>China is the largest emerging consumer market region in the world; the EEE has been widely used in Chinese daily life, which resulted in a huge amount of WEEE. Five categories of waste household appliances (WHA) in China (i.e. TV set, refrigerator, air conditioner, washing machine and PCs) reached 164.9 million units in 2008 and are expected to reach 251.8 million units in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12437568">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). Besides the ever-increasing domestic WEEE, illegal imports of WEEE from overseas has been added to the volume of WEEE being treated in China. The Basel Convention Regional Centre (BCRC) for the Asia Pacific estimated that approximately 33 million tonnes of illegal WEEE were imported into the Asian region in 2004, with a majority of that finding its way into China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437568">BCRC, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, China is the world’s largest exporter of electronic goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12437568">MIIT, 2011</xref>). Consequently, scraps generated during EEE manufacturing processes are part of the domestic WEEE streams that cannot be ignored (Chi et al., 2010).</p>
<p>The WEEE is important not only in terms of its quantity but also in terms of its toxicity. Many of the materials contained in WEEE are highly toxic, such as chlorinated and brominated substances, toxic metals, photoactive and biologically active materials, acids, plastic and plastic additives, which can cause serious environmental problems during the stage of disposal if not properly pretreated. On the other hand, WEEE also has relatively high residual value if recycled. In view of the hazardous environmental impacts and the high residual value, management of WEEE has aroused worldwide attention in terms of legislations and technologies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12437568">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the generic chain of WEEE recycling processes and material flows as observed in China. There are two WEEE recycling sectors within the existing WEEE flow system: formal and informal sector. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12437568">Table 1</xref> summarizes the differences between the two WEEE recycling sectors. In practice, informal recycling plays an important economic role in China. Informal recycling is not only associated with serious environmental and health impacts, but also the supply deficiency of formal recyclers and the safety problems of remanufactured electronic products (Chi et al., 2010). For this situation, WEEE had become a serious problem in China both in terms of quantity and toxicity, and had aroused wide attention. Chinese government has drafted many legal documents for WEEE management (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12437568">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In China, current policy related to WEEE is focused on recycling system and the responsibilities of different stakeholders. For example, China WEEE, which became effective on 1 January 2011, sets out the responsibilities of various parties with respect to the manufacture, import, sale, repair and after-sales service of EEE, as well as the recycling and disposal of WEEE.</p>
<p>Encouraged by positive legislation development, China has successfully consolidated many new investments in the WEEE recycling industry (Chi et al., 2010). In parallel with construction of private recycling plants, many official pilot projects have been undertaken by the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in different provinces. Since December 2003, NDRC designated Qingdao, Beijing, Tianjin City and Zhejiang province as the trial demonstration administrations to establish WEEE recycling system and management method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12437568">NDRC, 2003</xref>). In 2006, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched a project dealing with electronic waste in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>However, these government pilot projects have not, as yet, seen any success, being unable to compete with the informal sector, most notably in collecting WEEE and in covering the costs of environmentally sound processing (Chi et al., 2010). This means that the current collection system challenged the sustainability of the whole formal recycling industry if sufficient supply of WEEE can not be guaranteed through formal collection channels run by public or private owners.</p>
<p>After the financial crisis, the Chinese government launched home appliances trade-in promotion program, which would not only stimulated domestic appliances consumer demand, but also helped to establish an efficient WEEE recycling system. This paper reviews and analyses the significant impact of the home appliances trade-in policy on the WEEE management in China, and provides practical experiences from this policy.</p>

<title>The trade-in of home appliances in China</title>
<p>The trade-in policy, a domestic consumption stimulus package, is a decision made upon the development status of China’s household appliance industry and the reality of consumer market to further expand the domestic demand. In June 2009, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, State Administration of Industry of Commerce, General Administration of Quality Supervision jointly launched a home appliances and electronics trade-in implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12437568">NPC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The trade-in policy was firstly implemented in nine pilot provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Fuzhou and Changsha from 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2010 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12437568">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In June 2010, the home appliances trade-in policy was launched in 19 additional provinces and cities, in addition to the existing nine pilot provinces and cities, and the implementation period will be extended to 31 December 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12437568">NPC, 2010</xref>). The 19 new additional provinces and cities include Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Dalian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Fujian, Xiamen, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12437568">Figure 2</xref>). Following the second pilot, the trade-in policy was then gradually extended to cover the whole country, and the new regions in the scheme include Xizang, Xinjiang, Hainan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Qingdao (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12437568">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The trade-in policy is funded by authorities and implemented by government-authorized facility in cooperation with a number of local stakeholders including companies and consumers. So far, trade-in home appliances including air-conditioners, TV sets, refrigerators, washing machines and computers.</p>
<p>The trade-in policy involved specific provisions on subsidizing measures, operating process, organization and implementation for replacement of household electrical appliances.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12437568">
<title>Subsidizing measures</title>
<p>Chinese government offers consumers and designated companies in pilot provinces and cities subsidies, including home appliances subsidy, freight subsidy and disposal subsidy, in which 80% of the subsidies are provided by the central government and 20% by the provincial governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12437568">NPC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The home appliances subsidy is generally 10% of the prices of the newly purchased ones; while the freight subsidy is decided by the types, specifications and transport distances of the recycled ones, namely 20–50 yuan RMB per WHA.</p>
<p>Starting from 27 April 2010, the government provides the disposal subsidy to the dismantling companies, namely 15 yuan RMB per waste TV, 20 yuan RMB per waste refrigerator, 5 yuan RMB per waste washing machine, and 15 yuan RMB per waste PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12437568">MOF and MEP, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12437568">
<title>Organization and implementation</title>
<p>The government established a licensing system for the collection, disposal and recycling of WHA, under which only enterprises with a proper licence were eligible to deal with WHA. The trade-in policy has been carried out by designated companies which include electronic retailers, collection companies and dismantling companies. These companies were officially recognized and authorized by the government to conduct the activity of WEEE recycling. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437568">Table 3</xref> summarizes the information of designated companies (Report dated Oct 28, 2011), a total of 2337 companies participated in the trade-in policy, including 1130 electronic retailers, 1104 collection companies and 103 dismantling companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437568">ISWHA, 2011a</xref>).</p>

<title>Effectiveness of China’s WHA recycling system</title>
<p>Collection and financing are two primary elements of the WEEE recycling system. To a large extent, sound network design and effective incentives for collectors and recyclers determine the success of China’s WEEE recycling system. WEEE collection was still in its infancy in China, where the informal recyclers were firmly in control of the collection system. However, a trade-in policy would be helpful to establish a new efficient WHA collection system with the active participation of 1104 designated collection companies and 103 dismantling companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, authorities guided more electronic retailers to establish a kind of cooperation to make contributions to the WHA recycling system through the domestic consumption stimulus package. Currently, there are 1130 designated retailers in China (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437568">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Under this policy, the government uses the financial means and network design to guide the consumers, collectors and recyclers to be involved in WEEE management. Within the recycling chain of WHA, various tasks such as collection, transportation, sorting and disassembly of WHAs are conducted in accordance with the policy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12437568">Figure 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12437568">Liang et al. (2009)</xref> estimated that the total amount of WHA generated in China is 206.9 million units in 2010. In 2010, the total of the collected WHA was 28.20 million units (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12437568">Table 4</xref>), which shown that the formal recycler collected about 14% of WHA in China. The number of the collected WHA will continue to increase in China. Obviously, China has successfully set up an effective WHA recycling system.</p>
<p>With the experience of the trade-in policy, some registered formal recyclers, such as Shanghai Central E-waste Recycling Co,. Ltd. and TES-AMM (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (two designated dismantling companies in Shanghai), have built the business to customer (B2C) online recovery system, which includes community recovery points, WHA recycling information terminal system in community, and convenient payment methods (e.g. selling WHA in exchange for virtual money scheme). Profiting from the implementation of the B2C service system, Shanghai Central E-waste Recycling Co,. Ltd. has established more than 1100 community recovery points in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The WHA recycling system diverts a large amount of WHA into the formal recycling sector and consequently reduces improper recycling activities and corresponding environmental pollution. In the WHA treatment process, these authorized formal recycling companies are required to monitor concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), antimony (Sb), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), beryllium (Be), tin (Sn), mercury (Hg), dust, benzene, volatile halogenated hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as well as dioxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12437568">MEP, 2010c</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12437568">
<title>Opportunities and challenges for dismantling company</title>
<p>Trade-in policy brought a great many opportunities and challenges to the development of WEEE treatment. Under this policy, a large number of WHA entered the recycling system, significant WHA recycling and treatment burdens fell on designated dismantling companies. In nine pilot provinces and cities, there were only 28 dismantling companies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437568">Table 3</xref>). The number of WHA and dismantling companies’ treatment capacity was not matched. In Guangdong province, by 23 May 2010, the rate of dismantling WHA was only 69.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12437568">ISWHA, 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>Thanks to the recycling yield and technological advances, designated dismantling companies developed various recycling technologies, allowing for better recovery of materials with minimal disposal. For instance, government statistics indicate that the total volume of collected WHA in the first pilot regions was 14.79 millon units from August 2009 to May 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12437568">MEP, 2010d</xref>). TV sets account for 81.52% of the total volume, in which cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are the dominated monitors. Discarded CRTs contain many materials that can already be recycled, such as plastic and metals, but the glass is currently more difficult to dispose of. How to distinguish between lead glass and ordinary glass is a key factor. TES-AMM is attempting to perfect the optical sorting technology to deal with the CRT glass.</p>

<sec id="section9-0734242X12437568">
<title>Increasing public environmental awareness</title>
<p>The public awareness of WEEE recycling is still low in China. Selling WEEE to individual collectors is the preferred option by Chinese households or companies for the disposal of WEEE. Nearly 60% of the generated WEEE in China went into informal recycling processes, combined with a lack of environmental awareness among WEEE collectors, recyclers and consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12437568">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). It was one underlying reason for the present low-end management of WEEE in China.</p>
<p>This China reality shows clearly that a successful recycling program must incorporate consumers’ awareness. Preparation for the trade-in programme appears to be well under way in China. The high level of awareness regarding the event can be attributed to the success of the government campaigns to educate the public about this event. On the other hand, they can benefit from the governmental fund as reported in the media. Results indicate that the implementation of the trade-in policy may be an effective way to arouse and enhance public awareness regarding environmental protection, and to change their traditional viewpoint on the WEEE.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>In view of the environmental impact induced by WEEE and the high residual value of the materials contained in WEEE, the recycling of WEEE is attracting wide attention. The recycling of WEEE in China has a lot of work to do. The trade-in policy implementation offered some experience for establishing WEEE recycling system in China: (1) the collection method chosen, including the offer of permanent and sound collection points; (2) the convenience offered to potential donors; (3) the promotion and the advertisement to improve public awareness about the programmes offered; and (4) an appropriate funding scheme provided to encourage the development of formal activities.</p>
<p>The authors’ key recommendations for the China Government as well as local authorities are presented in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12437568">
<title>Enhancement of policy enforcement</title>
<p>In the process of policy implementation, there is still a lot of work to do to better regulate the system. The management of the credit statement for WHA is the real challenge. In order to obtain benefits using credit statement, some individual consumers tended to buy cheap WHA from the second-hand market, with which they can get the subsidy when buying new home appliances. Similarly, a few of individual electronic retailers involve illegal trade in the credit statement and cheat the government subsidy.</p>
<p>Effective WHA recycling requires consumers have both knowledge about the programs offered and public environmental awareness. This essentially means that consumers need the public environmental awareness education. Authorities should encourage schools to help guide green electronics consumption through propaganda and education.</p>
<p>It is important to notice that there is a lack of data related to WHA recycling solutions on WEEE management. Being a new e-waste stream, there is an urgent need for better monitoring and control of the formal recycling sector. Consequently, it is advisable to register and to evaluate all results and then to plan and to establish regular recycling goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734242X12437568">
<title>Institutionalizing and developing the collection and recycling industry</title>
<p>The policy should not ignore the individual vendors and second-hand market. It is an urgent need for better monitoring and control of the informal recycling sector in China. In the collection system, it is vitally important to include the informal sector in the formal WEEE recycling systems instead of trying to eliminate the informal sector because the livelihoods of large population groups depends on the income from recycling activities. The informal recycling has the potential to make more valuable contribution to the recycling of WEEE if their operations can be brought into line with the requisite modern safety standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0734242X12437568">
<title>Implementing extended producer responsibility</title>
<p>Financing is the key factor of the establishment and operation of sound recycling system. An appropriate funding scheme also needs to be founded, especially under present market condition where collection and treatment costs of formal recyclers are on average much higher than that of their informal counterparts. At the present time, in order to reduce the burden of producers to pay the necessary fees for collection, transportation and recycling of WEEE, the dedicated governmental fund for supporting WHA recycling will benefit the development of enterprises. However, government financial support/subsidy is far from sufficient for WEEE recycling. This substantial and rapidly growing WEEE suggests that it is important to consider a targeted financing scheme rather than government subsidy. In the future, the extended producer responsibility with well-defined roles for all participants – producers, users, authorities and waste managers is essential for designing an effective WEEE management system.</p>
