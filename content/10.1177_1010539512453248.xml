<p>This is the second time that the <italic>APJPH</italic> has included a section of articles related to health and health services on islands. This time the supplement also includes a number of articles related to disaster management in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) has always emphasized the public health imperative of serving the health needs of the disadvantaged peoples in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes rural poor in continental regions and what we could refer to as rural islands. Given the particular needs of these areas, the APACPH has sponsored symposia on Island Health in Okinawa (2009), Kuala Lumpur (2010), and at the Seoul APACPH Conference (2011). The <italic>APJPH</italic> has reflected the interests of our members and published special issues on “Disasters,” edited by Professor Zwi in 2007, and “Pacific Health,” edited by Professors Low and Binns in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453248">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453248">2</xref></sup> In the previous volume, the increase in noncommunicable diseases in Asia-Pacific islands was one of the public health issues presented, a trend that is continuing. Island populations make up a significant proportion of the membership in APACPH, and hence, it is important to keep the issue of island health under continuing review and to update teaching and research plans. Public health is always a continuing challenge as populations and levels of development change and educate new cohorts of public health workers in disaster responses in public health.</p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region has many small island states as well as relatively large island nations with greater populations, although they may be spread over large archipelagos. The main groups of islands in the region include the Indonesian nation comprising 17 508 islands with an estimated population of around 237 million people, the world’s fourth most populous country; the Philippines with 7107 islands and a population of 92 million; and the islands of Oceania with 20 000 to 30 000 islands scattered over distances of thousands of kilometers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453248">3</xref></sup> There are also more than 30 small island nations with small populations ranging from thousands to millions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Each island has its own history and culture. The common characteristic feature is that these small islands are fragile and vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters as well as outside influence of environmental and economic changes, and recent globalization. The islands are being forced to meet new challenges as an epidemic of chronic disease sweeps across the region.</p>
<p>There were 12 million deaths in the Asia-Pacific region in the 2004 and 2.8 million were due to respiratory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453248">4</xref></sup> There has been a dramatic shift in the causes of the respiratory disease over the past 50 years from a majority of infectious causes to chronic illnesses. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease now causes 52% of respiratory deaths followed by lung cancer (17.5%). Tuberculosis still causes 10.8% and respiratory infections 16.8% of deaths. For island health services this provides the challenge of addressing multiple treatment and prevention strategies. Drug-resistant tuberculosis has become widespread in some island communities, such as parts of the Philippines, the result of previously unsupervised ineffective treatment, poverty, and coinfection with HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453248">5</xref></sup> The challenge of delivering BCG vaccination and directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) to island communities remains a major challenge. DOTS has become the standard of care in the Asia-Pacific region. But this strategy requires “significant investment in healthcare networks, laboratories, drug availability and affordability, sufficient record keeping and analysis, as well as a sustained political commitment underwriting the continuity of the service.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453248">5</xref></sup> While DOTS has resulted in improved patient compliance and treatment, the challenge remains to deliver this service to island communities.</p>
<p>The major public health risk factor for respiratory disease is tobacco smoking. It is easy for multinational companies to dump their deadly products in the region, but it is very difficult for small administrations to provide the legislation and health promotion resources to reverse the damage caused. This is an area where APACPH can assist by coordinating education of public health professionals in prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Other areas of public health that are changing are the increasing rates of obesity and heart disease in our island regions. The level of obesity continues to increase, and in a recent review, the highest average body mass index levels were found in American Samoa (males 33.7, females 36.2) compared with the lowest reported from Indonesia (males 20.4, females 21.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453248">6</xref></sup> But these figures hide wide variation, and now in the same village or on the same island obesity may occur side by side with undernutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453248">7</xref></sup> The epidemic of obesity is predisposing to an epidemic of heart disease, with an estimated 4.1 million deaths in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453248">4</xref></sup> Already diabetes is reported as causing 210 000 deaths per year, but its main impact is on predisposing to other chronic illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453248">4</xref></sup> On islands the prevention of obesity is very important for maintaining and promoting health, and with the potential for agriculture and fishery in the region healthy nutrition is feasible. One of the easiest to implement strategies for obesity prevention is to continue to promote exclusive breastfeeding for every infant, which of course has many other health benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453248">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453248">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this issue of the journal, we revisit island health with a special section on “Islands, Disasters, and Public Health” sponsored by the University of the Ryukyus, a strong supporter of APACPH, a sponsor of research, and a service provider in island health services and public health. As a small island, with less than 1% of the population of mainland Japan, Okinawa has been a public health laboratory for the past century. Renowned for the longevity of its citizens, the impact of high low-birth-weight rates and the introduction of unhealthy lifestyles following military occupation by the United States has provided an unfortunate public health experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453248">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453248">10</xref></sup> Chronic disease rates have increased and life expectancy has now fallen from the highest in Japan (and the world) to below the average for Japan for males. A very good (actually bad) example of health promotion gone wrong, and in the article by Hokama the ways the Okinawans are fighting back to retain and restore their health are documented.</p>
<p>These islands have been hit by periodic typhoons earthquakes and tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions occur around the rim of the Pacific. However, disaster planning and management have not been well prepared, especially in small islands. Severe cyclones have damaged food supplies and forests in Samoa, and the Philippines lies in the path of many typhoons that result in floods and devastate their island. Many island countries and communities are at risk due to climate change. Some island states such as Tuvalu and Maldives and parts of the Marshall Islands are likely to simply disappear by the end of the 21st century as ocean levels rise as a result of climate change produced by the larger countries. APACPH is highlighting the need to preparatory planning and the preparation of health personnel for disaster mitigation.</p>
<p>Recently, the Eastern Japan disaster demonstrated the power of a tsunami combined with the devastating pollution from the subsequent nuclear power plant accident. The earthquake and tsunami claimed more than 12 000 lives, more than 3000 were injured, more than 14 000 are still missing, and 160 000 are living in temporary shelters. Furthermore, many hundreds of thousands were evacuated from radioactive area. The Fukushima disaster is not of course the first nuclear tragedy in the Pacific. Following multiple nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands by the United States and in Tahiti by the French, environmental and human damage has resulted. The United States has conducted more than 20 series of nuclear tests at the Bikini atoll, part of the Marshall Islands during 1946 to 1958. Although the residents were evacuated to other islands to prevent radioactive pollution, return to the island 20 years later resulted in increased rates of thyroid and other diseases due to radioactive exposure, a condition known in Japanese as “hibakusha.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453248">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453248">12</xref></sup> Japanese fishermen who were working the Pacific Ocean have also been affected by radiation-related illnesses. In this issue of the journal, Drs Hayashi and Tomita discuss lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster, and their report includes some results from a survey on the radioactive contamination in breast milk in East Japan. To provide an additional perspective on the disaster, Dr Robertson describes the challenges of risk assessment, risk communication, and contingency planning for Australian expatriate staff who volunteered to assist in Japan.</p>
<p>We have experienced many natural disasters for past several years in the Asia-Pacific region including earthquakes (Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011; Yunan province, China, 2011; Myanmar, 2011), tsunamis (Ache, Indonesia, 2007; Japan, 2011), typhoon/cyclone/hurricane and floods and landslides (New Orleans, Philippine, Myanmar, and Queensland; Thailand, 2011), and volcanic eruptions (Japan, Philippine, and Indonesia). Each disaster brings its human toll to be cared for by the health services. There is much that still needs to be learned about how to minimize postdisaster damage and to promote optimal rehabilitation. Drs Krishnaswa and Low et al report on their experiences in the management of posttraumatic stress following the tsunami in Penang, using early mental health intervention. In the article by Binns, Lee, and colleagues, important ethical issues related to infant feeding in the postdisaster phase are highlighted, drawing on case studies from Indonesia, China, and Japan. The remarkable rehabilitation of health and public health services in Sri Lanka following the natural and human-made disasters in that island nation are described by Karunatilake.</p>
<p>APACPH and other public health organizations are committed to bringing improved health and well-being to the disadvantaged and poor in our region. Islands are one of these important groups that can easily be forgotten. Another group that may quickly fade from sight is those who are injured or left to recover following disasters. We hope that these articles will lead to continued discussion, promote planning, and encourage the strengthening of teaching and research in “Island Health” and “Disaster Preparedness and Response” in our schools of public health.</p>
