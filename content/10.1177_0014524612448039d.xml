<attrib>Mark 9:41</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>A little while back, in a fit of nostalgia, a manufacturer once again put little blue sachets of salt into bags of crisps. Choice became a possibility for consumers; we could have a little bit of salt or a lot. Shaking the bag vigorously enough would leave the salt more or less evenly distributed over the contents of the pack. Of course, if we were so minded, we could abstain from adding any to the bag, which would show us just how dreadful fried potato slices taste without any salt at all!</p>
<p>Today, Mark offers us a little collection of salt sayings. At first it seems that Jesus is making a simple point that resonates with the little twist of blue paper. Salt is necessary and useful, so long as it does its job. But a closer look at the material shows us that rather more is at stake. People who have thought carefully about this little portion of Mark point out that we actually have three different sayings here which seem to have been brought together because of the linking word ‘salt’. Each has a different force—each makes a different point.</p>
<p>The one in the middle is the saying that most of us associate with Jesus, probably because it is in three of our gospels. “Salt is good stuff,” he says, “but if it is no longer salty, what can you do to renew its flavour?” Jesus expects us to supply the answer to his question—you can’t revive saltiness, it’s useless. This leaves us with a little puzzle—how can salt stop being what it is, salty?</p>
<p>This mystery is compounded by the other two statements. What does it mean to be salted with fire? What is Jesus asking when he commands that his hearers have salt in themselves, and be at peace with one another? The second half of the order, to be at peace, seems sensible and consistent with what we know of the teaching of Jesus, but having salt within—that seems strange.</p>
<p>We are greatly helped in understanding these sayings if we look at their context. They come in the teaching passage that follows the dispute about greatness. In it, Jesus deals first with the issue of a competitor, then teaches about sin and the temptations that go with it, concluding with the salt sayings. However, a health warning is needed before we get stuck in: this material isn’t for the faint-hearted, there are no half-measures.</p>
<p>At the end of the dispute about greatness, we find a strong statement from Jesus: receiving a child is like receiving Christ, and to receive him is to receive the One who sent him. This leads into the follow-on unit about a competitor who was using the name of Jesus to cast out demons. Here Christ shows himself to be more generous than his disciples. If someone refrains from acting against him, he says, that person is to be regarded as a friend, not an enemy. The Lord goes on to say that meeting the need of a thirsty disciple—that is, caring for souls because of their allegiance to Christ—will be rewarded.</p>
<p>More than tolerance, then, is required of those who follow Jesus. They are to receive others as if they were Christ himself. And—they must choose to regard as friends any who refuse to harm them. Trust and acceptance and inclusive behaviour are marks of allegiance to Christ.</p>
<p>These commands are augmented by yet further demands on the disciples. The statements which follow, about millstones and maiming, are quite stark. Death by drowning, says Jesus, is preferable to being a cause of sin in another person. Not only are disciples to avoid leading others into bad behaviour, they are to cut themselves off from anything that leads them into sin. Jesus repeatedly states that it is better for a body to enter eternal life mutilated, minus hand, foot or eye, than to risk the consequences of sin.</p>
<p>There is nothing meek or mild about this teaching. Following Jesus demands decisive and determined action, nothing less will do. Disciples are to be hard on themselves and inclusive of others. To do anything else risks hell, where an individual might perish, but where the fire is always lit and ready. Which brings us back to salt and being salted with fire. It seems that the impetus for bringing together the sayings about hell and being salted is the linking word ‘fire’.</p>
<p>Fire might be understood as hinting at sacrifice, but the context suggests that purification is intended. The ever blazing fires of hell burn away sin, destroy impurities. If the disciples are salted with fire, if they know suffering, if they are burnt by their faith, their witness is purified, is refined. Their testimony is salty—the whole sachet has been used to give intensity and flavour to their evidence. Jesus insists that his followers should expect to suffer, and that their ordeal will purify and refine their faith. They will be salted with fire.</p>
<p>So, salt-free food may be good for those with health problems, but when it comes to the living witnesses, salt is essential. Jesus implies that his disciples are useless if they aren’t tasty. They are called to be distinctive and determined in their allegiance to the Lord, otherwise it is as if they were an unseasoned dish. Bland doesn’t do it when it comes to faith. Followers of Jesus must be scrumptious—it is their vocation. They are to be their salty selves.</p>
<p>The force of the saying about having salt within and living at peace now makes better sense. The body of Christ is constructed from souls whose faith is tested, salted with reality. This saltiness means that mutual trust, regard, and love are built among the disciples. The respect and security that salted faith brings enables members of the body to live at peace with one another. There is no need for competition or boundaries that exclude.</p>
<p>The teaching of the salt statements is now easier to relate to our lives as people of faith. They are part of the urgent demand of Jesus—he calls us is to be like the disciples. When times are harsh for us, says our Lord, that’s part of the process of being salted. The things that wound or destroy, disfigure or damage our lives are bad—but expected.</p>
<p>The hidden blessing, the good secreted within the bad, is that testing strips our faith to bare essentials. Adversity teaches us to cling to Christ, who has walked the worst of this world before us. When we are too weak to walk, we allow ourselves to be carried by the one who bore the cross. In difficult times, we learn to accept the prayer of others because we are no longer able to pray ourselves. We are salted with fire.</p>
<p>We are tasty souls. We are to be ourselves, and to allow the same dignity to others. We live at peace if we include and accept those who may make us feel uncomfortable. The body can only be built of salty souls. We may not be liked, but we will be a force for good. Salt is what we are meant to be. That is our calling—to keep on being salt, and yeast, and light. Amen.</p>
