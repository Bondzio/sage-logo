<abstract>
<p>We used polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, a reinforcing material, as supporting devices for securing the fascia instead of fibrin glue or Gelfoam in patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations. PGA sheets were placed lateral to the fascia graft attached using the underlay grafting technique in 6 patients. In each case, the PGA sheet had been macerated and had merged into the fascia within 1 week of the procedure. At 2 to 3 postoperative weeks, parts of the sheet had become dehydrated and detached from the fascia, revealing a new epithelialized TM underneath. Eventually, the sheet had disappeared, and complete epithelialization had been achieved at 4 to 5 postoperative weeks, resulting in the successful closure of the perforation. The repair of TM remained stable throughout the follow-up period of at least 6 months in all patients. These results suggest that PGA sheets have the potential to secure fascia grafts and to guide the epithelialization of new tissue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets were developed as an absorbable suture-reinforcing material and have been currently used to cover and protect defects after resection for various organs, suggesting that PGA sheets are useful for supporting the re-epithelialization of raw tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813492654"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813492654">3</xref></sup> We used PGA sheets (Neoveil, Gunze, Kyoto, Japan) as a substitute for fibrin glue or supporting materials such as Gelfoam to determine whether placing PGA sheets lateral to fascia grafts is a suitable method of securing and protecting grafts during the treatment of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations.</p>

<title>Design of the PGA Sheet</title>
<p>PGA consists of a degradable, absorbable polymer that can be hydrolyzed via pyruvic acid to water and carbon dioxide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref></sup> A felt-like nonwoven PGA sheet (thickness: 0.15 mm) can be produced from PGA fibers of 20 µm in diameter that are randomly oriented in all directions and mutually entangled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813492654"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). These sheets are stretchable and compatible with various wounds and can be adjusted to produce any size or shape according to the surgeon’s requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813492654">2</xref></sup>

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>The procedure was performed via an endaural approach with an ear speculum under a surgical microscope without endaural incisions. The PGA sheet was cut to an appropriate shape to fit the perforation area before surgery. After the edge of the TM perforation had been removed, a temporal fascia graft was attached to the medial side of the TM to completely close the perforation using the underlay grafting technique. Then, a PGA sheet was placed over the fascia graft, on the lateral side of the TM, to secure it in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813492654"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All 6 perforations had healed. In each case, the PGA sheets appeared to be macerated and merged into the surface of the fascia within 1 week of the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813492654"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). Furthermore, at 2 to 3 postoperative weeks, parts of the sheet had become dehydrated and detached from the fascia, revealing a newly epithelialized TM underneath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813492654"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). Eventually, as removing the remnant dried sheet, complete epithelialization of the new TM had been achieved at 4 to 5 postoperative weeks, resulting in the successful closure of the perforation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813492654"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). The repaired TM remained stable throughout the follow-up period, which lasted at least 6 months, in all patients. The mean air-bone gap value at frequencies 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz had decreased by more than 10 dB in 5 of the 6 patients. No adverse events were observed in any of the patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study describes 6 cases in which PGA sheets were placed on the external sides of fascia grafts. The sheets initially appeared to be merged with the surface of the fascia grafts and to adhere to them. PGA sheets consist of a felt-like nonwoven material and have the elasticity and flexibility to fit into irregular wound contours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref></sup> A morphological study showed that the seeded fibroblast cells adhered to the fibrous structure of poly-lactic/glycolic acid, implying fabricated scaffolds provide an adherent environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813492654">4</xref></sup> The clinical use of PGA sheets also revealed that the sheets remain adhesive to the wound surface during epithelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813492654">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813492654">2</xref></sup> Thus, PGA sheets could allow the fascia grafts to remain fixed to the margins of the perforations without deviating from the appropriate position or falling into the tympanic cavity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that PGA sheets facilitate early epithelialization of tongue and oral defects, suggesting the use of PGA sheets as scaffolds to guide the epithelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813492654">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813492654">3</xref></sup> Indeed, when PGA sheets were used to cover the surfaces of raw tongue tissue or oral defects, it was reported that they gradually dried and became detached as the epithelialization of the tissue progressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813492654">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813492654">3</xref></sup> In this study, a similar process was observed during the epithelialization of the TM; namely, the moist PGA sheets gradually dehydrated and eventually became detached from the fascia grafts as epithelialization of new TM progressed, resulting in the successful closure of the perforations. Therefore, PGA sheets seem to play a role as scaffolds in guiding the epithelialization correctly across the surface of the fascia graft.</p>
<p>Using PGA sheets has several benefits. For example, it removes the risk of infection due to pathogens within blood products such as fibrin glue and might be acceptable to patients who reject the use of fibrin glue because of possible pathogens or religious issues. In addition, placing PGA sheets on the fascia may be safer, simpler, and less time-consuming than filling the tympanic cavity with medial supporting materials such as Gelfoam, which could dislocate ossicles and affect inner ear function.</p>
<p>Moreover, no adverse events were observed in this study. It was reported that poly-lactic/glycolic acid placed on the round window niche for drug delivery to the inner ear had no marked adverse effects such as nystagmus or inflammation in the middle ear except for temporary hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813492654">5</xref></sup> It is unlikely that PGA sheets affect the middle and inner ear and cause dysfunctions therein, since PGA sheets were just placed lateral to the fascia in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PGA sheets might be a useful alternative to fibrin glue or medially placed supporting materials for securing fascia grafts and guiding the epithelialization of new tissue as scaffolds for the closure of TM perforations.</p>
