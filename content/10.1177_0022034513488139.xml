<abstract>
<p>Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a key regulator associated with the pathogenesis of gingival overgrowth (GO). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is overexpressed in GO tissues. CCN2 promotes and sustains fibrosis initiated by TGFβ. Previous studies have shown that JNK and Smad3 activation is required for TGFβ-induced CCN2 expressions in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). In this study, we have found that Src is a major signaling mediator for TGFβ-induced CCN2 expressions in HGFs. Pre-treatment with 2 Src kinase inhibitors (PP2, Src inhibitor-1) significantly reduced TGFβ1-induced CCN2 synthesis and JNK and Smad3 activation in HGFs. These results suggest that Src is an upstream signaling transducer of JNK and Smad3 with respect to TGFβ1-stimulated CCN2 expression in HGFs. We further found that curcumin significantly abrogated the TGFβ1-induced CCN2 in HGFs by inhibiting the phosphorylations of Src, JNK, and Smad3. Furthermore, curcumin inhibited TGFβ1-induced HGF migration and α-SMA expression. Curcumin potentially qualifies as a useful agent for the control of GO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gingival overgrowth (GO) is clinically manifested by generalized and fibrotic enlargement of the gingiva. It can be inherited, induced as a side-effect of systemic drugs, or idiopathic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488139">Coletta and Graner, 2006</xref>). Despite its etiology, GO is histologically characterized by the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) in the gingival tissues with various degrees of fibrosis and inflammation, and the clinical appearance is similar. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is a key regulator of the biochemical mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488139">Coletta and Graner, 2006</xref>). It is elevated in human GO tissues and is closely associated with the clinical manifestation of drug-induced GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513488139">Kuru <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Deregulated TGFβ1 expression could result in accumulation of gingival fibroblasts with specific proliferative and synthetic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488139">Coletta and Graner, 2006</xref>). Enhanced TGFβ1 increases the synthesis and reduces the proteolytic activities of fibroblasts from patients with hereditary gingival fibromatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513488139">Martelli-Junior <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). TGFβ1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition also contributes to the development of drug-induced GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513488139">Sume <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Neutralization of TGFβ1 synthesis or signaling has been proposed for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. However, since TGFβ is also involved in tumor suppression and immunosuppression, generally blocking its actions could cause deleterious effects. Treating early-stage diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis with neutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) was initially found to be secreted by HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513488139">Bradham <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>) and is induced in fibroblasts in response to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513488139">Igarishi <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513488139">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It is a matricellular protein (of the CCN protein family) that creates an environment favorable for fibrosis and is required for the maximal pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513488139">Leask and Abraham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513488139">Leask, 2012</xref>). CCN2 exerts very limited expression in normal adult mammals and is produced only by hepatic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513488139">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) and kidney mesangial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513488139">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). It is overexpressed in both drug-induced and non-drug-induced GO tissues and is positively related to the degree of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513488139">Kantarci <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Blockade of CCN2 by antisense mRNA or by anti-CCN2 antibodies inhibits TGFβ-mediated ECM production <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513488139">Leask, 2012</xref>). Therefore, CCN2 serves as a better target than TGFβ for the treatment of GO.</p>
<p>Black and Trackman have demonstrated that TGFβ1 stimulates CCN2 expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) through Rac1/Cdc42/JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488139">Black and Trackman, 2008</xref>). TGFβ1 stimulation of CCN2 in HGFs is blocked by ALK5 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513488139">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513488139">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> have reported Src as a major signaling component for the CCN2 induction by TGFβ1 in osteoblasts. The Src-family kinases play crucial roles in the transduction of fibrogenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488139">Skhirtladze <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Blockade of Src kinases inhibits collagen production in scleroderma fibroblasts and ameliorates dermal fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model. Since Src acts as a downstream signaling effector for TGFβ in certain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513488139">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488139">Skhirtladze <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513488139">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) and may function upstream of JNK in the transmission of TGFβ signals leading to expression of pro-fibrotic genes in embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513488139">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), we decided to probe whether Src also plays a role in the TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs.</p>
<p>Curcumin [1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione], the major yellow pigment in turmeric, curry, and mustard, has been used for centuries as a flavoring and coloring agent in food and as herbal medicine for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513488139">Strimpakos and Sharma, 2008</xref>). It blocks CCN2 expression in hepatic stellate cells <italic>via</italic> NFκB and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513488139">Chen and Zheng, 2008</xref>) and suppresses the pro-fibrotic actions of TGFβ in renal fibroblasts through down-regulation of TGFβ receptor type II (TβRII) expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation levels as well as c-jun activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513488139">Gaedeke <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). We recently found that curcumin could effectively inhibit thrombin-induced CCN2 synthesis in HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513488139">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We therefore investigated the effect and mechanisms of action of curcumin on TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022034513488139">
<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Under the approval of the Hospital Ethics Committee, healthy human gingival tissue was obtained from four patients during crown-lengthening procedures, with informed consent. Four primary HGF cultures were established by an explant technique as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488139">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Before TGFβ1 treatment, the cells were incubated in serum-free media for 18 hrs. In selected experiments, 4 groups of HGFs were pre-treated with 5 µM SIS3, 10 µM PD98059, 10 µM SP600125, 10 µM SB203580, 10 µM curcumin, 10 µM EGCG, 20 µM lovastatin, 10 µM PP2, 10 µM Src inhibitor-1, or 10 µM PD145065 for 1 hr before exposure to 2 ng/mL TGFβ1 for 6 hrs. Data given herein are the means of 4 experiments.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488139">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). On termination, cells were harvested, subjected to lysis, separated, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with a primary antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-link secondary antibody. Proteins were detected with the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA, USA) and analyzed with Fuji LAS-4000 lumino image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Smad3, JNK, and Src are Involved in TGFβ1-induced CCN2 Expression in HGFs</title>
<p>HGFs were first treated with 2 ng/mL of TGFβ1. TGFβ1 stimulated CCN2 protein expression after 2 hrs of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488139">Fig. 1A</xref>). The increased CCN2 protein expression was most pronounced at 4 to 6 hrs. HGFs were then pre-treated with 10 μM of ERK inhibitor PD98059, 10 μM of JNK inhibitor SP600125, 10 μM of p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, or 5 μM of Smad3 inhibitor SIS3 for 1 hr before exposure to 2 ng/mL TGFβ1 for 6 hrs, to identify the specific signal transduction pathways involved in TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs. SIS3 and SP600125 significantly abrogated the TGFβ1-induced levels of CCN2 protein, but not PD98059 or SB203580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488139">Fig. 1B</xref>). We next investigated the upstream transducer of Smad3 and JNK signaling with respect to TGFβ1-stimulated CCN2 expression in HGFs. Src is a major signaling component for TGFβ1-induced CCN2 in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513488139">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). ET-1 acts downstream of TGFβ to induce pro-fibrotic genes, including CCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513488139">Leask, 2008</xref>). An autocrine ET-1 loop results in JNK activation in scleroderma lung fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513488139">Leask, 2008</xref>). We therefore pre-treated HGFs with 2 Src kinase inhibitors (PP2 and Src inhibitor-1) or 10 µM ET<sub>A/B</sub> receptor inhibitor PD145065, followed by TGFβ1 stimulation for 6 hrs to investigate whether Src or ET-1 was involved in TGFβ1-induced CCN2 protein in HGFs. Western blot analyses demonstrated that both PP2 and Src inhibitor-1 significantly inhibited TGFβ1-induced CCN2 protein expression but not PD145065 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488139">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results are consistent with the findings that ET-1 is not a downstream mediator of TGFβ in HGFs; however, Src and canonical TGFβ signaling (ALK5/Smad) is responsible for TGFβ-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513488139">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Cell migration and myofibroblast differentiation are important in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease and are both FAK/src-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513488139">Yeo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488139">Shi-wen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Because pro-contractile protein α-SMA is the classic marker for the transdifferentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblast, we examined whether curcumin affected TGFβ1-induced migration and α-SMA expression. TGFβ1 significantly enhanced the migration of HGFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513488139">Fig. 4A</xref>). Curcumin dose-dependently inhibited fibroblast migration, as determined by both the number of fibroblasts that migrated and the distances traveled by the cells from the wound edge. At a concentration of 20 µM, curcumin completely blocked TGFβ1-induced HGFs migration. Western blot analyses demonstrated that curcumin dose-dependently inhibited the TGFβ1-induced α-SMA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513488139">Fig. 4B</xref>). At a concentration of 20 µM, curcumin completely blocked TGFβ1-induced α-SMA protein expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GO is one of the most common fibro-proliferative diseases in the oral cavity, and there are no effective medical treatments. Surgical resection is often necessary to improve esthetics, chewing function, and oral hygiene maintenance in GO. However, the recurrence after surgical excision can only be minimized, but not prevented, even under meticulous periodontal maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513488139">Hall, 1997</xref>). The potential mechanism for the rapid recurrence of GO after surgical excision is the early recruitment of platelets and coagulation factors to the surgical wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488139">Black and Trackman, 2008</xref>). Platelets are rich in lysophosphatidic acid LPA and CCN2 protein. Following surgical excision of gingival tissues, increased local levels of LPA and TGFβ1 stimulate HGFs to further induce CCN2 expression and enhance the fibrotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488139">Black and Trackman, 2008</xref>). Moreover, surgical excision of gingival tissue results in the aggregation of coagulation factors, such as thrombin. Thrombin additively induces CCN2 expression in HGFs through the PAR1/ROS/ASK1/JNK signaling pathway to perpetuate the fibrotic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513488139">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Since CCN2 is a better target than TGFβ for the treatment of GO, we focused on the signal transduction pathways involved in TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs for therapeutic relevance to the treatment and recurrence of GO.</p>
<p>The canonical Smad pathway is the chief mediator in TGFβ signaling. Most of the pro-fibrotic activities of TGFβ are mediated by Smad3. In addition to the Smad pathway, TGFβ1 stimulates CCN2 protein expression in HGFs through Rac1/Cdc42/JNK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488139">Black and Trackman, 2008</xref>). Recent studies have shown that FAK/Src is required for TGFβ-induced JNK phosphorylation. TGFβ-induced actin stress fiber formation, matrix contraction, and expression of pro-fibrotic genes are JNK-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513488139">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Src kinases were suggested to play central roles in fibroblast activation and in skin fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488139">Skhirtladze <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The FAK/src pathway may be important for pro-fibrotic CCN2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488139">Shi-wen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that Src is an essential upstream signaling transducer of JNK and Smad3, consistent with the notion that Src kinases play a central role in the regulation of both Smad and non-Smad cascades that cooperate to attain maximal TGFβ1-induced pro-fibrotic effects in HGFs.</p>
<p>Lovastatin is useful in reducing the TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488139">Black and Trackman, 2008</xref>). EGCG completely inhibited TGFβ1-induced CCN2 synthesis in buccal mucosal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488139">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Curcumin abrogates thrombin-induced CCN2 synthesis in HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513488139">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether lovastatin, curcumin, or EGCG affected TGFβ1-stimulated CCN2 expression in HGFs. We found that EGCG and curcumin were more effective than lovastatin for inhibiting TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression. Curcumin is an approved food additive and has a variety of biological activities, such as anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. Clinical trials have indicated that curcumin is well tolerated, even at high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513488139">Strimpakos and Sharma, 2008</xref>). In the normal repair process, myofibroblasts disappear from newly formed connective tissue. However, in pathological situations, myofibroblasts continue their presence in the lesions, leading to scarring or fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513488139">Leask, 2012</xref>). The finding that curcumin inhibits TGFβ1-induced HGFs migration and the α-SMA expression in HGFs suggests that treatment with curcumin may reduce the recurrence of GO.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513488139">Gaedeke <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> have demonstrated that curcumin suppresses the pro-fibrotic actions of TGFβ on renal fibroblasts through down-regulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation levels as well as c-jun activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488139">Shi-wen <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> have shown that blocking FAK/src with PP2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS) with N-acetyl cysteine alleviates the elevated contractile and migratory capability of lesional scleroderma fibroblasts. We have found that curcumin significantly attenuates the TGFβ1-induced Src, JNK, and Smad3 phosphorylations in HGFs. The requirement of Src for the TGFβ1-induced activation of JNK and Smad3 suggests that curcumin acts mainly through FAK/Src signaling. The effects of curcumin observed in this study may be attributed to its direct inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513488139">Leu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) or ROS generation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that curcumin potentially qualifies as a useful and safe agent in the treatment and for reducing the recurrence of GO by abrogating the TGFβ1-induced fibrotic phenotype <italic>via</italic> ameliorating Src activation in HGFs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that TGFβ1 stimulates CCN2 production in HGFs. The TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs could be mediated by the Src, Smad3, and the JNK pathways. We are the first to show that Src acts as an essential upstream signaling transducer of JNK and Smad3 in the regulation of TGFβ1-induced CCN2 expression in HGFs. Curcumin blocks the ability of TGFβ1 to induce cell migration as well as CCN2 and α-SMA protein expression by attenuating the TGFβ1-induced Src, JNK, and Smad3 activations in HGFs. Curcumin potentially serves as a useful agent in the treatment and reducing the recurrence of GO.</p>
