<sec id="sec1-1350650111433244"><title>Y-W Chung (ed), <italic>Micro- and nano-scale phenomena in tribology</italic>, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2012; 210 pp.: ISBN 978-1-4398-3922-5, 95 GBP (hbk)</title>
<p>Explanations of the macroscopic effects of tribology in terms of small-scale surface interactions have a long and distinguished history. However, prior to the last few decades, the nature of these events had to be largely inferred from a posteriori examination by microscopy or other forms of surface observation after either test or service. The development of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and nano-electro mechanical system (NEMS) with their consequential heavy dependence of surface phenomena for both satisfactory fabrication and subsequent operation has focused attention on these individual contact or wear events and the statistical or analytical methods of their assembly into predictive models of device performance. The development of new methods of surface analysis and examination has come to our aid and practitioners of tribology now have a range of techniques undreamt of only a few years ago.</p>
<p>This volume contains contributions from eight experienced workers in the field and evolved from an intensive short course held under the auspices of the US National Science Foundation in 2010: consequently, several of the chapters have a tutorial style. The challenges to our community are well described in the contribution from Wahl which is helped by some clear operational maps which can aid not just the novice in an appropriate choice of contact model. Continuum solutions to both dry contact and those classically lubricated are reviewed by Wang, though those coming relatively untutored in applied mathematics may find her rigorous treatment rather challenging. The influence of surface energy and the various phenomena that can contribute to adhesion under both dry and not-so-dry environments are well set out by Carpick who is careful to distinguish between surface energy—a true thermodynamic property of a surface—and the work of adhesion of a pair of surfaces which, rather like a coefficient of friction, depends on the circumstances under which the measurement procedure is carried out. Although still most easily introduced—and perhaps still most heavily used—as a topographical measurement tool, the atomic force microscope (AFM) can be configured to produce a whole host of surface measurements or images and indeed, of course, as a nano-tribometer itself. The chapter by Cannara is principally concerned with the interpretation of data from AFM used as a friction force microscope. The importance of tip and cantilever calibration is well described and the implications of recent work for the development of both MEMS and NEMS explored.</p>
<p>Many techniques can be envisaged to produce micro-textures over significant surface areas—whether of a serial nature such as laser or electron beam treatments or parallel methods relying on photolithography and differential etching. The contribution by Zou concentrates on the rapid induced crystallization of amorphous silicon, spin coating using colloidal silica nano-particles and the anodized aluminum template method.</p>
<p>Real devices always operate in real environments and are never truly dry or unlubricated—except perhaps in deep space—so Kim’s contribution on environmental effects is valuable. Simply rubbing two solids together can lead to a raft of interacting physical and chemical mechanisms—if the transient temperatures are high enough thermionic emission of electrons can occur. If the surface wears and so loses mass, then the associated bond dissociation process can be accompanied by the emission of energetic electrons, ions or radicals. Exposed surface dangling bonds will be highly reactive to stray organics, so that solid surfaces that are inert under ‘normal’ conditions can be highly reactive in tribological contacts. On the one hand, this can lead to the advantage of the tribologist if this encourages the formation of protective surface films while, on the other, it may be detrimental if these are lost at an unacceptable wear rate. In the final chapter, Martini discusses the contribution that has been made by the technique of molecular dynamics to tribology and the opportunities it presents with particular reference to atomic-scale friction and thin film lubrication.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information packed into these 200 pages and the individual sections are all well and comprehensively referenced. Inevitably in a collaborative effort of this sort, there is some overlap of treatment but it is pleasing to see that, in general, there is a uniformity of nomenclature. Well illustrated with ca. 100 diagrams and figures the volume would be useful resource to more than just those setting out into this expanding are of study. While the names of the contributors will be known to those already working in the field, it is rather a shame that their affiliation is not included in the book’s contents page.</p>
