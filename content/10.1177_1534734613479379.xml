<abstract>
<p>Chronic skin ulcers require extensive, systemic differential diagnosis; thus, they are difficult to diagnose and treat. Transient or persistent hypercoagulable states are among the rare causes of skin ulcers. Here, we present the case of a 27-year-old woman patient with recurrent, nonhealing skin ulcers of 8 years’ duration, who had been treated unsuccessfully with various medications under different diagnoses at different clinics. On admission, a skin biopsy demonstrated occlusive vasculopathy, and the search for an inherited hypercoagulable state revealed a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated with anticoagulants and hyperbaric oxygen. On treatment, the skin lesions healed and did not recur.</p>

<p>Among the rare etiologies underlying skin ulcers are transient or persistent hypercoagulable states, for which various therapy options are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479379">1</xref></sup> These etiologies include factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, and congenital or acquired protein C and/or protein S deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479379">2</xref></sup> With an incidence of 12% to 40%, FVL mutation is the most common etiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479379">3</xref></sup> The prevalence of FVL in the normal population varies between 2% and 10%. Up to 50% of FVL carriers born to symptomatic families may experience venous thromboembolism during their lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479379">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479379">3</xref></sup> FVL mutation causes thrombosis, mainly in veins, and the skin is one of the most affected sites. Here, we present the case of a 27-year-old woman with recurrent, nonhealing skin ulcers of 8 years’ duration, in whom the search for an inherited hypercoagulable state resulted in the detection of a heterozygous FVL mutation.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>A 27-year-old woman patient experienced edema, bruising, and ulceration on the same leg because of trauma 8 years earlier; however, the lesions healed after wound care and treatments. Later, similar skin lesions occurred multiple times, without any obvious cause, on both her legs. The patient was treated according to different diagnoses at different clinics and was then referred to our clinic because of repeated wounds and leg pain. She had no history of familial thrombosis, labor or miscarriages, cigarette smoking, or use of oral contraceptives. On physical examination, she had a slight degree of edema in both legs; however, there were no other abnormal signs. Dermatological examination revealed postlesional atrophic cicatrices on the front of both legs and on the dorsal foot. The ulcerated lesion was characterized by irregular borders, with dimensions of 5 × 5 cm, and it was centrally livid-colored, filled with a necrotic material, and surrounded by an erythema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479379">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Laboratory tests revealed normal values for the following parameters: Antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, rheumatoid factor, and C reactive protein levels were also within normal limits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 24 mm/h. Lupus anticoagulant was negative, and the levels of anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies were 18.7 IgM phospholipid (MPL) units (normal range, 0-10 MPL units) and 13 IgG phospholipid (GPL) units (normal range, 0-11 GPL units), respectively. The levels of anticardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies were measured again after a 6-week period and were found to be 6 MPL units and 4 GPL units, respectively. Evaluation by polymerase chain reaction amplifying the factor V gene 1691 heterozygotic G → A mutation was positive. Arterial and venous Doppler ultrasound was performed and no evidence of a thrombosis was found. There was no evidence of arterial occlusive disease in Doppler ultrasound. Since the possibility of arterial disease was not considered clinically, ankle brachial pressure index was not done.</p>
<p>After a dermatological consultation, a 4-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. Biopsy was taken from the large ulcerated lesion on the front of the left tibia. Since there was no tumoral appearance on ulcers, a 4-mm punch biopsy was considered to be sufficient and a deep biopsy was performed. The pathology included irregular acanthosis of the epidermis, extension and coalescence of the rete ridges, slight spongiosis, focal exocytosis, increased fibroblastic activity of the entire dermis, and vein proliferation in the form of foci throughout the dermis and in the superficial subcutaneous fatty tissues. In addition, a fibrinoid substance in the multiple vein lumens, edematous appearance in the vein endothelium, edema in the tissues surrounding the veins, and infiltration consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes were observed. These findings were compatible with occlusive vasculopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479379">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the presence of heterozygous FVL mutation and occlusive vasculopathy, as determined by biopsy, warfarin therapy with a target of an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were initiated. After 30 days of treatment, the patient’s symptoms resolved completely. Her leg ulcers healed and all treatments were concluded except the warfarin therapy, which was continued such that INR was maintained between 2 and 3. The patient did not develop any severe leg ulcers during the 2 years of follow-up. An informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chronic skin ulcers can be falsely diagnosed and treated for months as pyoderma gangrenosum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479379">4</xref></sup> Treatment of chronic skin ulcers is problematic because of their chronic nature and potential for recurrence. Physical examination findings, history of the disease, duration of the ulcers, cigarette consumption, and medications used are all considered very important in the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers. However, the presence of antithrombin, protein C and/or protein S deficiency, FVL mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome or hyperhomocysteinemia may lead to an increased coagulation tendency, resulting in vascular thrombosis and skin ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479379">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The incidence of vascular thrombosis–induced advanced skin ulcers in the community is 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479379">6</xref></sup> Skin ulcers are usually located on the front of the legs, ankle, and foot dorsum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479379">6</xref></sup> Although the prevalence of FVL mutation, which was first identified in 1994, varies between 4% and 6% in the general population, FVL mutation may be present in 40% to 50% of hereditary hypercoagulopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479379">3</xref></sup> Factor V Leiden frequency in Europeans is 4.4%, with the highest prevalence among Greeks (7%). It is 0.6% in Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479379">7</xref></sup> The prevalence of FVL is 7.9% in the Turkish population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479379">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Activated factor V (FVa) plays a significant role in the development of thrombosis. FVa and activated FVIII (FVIIIa) are inactivated by activated protein C to avoid the increased thrombus formation in healthy individuals. This negative feedback mechanism is not effective in patients with FVL mutation because of the resistance that occurs against active protein C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479379">9</xref></sup> Deep and superficial vein thromboses in different sites of the body, such as the cerebral, hepatic, and portal sites, and upper extremities are frequently reported in FVL carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479379">2</xref></sup> FVL mutation must be considered and investigated if the patient has ulcerative skin lesions accompanied by edema and venous stasis in the lower extremities and if the patient experienced his or her first thromboembolic event before 50 years of age. Additionally, the presence of thrombosis at atypical locations, such as cerebral, mesenteric, or portal vein, or the presence of venous thrombosis without any signs of malignancy is an important finding that warrants investigation of FVL mutation. Antiphospholipid syndrome may occur in isolation or together with other hypercoagulable states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479379">10</xref></sup> In our patient, the baseline anticardiolipin antibody level was slightly above normal, but it fell to within normal limits at validation testing 6 weeks later. Additionally, the anti-dsDNA test was negative. Increased baseline levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were considered to be linked to infection and drug use. The first option in the treatment of venous thrombosis accompanied by a FVL mutation is warfarin. No treatment is necessary for asymptomatic FVL carriers. In individuals with a history of 2 or more thromboembolic episodes, long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended, whether or not a hereditary thrombophilia is present, and if possible, continued throughout the patient’s lifetime. It has been reported that long-term aspirin treatment in patients with recurrent leg ulcers may reduce the risk of ulceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479379">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acquired or congenital hypercoagulable states may lead to different clinical findings at various sites of the body and may cause venous or arterial thrombosis in multiple organs. It should be kept in mind that hereditary coagulation disorders and thrombosis may also lead to nonhealing ulcers in such patients and therefore these selected patients should be screened for thrombophilia factors. Individuals with recurrent thrombosis at early ages and with a family history of this condition should be evaluated carefully for thrombophilia, because this diagnosis may indicate significant changes in the therapeutic regimen of the patients.</p>
