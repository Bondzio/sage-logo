<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on healing in an experimental model of a degloving injury of the tails of nicotine-treated rats. Thirty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomized to four groups (n = 8): nicotine (group 1); HBO (group 2); nicotine + HBO (group 3); and control (group 4). The mean length of the necrotic parts of the tails at the degloving injury site was significantly higher in group 1 compared with groups 2, 3, and 4, and was significantly lower in group 2 compared with groups 1, 3, and 4. The mean histopathological stage of ulcers at the degloving injury site was statistically significantly higher (more severe) in group 1 compared with groups 2, 3, and 4, and was statistically significantly lower in group 2 compared with groups 1, 3, and 4. It appears that the negative effects of nicotine on wound healing in degloving injuries are negated by the positive effects of immediate HBO therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Degloving injuries are caused by the separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying fascia and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412469130">Wójcicki et al., 2011</xref>). Although many studies have investigated the factors involved in wound healing and improvements in the management of injury have been achieved, healing problems are still encountered in degloving injuries. The main problem in degloving injuries is necrosis of the skin resulting from impaired blood supply due to damage to the vascular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469130">Adani et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Smoking and its major component, nicotine—which is primarily responsible for the side effects of smoking—reduce skin blood flow and have negative effects on wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469130">Rinker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469130">Russo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469130">Selcuk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469130">Sørensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al., 1996</xref>). On the other hand, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy increases the tolerance of tissues to ischemia through improved tissue oxygenation and has positive effects on wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469130">Hong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469130">Richards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193412469130">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered that nicotine would further aggravate the circulatory problems that are common in degloving injuries, thus having a negative effect on healing, whereas HBO therapy would counteract the negative effects of nicotine by exerting positive effects on healing. As far as we are aware, there are no experimental studies evaluating the effects of nicotine and HBO together in degloving injuries.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HBO therapy on healing in an experimental model of degloving injury in tails of nicotine-treated rats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412469130" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 32 male Sprague–Dawley rats (weight 230–270 g) were used in this study. All procedures were performed in a practice and research laboratory.</p>
<p>The rats used in the study were randomized to four groups (<italic>n</italic> = 8): the nicotine group (group 1); HBO group (group 2); nicotine + HBO group (group 3); and control group (group 4). Before surgery, rats were followed-up in the laboratory for 48 hours at 22ºC room temperature for acclimatization with exposure to 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. Rats were fed with tap water and standard rodent feed ad libitum.</p>
<p>Prior to the surgical procedure, groups 1 and 3 received 2 mg/kg nicotine sulphate subcutaneously twice a day (Sigma Cas-No: 22083-74-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469130">Campos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469130">Eskitascioglu et al., 2005</xref>) for 28 days, whereas groups 2 and 4 received saline solution (1 mL subcutaneously twice a day).</p>
<p>After the procedure, groups 2 and 3 received HBO therapy (100% oxygen at 2.4 atm for 2 hours daily in a single session) for 15 days, the first dose starting immediately after degloving skin was sutured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412469130">Figure 1</xref>). Groups 1 and 4 received no therapy. At the end of day 15, all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.</p>

<sec id="section3-1753193412469130">
<title>Surgical procedure</title>
<p>Before surgery, all rats were anaesthetized subcutaneously by a combination of 50 mg/kg ketamine (Ketalar; Pfizer, Istanbul, Turkey) and 10 mg/kg Xylazine (Rompun; Bayer, Istanbul, Turkey). After cleaning, the surgical method of choice was the degloving injury model described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469130">Oztuna et al. (2006)</xref>. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were incised circumferentially 5 cm distal to the root of the tail. The proximal edge of the circular incision created was fixed and controlled manual traction was applied to the tail at the distal end of the incision. When a 3 cm avulsion of the skin and subcutaneous tissue had been achieved, traction was stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412469130">Figure 2</xref>). After 15 minutes, the ends of the incision were reapproximated and sutured using 4/0 vicryl.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193412469130">
<title>Clinical evaluation</title>
<p>Following sacrifice of the rats the length of the necrotic parts of the tails were measured in mm. In two-group comparisons, a reduction in the length of necrosis was considered positive, whereas an increase in the length of necrosis was considered negative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412469130">
<title>Histopathological evaluation</title>
<p>For histopathology, samples obtained from the degloving injury site were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and stored in 5% formic acid. The sections obtained were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&amp;E) and analyzed. Tissue lesions in the sections were evaluated according to the scale developed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412469130">National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP; 1989)</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469130">Table 1</xref>). Stage I and II ulcers are generally considered the least severe, and stage IV ulcers are considered the most severe.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Degloving injuries are serious injuries usually caused by industrial, traffic, or farm accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469130">Adani et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412469130">Wójcicki et al, 2011</xref>), and sometimes by simpler traumas such as ring injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469130">Adani et al., 1995</xref>). In degloving injuries, the dermal vascular plexus, which perforates the underlying muscles and runs into the subcutaneous tissue, is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412469130">Wójcicki et al., 2011</xref>). Even though repair of the avulsed flap to its original place is a simple and quick technique, partial or total flap necrosis is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412469130">Milcheski et al., 2010</xref>). The survival of the avulsed flaps depends on blood circulation between the flap and flap bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412469130">Musgrave and Lehman, 1992</xref>). Healing problems in degloving injuries have given rise to increased studies on factors that are likely to have an effect on circulation and development of new therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Smoking is one of the factors known to affect skin blood flow. Tobacco and its major component, nicotine, reduce skin blood flow. Nicotine exerts its effects by reducing the amount of oxygen supply to tissues by 30–40% through vasoconstriction, changing the balance of prostacycline/thromboxane in favour of thromboxane, and leading to the formation of microthrombus through platelet activation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469130">Rinker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469130">Russo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469130">Sørensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that nicotine slows wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469130">Aker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469130">Eskitascioglu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469130">Reus et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al., 1996</xref>). In an experimental study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al. (1996)</xref> demonstrated that cigarette smoking reduced the survival of free vascularized flaps. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469130">Aker et al. (1997)</xref> found a significant decrease in survival in random-pattern skin flaps in rats exposed to nicotine. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469130">Reus et al. (1992)</xref> assessed the risk of complications in elective free tissue transfer in patients who did and did not smoke, and demonstrated delayed wound healing in the smokers. Moreover, they found that smokers more frequently require an additional procedure to achieve wound closure.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have used different agents to ameliorate the deleterious effects of nicotine on wound healing. An experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469130">Karien et al. (1997)</xref> reported that use of oral terazosin, an alpha-1 antagonist, improved flap survival in nicotine-treated rats. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412469130">Baykan et al. (2012)</xref> showed that angiotensin reduced nicotine-induced ischemia in McFarlane random flaps, thus increasing flap survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469130">Garcia et al. (2012)</xref> showed that low-intensity laser therapy exerted positive effects on wound healing in nicotine-treated rats. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469130">Khandelwal et al. (2008)</xref> administered HBO therapy immediately after the surgical procedure in a 43-year-old patient with a complete scalp degloving injury who smoked and concluded that HBO therapy may facilitate tissue survival in this type of injury and, hence, could be used as an additional treatment.</p>
<p>HBO therapy increases tissue oxygenation, thus improving ischemic tolerance in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469130">Hong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469130">Richards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193412469130">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). HBO exerts this effect by increasing tissue microcirculation and decreasing platelet aggregation, increasing the amount of dissolved oxygen carried in the plasma, and stimulating neoangiogenesis in the early stage of wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469130">Hong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469130">Richards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193412469130">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469130">Löndahl et al.

(2007)</xref> investigated the factors affecting healing in 73 patients with lower extremity wounds that were not healing and who were treated with HBO therapy. They reported that cigarette smoking was associated with a poor response to HBO.</p>
<p>Different durations and doses of HBO therapy are reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412469130">Ishii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412469130">Rollins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412469130">Sheikh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469130">Tompach et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193412469130">Zamboni et al., 1989</xref>). In a study evaluating the effect of HBO on axial-pattern skin flaps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193412469130">Zamboni et al. (1989)</xref> found that HBO was effective on axial-pattern skin flap survival when administered during and after total ischemia. In a study on the efficacy of HBO therapy in wound healing, wound oxygen levels were measured on days 5, 10, and 15; peak wound oxygen level was reached on day 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412469130">Rollins et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469130">Tompach et al. (1997)</xref> conducted a study investigating cell response to HBO therapy in wound healing and demonstrated that endothelial cell proliferation occurred after 15 minutes of HBO, whereas fibroblasts required 120 minutes of HBO to produce a response. In the same study, no difference was noted in cell proliferation between 2.4 and 4.0 atm absolute. In our study, HBO therapy (100% oxygen at 2.4 atm for 2 hours daily, in a single session) was administered for 15 days, the first dose starting immediately after degloved skin was sutured.</p>
<p>There are various studies in the literature on the effects of duration of nicotine exposure on wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469130">Selcuk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469130">Sørensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al., 1996</xref>). In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469130">Selcuk et al. (2012)</xref> evaluating the effects of HBO on random-pattern skin flaps in rats, the negative effects on healing were observed to continue despite the pre-operative cessation of nicotine administration. In an experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al. (1996)</xref>, rats with free vascularized flaps were exposed to cigarette smoking for varying periods before and after surgery (10 rats were not exposed to smoking; 10 rats were exposed to smoking 6 weeks before surgery and 2 weeks after surgery; 10 rats were only exposed to smoking pre-operatively for 6 weeks); flap survival was evaluated. The best results were observed in the nonsmoking group, while the worst survival was observed in the group that continued smoking after surgery. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469130">Van Adrichem et al. (1996)</xref> demonstrated that the negative effects of smoking continued even it was stopped pre-operatively, and the negative effects on flap viability were even greater if smoking was continued after surgery. We ended the exposure of the rats to nicotine pre-operatively because we believe that patients subject to a major injury such as a degloving injury would stop smoking for at least the duration of healing. However, we believed that the negative effects of smoking would not disappear immediately after cessation of smoking. Similarly, a significant negative effect on wound healing was observed in the nicotine compared with the control group. This demonstrates that the negative effects of nicotine continue despite the pre-operative cessation of nicotine administration. We assume that the negative effects on wound healing would further increase if nicotinization is continued after surgery. We did not evaluate the effects of HBO treatment when nicotinization was continued after surgery. However, healing was significantly better in the nicotine + HBO group compared with the nicotine group. This demonstrated the effects of HBO in neutralizing the negative effects of nicotine. HBO might have had a positive effect on wound healing to varying degrees when nicotinization was continued after surgery. We suggest that this can be evaluated by further clinical and experimental studies.</p>
<p>In this study we have shown both clinically (measuring the length of tail necrosis) and histologically that HBO treatment can compensate for the negative effects of smoking. We suggest that patients who undergo surgery for degloving injuries should cease smoking and receive HBO treatment.</p>
<p>The injured area was sutured 15 minutes following the degloving injury in our study, and HBO treatment was started immediately after suturing. This brings to minds two questions: Can these conditions be reproduced in real life? Would wound healing be affected if the lag period until suturing or the beginning of HBO treatment was increased? We are aware of the difficulties in current practices in creating these conditions.</p>
<p>Our study was designed with an ideal environment in mind, where the patient with a degloving injury is immediately taken to a hospital that has HBO treatment units and treatment commences immediately. Nevertheless, we are aware that the dermal vascular plexus penetrating the muscles underneath and entering the subcutaneous tissues from the deep fascia is interrupted due to the injury. Therefore, vascular structures would not be reinstated simply because the wound is sutured early. Consequently, minor changes in the timing of suturing of the wound would not have a significant effect on wound healing.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the total number of HBO treatment sessions—15 sessions—are taken into account, minor deviations of the lag period between surgery and the first session of treatment would not greatly affect the healing process. In our study, a positive effect on healing was observed in the HBO group in comparison with the other groups, where the degloving injuries in all rats were sutured during the same time periods after injury. Nevertheless, different studies evaluating the association between time of initiation of surgery and of HBO treatment might be performed. However, it is evident that further clinical and experimental studies are required to identify optimal duration and dose of HBO therapy.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study were the use of a simple degloving injury model and the rapidity of the repair, which is substantially quicker than in clinical practice. We also stopped the nicotine prior to repair, which may not reflect clinical practice, and our protocol for HBO treatment, although logical, is not proven to be optimal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data obtained in this study suggest that the deleterious effects of nicotine on healing in degloving injuries can be ameliorated by the positive effects of HBO therapy. This will need further study to assess whether it is applicable in humans.</p>
