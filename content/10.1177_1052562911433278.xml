<p><italic>What does this body of scholarship mean to the responsible management education “movement,” and how will it assist ongoing initiatives such as the Principles for Responsible Management Education?</italic></p>
<p>An increasing number of companies and organizations around the world have realized that including sustainability and responsibility to stakeholders in their agendas is necessary to effectively address the growing nexus of global environmental, social, and economic challenges. However, the question remains as to how management education can be transformed to better prepare students to meet these current and future demands.</p>
<p>The UN Global Compact–backed initiative Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) was launched in 2007 with the mission to accelerate the transformation of management education by inspiring and championing responsible management education, research, and thought leadership globally. The Principles seek to establish a process of continuous improvement among institutions of management education in order to develop a new generation of business leaders who are capable of managing the complex challenges faced by business and society in the 21st century.</p>
<p>In their initial phase, the Principles were primarily seen as a framework for organizational and curriculum change and a platform to serve as the starting point for many schools interested in implementing change. Over time, we witnessed an increasing number of curricular innovations that incorporate more “effective learning experiences for responsible leadership” (Principle 3—Method) and enable the “[development of] the capabilities of students to be future generators of sustainable value for business and society at large and to work for an inclusive and sustainable global economy” (Principle 1—Purpose). The PRME initiative has thereby become a dynamic learning community, drawing on its participants’ Sharing Information on Progress (SIP) reports, as well as the activities of its many working groups and regional meetings.</p>
<p>I am delighted to see that a number of the articles in this special issue of the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> contribute to the further development of this global effort. While some articles focus on strategies for addressing the challenges of implementing the Principles on both the organizational and course levels, other articles analyze the curricular innovations that have already begun to incorporate the Principles of PRME.</p>
<p>The insights provided by these examples will help faculty and administration in other schools and departments to develop their own responsible management education strategies and programming. I encourage further scholarship in this highly transformative and growing field of responsible management education.</p>
