<abstract>
<p>This study explored verbal, visual, motor, and tactile humor appreciation and comprehension among preschool children with epilepsy as compared with healthy children. Participants included 32 children with focal epilepsy, as well as 70 healthy controls. The results suggest that children with epilepsy assess humor dichotomously (as either not funny at all or as extremely funny) and generally as less amusing when compared with ratings given by controls (<italic>M =</italic> 6.08, and <italic>M =</italic> 7.44, <italic>P =</italic> .01, respectively). They also gave significantly lower ratings to verbal jokes than to visual jokes. Furthermore, children with epilepsy assessed the jokes they understood (ie, gave expected explanations to the content of jokes) as less funny. An important finding from our study was that children with epilepsy assess aggressive humor as not funny. The most frequent emotional reaction in both groups to jokes from all subtests was a smile, followed by a half-smile.</p>

<body>
<p>Humor and laughter are considered important indicators of childrens’ interpersonal, affective, and sociocognitive abilities as well as potential diagnostic measures for determining levels of cognitive development among both healthy children and children with atypical development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811419259">1</xref>
</sup> A sense of humor emerges in early childhood, develops with age, and facilitates social functioning and adjustment, mutual understanding, and communication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811419259">2</xref>
</sup> Humor helps to make new contacts with peers, overcome difficult situations, relieve tensions, and create trust.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811419259">3</xref>
</sup> It also helps to maintain self-control in tense social situations, thereby providing support to others and facilitating a peaceful and calm resolution of conflicts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811419259">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Humor develops cognitive functions, primarily memory. Funny statements and images are better remembered than those that are not funny, because active cognitive processing is required to adequately understand humorous material. The cognitive processing of funny, and therefore somewhat unusual, material in the brain is also related to emotional reactions (ie, surprise), which also increase attention and working memory functions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811419259">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811419259">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>During early childhood, humor is related mainly to bodily sensations and motor-play such as hiding one’s face, tickling, chasing, and falling over. Later on, from the age of 5 to 7 years, humor acquires a more verbal quality, centering on word-play, rhyming, and riddles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811419259">7</xref>
</sup> Children who are interested in humor and use it skillfully tend to have more advanced verbal skills, be more talkative, possess a wider vocabulary, and be more articulate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811419259">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Humor potentially involves expressive abilities involved in the generation of humorous stimuli as well as in the receptive abilities involved in humor comprehension. The majority of studies have been based on the most common humor theory, incongruity resolution,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811419259">8</xref>
</sup> which proposes that humor comprehension is a 2-stage process. Incongruity, the first stage, involves the detection of an incongruous element (ie, an object or event) among 2 or more incompatible elements. In the second stage, the incongruent element is linked in a meaningful way to the body of the text, resolving the incongruity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811419259">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Shultz differentiates between 2 phases in the development of humor evaluation: children up to 7 years old regard surprising stimuli, or simply unresolved incongruity, as funny.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811419259">9</xref>
</sup> From that age on, humor is considered funny when the incongruity is resolved, that is, when humor is rationalized.</p>
<p>In addition to incongruency, preschool childrens’ humor assessment is also influenced by the content of the humor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811419259">10</xref>
</sup> Children who participated in Sinnott and Ross’s research preferred aggressive and incongruent situations to neutral ones. Helmers found that aggressive humor is considered funny primarily because the child is aware that the situation is make-believe and that the victim will be fine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811419259">11</xref>
</sup> If this does not appear to be the case, then the situation is perceived as frightening or confusing. Uekermann and Daum indicate that slapstick humor (eg, slipping on a banana peel) is dependent only on the first stage, incongruity detection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811419259">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Studying preschool children (ages 5-7 years) is a critical part of the study design, because it is during this time period that the ability to understand linguistic statements and detect incongruencies develops,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811419259">6</xref>
</sup> accompanied by the emerging ability to regulate and manage one’s emotions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811419259">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that has an impact on all areas of life of children, including cognitive and academic skills and social functioning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811419259">12</xref>
</sup> In children with epilepsy, deficits in attention, language, visuoperceptual, and memory functions as well as indications of mental rigidity and excessive focus on details have been described. Furthermore, the antiepileptic treatment itself can affect humor perception. The neural processing and appreciation of humor requires integration of multisensory information, as well as mental manipulation and organization of information in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and temporoparietal junctions, which might be disturbed by epilepsy. It may also be related to an inappropriate focus on irrelevant details, difficulties at integration, tendencies toward concreteness, and egocentricity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811419259">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One of the few studies involving adults with epilepsy, which evaluated the social-cognitive functions of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, showed no differences between people suffering from epilepsy and the control group in the Theory of Mind Test, but the perception of humor from funny images (humor appreciation) and recognition of facial emotions was severely impaired.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811419259">14</xref>
</sup> So far, research has been done regarding humor perception in children with developmental deficit (intellectual and learning disabilities),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811419259">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811419259">16</xref>
</sup> Down syndrome, and autistic spectrum disorders,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811419259">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811419259">18</xref>
</sup> but studies involving children with epilepsy have not been conducted.</p>
<p>Research has shown that children with learning disabilities have difficulties comprehending humor,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811419259">16</xref>
</sup> and children with autism do not tell jokes and show less humor appreciation with visual incongruity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811419259">17</xref>
</sup> Children with Down syndrome have been found to enjoy humor more than do those with other types of mental retardation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811419259">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811419259">18</xref>

</p>
<p>Studying children with epilepsy may help not only to understand differences between normal and atypical development of sense of humor and the mechanisms of humor development in general, but also to develop more appropriate and effective interventions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811419259">
<title>Goals of the Study and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The goal of the present study was to investigate similarities and differences in perception and understanding of different types of humor (verbal, visual, motor, and tactile humor, as well as picture drawing) in preschool children with epilepsy as compared with healthy children. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Children with epilepsy are less able to perceive humor, and they experience humor as less funny than healthy children. They have less positive reactions to humor and have more difficulties in explaining the reasons why joke is funny.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Humor perception and understanding depends—for both groups—on the type of humor. Children perceive verbal humor as less funny than visual humor, because understanding verbal humor is cognitively more demanding and difficult.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0883073811419259">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 102 Estonian preschool children ranging in age between 5 and 7 years (mean = 5.78 years, standard deviation [SD] = 0.75 years). The study group consisted of 32 children with focal active epilepsy, of whom 11 were boys and 21 were girls. Mean age of the study group children was 5.77 years (SD = 0.81). The inclusion criteria were: children with diagnosis of focal epilepsy, absence of mental retardation and physical abnormalities, age between 5 and 7 years (preschool children), parental consent for participating in the study.</p>
<p>The International League Against Epilepsy 2006 classification of epileptic seizures was used for definitions and principles for diagnosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811419259">19</xref>
</sup> A seizure was classified as focal when there was evidence of a clinical partial onset and characteristic focal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. The epileptic focus of the children was determined using awake and/or sleep EEG recorded in every case during the interictal state. The mean age at onset of epilepsy was 4 years, 3 months. Children with epilepsy were on anticonvulsant medication; all children were undergoing monotherapy, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or valproate with good seizure control.</p>
<p>The study group was tested during their outpatient visit at the Children’s Clinic in Tartu University Hospital to minimize side effects.</p>
<p>The control group consisted of 70 healthy children, of whom 32 were boys and 38 were girls. The mean age of the control group children was 5.62 years (SD = 0.61). They were tested in 3 kindergartens in Tartu, Estonia. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Hospital in Tartu.</p>

<title>Study Material</title>
<p>The Special Humor Test, created by the authors, was used in this study. The Special Humor Test is based on research and theories regarding the comprehension and appreciation of humor among preschool children. A pilot study was conducted in order to create study material for measuring preschoolers’ humor comprehension and appreciation covering different types (ie, verbal, visual, motor, and tactile) of jokes that would be funny for 5- to 7-year-old children. With this aim, 51 jokes and funny materials were presented to 20 kindergarten children aged between 5 and 7 years. Children were asked to rate the funniness of the presented jokes. Some of these jokes were from previous studies conducted by Klein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811419259">20</xref></sup> Most of the verbal jokes were from Estonian children’s magazines and popular books. Eight jokes the children considered as not funny were omitted from the created study material.</p>
<p>The final test material consisted of 43 jokes and funny activities in 5 categories: verbal humor (9 funny stories, 2 riddles, 2 poems, and 2 songs); visual humor (16 pictures, 3 of them with aggressive content); 4 motor activities; 4 tactile activities; and 4 drawings.
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) <italic>Verbal subtest</italic>. Jokes were presented to the children one by one and then the children were asked to assess and explain what they perceived as funny. The verbal jokes and riddles are from a well-known Estonian children’s magazine <italic>Täheke</italic>, the poems from a book of poems called <italic>Kilul oli vilu</italic> by Eno Raud, and the elephant story from a study by Klein about humor perception of kindergarten children (see Examples 1-3 in the Appendix).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811419259">20</xref></sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) <italic>Visual subtest.</italic> Funny pictures were presented to the test subjects one by one (see Examples 4-5 in Appendix), and the children were then asked to assess how funny they were and explain what was funny about them. Pictures were downloaded from the Corel Clipart Web page (royalty-free images, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clipart.com/en">http://www.clipart.com/en</ext-link>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(c) <italic>Motor activity subtest</italic>. The motor activity test involved imitating animals and birds after following the experimenters’ example and assessing how funny it was perceived to be. Test subjects were asked (according to the experimenter’s instructions) to imitate a frog, a duck, a rooster, a bear, and finally an animal or a bird of their own choice that they thought was funny. They were then asked to rate jokes on funniness and to explain what it is that is funny about it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(d) <italic>Tactile activity subtest</italic>. The tactile activity test consisted of games involving manual activity. Four games <italic>“Clapping hands”</italic>(see Example 6 in the Appendix)<italic>, “Finger counting”</italic> (see Example 7 in the Appendix)<italic>, “Catching hands,”</italic> and <italic>“Guess what’s in your palm,”</italic> were played with the experimenter.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Children were asked to assess how funny these activities were and what was funny about them.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>(e) <italic>Drawing subtest</italic>. The experimenter drew 4 pictures, <italic>“Hobbit Krõll”</italic> (see Example 8 in the Appendix), “<italic>The rabbit with a carrot nose</italic>” (see Example 9 in the Appendix), <italic>“Funny house,</italic>” and <italic>“Turtle on wheels,”</italic> with mismatching parts one at a time, describing her intentions simultaneously. The child’s task was to assess how funny these activities were and what was funny about them.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The reliability of the subtests was high: Cronbach α was 0.91 (for the verbal and visual humor subtests α = 0.83, and for the tactile and motor humor subtests α = 0.99).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073811419259">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The children were tested individually by 2 researchers, and the order of presentation of subtests was random. The test took approximately 1.5 hours (including pauses) to complete. The aim of the test was to determine how funny the child perceived the presented material to be and what he/she perceived as funny.</p>
<p>The children were observed in a quiet room of at least 15 m<sup>2</sup>. The study group was observed in the children’s hospital during their outpatient visit, and the control group was in their kindergarten environment while other people were not in the same room, by the same 2 researchers.</p>
<sec id="section6-0883073811419259">
<title>Humor ratings</title>
<p>First, the child was asked to rate each joke or activity on funniness using a colored scale. It was similar to pain scales used to measure patients’ pain intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811419259">21</xref></sup> On one side, the scale had different intensities of color: the darker shade corresponded to a higher value. On the other side, there was a numerical scale from 0-10. The participants were asked to show how funny the joke was on the colored side of the scale, and the researcher used the numerical side to give numbers to the child’s ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0883073811419259">
<title>Children’s emotional reactions</title>
<p>While presenting the test components, 2 researchers simultaneously measured the child’s emotional reactions according to Pien and Rothbart’s 4-point scale: serious/not laughing (0), faint-smile (1), smile (2), laughter (3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811419259">22</xref></sup> Children’s emotional reactions were judged by 2 researchers with more than 94% cases in agreement for all protocols. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0883073811419259">
<title>Humor explanations</title>
<p>Children were asked to explain why they thought the joke or activity was funny or to explain the punch line (what made it funny). Humor explanations were coded into 5 types (scores 4-0). For instance, explanations given to a verbal joke presented in Example 1 (in the Appendix) were classified into the following types:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0883073811419259">
<title>Expected explanations (score 4)</title>
<p>These included full and explicit explanations that were expected by the experimenters to be given. Here the child gave the logical outcome or punch line, identifying the critical element in a joke that made it funny. For instance, “He wants to put his hands in his pocket. Hands have to be washed, not put in the pocket.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0883073811419259">
<title>Unexpected explanations (score 3)</title>
<p>These included irrelevant or incorrect explanations where for the child some uncritical element of the joke seemed to be funny, for instance, “It isn’t difficult to wash the face.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0883073811419259">
<title>Unconventional explanation (score 2)</title>
<p>These included explanations when the child added details that were not given in the joke. For instance, “That the face has to be wiped, (washed).”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0883073811419259">
<title>Description or retelling the joke by the child (score 1)</title>
<p>For instance, “Mother washes Paul’s face and wants to wash the hands, too, but Paul wants to put them in his pocket instead.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0883073811419259">
<title>No explanation (score 0)</title>
<p>“Don’t know” answers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0883073811419259">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted with STATISTICA (data analysis software system) version 7.0 (StatSoft Inc., 2004, Tulsa, Oklahoma). The mean values of the assessments, emotional reactions, and explanations given to the jokes by the control group and test group were compared using the <italic>t</italic> test. The value of the effect size (Cohen <italic>d</italic>) was calculated using the means and standard deviations of the study group and the control group. Cohen considered a small effect size to be 0.20, a medium effect size to be 0.50, and a large effect size to be as 0.80.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811419259">23</xref>
</sup> The distributions of children’s assessments were presented as percentages in frequency tables.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0883073811419259">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In a preliminary analysis, no significant age or sex differences were observed between control and study group regarding assessments of the jokes and children’s explanations and emotional reactions. Therefore, age and sex were not included as variables in further analyses.</p>
<sec id="section18-0883073811419259">
<title>Humor Ratings</title>
<p>Children in the study group rated the jokes in a verbal subtest, in a tactile subtest, and in a drawing subtest as significantly less funny than the control group did, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811419259">Table 1</xref>. In the visual subtest, significant differences between the study and control groups were found only when the pictures had aggressive content (in the study group, mean = 5.37, SD = 4.34; in the control group, mean = 7.30, SD = 3.38, <italic>P =</italic> .01, <italic>d</italic> =0.50), and the control group rated aggressive pictures to be less funny.</p>

<p>As expected, the study group children assigned significantly lower ratings to verbal jokes compared with visual jokes. There were no statistically significant differences between verbal and visual jokes in the control group children. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811419259">Table 1</xref>, the study group gave the highest funniness ratings to the visual subtest. The control group highly rated all kinds of jokes, except the motor subtest.</p>
<p>To get a better picture regarding joke appreciation, the children’s ratings for funniness of jokes were divided into 4 categories (assessments 0; 1-5; 6-9; 10). The distribution of ratings for all jokes is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811419259">Figure 1</xref>. The study group tended to use either the bottom of the rating scale, score 0 (21% perceived the verbal and visual subtests, and 31% the motor subtest to be not funny), or the top of the rating scale, score 10 (42% rated the verbal and visual subtests, and 39% the motor and tactile subtests to be extremely funny). In contrast, the control group tended to use the upper side of the rating scale. Only 6.5% of control group children said that the jokes were not funny at all; the majority (76%) of them tended to assess jokes to be funny or extremely funny.</p>

<p>Thus, as expected, the study group rated jokes as less funny than the control group did. The biggest differences in the 2 groups’ assessments were in the verbal subtests in the riddle “How do you catch a rabbit?” (Example 3; control group mean = 7.41, SD = 2.76; study group mean = 4.35, SD = 3.99, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.99) and in the visual subtest in the picture, “Man stepping on a rake” (Example 5; control group mean = 6.83, SD = 3.45, study group mean = 4.83, SD = 4.55, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.50). The biggest group differences between assessments’ were in the tactile subtest: “Clapping hands” (Example 6; control group mean = 6.69, SD = 3.43, study group mean = 4.44, SD = 4.41, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.60), and in the drawing “Hobbit Krõll” (Example 8; control group mean= 8.29, SD = 2.61, study group mean = 5.91, SD = 4.18, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.68).

<title>Relationship Between Children’s Explanations and Assessments of the Jokes</title>
<p>The <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the relationship between the children’s explanations and assessments of the jokes in the control and study groups. Significantly more verbal jokes were understood (ie, the child gave expected explanations) and assessed to be funny by the control group (mean = 7.27, SD = 2.47, <italic>P</italic> = .05) compared with the study group (mean = 4.13, SD = 2.63, <italic>d</italic> = 1.23). A similar tendency was also found with visual jokes (study group mean = 4.09, SD = 2.98, control group mean = 6.94, SD = 2.95, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> =0.96). Thus there are significantly more verbal and visual jokes in the control group, compared with the study group, that were understood and assessed as very funny.</p>
<p>Regarding the verbal subtest, more jokes were understood but assessed as not funny by the study group (mean = 0.39, SD = 0.65) compared with the control group (mean = 0.14, SD = 0.39, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.47).

<title>Relationship Between Children’s Explanations and Emotional Reactions</title>
<p>Children’s reactions were analyzed in relation to the given explanations, which showed that when explaining the punch line of verbal humor, the control group expressed a positive reaction (half-smile, smile, or laughter) significantly more often than the study group (the mean number of tasks in control group, mean = 7.26, SD = 2.47 and study group mean = 4.12, SD = 2.63, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.23).

<title>Relationship Between Emotional Reactions and Assessments of the Jokes</title>
<p>To characterize the relationship between funniness ratings and emotional reactions, we used the <italic>t</italic> test to calculate to what extent the assessment of humor as very funny is accompanied by emotional reactions (reaction ≥ 1, ie, half-smile, smile, or laughter). It emerged that this kind of relationship exists significantly more with verbal (mean = 12.22, SD = 2.39) than visual jokes (mean = 3.05, SD = 1.92, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 4.23). When comparing the study group and control group, a statistically significant difference in verbal and visual humor could be seen, since both types of humor produced more positive reactions in the control group when assessing the stimulus as funny (verbal humor, control group mean = 13.08, SD = 1.46, study group mean = 9.87, SD = 2.88, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.85; visual humor, control group mean = 3.31, SD =1.94, study group mean = 2.31, SD = 1.66, <italic>P</italic> = .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.55).</p>
<p>In the motor subtest, there were no statistically significant differences between the control group and the study group.

This tendency also emerged in the picture-drawing subtest (control group mean = 3.27, SD = 1.05, study group mean = 2.28, SD = 1.61, <italic>P</italic> = .01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.72).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of the present study was to examine differences and similarities in appreciation and understanding of humor in preschool-age children with epilepsy and in healthy children. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the perception and the understanding of humor among children with epilepsy.</p>
<p>An important finding from our study was that children with epilepsy did not have a global humor perception or understanding deficit, but that the differences depended upon the type of joke as well as upon specific joke content. Children with epilepsy are likely not to rate verbal jokes, tactile jokes, and picture drawing as highly as control group children.</p>
<p>In the visual jokes subtest, pictures with joyful activities and happiness, as well as pictures with aggressive content like misfortune or accidents were used, which Bariaud describes as funny thematic for preschoolers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811419259">24</xref>
</sup> An interesting finding from our study was the support for the hypothesis that epileptic children assess the pictures with aggressive content as considerably less funny, whereas the control group assessed all pictures, including agressive ones, to be funny. Helmers has found that aggressive humor is considered funny primarily because the child is aware that the situation is make-believe and the victim will be fine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811419259">11</xref>
</sup> In our study, children with epilepsy frequently stated that being hurt or hurting someone was not funny. One explanation for this finding could be that the understanding of aggressive jokes requires the child to have developed abilities of abstract thought, cognitive flexibility (placing the funny stimulus in a new and coherent context), perception of ambiguity, and fantasy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811419259">10</xref>
</sup> Therefore we infer that relatively inflexible, concrete thinking, a detailed perception, and impaired ability of abstract thought, which are a result of epilepsy, prevent the child from analyzing the joke as a whole and cause him or her to perceive the aggressive content of the picture as not funny. One more explanation of the different perception of aggressive pictures by children with epilepsy would also be their experience of being hospitalized and suffering from chronic illness, which has influenced their emotional reactions to seeing somebody getting hurt, despite the fact that that it is merely a joke. Future studies are needed to explore further why children with epilepsy assess humor with aggressive content differently.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis was confirmed: children with epilepsy assess humor differently and as less funny than healthy children. It was found that the study group children assess humor dichotomously, as not funny at all or extremely funny. It might be that their shorter attention span or memory impairment made epileptic children give their funniness assessments immediately after the presentation of the jokes, and before they are able to fully analyze and understand them. The dichotomous assessments may also be caused by the mental rigidity and an excessive focus on details among children with epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811419259">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the study group children gave lower assessments of verbal jokes than to visual jokes. Humor development theories emphasize that appreciation of verbal humor requires more cognitive resources than appreciation of visual humor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811419259">25</xref>
</sup> This might be a reason for the difficulties of our study group children in understanding verbal humor.</p>
<p>The verbal jokes, which got statistically significantly lower scores in the study group compared with the control group, were based primarily on simple incongruity and repeated words or rhymes. Differences in the assessments of phonological jokes were probably because of the effects of the study group children’s epileptic activity on the temporal and frontal lobes region as well as the integrated functioning of different brain association areas, which affected the perception and assessment of phonological jokes. Therefore, the lower assessment scores of verbal humor are due to semantic complexity, but also result from phonological and grammatical aspects, which are processed in the brain primarily by the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and cerebellum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811419259">26</xref>
</sup> Because of its complexity, verbal humor requires more prior atonement, focus, and attention from the child, because the funny component is not always immediately clear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811419259">27</xref>
</sup> The language and attention functions tend to be impaired in children with epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811419259">28</xref>
</sup> It should be mentioned that some verbal jokes were also difficult to understand for the control group children.</p>
<p>In their funniness assessments, the lowest funniness ratings were given by the control group in the motor subtest. It was the easiest subtest in our study and consisted of the most familiar activities for the children, since the development of funny motor activities like hiding the face, tickling, and chasing each other begins in early childhood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811419259">11</xref>
</sup> The control group children seem to appreciate the novelty, whereas children with epilepsy seem to appreciate somewhat easier and more familiar activities.</p>
<p>Study group children gave the lowest assessments to tactile funny activities, and these assessments were statistically significantly lower, compared to the control group’s assessments. On average the control group children assessed <italic>“Finger counting”</italic> (Example 7) and <italic>“Guess what’s in your palm”</italic> activities as funnier than <italic>“Clapping hands”</italic> (Example 6), which requires more motor attention and coordination as well as some practice. The same tendency was observed in the study group, as their assessments for all the activities in this field were significantly lower. It is likely that complex activities are easier for the control group, since visuomotor coordination and attention are often impaired in children with epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811419259">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the picture-drawing subtest, the control group children assessed complex and unusual pictures like <italic>“Hobbit Krõll”</italic> (Example 8) to be more funny, whereas the study group perceived simpler pictures like <italic>“The rabbit with a carrot nose”</italic> (Example 9) to be more funny. This finding seems to be related to the decreased attention span of children with epilepsy as well as their impaired ability to concentrate, information processing abilities, and fine motor skills. The same results were described by Kolk and Cull.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811419259">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811419259">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Children with epilepsy were similar to other children in their emotional reactions to jokes. The most frequent emotional response in both groups and to all types of jokes was smiling, followed by half-smiles. It seems to be difficult to make children laugh in test conditions. Our study shows that it is difficult to decide how much the child appreciates the joke when just observing his or her emotional responses. Cognitive responses (eg, assessments of funniness) to jokes give more information about appreciation of humor, at least in test conditions.</p>
<p>We found that for 5- to 7-year-old children, it is not easy to explain what was funny in the jokes. Although the control group showed that they understood the joke (gave an expected explanation) more frequently than the study group, they were able to explain only 52% of verbal jokes. Jokes from other subtests were even more difficult to explain. The study group tended frequently not to give any explanation or to describe the joke. They gave expected explanations primarily to simple, incongruent jokes with no solution, to funny pictures, and to motor and tactile subtests.</p>
<p>Control group children frequently perceived something funny in the stimulus that was not intended to be funny. It was mentioned also by Shultz and Horibe that a child who does not fully understand the joke invents his or her own meaning and considers it funny.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811419259">30</xref>
</sup> Healthy children seem to be more creative than children with epilepsy.</p>
<p>Explanation of a joke requires not only understanding it but also remembering and reproducing the content of the joke (short-term memory function) after giving an assessment. In other words, it requires the effective collaboration of various brain regions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811419259">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A noteworthy result that emerged from this research was that children with epilepsy were more likely than were control group children to understand the joke (ie, they gave expected explanations), but they assessed the joke as not funny. This finding may indicate that children with epilepsy can understand and describe the content of the joke, but that they have difficulty integrating it with the funny components of the joke or punch line. This tendency cannot be explained by study group children’s intellectual abilities or impairment of single neurocognitive function (their overall cognitive abilities are at a normal level), but with epileptic activity, which has affected their associative network and abstract thinking abilities.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study was that the observers were not blind to the diagnosis of epilepsy in the study group, but the study was designed for examination the impact of epileptic activity for humor perception in children. Moreover, although both groups of children were assessed in a separate room in which only 2 observers and the child were present, the study group children’s study room was in the hospital (in the outpatient department), and those of the control group in their kindergartens. It is likely that this situation might have had an impact on the findings.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study is one of the first to study differences in appreciation and understanding of different types of jokes between children with epilepsy and healthy children. The findings from this study may help us move toward a better understanding of brain dysfunctions caused by epilepsy. The study showed that at preschool age, children with epilepsy appreciated some type of humor and some specific jokes less than control group children. It was difficult for all children from this age group to relate what makes jokes funny. Future longitudinal research is needed to answer the question, Are these peculiarities of humor appreciation typical only of preschool children with epilepsy, or are they also characteristic of humor perception among older children and adults with epilepsy? Future studies should explore humor assessment among children with other acquired brain lesions as well. The results from such studies could be used in informing rehabilitation programs and practices in order to help improve neurocognitive outcomes for children with various types of disorders.</p>

<p>Now a child reaches out with his/her left hand and claps his/her partner’s left hand, then claps his/her hands again. This was repeated 10 times.</p>
<p>Example 7: “Finger counting”</p>
<p>The fingers on one hand of the test subject were counted. The first time one additional finger was counted (6 fingers), the second time one finger less (4 fingers) and finally the correct amount of fingers were counted (5 fingers).</p>
