<p>The contributions to this special issue of <italic>Politics &amp; Society</italic> explore the relationship between social policy and financial markets, which was thrown into sharp relief by the financial crisis of 2007-09. The research asks how particular social policies underpin and even create financial markets, specifically mass markets for consumer finance, mortgages, and pensions. The authors study how social regulation and subsidization of financial products aim to establish and expand the reach of financial markets for reasons of social policy, such as promoting equality of access to resources and the shifting of risks onto market parties that are supposed to be better equipped to bear them. This was a relevant trend in social policy reforms before 2007, often described as “privatization” or “marketization” of welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032329211434687">1</xref></sup> We put this in a wider comparative perspective and show that this trend has not been confined to the United States. Most importantly, we explore how social policies directed at financial markets as well as financial regulations with social policy implications may have contributed to the most severe crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>This crisis—and the relationship between financial markets and social policy that it has highlighted—invites us to revisit the analytical and normative framework of comparative welfare state research. Social policy scholars like Esping-Andersen (1990) saw the welfare state as a political response to the Great Transformation as described by Karl Polanyi (1944). In this tradition, the constitutive role of social safety nets amounts to a humanizing “embedding” of already existing markets. Social policy in mature capitalist economies is primarily concerned with “decommodifying” labor, which is making the living standard of individuals and families to some extent independent of earnings. In this tradition, markets come about through antisocial processes that are then restrained by social policy.</p>
<p>This interpretation cannot grasp that a social policy may <italic>create</italic> markets. Notably, policies devised to make housing affordable created a subprime mortgage market, which then turned out to be a crucial element in—if not the cause of—the ensuing Great Recession. Contrary to the notion of embedding and constraining markets, social policy can set market actors free to pursue commercial interests more vigorously and to be more ruthlessly competitive. An example is the piggy backing of private insurance schemes on basic state schemes. In turn, this observation also contradicts the standard economic notion that social services crowd out markets.</p>
<p>Analytically, at least three relationships between social policy and markets can be distinguished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032329211434687">2</xref></sup> There is, first, the traditional compensation of market outcomes. In financial markets, the typical market outcome to be compensated is that the borrower cannot service the debt as stipulated. Income support and prescribed loan modification can be ways of redistributing from the lucky to the unlucky or from the stronger in terms of loss-bearing capacity to the weaker.</p>
<p>Second, the concept of market correcting or shaping social policy, grasps the distribution or allocation of risk-bearing responsibilities and resources from strong to weak parties at the point of contracting. Social policy corrects markets in that it defines and confines possible market outcomes, mainly through protective regulations. For instance, financial protection of “vulnerable” (rather than “competent”) consumers shifts the risk between unequal market parties and in favor of presumably less-informed clients.</p>
<p>Last but not least, social policy creates markets in the sense that it distributes resources such that a latent market demand and supply can materialize. Many social rights give an entitlement to individuals to whom private supply has to respond, typically by stipulating quotas for a needy target group and supporting measures that share the risk on the supply side. The affordable housing policy in the United States was of this nature. Another important example is the guarantee of a minimum income to everybody, as is common in European welfare states, which allowed the establishment of mass markets for financial products such as insurance and consumer credit, as it lowers the risk of complete default when individuals and families fall on hard times.</p>
<p>Like market correction, the market-creating role of social policy goes beyond the exclusive identification of social policy with redistribution of risks or resources. The conventional focus has the implausible implication that the existence of markets comes first, economically and historically, and is politically taken as a given by social policymakers who content themselves with compensating for undesirable market outcomes. Even where rudimentary markets have developed spontaneously, as in the case of consumer credit, we can observe that actors such as organized labor or the banks themselves tend to push the state into taking a public stake in developing and standardizing these rudimentary markets.</p>
<p>The conventional focus on redistribution also suggests that it is typically weakness or mishap on the part of the borrowers that need fixing. But market actors left to their own devices might create markets characterized by exclusion and risk accumulation that is to the lender’s own detriment. Some social policies, like antidiscrimination law or state guarantees, try to change this by forcing those markets to offer access at a reasonable price or incentivizing them to offer suitable products. Bank regulation may turn out to be social policy, sometimes in disguise, because it inadvertently affects the balance sheets of pension funds and insurance companies. Thus, social policy makes and shapes markets, and this affects the initial distribution of resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032329211434687">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>For better or worse, then, social policy is constitutive for markets generally, and financial markets particularly. We look at this constitutive role of social policy in “the spotlight of the crisis”: as a permanent feature of the welfare state, with the crisis as a reminder that we do not understand certain aspects of the relationship between markets and social policy very well. This crisis raised the specter that certain social policies may not only have failed to prevent but actually contributed to the destruction of livelihoods that occurred in the course of the market collapse. We start from the notion that social policy cannot help but create and correct markets in addition to its widely acknowledged role of compensating for adverse market outcomes. But the ideas on which this constitutive role is built matter: is it self-confidently molding markets for social welfare purposes? Or are welfare interventions buying into market norms such as choice and emulating market mechanisms through enhancing transparency? The way social policy is made determines which stakeholders become interested and consequently the degree to which the concerns of the disadvantaged get political representation.</p>
<p>The article by Gunnar Trumbull gives a first answer to these questions, in a comparison of consumer credit market development in the United States and France. Both markets started from social credit movements, with organized labor and religiously motivated reformers taking a keen interest. In the United States, credit came to be seen as a tool to promote welfare for all, right down to the working classes. In France, credit was seen as a threat to the welfare of and solidarity among workers. Trumbull shows that ideational differences about the development of consumer credit markets extended beyond state actors; strikingly, trade unions in the two countries had quite different views about the desirability of extending access to consumer credit. Powerful business interests (banks, in particular) also took opposite positions on market development, even though high transaction costs made it an equally unprofitable business in both countries. Their different stances led them to advocate different regulatory approaches. Trumbull argues that the consumer credit markets that developed ultimately reflect the interwar and postwar accommodations over social policy goals in the two countries.</p>
<p>The way in which this special issue looks at the relationship between social policy and financial market regulation forces us to radically rethink what caused the financial crisis. Herman Schwartz takes up this Whodunit question. Causation can run both ways: has welfare state intervention led to market actors taking too many risks, or has the retreat of the welfare state left too much room for markets to contract risks that individuals are not equipped to bear? Schwartz qualifies both verdicts and alerts us to a neglected dimension of the post-Great Depression welfare state, namely the macro-level regulation of finance. It protected the financial system from itself while providing the infrastructure that allowed the financing of nest eggs and old-age security on an unprecedented scale. He argues that deregulation undermined the match between long-term financial liabilities (mortgages) and long-term financial assets (pensions). This mismatch in the balance sheet of the welfare state ultimately caused the crisis. It had gone unnoticed by most observers because financial deregulation was not seen as a matter of social policy. It leaves us with the uncomfortable insight that the unwinding of the market-creating and correcting role of the welfare state can destroy markets.</p>
<p>The next contribution by Waltraud Schelkle takes a closer look into housing finance, which Schwartz identified as the last screw that held the old regime together. It gave way when policymakers tried to take it out (as an expert on regime change, Lech Walesa, could have told them). The crisis threw up a real puzzle. Both the United Kingdom and France had a similar, if not higher, potential for crisis than the United States, if measured in terms of their housing price bubbles or (shorter) time horizons of mortgage credit. Yet when the bubble burst, the consequences in terms of families getting overindebted and eventually losing their homes were much worse in the United States. Schelkle’s article asks to what extent the different ways homeownership was promoted in the three countries explains the puzzle. Each of these countries had a very different stance in regard to the creation, correction, and compensation of mortgage credit markets through welfare state intervention. The United States stands out for singularly aggressive market-making policies that are complemented neither by protection of the vulnerable consumer once she is promoted into homeownership (as in France) nor effective insurance when things have gone wrong (as in the United Kingdom). This combination of activism and complacency not only exposed individuals to unbearable risks but it endangered the financial system as well, echoing a finding of Schwartz.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the article by Gary Burtless takes a closer look at old-age security and asks how private pensions could be made to keep their promise of retirement income security. His study meets the social engineers of privatized old-age security on their own turf. With the help of simulations, Burtless demonstrates that private pension schemes make retirement income reasonably safe only to the extent that the private pensions are combined with elements of social insurance. Even the most skillful investor faces a sharp tradeoff between risk and return, and the safest private investment strategy produces a lower return than Social Security. Burtless brings the latest insights of behavioral economics on board, suggesting that individuals cannot manage their savings over long-time horizons. Social regulation would have to make pension savings mandatory or restrict the choice among financial products. Regulation would make private pensions even less attractive for households, because it eliminates the most alluring features of private provisions, notably choice and adaptability to individual circumstances. Burtless’ contribution reverses the prevailing trend in the pre-crisis debate on pensions, which was single-mindedly concerned with how public schemes can emulate market mechanisms. The crisis forces us to think through whether markets should emulate social insurance in order to achieve welfare gains.</p>
<p>The contribution by Deborah Mabbett scrutinizes one lesson that has been drawn from the crisis, namely the need for regulators to take insights of behavioral economics on board. Mabbett examines the implications of automatically enrolling people into private pensions, a provision that supposedly deals with the myopia of individuals when it comes to saving for their longevity. Taking up Burtless’ demonstration of just how risky private pensions are, she examines whether and how households might be compensated for bad outcomes in the United States and the United Kingdom, two liberal welfare states that “nudge” employees into signing up for private pension plans. Public pensions provide a minimum level of security, but the policy of substituting private for public pensions can erode this security and lead to regulatory interventions to reassign risks. These interventions can in turn shift blame to the regulator when things go wrong, so the government is forced to underpin a market that it has heavy-handedly created. Mabbett shows that the U.K. government is more likely than U.S. authorities to become the target of individuals taking recourse: the reason lies in the combination of a minimalist public provision for old-age security with a much more prescriptive regulation of private pensions. The converse implication from the U.S. system is that a lightly regulated or “free” market in retirement savings requires a robust underpinning of Social Security.</p>
<p>The comparisons in our articles qualify but also agree with the conventional view that the United States has taken a rather different path from Europe in using social policy for creating, correcting, and compensating financial markets. The difference is not that public policy instrumentalized financial markets for social policy purposes in the United States, such as affordable housing or old-age security; European governments did so and continue to do so. Rather, it was the particular social policy configuration of aggressive market creation, weak regulatory consumer protection, and even weaker insurance that failed. Moreover, changes in financial regulation were fatefully unsettling for the established diversification of risks among different segments of finance in the United States. Deregulation of financial markets can now be seen as part of welfare retrenchment, which has arguably destabilized markets more than it has reduced the role of the state. This is poorly understood and hardly recognized on either side of the Atlantic. Financial regulation and social policy still belong to different worlds of policymaking, public discourse, and social research, but the crisis suggests that we ignore their connection at our peril.</p>

<p>Esping-Andersen, Gösta, <italic>Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism</italic> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990) admits that much in his chapter 4 on state and market in pension regimes. But he is bound to see a paradox (92) in the concomitant growth of public and private pensions. His conception of social rights as ensuring living standards independent of market forces (3) cannot make theoretical sense of the historical fact that “[p]ublic policy was decisive in nourishing market expansion” in pensions (94).</p>
