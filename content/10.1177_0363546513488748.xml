<sec id="section1-0363546513488748">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Decreased hip range of motion (ROM) is a common finding in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513488748">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To report the prevalence of decreased hip ROM in asymptomatic adolescent athletes and to correlate examination findings to signs of FAI on radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513488748">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513488748">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 226 adolescent athletes presenting for state-mandated preparticipation physical examinations were assessed. Hip internal rotation was measured with the participant supine and the hip flexed to 90°. All participants with ≤10° of internal rotation were invited to return for standard radiographs and MRI of both hips. An age-matched control group, with &gt;10° of internal rotation, underwent MRI examination only. Twenty-six athletes (13 study and 13 control) returned for clinical and radiographic examinations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513488748">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Nineteen athletes (34 hips, 8%) were found to have &lt;10° of internal rotation. Eight athletes (13 hips, 3%) also had a positive anterior impingement sign. Thirteen of 19 athletes participated in the radiographic portion of the study. Of these 13 participants, 4 had limited internal rotation unilaterally, leaving 22 hips in the study group. Eight of 13 participants (15 hips, 68%) had a cam-type deformity evident on plain radiographs, and 4 participants (7 hips, 32%) had a positive radiographic crossover sign. The average α angle measured from radial MRI sequences was 58.1° in the study group versus 44.3° in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Fifteen hips (68%) in the study group had abnormal MRI findings within the acetabular labrum or cartilage compared with 10 of 26 hips (38%) in the control group (odds ratio, 3.4; <italic>P</italic> = .078).</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546513488748">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Eight percent of asymptomatic teenagers had limited internal rotation on examination; 68% of these had radiographic findings suggestive of FAI. More than two thirds of these participants had evidence of asymptomatic hip pathological lesions on MRI.</p>

<body>
<p>Several authors have discussed that primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is in fact a rare occurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513488748">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513488748">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513488748">32</xref></sup> The majority of patients with degenerative disease of the hip severe enough to warrant total hip arthroplasty at a young age have an underlying structural disorder of the hip joint in the form of hip dysplasia or, more commonly, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513488748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488748">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Femoroacetabular impingement is defined as a decrease in hip clearance that results in impingement with normal daily range of motion (ROM). This most commonly occurs anteriorly as the anterolateral femoral head-neck junction abuts against the anterior acetabular rim with hip flexion and internal rotation. Clinically, this is manifested as limited internal rotation of the flexed hip and pain with extremes of flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (positive anterior impingement sign).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513488748">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488748">9</xref></sup> Factors contributing to a reduced clearance of the hip include poor anterolateral orientation or increased relative depth of the acetabulum and offset abnormalities of the femoral head-neck junction. The typical radiographic findings consistent with both cam- and pincer-type impingement have been well described on anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographic projections of the hip and with magnetic resonance arthrography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513488748">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488748">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513488748">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488748">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513488748">28</xref></sup> Multiple prior studies have reviewed the prevalence of clinical and radiographic signs of FAI in a population of asymptomatic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488748">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513488748">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513488748">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513488748">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> Hack et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488748">11</xref></sup> found that 14% of 200 asymptomatic patients had evidence of a cam-type deformity on hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and those with reduced internal rotation of the hip or a positive impingement sign were more likely to have an elevated α angle on MRI. In a study of men undergoing conscription for the Swiss army, MRI of 244 hips showed a 24% overall prevalence of a cam-type deformity and a trend of increasing cam deformity with decreasing hip internal rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although these studies have shown a correlation between clinical and radiographic findings of FAI in adults, this relationship has yet to be studied in the adolescent population. Active adolescents are often involved in high-impact activities that require extremes of hip motion, which may predispose them to more frequent or forceful impingement of the hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513488748">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513488748">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513488748">34</xref></sup> The early identification of those patients with hip anatomic features that may predispose them to the development of FAI and subsequent hip lesions would allow practitioners to more effectively counsel the young active patient in regard to nonoperative treatment strategies, such as activity modification or directed physical therapy with the goal of preventing disease progression. Our hypothesis was that limited hip internal rotation at 90° of flexion would be associated with radiographic and/or MRI findings consistent with acetabular retroversion and/or femoral head-neck offset abnormalities and possibly evidence of early damage to the hip chondrolabral complex. Explicitly, we sought (1) to determine the prevalence of hip examination findings consistent with possible FAI in this group of young, active seemingly asymptomatic patients; (2) to determine the relationship between these examination findings and radiographic and MRI anatomic abnormalities consistent with FAI; and (3) to determine if early evidence of hip pathological changes is present when compared with age-matched controls.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The current study was conducted during state-mandated preparticipation examinations for high school students participating in sports from 2009 to 2010. High school students who wish to participate in organized sports in the local school district must undergo a comprehensive physical examination every 3 years. Through the Department of Sports Medicine, our institution offers a preparticipation physical examination once yearly for high school students.</p>
<p>A total of 226 athletes aged 12 to 18 years (mean age, 15 years) were examined. All musculoskeletal examinations were performed by a resident or staff physician from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation or Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Mayo Clinic. All physicians performing physical examinations were instructed to specifically examine athletes’ hips for limited internal rotation and a positive anterior impingement sign. All examinations were performed with the patient in the supine position on a standard examination table. The examiner was instructed to flex the hip to 90° and rotate the hip, while maintaining neutral pelvic rotation and tilt, and to record the maximum ROM obtained in internal rotation. Reduced internal rotation was defined as ≤10° of internal rotation with the hip flexed to 90° and neutral abduction and adduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513488748">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488748">27</xref></sup> Internal rotation was measured with a goniometer between the long axis of the body and the anatomic axis of the tibia at maximal internal rotation. A positive anterior impingement sign was defined as groin pain with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513488748">20</xref></sup> No specific guidelines for the amount of force applied with this maneuver were provided; however, examiners were instructed to inquire for pain at “extremes of motion.” Students with normal physical examination results were also recruited for participation as part of a control group for statistical comparison. Inclusion criteria included any athlete aged 12 to 18 years with reduced internal rotation (as defined above) or a positive anterior impingement sign. Exclusion criteria for both the study and control groups included pre-existing hip conditions resulting in structural abnormalities of the hip, including slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Perthes disease, developmental dysplasia of the hip, avascular necrosis, epiphyseal dysplasia, and prior hip fractures, surgeries, or infections.</p>
<p>Athletes meeting inclusion criteria were directed to a study coordinator to discuss participation in the study in the presence of a parent or guardian. All patients and their parents or legal guardians gave written informed consent to participate in the study, and the study was approved by our institutional review board. Study participants were offered a remuneration of $100 for completion of the study, which included radiographic assessment and a return visit with the senior author (R.J.S.) to review the radiographic findings and undergo a repeat physical examination.</p>
<p>In total, 19 of 226 athletes (8%; 17 male and 2 female) and 34 of 452 hips (8%) had limited internal rotation of the hip or a positive anterior impingement sign. All participants were invited to return for a physical examination by the senior author and radiographic imaging. Study participants underwent MRI of both hips and 2 radiographs: a well-centered AP radiograph of the pelvis and a Von Rosen view of both hips. These specific views were approved by the Pediatric Radiation Safety Committee and were thought to be associated with the lowest dose of radiation to patients. A Dunn lateral view was not approved by the Pediatric Radiation Safety Committee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488748">6</xref></sup> Thirteen of the 19 athletes with limited internal rotation returned for a further examination and radiographic imaging. Nine participants had reduced ROM or a positive anterior impingement sign bilaterally; the remaining 4 participants had unilaterally reduced ROM or impingement signs. Thus, there were 13 athletes (22 hips) with abnormal examination results that composed our study group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513488748">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, 13 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited and asked to return for repeat examinations and MRI, but radiographs were not obtained.</p>

<p>Plain radiographs in the study group were reviewed for the presence of OA (Tönnis grade 0-3) and evidence of dysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513488748">36</xref></sup> All pelvis AP radiographs were screened for appropriate rotation and inclination by assessing the symmetry and obturator foramina and the alignment and distance between the tip of the coccyx and the superior border of the pubic symphysis. The presence or absence of a crossover sign, ischial spine sign, or cam-type deformity (α angle &gt;55° on Von Rosen view) was evaluated from the radiographs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488748">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513488748">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488748">31</xref></sup> A Tönnis angle of &gt;10° or a lateral center edge angle of &lt;25° was considered indicative of developmental dysplasia of the hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488748">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All participants were scanned on GE Signa MRI systems (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) operating at 3 T (21 participants) or 1.5 T (5 participants) using a dedicated surface coil centered over the hip being imaged. Fast spin echo (FSE) T1-weighted (repetition time [TR] and minimum echo time [TE] at 1.5 T = 400-700 ms; TR and minimum TE at 3 T = 700-900 ms) non–fat-saturated and fluid-sensitive FSE intermediate to T2-weighted (1.5 T: TR = 4000 ms, TE = 45 ms; 3 T: TR = 4500 ms, TE = 50 ms) fat-saturated images were obtained in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using the following parameters: 4-mm thickness and 0.5 mm between images, with an 18-cm field of view. In 3 participants imaged at 3 T, the FSE intermediate to T2-weighted fat-saturated images were also obtained in the oblique axial plane (parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femoral neck) using the same parameters. In all participants, T1-weighted images were obtained in a radial fashion about the longitudinal axis of the femoral neck. The α angle was measured at the anterosuperior junction of the femoral neck at the 1:30 clock position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488748">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513488748">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> An α angle of ≥55° at this location was defined as a cam-type deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488748">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513488748">29</xref></sup> No previous technique for the assessment of acetabular version from MRI scans has been described. We measured acetabular version from each MRI sequence, using the horizontal plane of the MRI scanner table as a reference for the neutral plane of the pelvis, similar to a previous study utilizing computed tomography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513488748">33</xref></sup> The distal femur was not included on the MRI examination, and thus, no reliable estimate of femoral version could be made.</p>
<p>The MRI scans were reviewed for the presence of structural changes at the femoral head-neck junction and acetabulum. The presence of synovial herniation pits, acetabular abnormalities, os acetabuli, labral lesions, and cartilage damage was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488748">17</xref></sup> The presence of abnormal T1 or T2 signals within and extending through the acetabular labrum was considered indicative of a labral tear. Signaling extending through the normal contour of the acetabular cartilage on T1 or T2 sequences was considered evidence of a possible cartilage defect or abnormality. Intra-articular gadolinium was not utilized, which was a departure from our routine, as this was not approved by the pediatric institutional review board. The MRI scans were reviewed by a single musculoskeletal radiologist with over 20 years of experience, who was blinded to the results of the physical examination.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546513488748">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The MRI findings in the study group were compared with those in the control group. Data were summarized as the mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and number (percentage) for categorical variables. The analysis focused primarily on comparing the group of participants with limited ROM to the group of participants with normal ROM. Categorical variables, such as the presence of abnormal MRI findings (no vs yes) and α angle (≤55° vs &gt;55°), were compared using logistic regression, and continuous variables were compared using a linear models approach. Because most study participants had both their right and left hips included in the analysis, both the logistic and linear models were run in a general linear models framework utilizing generalized estimating equations to properly account for the within-participant correlation. The outcomes of the logistic regression models are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>There was a trend toward increasing evidence of chondrolabral lesions in those hips with abnormal physical examination results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513488748">Table 4</xref>). Fifteen of 22 hips (68%) in the study group had abnormal MRI findings indicative of damage to the acetabular labrum, rim, or cartilage compared with 10 of 26 hips (38%) in the control group (OR, 3.4; <italic>P</italic> = .078). Pathological lesions isolated to the acetabular labrum tended to be more prevalent in the study group than control group (64% vs 38%, respectively; OR, 2.8; <italic>P</italic> = .12); however, neither of these 2 comparisons reached statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513488748">Figure 2</xref>). The presence of cartilage damage on MRI was an infrequent finding and was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Three hips had an os acetabuli identifiable on MRI, all were from the study group, and all had a positive anterior impingement sign.</p>

<p>One patient in the study group did subsequently return to the authors’ clinic after developing symptoms secondary to FAI at 9 months after the study concluded. Repeat MRI at that time confirmed the presence of a femoral head-neck abnormality and superior acetabular labral tear.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is now well accepted that over time, FAI may lead to OA in young active patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488748">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513488748">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513488748">37</xref></sup> Anatomic abnormalities of the femoral head-neck junction (cam impingement) and anterior acetabular overcoverage (pincer impingement) lead to abnormal osseous contact between the femur and acetabular rim during extremes of motion, resulting in labral and cartilage damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488748">3</xref></sup> Although no screening examinations to identify patients at risk for early hip degeneration secondary to FAI exist, it would be beneficial to identify these patients before the development of irreversible chondral damage. Physical examination signs such as limited internal rotation and pain with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip are present in the symptomatic patient presenting with FAI; however, the prevalence or significance of these findings in the asymptomatic young patient is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513488748">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, the prevalence of abnormal hip examination results associated with FAI in 226 young asymptomatic athletes was 8%. In a study of 1080 healthy male patients, Reichenbach et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> found that internal rotation of &lt;30° was present in 19% of patients. Hack et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488748">11</xref></sup> reported that 13.5% of 200 asymptomatic patients had internal rotation of the hip of &lt;20° and that 1.5% had a positive anterior impingement sign. Based on previous studies of symptomatic patients with FAI, we defined limited internal rotation as &lt;10°, which may have led to a lower prevalence of hips with “reduced” internal rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513488748">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488748">27</xref></sup> As Reichenbach et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> have previously discussed, the lack of reproducibility of physical examination findings in patients has led that group to propose the use of an internal rotation chair that can reproducibly measure rotation at the hip. In our study, all patients were re-examined by the senior author, and the screening examination findings were confirmed. Although our measurement of internal rotation is quite crude, it is simple and can be performed in the office by primary care providers, physical therapists, or trainers and could help identify young athletes at risk for FAI.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the current study. First, this study is only representative of the young, active adolescent population. It does not represent the adolescent population as a whole, and recruiting only young athletes may have excluded a large portion of the adolescent population from our analysis, such as those who lead more sedentary lifestyles or athletes who choose not to participate in school district–sanctioned sports. Second, all practitioners were instructed on the correct method of the physical examination by the senior author, and the initial screening examination was performed by a variety of different physicians, leaving some room for error between individual measurements. Although radiographic findings thought to be consistent with FAI have been described in a skeletally mature population, including the crossover sign, os acetabuli, and ischial spine sign, we undoubtedly examined many skeletally immature patients to whom the previously described radiographic signs may not be generalizable. The identification of cam-type lesions on plain radiographs would have been more reliably obtained through the use of a single frog-leg lateral, Dunn view, or cross-table lateral radiograph of each hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488748">6</xref></sup> However, the increased radiation doses associated with these radiographic views were deemed too great after review with the pediatric institutional review board and Pediatric Radiation Safety Committee. We do concede that the assessment of labral tears would have been aided with the use of intra-articular gadolinium. However, the use of intra-articular contrast was deemed overly invasive for the purposes of the current study, and the quality of the MRI scans obtained was adequate to determine if subtle changes within the acetabular labrum were present. The assessment of damage to the acetabular rim and labrum was an important part of the current study, and while there was a trend toward increasing acetabular lesions on MRI with reduced internal rotation, our numbers did not reach significance. Although a true difference in hip injury on MRI may exist, recruitment of more participants would have been necessary to detect any difference. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow us to determine the ultimate fate of the painless hip with radiographic evidence of FAI, and clearly, longitudinal studies are required to determine if cam and pincer lesions in the young asymptomatic patient ultimately lead to an increased risk of clinically relevant FAI or symptomatic OA of the hip.</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of asymptomatic hips with clinical signs of reduced internal rotation or a positive anterior impingement sign on examination had evidence of abnormal hip anatomy on plain radiographs of the pelvis in this study. These were manifested in most cases as a cam-type deformity (elevated α angle) or as excessive acetabular retroversion. These radiographic findings have been shown to be consistently present in patients presenting with symptomatic FAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513488748">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488748">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513488748">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488748">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488748">31</xref></sup> as well as patients with symptomatic OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488748">10</xref></sup> This underscores the importance of plain radiography in the evaluation of patients with activity-related groin pain that may be related to FAI, as poor orientation of the acetabulum and femoral head-neck offset abnormalities may be easily identified.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have assessed the structural characteristics of the femoral head-neck junction in patients with FAI on MRI. An increased α angle has been shown to correlate with reduced internal rotation on physical examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513488748">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488748">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488748">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> We found that α angles were increased in those patients with reduced internal rotation (58.1° vs 44.3°), and there were significantly more hips with α angles of &gt;55° in the study group. Acetabular abnormalities, such as excessive retroversion, os acetabuli, and damage to the acetabular rim and labrum, are also more prevalent in patients with FAI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488748">24</xref></sup> Utilizing a modified approach to measure acetabular version, we found that those hips with limited internal rotation also had less acetabular anteversion (13.4° vs 17.9°).</p>
<p>No previous study has identified the presence of damage to the acetabular labrum, cartilage, or rim on MRI among asymptomatic adolescent athletes with reduced internal rotation on examination. We identified a trend toward increasing evidence of abnormalities in the acetabular rim, cartilage, and labrum on MRI in hips with abnormal physical examination results (OR, 3.4; <italic>P</italic> = .078). The elevated OR demonstrates that this is a true finding, and the lack of statistical significance was because of our inability to have all study patients return for radiographs.</p>
<p>More than two thirds of patients in the study group had MRI evidence of damage to the hip joint, as did over a third of patients in the control group. Reichenbach et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488748">30</xref></sup> also reported a high prevalence of abnormal MRI findings in patients with normal hip examination results. Their population consisted of mostly men in the Swiss army, and the increased level of activity and training could potentially explain the higher prevalence of labral abnormalities in both studies. In addition, MRI may be overly sensitive, and one must question if these findings represent true pathological abnormalities or normal variants in a still growing population of adolescent patients.</p>
<p>As more information about the natural history of FAI becomes available, it will be important to understand how and why the pathoanatomy of FAI leads to future hip injuries in some patients. Specifically, if there is a way to easily screen for those with reduced hip clearance, does counseling those patients on avoiding activities that require forced hip motion to the extreme reduce the development of symptomatic FAI or even OA in the future? Currently, we do not recommend any sports-related or activity modification based on the results of a “positive” screening examination result. This study, however, provides new data that can be used to compare future longitudinal natural history studies. Obviously, the data on the natural history of FAI are necessary before definitive recommendations regarding activity modification for the adolescent athlete can be made, such as avoiding ballet or playing as a goalie in hockey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513488748">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513488748">21</xref></sup> Additionally, there is probably a little role for prophylactic surgery. However, our findings suggest that a simple hip examination may have utility as a screening test in asymptomatic patients to detect the hip at risk of future pathological changes secondary to impingement during high-risk activities.</p>
