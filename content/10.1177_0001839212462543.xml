<p>Since the end of the patronage model and the subsequent takeover of the production of cultural and creative works (art, music, literature, etc.) by organizations, scholars have struggled to reconcile the world of creative, artistic production with that of markets and commerce. In particular, researchers have focused their energies on understanding how goods with mostly symbolic, rather than material value—in material terms, an oil painting by Pablo Picasso is no different or better than a painting by me, but that is the least consequential determinant of its economic value in the market—are exchanged in markets, which are known to be governed by specific economic rules. The most common and widely accepted explanation for how symbolic value is translated into economic value builds on Danto’s, Dickie’s, and Becker’s conceptualization of “art worlds” and Bourdieu’s notion of “consecration” by entities that evaluate creative works and place them in a relative hierarchy of quality and symbolic value, which in turn translates into economic value in the marketplace. Up until recently, however, there have been few systematic studies of these entities and their role and functions in the creative industries, (populated by the firms that undertake to bring creative works to market), and this book takes a large and important step toward filling this gap. The book strives to shed light on three important aspects of creative industries: how economic value is constructed from cultural or symbolic value in creative industries; the role of fairs and festivals in this process of negotiating and constructing value; and the recursive relationship between value-construction processes and the structure and configuration of creative industries.</p>
<p>Although there are multiple entities that engage in negotiating values in creative industries, the book, quite rightly, focuses only on one type of entity—the fair, or festival—trading broad coverage for deep understanding. The comprehensive introduction by the editors defines fairs and festivals and justifies the book’s focus on these events by highlighting their central role in the production, negotiation, and transaction of material, social, temporal, spatial, and aesthetic or appreciative values in determining the economic value of creative/cultural works and products. The subsequent chapters shed further light on each of these forms of value and the processes of negotiation that occur at fairs and festivals. Building on anthropological, historical, and sociological depictions of the colloquial term, “fair,” the editors develop a definition that conceives of fairs (which subsumes festivals) as temporally and socially bounded events in which institutions and individuals belonging to a particular creative industry intersect and interact to negotiate and affirm the multiple kinds of value embedded in the cultural product of the industry. This definition and the theorization of fairs as “tournaments of value,” or “field-configuring events,” undergirds all the chapters in the volume.</p>
<p>An edited volume, the book consists of thirteen chapters in addition to the introduction by the editors and an afterword by Joseph Lampel. The chapters cover a wide array of events, and the authors employ a variety of theoretical perspectives and empirical strategies in addressing the questions the book seeks to answer. One of the major strengths of the book is not only that several different creative industries are examined (art, book publishing, film/TV, music, fashion, and wine) but also that, with the exceptions of music and book publishing, multiple types of value-negotiation events within each industry are studied. This gives the reader a comprehensive picture of the various factors that influence the negotiations of values in the creative industries, while also elucidating similarities and differences across event types and industries, both of which are crucial to laying the foundations for theory building in a field of organizational research that has been relatively neglected. Fairs and festivals in different industries are the most common type of event covered in the book—art: chapters 2 and 3 by Thompson and Tang, respectively; publishing: chapter 5 by Moeran; film and TV: chapters 6, 7, and 8, by Havens, Mezias et al., and Ruling, respectively; music: chapter 9, by Lena; and, fashion: chapters 10 and 11 by Entwistle and Rocamora, and Skov and Meier, respectively—although, other kinds of events such as salons (chapter 1 by Delacour and Leca), auctions (chapter 4 by Smith), and wine classification (chapter 12 by Croidieu) and wine tasting events (chapter 13 by Anand) are given their due as well.</p>
<p>The chapters share an important feature, despite the diversity of subjects and approaches. I was most impressed by how well and deeply all the authors understood and knew the specific event they were writing about, as well as its context. While this may seem like a sine qua non of good research, the extensive field work (except in the cases of historical events covered in chapters 1 and 12) conducted by the authors is critical to readers’ understanding of the events and the multifarious, almost indiscernible (to the untrained eye) ways in which values are negotiated at these events. One of the many compelling instances of this is Moeran’s description of how relative spatial positioning and physical locations of publishers at book fairs translate into status hierarchies and finally into economic value; obviously such novel insights are impossible without deep immersion in the field. Even the one chapter (chapter 7) with a strongly quantitative grounding uses the authors’ findings from field work to substantiate and illustrate econometric analyses.</p>
<p>An inherently open-minded and polymathic approach is another strength shared by the chapters. Most chapters draw methodologies as well as concepts from disciplines and literatures as varied as anthropology, sociology, history, and institutional theory. Although this does make for slow reading at times, owing to the need to absorb a variety of literatures, most readers should appreciate the more complete understanding of the phenomenon and underlying processes that this approach provides.</p>
<p>The Introduction and the Afterword are valuable segments of the book. The former provides the theoretical foreground and motivations of the volume, while the latter cohesively positions the chapters relative to the literature on cultural production fields and negotiations of value to indicate their collective contribution. In particular, the Afterword juxtaposes the dynamic and entrepreneurial negotiations of cultural and economic values in fairs and festivals against prevailing notions of habitus and the reproduction of existing social structures to draw strategic implications for firms and suggest further rich areas of research into how value is constructed. This is a valuable new direction for research in the individual areas of valuation, creative industries, and entrepreneurship, as well as their intersections.</p>
<p>Reading the volume does raise some questions that the book itself does not answer, although this is to be expected of any book that tackles such a contentious topic as valuation. Foremost, the use of the “field-configuring events” literature as one of the theoretical foundations left me asking if there was something fundamentally different about creative industries that generates the need for multiple and repeated field-configuring events, and if so, what that difference was. I wondered whether the old movie industry maxim, “you are only as good as your last film,” which is applicable to all creative industries, had anything to do with the repeated need for configuring and reconfiguring, negotiating and renegotiating values through fairs and festivals. Second, I looked for, and did not find, a comprehensive picture of the roles and functions of what I will call the “micro-negotiators” of value, i.e., the critics, reviewers, and commentators, who are not directly involved in the commerce but are key to the final consumers’ purchase decisions. Naturally, they are present at many, if not all, of these fairs (fashion writers at Fashion Week, for instance), and it would have been illuminating to understand precisely how they moderated and influenced the interactions and value negotiations that took place among the actual “producers,” i.e., the firms that had a commercial stake in the value of the cultural product. Finally, I wished there had been some acknowledgment or, better, an analysis of the impact of the migration to the Internet of some of these events. Fashion Weeks are now routinely “webcast” live, and the Armory Art Fair, for instance, will “open” online before it actually opens its physical doors. How will the negotiation of values take place, if at all, in the absence of the physical and visible cues available in fairs, were these events to move entirely to the Internet?</p>
<p>On the whole, however, I raise these questions not to detract from the value (no pun intended) of this book to organizational scholars but rather to spur research in this understudied area and to point out the ways in which this book got me thinking. This volume is important to anyone interested in studying, teaching, or working in creative industries in particular and complex institutional fields and the critical organizational process of valuation in general.</p>
