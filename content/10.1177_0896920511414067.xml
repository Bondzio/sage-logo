<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After the epithet being in vogue for some two decades, and the phenomenon widely accepted as a reality, it is clear that the process of ‘globalization’, the essence of which is a thoroughgoing opening up of the global economy, has presented acute economic challenges to less developed countries (LDCs). It would not be a misrepresentation – even to critics – to suggest that for all economies, including LDCs, the theoretical appeal of globalization or, more specifically, a liberalized investment and trading regime as implied under a neoliberal framework, was significant. Indeed for many it remains so despite the financial crisis and attendant global economic slowdown of 2008–9. This appeal rests on the standard neoclassical assumptions that globalization expands the markets for the products and services of LDCs, improves the international division of labour and, therefore, more effective exploitation of comparative advantage and the gains from trade. In turn, for those countries implementing liberalization measures, these processes should increase GDP and average per capita incomes, thereby raising living standards and reducing poverty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0896920511414067">
<title>FDI as a Driver of Development under Globalization</title>
<p>Contrary to theory, experience has shown that exporting products and services into the global market place is by no means straightforward. The capabilities required to produce, distribute, and market products and services are often not available to LDCs and so have to be acquired as resource transfers from other countries. The dominant conduit for this is foreign direct investment (FDI) via transnational corporations (TNCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511414067">Balasubramanyam et al., 1996</xref>). It is precisely because FDI is potentially able to aid the raising of domestic capabilities and efficiencies that it has become so desirable for LDCs writ large – although competition for FDI is also intense amongst developed countries.</p>
<p>It naturally follows that if the opening up of LDCs can generate such transfers implied in, and via, FDI, then the theoretical appeal can be translated into a very positive outcome. Alas, however, the reality for most LDCs – especially for the poorest – has not taken this path over the past two decades. A fundamental problem is that FDI invariably requires very exacting standards: notably, low cost but literate and numerate labour, plentiful natural resources, proximity to large markets, good communication and transport infrastructure, low levels of corruption, and macroeconomic and political stability. Evidence demonstrably shows that relatively few LDCs are able to offer these requisites to prospecting TNCs and it this that helps explain why FDI into the developing world is dominated by East and South East Asia; and the amount flowing into small and vulnerable economies (for whom this represents a high proportion of gross fixed capital formation) remains very small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511414067">UNCTAD, 2010</xref>, xix–xxii).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the result of increasing liberalization for many of the poorest LDCs has also been contrary to what theory predicted, namely stagnant, even declining, levels of FDI and trade. It is evident that not only do these countries lack the requisites to induce FDI, they also lack capabilities for technological upgrading and enhanced efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511414067">UNCTAD, 2010</xref>). In contrast, East Asian economies, above all, have managed to achieve sustained growth since independence and during an increasingly globalized economy centring on export-oriented industrialization with FDI often playing a pivotal role. Moreover, (excluding the peculiar example of Hong Kong) the role of the state was of fundamental importance to what is termed the ‘developmental state model’ (two classic works on this are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511414067">Amsden [1989]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511414067">Wade [1990]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511414067">Chang [2003]</xref> provides a good general analysis of the issues). True, the 1997 East Asian financial crisis was severe but the rebound was astonishingly speedy and sustained.</p>
<p>A crucial reason why such a developmental path has been problematic for so many developing economies is that growth does not generate universal benefits; on the contrary, it tends to exclude certain segments of the population (such as minority groups or those who are highly unskilled) and hence, accentuates inequalities. Moreover, some of those elements of the population residing near to a new investment (or on the site of a planned investment) can be subjected to great hardship with the risk of having their homes and livelihoods severely disrupted. We can argue that it has been the work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that has brought to bear this uncomfortable reality of even those economies that have achieved rapid growth rates (for a good survey of the issues, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511414067">Arenas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511414067">Schepers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511414067">Teegen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that LDCs are characterized by insufficient domestic savings, resource transfer via FDI has inevitably become a crucial determinant of development in an increasingly open world economy. Hence, the development challenge is not only to attract FDI, but also for it to generate significant positive multiplier effects. In other words, investment has to be appropriate in the sense of having a labour-using bias yet being efficiently deployed. Two sets of factors interplay in this regard. The first encompasses the host country’s legal and regulatory structures, overall infrastructure, fiscal and financial policies, and political stability. The second concerns the nature of the investment – and the linkages it generates. Thus, the first set of factors can attract or deter FDI whilst the second set determines the effectiveness of FDI <italic>for the host country</italic>.</p>
<p>We can postulate that it is because for so many economies the gains from globalization have not materialized – indeed for many of the least developed there has been deterioration – that there has arisen in the ‘epoch of globalization’ a groundswell of opposition to neoliberalism. Much of this has emanated from NGOs in both the developing and developed world and was accorded the umbrella term ‘anti-globalization movement’ (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511414067">Stiglitz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>During the mid-1990s, there was an attempt to develop a global set of rules for FDI – the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) – under the auspices of the OECD which its proponents believed would provide a level-playing field for all countries and lead to increased FDI flows globally, including to LDCs. The Fitzgerald Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511414067">Fitzgerald, 1998</xref>) acknowledged the need for assistance from OECD countries if the poor countries were to embrace the MAI. However, critics argued that the MAI was, in fact, a charter for increasing the rights of TNCs at the expense of smaller countries, labour, and the environment (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511414067">Gilpin, 2000</xref>). Under pressure from a wide array of NGOs, the MAI was shelved in 1998. This was a unique phenomenon: for the first time, NGOs had blocked a proposal that had been backed up by the world’s richest countries and the largest corporations. In 1999, NGOs were instrumental in halting World Trade Organisation negotiations in Seattle. It became clear that NGOs were beginning to have a significant impact on the international competitive environment, and indeed on the process of globalization itself which, in turn, was inevitably going to affect the global strategies of TNCs. Moreover, we can also argue that without campaigning by environmental NGOs, the agenda on climate change and measures to curb global warming would not have achieved such prominence – this notwithstanding the failure of the Copenhagen conference in December 2009 to achieve an internationally binding treaty (though an accord was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511414067">UNFCC, 2009</xref>]).</p>
<p>For many NGOs, the neoliberal ‘Washington Consensus’ was firmly rejected as the optimal path to development and poverty reduction in LDCs. Instead, there was the desire to replace it with a better alternative: one rooted in enhanced democracy and human rights, and tackling poverty and inequality by more direct, interventionist, means. The hypothesis of this article chimes with this reasoning, that is, globalization has to date negatively impacted on many developing (especially the poorest) countries’ ability to drive forward the development process and deal effectively with their internal poverty problems.</p>

<title>NGOs and the Rise of Corporate Social Responsibility</title>
<p>The liberalization of the global economy, in combination with the increasing importance attributed to FDI as a conduit for development, has directly led to the rising prominence of TNCs. Debates regarding the potentially negative effects of foreign investments by TNCs had been prominent during the 1960s and 1970s with respect to third world development (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511414067">Todaro, 2000</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511414067">Fuchs, 2010</xref>, for a useful recent survey of global FDI from a critical perspective). However, in the past two decades, among policy makers and government advisers, there has been unanimity of the view that the benefits of FDI overwhelmingly outweigh any costs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511414067">Hasan, 2008</xref>, for the example of China). It is for this reason that the trend has uniformly been of countries imposing fewer and fewer restrictions on TNCs, so that we may think of them as being the real ‘winners’ under globalization. Given the reluctance of LDC governments to carefully monitor and regulate TNCs – on the contrary, they give priority to facilitating TNC operations – it has largely been left to NGOs to provide close scrutiny.</p>
<p>Though there is no generally accepted definition of NGOs, the following used by the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511414067">WANGO</xref> website) captures the key elements well:<disp-quote>
<p>A non-governmental organization (NGO) is generally considered to be any non-state, nonprofit, voluntary organization. As a <italic>non-state entity</italic>, an NGO is generally independent from government influence – it is not a part of or controlled by government or an intergovernmental agency. As such, an NGO is either not established by a government, or intergovernmental agreement, or, if established in such a manner, is now independent of such influence. As a <italic>nonprofit organization</italic>, an NGO is not operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business, although profits may be generated for the mission of the organization. A more accurate term may be <italic>non-profit distributing</italic>, in that any surplus that is generated is to be used solely to help the organization fulfill its mission and objectives, with no part of the net earnings of the NGO to be distributed to the benefit of the directors, officers, members, or employees of the NGO, or any private persons, other than reasonable compensation for services rendered. As a <italic>voluntary</italic> organization, an NGO is not required to exist by law, but is formed by private initiative, resulting from voluntary actions of individuals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In effect, NGOs are organizations that are not part of the government sector or part of the business sector. For such reasons, they are sometimes referred to being part of the ‘third sector’ in society.</p>
<p>It is a demonstrable proposition that TNCs are more likely to take account of the wishes of ‘civil society’ in developed countries than in developing countries. One reason for this is that the lobbying power of civil society in general, and of NGOs in particular, is greater in the former countries than in the latter. But what has come to the fore in the age of globalization is the lobbying and campaigning by NGOs in TNC’s ‘home’ (i.e. developed) countries and <italic>against</italic> the harmful effects of TNC operations particularly in LDCs with weak civil societies. The effectiveness of this lobbying has, in turn, given prominence to NGOs, so much so that in many key issues of social and economic justice, they have become a vital social force which governments and businesses have been forced to take account of. Such issues include child labour, very low pay, poor (‘sweatshop’) working conditions, excessively long work hours, and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>One important consequence of this has been the creation of a whole new dimension of TNC activity, that of ‘corporate social responsibility’ (CSR) where TNCs attempt – invariably owing to pressure put upon them – to take account of their wider social obligations (see the papers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511414067">Kakabadse and Morsing, 2006</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511414067">Matten and Moon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511414067">Reynolds and Yuthas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511414067">Markovitz, 2008</xref>). It is important to note, however, that there is an increasing body of literature that adopts a critical approach to CSR (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511414067">Shamir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511414067">Banerjee, 2008</xref>) and the attempts by governments to improve ‘corporate governance’ (see, for example, in regard to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511414067">Soederberg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is by no means a uniform phenomenon; indeed great variations exist among TNCs regarding their approach to CSR. Indubitably, however, TNCs’ manufacturing operations in the developing world have been at the forefront of this lobbying and campaigning by NGOs.</p>
<p>The nexus of NGOs and TNCs became clearest in East Asia, especially in ‘special enterprise zones’ or ‘export processing zones’. As noted above, concern for poor pay and working conditions, including sweatshop conditions obtaining especially in supplier companies, the incidence of child labour, and the impact of TNC operations on the environment have all brought TNC activities into the global limelight, with a concomitant response from a plethora of NGOs across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511414067">Klein, 2000</xref>). The role of NGOs in exposing oppressive practices has been central. Paradoxically, however, the workplaces in which abusive working practices have occurred are usually <italic>not</italic> owned by the TNCs themselves but rather by sub-contracting domestic companies. Yet, the effectiveness of NGO campaigning has resulted in the affixing of <italic>social</italic> responsibility for these sub-contractors onto TNCs they supply and making illegitimate the argument that such suppliers are independent firms whose relationship to TNCs is based on ‘normal’ external market transaction, that is, on the basis of price, quantity, quality, delivery schedules, etc.: the key business criteria. By so doing, TNCs have been <italic>forced</italic> to become more socially responsible, and not by any voluntary act based on a notion of ethical business practice.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is that NGO activity was badly damaging the reputation and, crucially, brand names of those TNCs that were using suppliers resorting to unacceptable working practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511414067">Klein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511414067">Campbell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511414067">Schepers, 2006</xref>). Indeed there is little difference in the conscience of the discerning consumer between arguing, for example, that ‘Nike resorts to sweatshop practices in East Asia’ and ‘Nike uses sub-contractors who resort to sweatshop practices in East Asia’. The image of Nike will inevitably suffer under both. And Nike and other TNCs have understood this well and responded by being prepared to take meaningful actions regarding their wider social responsibility. Four key novel developments have occurred which can be considered the different constituents of CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511414067">Merk, 2004</xref>): (i) adoption of codes conduct; (ii) setting up departments that specialize in ‘social responsibility’ issues and which ensure that such conducts are adhered to by the organization as a whole; (iii) benchmarking of social standards – ensuring that there is parity with rival organizations; and (iv) involvement of external parties to help achieve (i)–(iii).</p>
<p>Just by the creation of these, it is clear that the competitive environment of TNC activities in developing countries, above all, has been altered. The question naturally arises as to the extent of this. NGOs taken as a collective whole are not <italic>consciously</italic> attempting to change the competitive environment but their actions taken together have had precisely this consequence. One can, however, think of NGO pressure against TNCs as being a countervailing pole to that of lobbyists acting on behalf of TNCs vis-a-vis governments.</p>
<p>It needs stressing that the very rise of NGOs <italic>contra</italic> TNCs and their sub-contractors indicates the weakness and often the complete absence of organized labour in many developing countries. That is, NGO activity particularly in regard to the working environment is, de facto, trade union work even though workers affected by their actions have not been active. Denial of trade union recognition by TNCs is an attractive inducement for FDI investment and consequently, LDC governments often consciously give this assurance. This presents an ethical problem, that is, can lobbying by NGOs in developed countries be construed as paternalistic behaviour towards workers and citizens in developing countries? It certainly can, but this would be a mistaken inference; a more accurate view would be to think of it as a combination of moral, economic and political solidarity. The impulse behind those involved in NGOs from the developed world (often in conjunction with NGOs in LDCs) is surely to show solidarity with those less well-off and more oppressed in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Increased CSR is a costly exercise. The question therefore arises as to what extent should TNCs accede to NGO demands, and at what point should they stop. TNCs resort to CSR to prevent loss of consumers, sales and profits. Totally ignoring NGO demands is likely to generate adverse publicity, consumer alienation, and loss of sales, and hence no longer seems a viable option. Conversely, increased CSR leads to strong customer loyalty, and the possibility of consumers switching from other substitute products produced by less socially responsible firms – although consideration needs to be given to the fact that only a certain proportion of customers of, and investors to, a firm will be responsive to CSR issues.</p>
<p>Yet, complying with <italic>all</italic> NGO demands must inevitably lead to rising costs and the corollary of the weakening of the competitive position – to the point where additional ‘ethical’ customers run out – so that there reaches a point of zero marginal revenue from the adoption of ever-increasing socially responsible behaviour. In the manner of the ‘efficiency wage hypothesis’, we can postulate an <italic>efficiency CSR hypothesis</italic>. Under the former, increasing wages is thought to increase worker productivity (and less shirking) and increased loyalty to the employer, with a concomitant long-term improvement in profitability. The optimum is to move to the point where the marginal wage does not elicit increased productivity. Similarly, firms will adopt CSR standards up to the point where the notional marginal CSR ‘standard’ does not induce additional customer loyalty. All this, however, is predicated on isolating the ‘CSR effect’ – in reality this is likely to present considerable problems.</p>
<p>Hence, adherence to CSR may be more to do with economic necessity than on ethical grounds so that it does not contradict the imperative of profit maximization. We can postulate that it has become a <italic>sine qua non</italic> for TNCs to research the precise types of CSR activities that affect their operations and products and services – regarding social issues, labour rights, transparency, environmental protection, supplier practices, etc. – and then quickly act upon the findings. The more carefully TNCs attempt to fulfil all these factors, the greater will be the cost incurred. In regard to operations in LDCs, the NGOs might insist that standards should be similar to those obtaining in TNC operations in developed countries. But the reality is that TNCs, not required to do so by host LDC governments, or constrained by global investment standards, will in all likelihood implement standards that fall short of those in DCs. An ‘efficient CSR’ regime will, therefore, lie between that obtaining in advanced economies and the minimum in the poorest developing economies.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>To conclude: there has been a powerful trend towards deregulation and removal of restrictions on TNCs in developing countries. A corollary to this is that TNCs are tempted to cut corners, suppress workers’ rights including trade union recognition, curtail the rights of indigenous people and adopt lax environmental standards – all of which would not be legal or tolerated in developed countries. During the period of globalization, NGOs have been the most vociferous and determined campaigners to force TNCs to comply with ethical standards over such issues and, by so doing, provide an alternative, ad hoc regulatory framework – a crucial by-product of which has been the rise of corporate social responsibility. This is a positive outcome yet it does not detract from the profound problems of development for the weakest developing countries via the route of inducing FDI in a globalized economic environment. Contrary to expectations, the increasing interdependence in the world economy presents formidable challenges to development and poverty alleviation for such economies.</p>
