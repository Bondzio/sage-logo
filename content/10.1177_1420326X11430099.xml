<abstract>
<p>An extensive CO<sub>2</sub> concentration monitoring activity was carried out in a middle school located in Rome. Objective of the study was to evaluate the indoor air quality in eight classrooms during class occupation and to evaluate the ventilation rates of a natural trickle ventilation system, through an interactive approach involving the pupils. The analysis was conducted in two phases: a long-term analysis that consisted of evaluating the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and indoor air temperature in each classroom during the 2009/2010 scholastic year to obtain a snapshot of the indoor environment and a short-term testing carried out in 4 days in February 2010, involving the pupils in the monitoring activity. The campaign was performed during the teaching hours and students registered the air exchange events (opening and closing of windows and door) during the class hours. The correlation of the air exchange events recorded by the students with the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration level recorded every minute and the opening and closing control of the trickle ventilation system allowed the evaluation of the ventilation rate of the system. The interactive evaluation approach gave the conclusion that the system alone could not completely fulfil its performance requirement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11430099" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is one of the key issues for a pleasant stay inside buildings for occupants. People spend most of their time inside buildings and for this reason it is of high importance to ensure a safe and pleasant environment for living. There have been many researches conducted to monitor and evaluate the indoor air inside offices; and correlating it, not only with health and comfort but also, more recently, with the productivity of occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11430099">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11430099">6</xref>]. Fewer works have been conducted on the study of school building environments before year 2000 while more recently a higher sensitivity to this issue has been raised within the scientific community, which has produced research focus by considering children’s health and comfort as a priority for the society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11430099">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11430099">15</xref>]. Some authors identified high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the classrooms (typically higher than 1000 ppm) as a significant factor that could reduce students’ attention with a resulting drop of learning capabilities. Most of the school considered in the literature, especially in England and Greece, have been related to natural ventilation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11430099">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11430099">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11430099">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11430099">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11430099">19</xref>]. In majority of the cases, natural ventilation consisted of opening and closing doors and windows while when a control is required; trickle ventilators or passive stacks are the most used. The majority of the cases examined found that CO<sub>2</sub> concentration level during occupancy time was not adequate to meet the required standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11430099">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11430099">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11430099">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11430099">15</xref>]. In general, natural ventilation solutions were found less effective than mechanical ventilation and the major concern to the use of natural ventilation was the reduction of thermal comfort when high exchange air volumes from outdoor were brought in, especially in the winter season and in cold climates. In some cases, air conditioning was installed to overcome this drawback as Clemens and Crome reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11430099">20</xref>]; however, this solution was proved to increase the frequency of the reported symptoms with respect to natural ventilation. Furthermore, natural ventilation is generally preferred due to cost and energy efficiency issues.</p>
<p>Most recently an extended action has been taken in Europe by the Ministries of the Environment of various European countries including Italy. The action has been defined through the European project SEARCH (<italic>School Environment and Respiratory Health of Children</italic>) coordinated by the REC-Ungheria (<italic>Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe</italic>) and carried out in six countries (Italy, Albany, Bosnia, Erzegovina, Serbia, Slovacchia). In this framework, the Italian Ministry of the Environment produced a document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11430099">21</xref>] that provides a guideline regarding the control of air quality in schools. Despite this initiative, legislation on ventilation in school buildings is very poor in Italy. Although this competence should be considered at a Regional level, and the government made an agreement with the Italian Regions on the guidelines for indoor air quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11430099">22</xref>], an old norm, dated 1975, is still being used as a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11430099">23</xref>]. In this context, the research study wants to give a contribution into the understanding of the environmental quality of school buildings and into the definition of monitoring and evaluation strategies, to promote the pupils involvement in the experimental activities.</p>
<p>Most of the public schools in Italy are located in old buildings while most recent structures have been built in the 1970s or earlier so that the majority of them do not have mechanical ventilation systems.</p>
<p>The school chosen for the monitoring survey is located in the Rome municipality and well represents the Italian school typology. In the framework of the City Environmental Action Plan, starting in the year 2003, the municipality administration carried out a series of experimental projects introducing bioclimatic technologies. The middle school “Renato Fucini”, the objective of this work, was chosen as a case study. The building was constructed in the mid-60s and it required urgent renovation to be in conformity with the regulations in force. It was a good chance for the building to be re-qualified also with a view on the environmental issue. The school was then conceived as a “Permanent Environmental Education Laboratory”. Some classrooms were provided with motorised shadowing system and a motorised trickle ventilation system controlled by the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration level which was continuously being monitored in each classroom.</p>
<p>The trickle ventilators allow improvement of the air exchange when a threshold limit in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is reached. Moreover, the gym and the professors’ hall were provided with a passive cooling system and consisted of two solar chimneys and an underground ducting for cooling of air collected from outdoors.</p>
<p>No “post operam” evaluation of the proposed solutions was made. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the air quality in the classrooms through the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature measurements during class occupation, and with the use of an interactive approach, to evaluate the effectiveness of the natural trickle ventilation system. The considered approach has the double advantage of not being invasive to the students’ activities and also to involve the pupils in the evaluation of their environment with the objective to create a consciousness to the environmental conditions and to provide solutions for their improvement.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11430099"><title>Building Description</title>
<p>The school considered for the study is the middle school “Renato Fucini” located in the north-eastern part of Rome. The school was built in the mid-60s, in a green area. It consists of four sections in a form of a cross with each section consisting of a two-storey building. Each of the floors accommodates four classrooms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11430099">Figure 1</xref> shows an aerial view of the school building. Only one section, named section A, was considered for the monitoring survey.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11430099">Figure 2</xref> shows a 3D view of a typical classroom together with a picture showing the trickle ventilators installed over the windows shutters. Each of the eight classrooms (four at the first floor and four at the second floor) were provided with the air exchange system described. Trickle ventilators are usually operated with variable small openings located at the upper frame of windows to provide background ventilation in a space. In this case, the ventilators openings were motorised and controlled by CO<sub>2</sub> concentration level. When the CO<sub>2</sub> level inside the classroom reaches 1000 ppm the ventilators would be opened, while when the level falls down to 800 ppm they would be closed. On the opposite side of the ventilators, there is a narrow opening that communicates with the hall and is provided with 3 windows; only one of them is always left open to guarantee the air circulation from the ventilators.

</p>
<p>The classrooms were equipped with a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration sensor and a temperature sensor located in a niche of one of the back walls of the room at a height of approximately 1.8 m. This position was chosen to avoid sensor disturbance due to standing pupils or professors near the sensors. Temperature was measured by thermistors (Betatherm, 10K3 model) with an accuracy of ± 0.15°C and CO<sub>2</sub> was measured by an infrared sensor (Vaisala, GMD 21 model) with an accuracy of ±50 ppm. In the same <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11430099">Figure 2</xref>, the position of the sensors and of the ventilators is shown. A weather station was installed outside the building to measure ambient temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction together with solar irradiance on a horizontal and on a vertical plane.</p>
<p>A Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger was used for the data acquisition and storing. Each day the data were downloaded in a database via a GPRS system. The database can be accessed by the internet through a dedicated site powered by Tecno.el and named Olinda. Olinda can also provide analysis of parameters trends through a graphical interface.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11430099" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The long-term monitoring campaign started on June 2009 and it is still on going. Data provided by the survey were divided in two sets: a long-term data set over the 2009/2010 scholastic year to get a snapshot of the thermal and air quality environment into the classrooms and a short-term data set that consisted on data taken during February 2009. For the long-term measurements, CO<sub>2</sub> maxima, minima and averages were calculated every half an hour together with the corresponding indoor temperatures, all day long. The outdoor parameters were collected by the weather station with the same time frequency. The short-term set consisted of the same measurements taken at a time interval of 1 min (indoor measurements) to get a more accurate evaluation of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trends when the classrooms were occupied by pupils. This set was used to evaluate the ventilation capacity of the trickle ventilators in real occupancy conditions. It has been chosen to work in real conditions since it was proven that in controlled conditions the ventilation rates could be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11430099">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The measurement of occupant-generated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to evaluate ventilation is a well-accepted method suggested also by norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11430099">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11430099">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11430099">25</xref>]. Unfortunately, in real conditions, several actions can be made by the classroom occupants to improve the ventilation rate and it becomes quite difficult to evaluate the sole contribution of the passive ventilators. To overcome this problem, an interactive approach was adopted for the short-term campaign. Two weeks, during the winter period (February), less favourable to air change due to cold, were chosen for the test. In order to isolate the ventilation rate due to the trickle ventilators, the air change actions made by the classrooms occupants (opening and closing windows and door, students’ entry and exit) were recorded on a diary with formed questionnaire by a designated pupil for each classroom. Two days were chosen for each week to reduce to a minimum interference of the test with the normal class activities. The experiment was carried out in the second half of February (16th, 19th, 23rd, 25th). The school time period was chosen as the observation time (8:00–15:00). During this period, for each of the days of the test, air temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and control level of the trickle ventilators opening were recorded every minute. Weather data were available from the local weather station at 30 min time intervals.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted during the real occupancy time, first of all to avoid any disturbance to the normal school activities; lastly, the involvement of the class in the activity (interactive approach) would enhance the pupils’ awareness of the sustainability concept and to the environmental quality issue. In fact, the pupils must know that high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> inside the classrooms can produce discomfort and comprehension difficulties. The pupils’ involvement was requested in order to control and register the air exchange events that happened in the class during the occupancy time. All the information recorded by the students were manually correlated with the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trends recorded for each class through a visual inspection of the trend itself and the recognition of the action taken by the pupils through the trend variation (sudden increase or decrease of CO<sub>2</sub> due to windows opening or entrance of new pupils, for example). All the actions indicated by the pupils were superimposed on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trends to allow the identification of the effects the trickle ventilation has on the overall air exchange, with respect to the opening and closing of the door and windows of each classroom. Also, the number of pupils present inside the classroom was registered and the coming in and out the classroom of the pupils were also recorded during the school time.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> generated by the occupants was then used as a tracer gas for the determination of ventilation rates. Two methods can be applied for the calculation: the constant tracer gas method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11430099">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11430099">28</xref>] and the decay tracer gas method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11430099">29</xref>]. In this study, both methods are used.</p>
<p>The first method uses CO<sub>2</sub> concentration data coming from a state of equilibrium to reach between the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production and the rate of ventilation. In these conditions, a constant trend of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration with respect to time can be observed. Assuming steady-state conditions for that period of time, the ventilation rate could be calculated from the mass balance described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11430099">Equation (1)</xref>:

<p>The tracer gas decay method was used to determine the air exchange when there was no CO<sub>2</sub> source in the class. During these periods, the tracer gas concentration decayed to the background level by dilution with outdoor air.

<p>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and indoor air temperature were monitored all year long collecting data every half an hour to get an overview of the classrooms environment. The average, minimum and maximum values of recorded temperatures were calculated during the school occupancy hours (8:00–15:00) of each day. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11430099">Figure 3</xref> shows the temperature trends for class no. 1 (first floor), class no. 4 and class no. 5 (second floor) from September 2009 till the end of May 2010, together with the outdoor air temperature.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11430099" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Indoor average temperature trend for classrooms 1, 4 and 5 for the school year 2009/10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11430099-fig3.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The thick solid line indicates the temperature of 20°C that should be guaranteed in the indoor environment during the cold season. It can be noted as most of the classrooms could not meet the 20°C indoor temperature for most of the winter season. This situation, was more critical for classroom no. 4 and classroom no. 5 which could not provide comfortable conditions inside the classrooms during the occupancy hours and could not encourage the normal air change activities through the windows opening. From the trend, the activation and shut down of the heating system can be recognised as minimum average temperatures are detected during weekends, while during the week an increase in the average temperature can be observed. Classroom no. 5 seems to experience a failure of the heating system till the middle of January since its trend follows the outdoor temperature trend. This behaviour can be recognised also for classroom no. 1 in the winter holidays period (20 December–11 January). In general, the classrooms on the ground floor are slightly cooler during warm season because they are subjected to a lower external thermal load. During the cold season, the situation is reversed with the classrooms on the first floor being colder than the one on the ground floor, which was due to thermal loads. The classrooms that have only one outer wall are warmer in winter and cooler in warm season. Classroom 1, which is on the ground floor at the beginning of the corridor, is the warmest of all, during all seasons in the year.</p>
<p>For clarity, only the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels during the 8:00–15:00 daily time interval from September 2009 till May 2010, for classroom no. 1 and classroom no. 5, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11430099">Figure 4</xref>.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11430099" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Indoor average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration trend for classrooms 1 and 5 for the school year 2009/10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11430099-fig4.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Weekends and holidays are characterised by low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and can be identified in the trends. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11430099">Figure 4</xref>, the 1500 ppm threshold is marked with a thick solid line. This value was chosen as a limit for acceptable air quality as recommended by EN15251 which prescribes a threshold limit of 1200 ppm for class C environment and Griffiths and Eftekhari [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11430099">8</xref>] recommended a limit of 1500 ppm as UK standards. In this case, the limit was only taken into account as an indication of minimum standard quality for the environment. It can be noted that, especially for classroom no. 1, this limit was often exceeded during all the time of the year. In general, higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels were observed for the classrooms on the ground floor with respect to the classrooms on the first floor owing to the worst air circulation induced by the wind at the lower floor. In classroom no. 5, peak values that exceeded the limit were registered especially during the colder period of the year confirming that in order to ensure adequate thermal comfort of the pupils, the windows should be kept closed to reduce air change; but this would increase CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Obviously, this is not the only reason, but, however, a slight correlation between indoor temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was observed for all classrooms as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11430099">Figure 5</xref>, for classroom no. 1 and no. 5.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11430099" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Correlation between CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and indoor air temperature for classrooms 1 and 5 for the school year 2009/10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11430099-fig5.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> generation inside the classrooms would not be the same due to the different number of pupils in each class; however, this variable should not influence the results so greatly. CO<sub>2</sub> concentration appears, in general, higher in the winter than in the middle season periods. This is due only in part to the difficulties in opening the windows due to the cold. Moreover, the improvement in ventilators performances would be correlated with wind velocity and direction during the year. As can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11430099">Figure 6</xref>, in the cold season (Autumn, Winter) a prevalence of winds coming form the North was observed and this direction would be less favourable for the air change produced by the trickle ventilators located on the South West façade of the school building. The major wind contribution to the trickle ventilation in this season comes from the South-East direction as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11430099">Figure 6</xref>, in fact during the short-term survey, the most effective ventilation was registered when the wind of a consistent airflow came from that direction.
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11430099" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Occurrence of the wind direction at the school site for the cold (autumn-winter) and warm (spring-summer) seasons for the year 2009/2010.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11430099-fig6.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>To have an idea of the air quality experienced considering the 1500 ppm threshold limit as an indicator, the percentage of occupancy time in which this threshold was exceeded was calculated for each class using the data collected with 1-min frequency, from February 2010 till May 2010. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11430099">Figure 7</xref>. It can be observed that the classrooms on the ground floor exhibited a percentage variable from 28% to 45% of occupancy time, which exceeded the acceptable concentration limit. On the first floor, the situation improves due to the better ventilation conditions induced by the wind coming from the South-East direction (consistent percentage both in the cold and warm season) that reached parts of the first floor but certainly not the ground floor owing to the building obstruction. Only one classroom (no. 7) shows a percentage higher than 20% which exceeded the acceptable limit. This behaviour has not been clearly understood.

<p>The data of 16 of February shows the highest average of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for all the classrooms while on the 19th the lowest average was exhibited.</p>
<p>This behaviour could be explained by considering the wind velocity and direction during that days. In fact, the wind intensity on the 16th was 1.3 m/s with a wind direction almost opposite to the south-west façade (90°) which was a less favourable situation for natural ventilation that would be the reason for the high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels observed. On the contrary, on the 19th the average wind intensity reached 3.2 m/s with a wind direction more favourable with respect to the 16th (100°–175°).</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the classroom occupants was used as a tracer for the determination of ventilation rates, using both the constant gas tracer method and the decay gas tracer method. For the steady state case, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11430099">Equation (1)</xref> was used to evaluate <italic>C</italic><sub>int</sub> as the average of the data as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11430099">Figure 8</xref>; in the same figure, the data selected for the tracer gas decay evaluation were also shown together with the activities registered by the pupils. As shown, all the decay events were related to the exit of pupils from the classrooms with the door being left open. The increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration observed soon after the stationary time interval could be due to an increase of activity (mental or physical) of the students which increased the CO<sub>2</sub> production rate per person or by a registration omission of students’ entry to the room.

In the figures, the average of the suggested ventilation rate (3.6 1/h), considering a ventilation rate of 20 m<sup>3</sup>/h per pupil, weighted by the number of classroom occupants, is shown by the thick solid line.

</p>
<p>The ventilation per pupil considered for the calculation was an adequate number for air quality in a classroom considering a predicted percentage of dissatisfied between 20% and 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11430099">24</xref>]. For the calculations, only the student occupancy was considered, omitting in all cases the presence of the teacher. By analyzing the results, it can be concluded that on the average, the calculated rates were close to the recommended value. Classroom no. 1 had a low ventilation on the 16th and 25th of February and classrooms no. 2 and 3 could not be evaluated due to measurements exceeding the range limit of the equipment confirming high values of CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore not sufficient ventilation rates. Also classroom no. 7 was shown to have an inadequate ventilation on the 16th of February, confirming the trend observed. The low rates observed for this day were related to the low outdoor wind velocity which produced low air exchange from the trickle ventilators. On the contrary, more efficient ventilation was observed in almost all classrooms on the 19th of February where the higher wind velocity had contributed to the air exchange. Considering the values obtained with the two methods it can be concluded that, in most of the cases, an agreement between the two is within 20%. A couple of cases shows higher discrepancies and this could be ascribed to an incorrect compilation of the questionnaire with a consequent incorrect evaluation of the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for the stationary method evaluation.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11430099" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A long-term monitoring campaign was carried out in a naturally ventilated middle school in the municipality of Rome in order to verify the indoor air quality and thermal conditions inside eight classrooms, taken as a case study. A further short-term campaign was undertaken for 4 days in February 2010 with an interactive approach, involving the pupils, to check the air exchange capability of a trickle ventilation system recently installed in the same classrooms. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration produced by the occupants was used as a tracer gas for the ventilation rates calculation, applying both the stationary method and the decay method.</p>
<p>The long-term monitoring campaign results showed that the indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentration exceeded the 1500 ppm value, taken as a reference, for a consistent period of time during the school year, especially in the classrooms on the ground floor. The interactive approach in the evaluation of the trickle ventilation effectiveness gave good results, leading to the conclusion that the system did not completely fulfil its performance requirement, as already evidenced by the long-term data analysis. However, a certain inaccuracy in the ventilation rate evaluation was observed due, in part, to the not clear registration of the ventilation events through the questionnaires. A certain improvement in the questionnaire definition and compilation instructions should be introduced.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it can be inferred that the poor observed performances of the trickle ventilators were due to multiple causes such as the façade exposition that is not favourable to the predominant wind direction during the year, the small aperture area of the trickle ventilation system and the narrow opening and only one window being opened of the three indoor windows available on the opposite side of the trickle ventilators. The opening of these windows should contribute to improving the air circulation and purge the air out of the classroom.</p>
<p>A first attempt to improve the existing system will consist of opening of all the indoor windows to promote air circulation when the ventilators are opened. The introduction of small fans in the vicinity of the ventilators apertures could also improve the ventilation rate. Furthermore, it is desirable that the pupils’ were involved in the survey, which would lead to good practises to achieve efficient air exchanges in the classrooms, by integrating the trickle system with a more responsible use of the standard methods of opening windows and doors, for an adequate period of time, during the classroom occupancy. To promote this aspect, an improvement of the heating system should also be desirable to ensure better thermal comfort conditions inside the classrooms.</p></sec>
