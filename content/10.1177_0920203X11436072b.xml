<p>Developmental Fairy Tales is a groundbreaking treatise that sheds light on popular culture in republican China. The author Andrew F. Jones also wrote Yellow Music: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2001). The volume under review integrates thematic analyses of aesthetic texts with the larger socio-historical forces that were unfolding at that time, thus making literature and history serve as each other’s thick description. The keyword of this book is ‘development’. Because of Deng Xiaoping’s famous declaration that ‘development is the only hard imperative’ (發展才是硬道理), the word ‘development’ seems in the first instance to be associated with economic and social development in contemporary China. However, Jones revises our stereotypical view of development as a contemporary concept by tracing it back to the late 19th century, a time when Western evolutionary thinking was introduced to China by famous intellectuals such as Yan Fu. With the introduction of evolutionary thinking, the word ‘development’ (發達/發展) was popularized and became the zeitgeist that captured the spirit of the republican age. Jones argues that while the discourse of development dominated the cultural scene of republican China, it was nonetheless fraught with internal inconsistencies and even contradictions that paradoxically suspended the development of the developmental discourse.</p>
<p>The figures of child and beast appear prominently in Jones’s analysis of the discourse of development. Darwin’s evolutionary theory propounds that humans originated from animals. The child retains some animalistic traits and has the closest kinship with animals. In this view, the child is a ‘housed beast’ that needs to be developed, civilized, and humanized. Child and beast are therefore associated with each other in the developmental discourse. The development of the child is not an individual concern, but a collective enterprise associated with the development of the nation, because the child is the hope of the nation. Print culture (such as children’s magazines, Chapter 2), as well as other forms of popular culture and commodities (such as toys, Chapter 4), began to serve the developmental needs of children/the nation. It was in this context that Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren, and other intellectuals vigorously advocated children’s literature as a means to develop children and, by extension, the nation. The genre of the fairy tale became an important instrument in developing children into more fully civilized human adults. Nearly all of these developmental fairy tales for children feature anthropomorphic beasts. It is at this point that child and beast are again associated with each other in the discourse of national development.</p>
<p>Developmentalism was always marked by internal fallacies. For Jones, the last sentence ‘Save the children’ in <italic>Diary of a Madman</italic> (狂人日記, 1918) reflects Lu Xun’s scepticism about developmental discourse. Is it possible to save and develop children in a cannibalistic society in which everyone, including children, is contaminated? The title <italic>Developmental Fairy Tales</italic> therefore has multiple meanings. First, the fairy tale itself is an infantile form of literature that needs to be developed, with realism as its goal. Second, it identifies the genre of the fairy tale that serves the developmental needs of children. Third, in a self-reflexive manner, the term ‘developmental fairy tales’ suggests the narratives of developmentalism, which turned out to be just fantastic ‘fairy tales’ that cannot be fully realized in history.</p>
<p>Jones succinctly captures the aporia or predicament of developmentalism in the metaphor of the narrow cage. The book begins with a reinterpretation of Lu Xun’s famous metaphor of the iron house in his preface to <italic>The Outcry</italic> (吶喊, 1923). Jones reads this iron house metaphor as Lu Xun’s scepticism about developmental discourse: is it legitimate to develop people who may not want to be developed? Echoing the iron house metaphor, Jones’s book ends with a discussion of a fairy tale titled ‘A Narrow Cage’, which tells of the failed attempts of a tiger that tries to save, guide, and civilize other animals and humans trapped in various political and existential cages. These cages are the sites where the narratives of development freeze and historical agency stagnates. The child is a caged or housed beast; the family is a cage; the nation is a cage; the world is an existential cage; and even the discourse of development is a self-referential, narrow cage. Framed by these metaphors of captivity, Jones’s book ends where it begins and becomes a narrative cage that captures and holds its readers.</p>
<p><italic>Developmental Fairy Tales</italic>, which is rich in content and interdisciplinary in approach, is beneficial for scholars interested in the cultural and intellectual history of republican China. More importantly, it is a must-read for scholars interested in Chinese children’s literature and culture, a topic that is relatively understudied in the West. It will undoubtedly exert great intellectual impact on this still ‘developing’ yet promising field that centres on the figures of child and beast.</p>
