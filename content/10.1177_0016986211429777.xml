<p>There is a long and venerable tradition of edited collections on creativity. Some five decades ago, H. H. Anderson’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986211429777"><italic>Creativity and its Cultivation</italic> (1959)</xref>, offered 15 chapters by 14 scholars, and <italic>A Source Book for Creative Thinking</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986211429777">Parnes &amp; Harding, 1962</xref>) included 29 chapters from 26 contributors. Through every succeeding decade, there has been a steady flow of new anthologies. <italic>The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity</italic> maintains that procession (and is itself the successor to a previous edition about a decade earlier). The current volume includes 24 chapters from 38 contributors, the majority of which were not represented in the earlier edition or were modified or updated from the previous edition. The Handbook’s chapters are divided into four general sections. The book is intended as a compendium of scholarly papers and, accordingly, will be of greater interest to those concerned with theory and research than to practitioners. The contributions offer a blend of interesting and diverse inclusions and curious, almost inexplicable, exclusions. On the whole, the strongest chapters are those in which scholars from a variety of disciplines review, analyze, and offer forecasts of future directions and needs in their unique areas of specialization. The breadth of these perspectives will certainly enable any reader to explore new or unfamiliar aspects of theory and research on creativity that may challenge readers beyond their personal and professional “comfort zones.”</p>
<p>The first section’s four chapters purport to address basic concepts of creativity, addressing history, theories, assessment, and the roles of creativity in society. Chapters 1 to 3 initially appear to address “basic” concepts: what is creativity and what are its origins, in what ways do various approaches represent the construct and its implications, and how might we assess or recognize it. Chapter 1 sets its purpose as a history of research on creativity (a valid aim, although perhaps not what was expected as a “basic” issue). As in the earlier edition of the same topic, the chapter gives more than 80% of its attention from antiquity to Galton, and only a brief glance at history since Galton. The longer section is interesting in its discussion, if sometimes given to views that might be less than universally accepted (e.g., progressive religious scholars would certainly be uncomfortable with the impression that the Bible can be understood either as literal and divinely inspired or else as a secular body of literature). A puzzling exclusion: the briefer section on contemporary contributions to research on creativity focuses so much on work from California (e.g., IPAR or Guilford) that readers might be left to wonder whether there were any important advances elsewhere. Chapters 2 (Theories) and 3 (Assessment) are inclusive and address a variety of major issues, themes, and research perspectives. In the review of theories, some puzzling exclusions are bothersome (e.g., although there are 20 citations to the work of one coauthor, some only very indirectly related to creativity theory, there is just one citation to Torrance’s work, and none at all to the Synectics approach of Gordon, Poze, or Prince; the Osborn–Parnes tradition; the humanistic or “third-force” models of Maslow, May, or Carl Rogers; the Kepner–Tregoe approach; or others). The fourth chapter, while relevant to basic issues, might also have been comfortably placed within the next section on “Diverse Perspectives.” It offers a broad analysis of the interactions between society and individuals in relation to the purposes of improvement and expression and argues that the relationships can be complementary, not necessarily conflicting.</p>
<p>The second section on “Diverse Perspectives” is a composite of chapters that are incontestably diverse, including several that are complex and challenging while also insightful and provocative. This section might have benefited from a more focused clustering; some chapters, for example, address forces or factors that shape creativity across domains (e.g., cognition, personality, neurobiological, developmental, evolutionary). Others are targeted at more specific concerns (e.g., eminence, everyday creativity, cross-cultural factors, products) or contexts (e.g., visual arts, educational, or organizational creativity). Despite some minor flaws that eluded editorial oversight (e.g., attributing “the four Ps” to Wallas), these chapters span numerous areas of research that will draw readers beyond the most familiar psychological and educational variables of interest about creativity and thus will broaden most readers’ perspectives about the nature, sources, and implications of creativity and creativity research. Unfortunately, there are also some rather striking limitations (once again, interesting inclusions and puzzling exclusions). For example, the chapter on educational creativity, a topic probably of particular interest to readers of this journal, was disappointing. The authors omitted or overlooked both historical and contemporary research and development on an extensive array of models and programs, including most of Torrance’s instructional resources, the Productive Thinking Program, the Purdue Creative Thinking Program, Synectics, Creative Problem Solving, or any structured programs such as Future Problem Solving, Destination Imagination, Odyssey of the Mind, or Camp Invention. The Cropleys’ chapter on “Functional Creativity” laments Product as the “neglected P,” but compounds the neglect by making no mention of any of the published work on creative product analysis by Besemer and O’Quin.</p>
<p>The third section consists of seven chapters on “Contemporary Debates.” From this reviewer’s perspective, the chapters on domain specificity (Baer), motivation (Hennessey), and mental illness (Silvia and Kaufman) were among the strongest contributions to the book. Beghetto’s chapter on “creativity in the classroom” was well written and addressed a number of challenges or potential impediments to creativity in the school setting, although it dealt less with actual research on instructional implementation than on policy and philosophical issues and obstacles. The fourth section consisted of just one chapter in which the book’s editors reflected on the book’s overall themes and issues.</p>
<p>Several common themes appeared throughout the book. Most of them will be familiar to readers who are already well acquainted with the creativity literature, although many of the book’s contributors brought unique perspectives and insights to them. One such theme is the breadth and diversity of forms and expressions of creativity, or as Feist stated it, “Creativity comes in many forms, shades, and hues” (p. 113). While creativity of great impact (“big C”) has often been studied, it may not involve fundamentally different processes than “ordinary” creativity, and the chapters representing each of these perspectives underscored many commonalities. Not everyone in a field commonly thought to embody “creativity” (e.g., art, science) is necessarily creative, and creativity is certainly not restricted to those areas, as the contributors make very clear. In sum, notwithstanding the concerns noted here, this anthology makes positive contributions to the challenge of understanding creativity research and charting promising directions for future inquiry.</p>
