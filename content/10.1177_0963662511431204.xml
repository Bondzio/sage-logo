<abstract>
<p>Media coverage of climate change has been an area of continued research during the last years, mostly with a focus on developed countries. This study attempts to contribute to this body of work by analyzing the coverage in a developing country. The study presents a content analysis of newspaper coverage of climate change in Peru through the study of frames, geographical focus, and climate change strategies (mitigation/adaptation). Additionally, the role of foreign voices is assessed by comparing the coverage by Peruvian reporters with the coverage by wire services, and by determining the types of sources present in the articles. Results show a prevalence of an effects frame, followed by a politics frame. Also, the study found a significant amount of stories originating from wire services. In general, coverage prioritizes mitigation strategies and policies while providing limited attention to adaptation, which can be insufficient for a highly vulnerable country.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Developing nations are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The ecological, economic, and human effects in Peru and most Latin American countries have been widely reported. Decreases in commercial fish catches in both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511431204">Chavez et al., 2003</xref>), effects on biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511431204">Laurance, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511431204">Miles et al., 2004</xref>), melting of tropical glaciers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0963662511431204">Vuille et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0963662511431204">2008</xref>) that have an effect on water availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511431204">Barnett et al., 2005</xref>), decreases in agriculture outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511431204">Jones and Thornton, 2003</xref>), and impacts on human populations via the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511431204">Githeko et al., 2000</xref>) are just some of the main problems.</p>
<p>Despite these impacts and the scientific evidence that ascribes most of the responsibility to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511431204">IPCC, 2007</xref>), policy action aimed at mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects has been considered complex to say the least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662511431204">Selin and VanDeveer, 2009</xref>). Part of the challenge lies in the fluctuating attention by politicians, the public, and the media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511431204">Downs (1972)</xref> talks about the cyclical nature of problems, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511431204">Hilgartner and Bosk (1988)</xref> point to the limited carrying capacity of the different policy arenas. Climate change as a policy issue has entered and exited these policy arenas during the last decades owing to factors such as scientific evidence, focusing events (e.g. Hurricane Katrina), and symbolic representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511431204">Kingdon, 2003</xref>). Recently, the issue has had to compete for attention with other more salient topics such as the world’s economic crises and wars in the Middle East, among others. According to a Gallup poll,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511431204">1</xref></sup> fewer than 2% of the American public mentioned global warming as the most important problem facing the nation. Policy makers tend to follow the national mood when prioritizing policy issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511431204">Kingdon, 2003</xref>), which partly explains the current state of policy gridlock at the federal level in the US.</p>
<p>The influence of policy actions or inaction of the US on other countries is clear. Moreover the US can be considered a hub for information flows. The information disseminated through formal and informal channels can have an effect on public opinion and on policy responses. In the case of climate change, research has shown that the mass media represent the main source of information for most individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963662511431204">Stamm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0963662511431204">Wilson, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0963662511431204">2000</xref>). Similarly, agenda-setting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511431204">Pralle, 2009</xref>) and media effects studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511431204">Sampei and Aoyagi-Usui, 2008</xref>) document and discuss the role of the media in climate change policy discussions. It is then no surprise that the scholarship on climate change communication has gained an exciting momentum during recent years. Studies on public perceptions, media coverage, and communication strategies are found across disciplines. However, as with most areas of science and environmental communication, there is a strong focus on developed countries. This apparent bias is not a sole function of predetermined neglect for developing nations, but more a response to factors such as data availability. However, researchers are starting to look into media coverage of climate change in developing countries. Previous studies in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511431204">Billett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511431204">Boykoff, 2010</xref>), Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511431204">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>), and Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511431204">Takahashi, 2011</xref>) demonstrate this trend.</p>
<p>The present study attempts to contribute to this growing body of work in climate change communication by focusing and expanding previous research in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511431204">Takahashi, 2011</xref>). The selection of Peru as a case study responds to the need to focus on countries vulnerable to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511431204">Brooks et al., 2004</xref>), and how the media report the issue locally. In this respect, Peru hosts approximately 70% of the world’s tropical glaciers, which are at risk due to increasing temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0963662511431204">Vuille et al., 2008</xref>). The methodological approach borrows from previous studies, and incorporates new approaches relevant to the specific case study. This research is concerned with assessing the coverage of climate change and the prevalence of foreign voices in such coverage. This is done through a content analysis of newspaper articles that considers their main frames, sources, and geographical focus, among other variables explained in the methods section. Additionally, this study is part of a larger research focusing on the media–policy link in Peru (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662511431204">Takahashi and Meisner, 2011</xref>). The next section briefly discusses the relevant literature on the area of climate change and the media, as well as the literature on the role of news agencies.</p>

<title>2. Climate change in the media</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511431204">Anderson (2009)</xref> provided a thorough review of the literature on media coverage of climate change, and suggested that the media in developing nations have provided limited attention to the issue. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511431204">Shanahan (2009)</xref> discussed some case studies in developing countries, and suggested some reasons for the inadequate coverage, which include the lack of resources for journalists, and the lack of editorial support. Additionally, he argued that there has been a lack of research on the coverage in vulnerable countries. Similarly, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511431204">Gordon et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511431204">Takahashi (2011)</xref> argued that no other studies on Latin American media coverage of climate change were found during their research on Mexico and Peru. These two studies presented methodological constraints in terms of data gathering owing to the limited availability of articles in academic databases. The present study presents an alternative to improve this data collection problem.</p>
<p>US-based studies have traditionally applied media framing and issue attention cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511431204">McComas and Shanahan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963662511431204">Trumbo, 1996</xref>). Some articles have discussed the problems in coverage in relation to journalistic practices. For example, Boykoff and Boykoff analyzed the problems of the norm of balanced reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511431204">Boykoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511431204">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511431204">2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511431204">Antilla (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511431204">2010</xref>) discussed issues of reporting and self-censorship in the US press coverage; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0963662511431204">Wilkins (1993)</xref> identified the main values that drive the reporting. These issues have been found to be influenced by political partisanship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511431204">Kim, 2011</xref>), a pro-corporate bias towards environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511431204">Nissani, 1999</xref>), and the scientific complexity of the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0963662511431204">Sonnett, 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511431204">Neff et al. (2009)</xref> found out that the topic of food systems and their contribution to climate change has not been a major focus of attention in the US elite media despite the solid scientific evidence of its importance.</p>
<p>Studies in the UK are also common. Scholars have focused on dominant discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511431204">Doulton and Brown, 2009</xref>); misrepresentations of anthropogenic causes in the tabloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511431204">Boykoff, 2008</xref>); political and ideological influence in reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511431204">Carvalho, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511431204">Carvalho and Burgess, 2005</xref>); and more recently, on the use of religious metaphors to denigrate anthropogenic climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0963662511431204">Woods et al., 2012</xref>). Research has also tackled the connection between climate change and weather events. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511431204">Gavin et al. (2011)</xref> discussed the coverage of flooding in relation to climate change in the British press, similar to the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963662511431204">Ungar (1999)</xref> of the relationship between coverage of extreme weather events and climate change in US networks. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511431204">Hulme (2009)</xref> provided an event-centered analysis in the UK following the release of the fourth IPCC report. The study reported that the media relied mostly on alarmist and fatalistic discourses.</p>
<p>Beyond the US and UK, other developed nations have also been the focus of media analysis. Analyses similar to the ones presented above have been conducted in Portugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511431204">Carvalho and Pereira, 2008</xref>), Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511431204">Lyytimäki and Tapio, 2009</xref>), and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511431204">McManus, 2000</xref>). In Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511431204">Olausson (2009)</xref> applied a qualitative critical discourse analysis (CDA) to focus on the variations in the use of a mitigation frame in comparison to the adaptation frame. On the other hand, the role of emotional representations of climate change in a television news program and a tabloid in Swedish media was analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511431204">Höijer (2010)</xref>. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511431204">Sampei and Aoyagi-Usui (2008)</xref> discussed the influence of newspaper coverage of climate change on public opinion in Japan.</p>
<p>In addition, some comparative studies across countries have been conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511431204">Brossard et al. (2004)</xref> compared the coverage between US and French newspapers. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511431204">Dispensa and Brulle (2003)</xref> compared the newspaper coverage and scientific publications in the US, Finland, and New Zealand. New Zealand is also the focus of a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511431204">Kenix (2008)</xref>, who compared the coverage by alternative and mainstream media. The study found no major differences, suggesting that media ownership, organization-specific routines, and values did not have an effect on the coverage.</p>
<p>In summary, the study of the mass media and climate change has expanded considerably using a variety of methodological and conceptual approaches, mostly in developed nations. There are clear gaps that still need to be addressed in order to provide a better understanding of the role of the media at a broader scale.</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662511431204">
<title>3. The role of international news flow</title>
<p>The importance of the prevalence of news information flows from news agencies to developing nations has been extensively researched in recent decades. This goes back to initial discussions about cultural imperialism that suggested that information from developed nations, mostly the US, had a direct influence on cultures in developing nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511431204">Roach, 1997</xref>). This thesis was widely debated and challenged on the grounds of resistance and assimilation in the creation of new identities. However, this appropriation was delimited by “first order” meanings, which retain certain traits of the dominant culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511431204">Elteren, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these debates, the fact remains that the flow of information between countries is still widely unbalanced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0963662511431204">Wu’s (1998)</xref> meta-analysis of the literature suggested that the determinants that influence international news flow and the over reporting of developed nations around the world include gross national product, volume of trade, regionalism, population, geographic size, geographic proximity, political/economic interests of the host countries, “eliteness,” communication resources, and cultural affinity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511431204">Boyd-Barrett (2000)</xref> considered the role of news agencies in constructing global and national identities, and provides a thorough summary of the scholarship on the type of coverage provided by news agencies. He suggests that,
<disp-quote>
<p>The content of the news tends to be about topics that privilege elite national institutions or players, or about their relationships at transnational levels, primarily within the spheres of politics, military affairs, business and economics, intergovernmental organizations, and sports. (p. 310)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This dominance of news agencies in concentrating the content has also become prevalent on the Internet, a medium that was expected to democratize and decentralize news production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511431204">Paterson, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511431204">Alleyne and Wagner (1993)</xref> surveyed the extent of influence of the main news agencies in the 1990s and their relationships with governments, arguing that the latter are not willing to let the agencies fail despite major financial constraints. This guarantees their long term status, but also raises questions about their reliability as news sources.</p>
<p>The dominance of news agencies in the media landscape has several effects on framing of issues and eventually on people’s understandings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511431204">Horvit (2006)</xref> analyzed the coverage of the US–Iraq conflict in early 2003 from the perspective of both western and non-western news agencies. She found that there was a dramatic difference in the use of non-western vs. western news sources. Similarly, from a qualitative perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511431204">Rauch (2003)</xref> analyzed a G77 meeting in Cuba, comparing the coverage between a mainstream and an alternative news agency, AP and IPS respectively. She found that “IPS coverage demonstrates decentralizing and de-Westernizing tendencies that are absent from the AP discourse” (p. 100). AP covered the issue in a one-dimensional and “North-centric” perspective.</p>
<p>This discussion has also taken place within Latin American academic circles. In the 1970s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511431204">Córdova Claure (1976)</xref> critically discussed the influence in Latin America of international wire services. He called for an Andean regional agency in order to counter the flagrant errors of international wire services and their influence on social and political affairs. That said, studies focusing on the Latin American press and the prominence of international news agencies have been scarce. On the other hand, studies of Latin American news in developed nations’ media have been relatively frequent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511431204">Hester, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511431204">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662511431204">Peterson, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recent example of the former, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511431204">Lozano (2000)</xref> conducted a content analysis of eight Latin American and two Spanish newspapers, and found that the dominance of foreign news was not as high as it was in the 1960s and 70s, but still depended highly on a handful of wire services. Moreover, the regional coverage focusing on Latin America was not as positive as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511431204">Lozano, 2000</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511431204">Sepúlveda Beltrán and Mayorga Rojel (2005)</xref> also discussed the role of news agencies, specially the “Big Four” (AP, UPI, REUTERS and AFP), as they account for approximately 70% of international news in Latin America. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511431204">Sepúlveda Beltrán and Mayorga Rojel (2005)</xref> critically described the role played by these news agencies in concentrating information flows, suggesting that they serve a primary function of propagating the false image of a center (developed nations) to the periphery.</p>
<p>Finally, specifically on the topic of climate change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511431204">Antilla (2005</xref>: 350) concluded that the wire service community “is not only an essential but a dominant source of climate science news.” This assertion serves as a precursor to the present study, and follows on one of the recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511431204">Anderson (2009</xref>: 176) in respect to future areas of research in climate change communication: “Future studies could also usefully examine the role of global news agencies/wire services since they have been shown to be an important source of information on climate science.”</p>
<p>This review, along with the previous discussion on the state of research on climate change media coverage, serves as the justification for the present study of a developing country, as well as the focus on information flows and foreign sources as they relate to the policy needs of the country under discussion. Specifically, this study is guided by the following research questions: In what ways does the Peruvian press cover climate change, and what role do the wire services play in such coverage?</p>
</sec>

<title>4. Methods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511431204">Dirikx and Gelders (2010)</xref> pointed out that most studies on media coverage of climate change have applied a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach. They argued that although CDA provides a rich textured analysis of texts—something <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511431204">Carvalho (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511431204">Anderson (2009)</xref> advocate—the inductive nature of the method does not allow for major comparative efforts. The present study applies a content analysis that borrows main variables and coding categories from previous studies to determine similarities in the reporting, assuming a strong presence of articles coming from news agencies. However, recognizing the presence of frames and discourses specific to the Peruvian media, additional coding categories salient to the data were also incorporated through an inductive process.</p>
<p>The archives of Peruvian newspapers are not easily accessible. Databases such as Lexis Nexis do not offer the same kind of access as they do to North American and other developed nations’ papers. However, the leading Peruvian newspaper, <italic>El Comercio</italic>, has a database of all major Peruvian newspapers (excluding sensationalist publications) in digital form since 2000 in its archival office in Lima. The newspapers cover a range of ideological positions, and include the following: <italic>Correo, El Comercio, El Peruano</italic> (official government newspaper), <italic>Expreso, La Primera, La Razon, La Republica, Gestion, Ojo</italic>, and <italic>Peru21. El Comercio</italic> is widely perceived as the most influential newspaper, and in terms of format, along with <italic>El Peruano</italic>, it is the only one that is not considered a tabloid (in terms of size). A search in these ten newspapers using the keywords “climate change,” “global warming,” “greenhouse effect,” and “greenhouse gases” in the headline and the lead was conducted for the period January 2000 to December 2010. A total of 509 articles were retrieved. After a review of all articles to make sure they focused on climate change, a total of 459 were retained. Duplicate and irrelevant articles were discarded. Articles were then categorized by format (opinion piece, editorial, or news article).</p>
<p>Similar to most studies in this area, this research considers the article as the unit of analysis. The articles were first coded by their descriptive information, including the type of author (journalist, commentator, news agency, or unknown), and the origin of the author (Peruvian or foreign). Next each article was coded based on the degree to which climate change was its focus, either primary or secondary. From the total sample, 409 were coded as primary. The analysis of all variables explained below was only conducted on the articles with a primary focus.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511431204">Entman (1993)</xref> defined framing as the selection of a perceived reality that is made more salient in a text. Based on this conceptualization, this study follows the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511431204">McComas and Shanahan (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511431204">Brossard et al. (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511431204">Boykoff (2008)</xref>. From the latter, the two-tier framing scheme was adopted. In the present study, based on the inductive review of some articles, the main frames and sub-frames were modified accordingly to better fit and more adequately capture the reporting from the Peruvian media. This process produced five main frames: “effects,” “opportunities,” “politics,” “society,” and “science.” Additionally, each frame contained sub-themes that were coded as either present or absent. Under this structure, all sub-themes under a dominant frame could be coded as present. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511431204">Table 1</xref> presents this sub-division.</p>

<p>The study used the variable “cause” to determine the level of debate regarding the establishment of climate change as a problem, and the extent to which it can be attributed to anthropogenic sources. Codes used include “anthropogenic source,” “natural source,” “both anthropogenic and natural,” “climate change not happening,” and “no mention” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511431204">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004</xref>). Additionally, articles were coded by the overall tone of the article towards climate change (“negative,” “positive,” “ambiguous,” or “neutral”) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511431204">McManus, 2000</xref>), which was a subjective measure usually attached to the effects that climate change would produce. The presence or absence of references to mitigation and/or adaptation measures was also coded. It was expected that coverage would place a stronger focus on mitigation, following what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511431204">Anderson (2009</xref>: 178) stated: “So far, the emphasis within news media coverage has tended to be on mitigation rather than adaptation.”</p>
<p>This study also provides a geographical focus not applied in previous studies. This “geographic focus” variable is also related to the variable mitigation/adaptation, as it captures the relevance of the coverage to the needs of the country. In this respect, the articles were coded using three codes, “strong focus on Peru,” “moderate focus on Peru,” and “no focus on Peru.” Additionally, the articles were coded using a “scale” variable that included the presence or absence of the codes “national,” “regional/state,” and “local.” Although most visible discussions have taken place at the international and national levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511431204">Hempel, 2006</xref>), initiatives in the US, as reflected by the C40 Cities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511431204">2</xref></sup> initiative, show that significant actions are also taking place at the local level.</p>
<p>Finally, all sources, directly quoted or paraphrased, were coded in general categories. Sources were coded as being either Peruvian or foreign, and included “NGO,” “Industry,” “Researcher/Expert,” “Civil society,” “Celebrity,” “National government,” “Regional government,” “Local government,” “Multi-state organization” (e.g. UN, European Union, World Bank), and “other.”</p>
<p>Two Spanish speaking coders coded 10% (<italic>n</italic> = 40) of the articles to assess inter-coder reliability using Krippendorff’s alpha levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511431204">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>) for the main variables. Reliability scores for some of the variables were lower than expected, therefore disagreements were discussed among the coders to determine procedural problems and improve coding. After this process, one of the coders coded the rest of the articles.</p>
<p>Significance tests were conducted across the variables and the different categories of authors and origin of the author. From the sample, 109 articles did not include a byline and were coded as “unknown” in terms of authorship and origin of the author. For comparison purposes, non-authored articles were not used in tests including the variables “authorship,” and “origin of author.”</p>

<title>5. Results</title>
<p>Because of the uneven distribution of articles across newspapers, articles not published in <italic>El Comercio</italic> were all recoded in an “others” category for analysis purposes. Based on this categorization, 317 articles (77.5%) were published in <italic>El Comercio</italic>, and 92 (22.5%) in all other newspapers. Although, the archival staff at <italic>El Comercio</italic> explained that all articles from every newspaper are indexed, the disproportion could be due to a difference in the indexing between articles in <italic>El Comercio</italic> and those from all other newspapers. The distribution could also be explained based on the availability of space in <italic>El Comercio</italic> (full newspapers against tabloid format from all the others except for <italic>El Peruano</italic>), or that <italic>El Comercio</italic> places a relatively higher importance on the issue of climate change.</p>

<title>Frequency of the coverage</title>
<p>The frequency of the coverage by year and month from 2000 to 2010 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511431204">Figure 1</xref>. Climate change appears to have received limited media attention, accompanied by some punctuations. After limited coverage from 2000 to 2006, the issue received intense coverage in 2007 and 2008, and then decreased in intensity in 2009 and 2010. It is evident that the years 2007 and 2008 contribute disproportionally to the data sample (29% and 26% respectively). This trend loosely reflects the coverage found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511431204">Boykoff, 2010</xref>). However, recent tracking of media coverage worldwide shows that in 2009, coverage spiked, mostly explained by the anticipation of the Copenhagen climate summit in December of that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511431204">3</xref></sup> From the data presented here the reasons for this difference are unclear, but some speculative arguments can be pushed forward.</p>

</fig>
<p>In 2008, Peru hosted the Latin America and European Union summit, where the two main topics were poverty and climate change. This is evident by the number of articles published in May 2008, the month the summit took place, which is the highest in the dataset (<italic>n</italic> = 30). During the summit, Peruvian President Alan García also announced the creation of the new ministry of the environment, which might also explain the amount of coverage. December 2007 is the second highest spike (<italic>n</italic> = 23), which coincides with the 2007 COP-13 meeting held in Bali. February and April of 2007 also present interesting spikes, which coincide with the release of reports by the IPCC that stated that climate change is very likely to be human induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511431204">IPCC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the increasing trend building towards 2007–2008 and then the drop for the following two years, it is surprising to see the dramatic drops in coverage after the biggest peaks. Immediately after the peaks of December 2007 and May 2008, the coverage dropped to pre-2007 average levels. This could suggest that coverage is event driven, similar to the results reported in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511431204">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>), although the extent to which competing issues—such as the economic world crisis—affect the coverage is unknown.</p>

<title>Framing the issue</title>
<p>The distribution of main frames and sub-frames is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511431204">Figure 2</xref>. The “effects” frame was clearly the most prominent one, with a presence in almost half of the sample (46.7%). In regards to the sub-frames, the “ecological effects” frame was present more than twice as often as the “human effects,” and more than three times as often as the “economic effects” frame.</p>

<p>A dominant theme frequently discussed within the “ecological frame” refers to the melting of tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains. Headlines such as “Fate of Peruvian glaciers at play in Poznan summit,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511431204">4</xref></sup> “Peruvian Andes lost 22% of their glaciers,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511431204">5</xref></sup> and “Say goodbye to the glaciers”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662511431204">6</xref></sup> exemplify the fatalistic view of a problem that is portrayed as inevitable and out of our control. An important number of articles using a human effects sub-frame (<italic>n</italic> = 75), discussed issues of water access, vector-borne diseases, food security, migration due to sea level rise, among other known effects. Most articles broadly discussed the effects on vulnerable, rural, and poor populations, but in a few cases personified the threat. The second most used frame was the “politics frame.” In this respect, the sub-frames “political discussions” and “policies” were similarly used. Articles with a science frame discussing new studies, mostly came from wire services. Examples include: “Millions of tonnes of methane emerge in the Arctic,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662511431204">7</xref></sup> and “Global warming advanced more than predicted.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662511431204">8</xref></sup> This frame was found mostly in articles not focusing on Peru.</p>
<p>Significance tests were conducted between the “framing” variable and the variables “authorship,” “origin of author,” “geography,” and “strategy” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511431204">Table 2</xref>). The authorship variable shows that articles authored by journalists and wire services have a similar use of frames, while commentators tend to use a “politics” frame more often. In terms of origin of the author, there is no significant difference between the use of frames by Peruvian and foreign authors. Although it is not possible to provide evidence from the data presented, it could be that Peruvian journalists and commentators are influenced by the information coming from news agencies. Articles with a strong focus on Peru tended to use an “effects” frame mostly, while articles with a moderate focus or no focus on the country used the “effects” and “politics” frame more evenly. The analysis also reveals a difference between the use of frames when discussing mitigation and/or adaptation strategies. While mitigation is mostly discussed in a politics context, adaptation is discussed within an effects frame (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511431204">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As expected, a considerable number of articles came from wire services (approximately one third, all coded as foreign source). Another third was authored by a journalist (90% Peruvian), approximately 8% were authored by a commentator (75% of whom were Peruvian), while 27% had no author listed. Additionally, a <italic>t</italic>-test reveals a significant difference between the mean number of words used by journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 821.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 368.27) and wire services (<italic>M</italic> = 341.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 209.32) (<italic>F</italic> = 43.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000, <italic>t</italic> = 13.18, df = 264). Stories authored by wire services are considerably shorter, providing less space for the development of themes.</p>
<p>Stories authored by the wire services had a very limited focus on Peru (only 10% had a moderate or strong focus on Peru), while stories authored by journalists had mostly either a moderate or a strong focus on Peru (64% combined) (χ2 = 139.29, df = 6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). In regards to the type of strategy discussed (mitigation and/or adaptation), the results show a significant difference (χ2 = 59.684, df = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) between articles authored by wire services, journalists, and commentators. Both wire services and journalists focused mostly on mitigation themes; however, journalists (who are mostly Peruvians), tended to discuss adaptation measures in higher proportions (approximately 19% of articles discuss only adaptation, compared to 10% authored by wire services).</p>
<p>Half of the articles discussed the issue as mostly a result of human actions. The rest of the articles did not make an explicit mention or it was not possible to deduce a position, with fewer than 2% suggesting that climate change is only a natural problem, or that it is not happening at all. In terms of the tone, more than 80% of the articles presented climate change in negative terms (e.g. a threat, a problem, a costly issue, etc.). About 14% used a neutral tone, while only 2.4% used an ambiguous tone, and only one article discussed it in a positive light.</p>
<p>In terms of the geographical scale, a focus on a national scale was used in 57% of articles, 16% had a mention of regional issues, while 20% discussed local features. After cross-tabulating with the variable “strategy,” it becomes clear that articles discussing mitigation actions will usually do so at the national level. Although articles discussing adaptation tended to also discuss such issues mostly at a national level, there was a higher tendency to include the local and regional levels.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511431204">Table 3</xref> presents the number of sources by origin (Peruvian or foreign). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511431204">Takahashi, 2011</xref>), “national government” sources (32%) clearly dominated media coverage, with almost an equal split between Peruvian and foreign sources. “Researcher/expert” was the second most prominent source, with foreign sources accounting for almost 80% of them. These sources were mostly found within the “science” framed articles (55%, <italic>n</italic> = 23), while none of the Peruvian sources were found in this type of article.

Although the number of expert sources used by journalists is important, most of them are not considered climate experts, which can partly be explained by the lack of controversy regarding the existence of the problem, as has been the case in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511431204">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>In relation to previous studies, there was a very limited use of “business” sources, which were highly prominent in the <italic>New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511431204">Brossard et al., 2004</xref>). In Peru, because of the low number of articles using the “Opportunities” frame, the low number of “industry” sources comes as no surprise. Similarly, there was an almost non presence of local and regional government voices or community sources. In this regard, articles with a strong focus on Peru were evenly distributed when applying the variable “scale” (national = 66, regional = 45, and local = 53). This suggests that the coverage at the regional and local levels is not incorporating sources that are representative of those areas. Finally, local celebrities have not become important actors in the climate change landscape, as opposed to their role in the US and other developed nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511431204">Boykoff and Goodman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The frequency of sources by authorship is also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511431204">Table 3</xref>. Stories by journalists and wire services presented very similar source use. The only differences were found in that journalists made some use of civil society sources (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and regional government sources (<italic>n</italic> = 9), while wire service stories did not use any of them.</p>

<title>6. Discussion</title>
<p>Coverage of climate change in the Peruvian press tended to emphasize the impending effects associated with the issue with no presence of skeptical views. Because of Peru’s marginal contribution to greenhouse gases, the coverage had a lesser focus on the country’s role in solving the problem, something more prevalent for example in the Indian press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511431204">Billett, 2010</xref>) and the UK tabloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511431204">Boykoff, 2008</xref>). The results most resemble those found in Mexico. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511431204">Gordon et al. (2010)</xref> argued that in previous studies outside the United States, an international relations frame dominated. In their study, they found that ecology/science and consequences frames were the most popular. Furthermore, this study extends the exploratory work conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511431204">Takahashi (2011)</xref> in Peru for one-week’s coverage of climate change during the Latin American and European Union Summit in 2008. The results presented here confirm the dominance of government sources and the limited amount of science framed articles.</p>
<p>The results also reveal that wire services play an important role in the reporting. First, the volume of stories is highly significant. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511431204">Shanahan’s (2009</xref>: 153) general assertion that coverage in non-industrialized nations has “a reliance on reports from Western news agencies rather than more locally relevant news. This, coupled with sparse coverage of adaptation, has implications for the world’s poor, who urgently need information to prepare for the impacts of climate change.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511431204">Antilla (2005)</xref> also suggested that wire services play a critical role in the reporting of the issue in the US. Nevertheless, comparative studies would be necessary to assess the extent of these claims. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511431204">McComas and Shanahan (1999)</xref> reported that the <italic>New York Times</italic> and the <italic>Washington Post</italic> included 67% of articles by journalists and only 8% from wire services.</p>
<p>Second, there is no major difference in the use of the frames between journalists and wire services. This might be a function of Peruvian journalists mirroring stories from the wire services, or of editorial selection by Peruvian newspapers. A more comprehensive analysis of wire service stories in other contexts would be necessary to determine this question. The significance of the wire services lies in the fact that their stories did not discuss issues directly relevant to Peru. Although the reporting of international politics would be expected to come from wire services, the high volume of articles not directly discussing Peru could provide an ambiguous representation where there are some important effects (i.e. melting glaciers), but also that the problem is something external to the country.</p>
<p>Third, and related to the previous point, discussion of mitigation and/or adaptation strategies shows some differences. From all articles, 123 mentioned only mitigation, 49 mentioned only adaptation, and 40 discussed both (almost half of the articles had no mention of either strategy). From that, stories from the wire services discussed adaptation significantly less than stories from journalists. This seems consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511431204">Olausson’s (2009</xref>: 432) assertion that in the Swedish media the mitigation frame dominates the coverage and that “[t]he two frames exist parallel to each other, in different contexts, hardly ever appearing in the same news items, regardless of the fact that they constitute two sides of the same coin—how to tackle the issue of climate change.” As previously discussed, this bias is even more relevant to developing countries such as Peru that are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Peruvian press in the case of climate change is highly dependent on the international news flow, especially when covering international relations. The heavy focus on the impacts should give way to a stronger coverage of solutions and policies in Peru, especially in regards to adaptation. This shift will depend on the availability and accessibility of sources such as regional and local governments that have not had significant media access so far. Understanding the characteristics of the coverage is highly relevant to the study of media and policy making, especially when considering that the media are one of the main sources of information about climate change for policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662511431204">Sundblad et al., 2009</xref>), including policy makers in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662511431204">Takahashi and Meisner, 2011</xref>). The information discussed in the media could influence both attention to and understandings of the issue.</p>
<p>Finally, the study presents certain limitations. The data collection offered an alternative procedure to contexts where data availability is a barrier for this type of research. However, as discussed in the methods section, it also presents some questions about its reliability. Also, although this study provides an extensive understanding of the coverage in Peru, a more detailed discourse analysis could provide a better level of detail about the dominant discourses. In their study of the UK press, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511431204">Doulton and Brown (2009</xref>: 201) suggested the following: “In constructing, reconstructing and presenting these discourses the press accentuates and perpetuates widely held views of developing countries and the poor as hapless victims facing another set of disasters who can only be helped by the rich Western countries.” In this respect, wire services may well be contributing to extending these views, something consistent with the perspective coming from the international news flow literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511431204">Sepúlveda Beltrán and Mayorga Rojel, 2005</xref>). Additionally, although this is a single case study, it provides a step forward in the need for comparative studies beyond the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511431204">Dirikx and Gelders, 2010</xref>). For example, future research could analyze the similarities and differences in media coverage between Andean countries.</p>
