<abstract>
<p>This article explores the nature of the reflective learning undertaken by pre-service trainee teachers training to teach in the lifelong learning sector in the UK. The argument made is that reflecting on the student voice can support novice teacher’s boundary-crossing and legitimate peripheral participation (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Heggen, 2008). This article frames student voice practices as essential within teacher education pedagogy. As a counterpoint to post-Fordist and post-modern challenges to education in late capitalism, student voice practice is used to demonstrate to novice teachers the pedagogic and democratic value that ‘listening to learners’ brings. While recognising the highly contested nature of voice, value is held in both listening to trainee teachers and their anxieties and concerns and providing a reflective and reflexive context through which these can be expressed; and the value to be had for (new) teachers to listen to their own learners. Student voice practice is held to have significance for teachers’ iterative identity (Giddens, 1991), and is seen to provide pedagogic opportunities for the framing of relational agency (Edwards, 2005).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With international interest in student voice continuing to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0892020612445684">Czerniawski and Kidd, 2011</xref>), and the rise of a body of student voice literature locating ‘voice’ as a counterpoint to neo-liberal agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0892020612445684">Giroux, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0892020612445684">Flutter and Rudduck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0892020612445684">Gunter and Thomson, 2007</xref>), the argument of this article is that student voice can support the identity construction of novice teachers through reflective and reflexive practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0892020612445684">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen, 2008</xref>). While for some, student voice work impacts massively on creating inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0892020612445684">Demetriou and Wilson, 2010</xref>) and in improving the quality of learning and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0892020612445684">McIntyre et al., 2005</xref>), others are critical of the use of student voice to give authority to teachers and not learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0892020612445684">Rudduck, 2006</xref>) and of the privileging of some learners over other more marginal groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0892020612445684">Robinson and Taylor, 2007</xref>). For some, it is not a case of allowing voice but in engaging with dialogue, although it is noted that too often these dialogic pedagogics are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020612445684">Arnot and Reay, 2007</xref>) and student voice is frequently marginalised as extracurricular and tokenistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020612445684">Bragg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0892020612445684">Thomson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of the student voice within the author’s teacher education pedagogy is located and framed within the post-modern and post-Fordist structural context of the lifelong learning sector in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445684">Avis, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">2002</xref>) where the specific teaching and learning behaviours which are the focus of this enquiry are acted out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al., 2009</xref>). Student voice – and its role in trainee teacher learning – will be linked to arguments around teacher identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020612445684">Beauchamp and Thomas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020612445684">Day and Gu, 2010</xref>) and the role of situated context and community membership in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0892020612445684">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>). Student voice pedagogic practice is held to provide an antidote to neo-liberal agendas in education and to marketised and managerial forces sweeping through the lifelong learning sector in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445684">Avis, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">2002</xref>). As a buttress to the consequences of late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0892020612445684">Savage and Warde, 1993</xref>) and the problems of late capitalism in constructing a ‘strain on the self’, student voice practice for novice teachers is seen to construct a forum for the exploration of relational agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445684">Edwards, 2005</xref>). Through this article, while aware of the contested nature of notions of ‘voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020612445684">Bragg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">2004</xref>), I will use ‘student voice’ to refer to two sets of practices: the capturing of trainee teacher’s ‘voices’ through reflective pedagogic practices and the capturing of younger learners’ ‘voices’ through a series of semi-structured interviews. The student voice interviews are at the heart of this enquiry and were used to frame learning and teaching strategies to trainee teachers on the author’s own initial teacher education programme. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al. (2009</xref>), teacher learning and teaching and learning itself:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>…is shaped by the nature of the social contexts in which interaction occurs and the ways in which teachers and students construct their roles within it…teachers’ conceptualisations of their students’ learning can be related not only to their own and students’ backgrounds and learning biographies, but also to the wider structural context within which learning in FE is currently located</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al., 2009</xref>: 421)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Following Salisbury et al. (2009), the viewpoint explored here is that until trainee teachers visit colleges and meet learners, the ‘location’ and groundedness of their initial professional learning is highly ‘unsituated’. In other words, learning is not rooted or grounded in a context of lived experience as a professional in the making but perceptions are drawn upon autobiographical histories of the self which are limited by the individuals’ experience. Often trainee teachers are learning how to teach (and how to learn) in contexts radically different from their own educational biographies and in socioeconomic geographical locations different from their own upbringing. This is both a pedagogic and professional issue – how do trainees as professionals in the making come to develop sensitivity towards their learners and towards the mechanics and craft of teaching and learning itself? How can we, as teacher educators, model best practice in supporting trainees in this crucial initial development? It is by adopting the student voice – and using this to inform professional learning – that we might hope to achieve the ‘democratic schooling’ spoken of by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0892020612445684">Giroux (2005</xref>). As Giroux notes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>The concept of voice constitutes the focal point for a theory of teaching and learning that generates new forms of sociality as well as new and challenging ways of confronting and engaging everyday life.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0892020612445684">Giroux, 2005</xref>: 454)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This article develops a commentary on the fears and anxieties of teachers in the making regarding their own learners and regarding the boundary-crossing practices they undertake while starting their training programme as a (new) ‘professional learner’; and in doing so it gives a voice to the thoughts that younger learners (aged 16−19) in the UK lifelong learning sector have about ‘good teaching’.</p>
<sec id="section2-0892020612445684">
<title>Unsituated voices</title>
<p>This article explores student voice research conducted by the author as part of the provision on an initial teacher education programme for the lifelong learning sector in the UK. As a means to better inform pre-service trainee teachers regarding teaching and learning, a variety of audio recordings (podcasts) were produced, through semi-structured interviews, of 16−19 year old learners. Interviews were conducted in a variety of diverse urban-situated contexts in schools and colleges, seeking to explore young learners’ views on teaching and teachers. These recordings have then been used as part of a blended delivery to aid the reflective practice of trainee teachers. The articulation of the learner voice through the recordings enables trainee teachers to (re)contextualise their assumptions (and ultimately their biographies) regarding expectations of learners and teaching and learning prior to starting teaching placement. In this way, the discursive and reflective practices supported by these learner voice audios enable the reformation of (un)situated learning and better informs trainees’ initial boundary-crossing practices from ‘outsider’ to ‘novice teacher’.</p>
<p>This enquiry captures student voice in two, related contexts. Firstly, the trainee teachers who are being supported are ‘(professional) learners’. Their voice has been captured through the adoption of reflective journals on their teacher education programme. Secondly, young learners’ voices have been captured through interviews, leading to the creation of an audio archive. The audio resource is used pedagogically as a means to inform the trainee teachers, supporting them to co-construct meanings of ‘what teaching means’ at the very start of their professional education.</p>
<p>My own experience of supporting professional learners – ‘trainee teachers’ – would indicate that many trainee teachers in initial teacher education arrive at the start of their programmes without much contact with younger learners. Thus, they are often surprised by the degrees of confidence, reflection and articulation with which many younger learners are able to engage with their own learning. They are surprised at how learners are able to talk confidently about what they think is good teaching and to be able to describe styles of teaching and teaching tools and techniques in some depth and with sophistication. At the same time, many trainees are understandably cautious and concerned about the teaching role – in particular over issues of classroom and behaviour management, often clouded by their perceptions of what learners (aged 14–19) are like. This article, and the enquiry it critically outlines, starts with the explicit value proposition so deeply embedded in many notions of student voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0892020612445684">Rudduck and Flutter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0892020612445684">Ruddock and McIntyre, 2007</xref>), that teachers and learners can be, are, and must be co-constructors of their own practice and social endeavours. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al. (2009</xref>) suggest, ‘it is important to locate teachers and learners as active participants in at least some of the processes of learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al., 2009</xref>: 421).</p>

<title>Contested voices</title>
<p>In characterising the student voice movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445684">Taylor and Robinson (2009</xref>) comment that, ‘As a field of educational endeavour student voice has been largely seen as oriented to action, participation and change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445684">Taylor and Robinson, 2009</xref>: 163). However, not all voices are heard, or at least, not all voices are heard the same way. Literature suggests that learners most likely to be involved in student voice initiatives are those learners who would mostly likely have a ‘stake’ or investment in education due to the accumulation of cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020612445684">Bragg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0892020612445684">McIntyre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445684">Taylor and Robinson, 2009</xref>). In some schools and colleges the ‘zeitgeist commitment to student voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0892020612445684">Rudduck, 2006</xref>: 133) is little more than an attempt to engage in ‘surface compliance with a notionally transformational agenda but which fail to take account of the intransigencies of power or disrupt its operations at a deeper level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445684">Taylor and Robinson, 2009</xref>: 166). When student voice is linked to ‘school improvement’ agendas it often reproduces ‘surface compliance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445684">Taylor and Robinson, 2009</xref>: 163) rather than more authentic and meaningful attempts to develop democratic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The agenda of some student voice work is to capture voices to give ‘privileging’ to the learner as the author of their voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0892020612445684">Solorzano and Yosso, 2002</xref>) – a claim seen by some authors informed by post-structural theories to be a ‘romanticisation’ of an ‘authentic’ voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0892020612445684">Jackson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0892020612445684">Mazzei, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0892020612445684">St Pierre, 2000</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0892020612445684">2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0892020612445684">Rudduck (2006</xref>) an authentic voice is possible and can operate as an alternative to performance cultures and ‘managerialism’.</p>

<sec id="section4-0892020612445684">
<title>Reflective voices</title>
<p>In this enquiry, I seek to use student voice to support the learning and development of trainee teachers. As professional learners, these trainee teachers also have a ‘learner voice’, which we can explore, alongside the voice of younger learners. Extracts from trainee teachers’ reflective journals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0892020612445684">1</xref></sup> (quoted here with permission of the trainees themselves) express clearly ambiguous locations and tensions in the initial development of a professional self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020612445684">Day and Gu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020612445684">Czerniawski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0892020612445684">Layder, 1993</xref>) and a ‘professional identity’ – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020612445684">Beauchamp and Thomas (2009</xref>) describe as ‘how to be’, ‘how to act’ and ‘how to understand’.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>When I arrived at a local sixth form to have a look around I felt a little intimidated, as my experiences of sixth form were very different studying in middle-class York. However, during our tour I saw nothing but eager, hardworking students who were all focussed and seemingly interested in what they were learning.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
<p>
<italic>I had half expected to walk past classrooms and see students running around, shouting, fighting and generally getting out of hand.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this way, ‘becoming a teacher’ is a learning process and based upon socialisation from within groups and interactional encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0892020612445684">Hobson et al., 2004</xref>). In forming the initial stages of this professional identity, the trainee teachers in this enquiry express a range of emotions when thinking about the learners they are likely to meet in their training year:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>As my choice to come to UEL was mainly based on the fact that I would be studying and working in east London, the introduction to the socio-economic ‘peculiars’ of the local area was of no surprise or shock. As I looked around the room I wondered how many in the group had a similar point of view (I’m guessing and hoping the majority) and how many might end up struggling to deal with East End’s ‘deprived youth’. One of course does not negate the other, and I suspect I too will find it rather challenging at times – despite all my good intentions and genuine interest in giving my students the best possible opportunities.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This reflection, as discussed above, is initially unsituated – it is uncontextualised by practice at this early stage. Tensions exist between excitement and fear; between wanting to ‘change lives’ and being worried about the ‘nature’ of the lives of their younger learners; tensions between wanting to patronise learners and being willing to learn from them. As one trainee reflects,<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I was worried that I had been too naïve about the challenges of teaching in FE colleges … and was left wondering if this was the right path for me after all.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Once they have started their teaching placement, this hope for young learners can sometimes all too quickly become frustration:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I have an issue with student’s complete inability to work independently or for themselves. In many lessons it feels as though students would prefer me to just give them definitions of keywords and tell them to memorise. The idea of building skills for themselves seems beyond them.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On recalling the group’s induction walk along the east London ‘Docklands’ area of the Thames, one trainee reflects:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>The walk from Canary Wharf along the river to just east of Tower Bridge was a good addition, as it said plenty about what the area used to be like (warehouses, etc.) and what it is like now (posh flats, gated communities) It is in stark contrast to most of the rest of east London – as a walk to Shadwell station reminded us later – but the gated communities and riverside apartments could have as much an effect on the lives of east London’s young people as the council estates and tower blocks of Bow and Poplar. I can only try and guess what that effect might be at this point (anger? resentment? feeling of worthlessness? Who knows…) but I suspect I might find out once I start my placement!</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many of trainees (as indeed do many ‘established’ teachers) find themselves occupying highly contested and ambiguous relationships with their learners:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I feel that I need to challenge them, and help broaden their horizons and their aspirations. Even if it needs to be done while they are kicking and screaming.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
<p>
<italic>My opinion varies − They are sweet and lovely, smart and enthusiastic, frustrating and hard work, stubborn and disrespectful. They can reduce you to tears in one lesson, but amaze you with their creativity and enthusiasm two days later. They are given a hard time by the media and the police − twice in the last four days I witnessed the police stop and search my students, once at the tube station and once outside the theatre. Their lives are not easy, or fair, and yet they sometimes seem resigned to their fate. I think they are scared of what they don’t know, so choose to dismiss it and stick to their small (and safe) known worlds. I find teaching them hard work, but also extremely rewarding when they ‘get it’. I feel it’s a greater duty to do the absolute best I can and give it my all.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Within all these hopes, fears, insecurities and frustrations, the importance of the induction period into the initial teacher education programme becomes paramount for supporting teachers’ learning and development – to allow and encourage the ‘surprises’:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Students do have the ability to surprise you. Some students appear quite unmotivated until you get to know them and they turn out to be amongst the best students.</italic> (trainee teacher reflection)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The importance of using student voice to inform the professional learning of teachers in the making also becomes apparent. Induction into a professional learning programme needs to be supported through recognition on behalf of the trainee that the construction of their professional identity and self is about to undergo rapid transformation. The induction period becomes an attempt to turn this reflection into more situated learning – to contextualise first visits to placements and first contacts with learners within broader brush strokes. It is this research problematic that has led to the construction of the learner voice audio resource that this article addresses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0892020612445684">
<title>Post-Fordist voices</title>
<p>To support teacher education and professional learning we also need to consider the situatedness of where and how professionals in the lifelong learning sector, in the UK, ‘learn’ once they move from university training to ‘novice’ and eventually legitimate practice in the educational institutions which make up the sector in question. It is this very context that informs the need to encourage trainee teachers moving into the lifelong learning sector to listen to learners. It is also this context that informs the ‘voice’ of trainee teachers’ reflective accounts, as presented above, of their learning and boundary crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0892020612445684">Van Oers, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the literature commentating on the past decade of ‘workplace reform’ within the UK lifelong learning sector adopts the language of a post-modern (and at times a post-structural) pessimism: it speaks of a late-modern and reflexive modern ennui characterised by anxiety, uncertainty, de-professionalism and surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">Avis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020612445684">Ainley and Bailey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0892020612445684">Wallace, 2002</xref>). Such is the prevalence of managerialism within the sector, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0892020612445684">Reeves (1995</xref>) described this sector in the UK as being ‘totalitarian’ in outlook and in working conditions and relationships.</p>
<p>However, there is another interpretation. This second narrative does recognise the realities of problematic conditions in the UK lifelong learning sector. However, while not negating the application of post-structural analytical tools, neo-Fordist working regimes and anxious, unconstructed, fragmented post-modern identities, it is possible to offer another framework. It is possible to see change within lifelong learning as a space for possibility, not pessimism. To see the possibility of identity change and also the possibility for newly formed identities for teachers in this sector. The fluidity of further education (FE), as characterised in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445684">Avis (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">2002</xref>), points to shifting (teacher) identities as global policy agendas shape the reality of the FE sector but more importantly, are in turn adopted, managed, maintained and subverted by the lived experience of trainees, teachers and teacher educators in the FE sector.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445684">Avis (1999</xref>) offers an interpretation of the further education sector where previous notions of ‘proletarianisation’ or ‘de-skilling’ are seen as lacking and limited. For Avis (as for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020612445684">Bathmaker and Avis, 2007</xref>), FE is witnessing a transformation process – of both teaching and learning and of identity. The transformation of teaching and learning itself opens up a space within which it is possible for vocational education and training (VET) professionals to explore new professional knowledge, re-evaluate practice and construct new identities. This is a positive interpretation of the workplace reforms undertaken by the sector over the past decade, but one that owes as much to post-structuralism as do the more nihilistic interpretations of ‘risk’ and the onset of control and compliance. For example, education as a site for ‘policy technologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020612445684">Ball, 2001</xref>) is a space where teachers are ‘accountable and constantly recorded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020612445684">Ball, 2004</xref>: 144).</p>
<p>Both these interpretations recognise that discourses produce subjects under their gaze, but the interpretation placed upon this subjectification process by Avis suggests that agents within policy settlements and ideologies are able to carve out and negotiate futures and identities for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020612445684">Avis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">Avis, 2002</xref>). As trainee teachers ‘boundary-cross’ from the university to the training placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen, 2008</xref>), we might recognise that their identities are even more fluid than the identities being worked on by established teachers already working in a fluid and moving workplace. As such, trainee teachers’ identities are being worked-<italic>up</italic> rather than worked-<italic>on</italic>.</p>

<title>Theorising voices</title>
<p>The argument here is that adopting student voice work – talking with learners and making this dialogue transparent to trainee teachers – allows teachers to develop their own theorising. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020612445684">Carr and Kemmis (1986</xref>) note:</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Many teachers – and certainly many trainee teachers – find both reflection and the application of theoretical insights difficult and find theory somehow distanced and separated from their experiences of their own practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0892020612445684">Griffin, 2003</xref>). While most trainees value and see the importance of their ‘field experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020612445684">Avis et al., 2002</xref>), the other side of the coin, the teaching theory, is usually ignored and at best used in a clinical and cynical fashion for the writing of essays and assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0892020612445684">Elliott, 1991</xref>). Field experience is invaluable; being in the classroom as a practical exercise is clearly essential, but practice without reflection and without critical thinking is ultimately of surface value only for teacher learning. The ‘craft knowledge’ of teachers as spoken about by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445684">Hagger and McIntyre (2006</xref>) is not atheoretical – far from it: it is situated in practice but also straddles the work place and the academy by linking theory to practical know-how. Adopting Bourdieu’s socio-cultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892020612445684">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen (2008</xref>), writing within the Norwegian context, has made the claim that there is a gap between professional practice and what professionals are taught about this practice. For Haggen, this makes teachers ‘boundary crossers’ – they are members of different horizontally segregated communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0892020612445684">Wenger, 1998</xref>). This polycontextuality informs their identity and professional socialisation but the ‘realities’ of the field constitute the stronger pull. Following the Norwegian example once more, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0892020612445684">Van Oers (1998</xref>) offers a social-constructivist approach to notions of professional formation, arguing that knowledge learned on training programmes needs to be recontextualised before it can become of practical use in the field. Student voice work – and positive and democratic relationships with learners − can have the potential to transform the contextuality of trainee teachers as they begin this process of identity formation.</p>

<title>Pedagogic voices</title>
<p>It is important that we recognise that notwithstanding the ‘unsettling boundaries’ in and around the lifelong learning sector itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445684">Edwards and Fowler, 2007</xref>), teacher education in general, and teacher education and learning within the lifelong learning sector in particular, are contested and enacted by the professionals who ‘profess’ to practise them. Teacher education is equally constructed as a ‘subject’ in policy narratives and discourses. The shifting field of teacher education makes many claims: it is seen by some as the means by which teachers better know their ‘craft’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445684">Hagger and McIntyre, 2006</xref>), and to better know their ‘selves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020612445684">Atkinson, 2004</xref>). While a new field, or at least, a marginal contribution to a larger and more established field, teacher education literature points to the need for teacher educators to articulate their pedagogies as a meaningful and collegiate way forward within a professional research community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0892020612445684">Murray et al., 2009</xref>). There is also recognition that within the ambiguity that surrounds the teacher education field, it is impossible to make certain knowledge claims about teachers’ own practices as a professional body – let alone teacher educators’ own practice. The particular location for teacher educators – the double hermeneutical location of being both teacher and a teacher of teachers – seems to sit easily with notions of a pedagogy built upon ‘modelling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0892020612445684">Loughran, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445684">Hagger and McIntyre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0892020612445684">Malderez and Wedell, 2007</xref>); although the modelling of what is unsure. Through the enquiry which is the subject of the research-informed practice identified in this article, I seek to demonstrate to trainee teachers, modelling in my practice, the importance of a ‘democratic education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0892020612445684">Giroux, 2005</xref>) and the value to be had in ‘listening to learners’:<disp-quote>

<title>Digital voices</title>
<p>To develop the learner voice audio resource the recordings themselves were edited audio files drawn from a series of semi-structured interviews with 16–19 year old learners in diverse urban settings in the UK. On the basis of a ‘something-for-something’ contractual relationship to participant participation, the learners themselves were drawn from students currently studying sociology. It was hoped that the experience of taking part in a research interview would be a learning experience for them and one that they could apply to their own sociological studies. As an elicitation technique, considerable time was taken before and after each private individual interview to speak to each student about their studies, their coursework and in doing so to answer any questions about the research methodology and techniques of this research. A central feature of the research interviews was the emphasis at all times upon ‘good teaching’; all institutions and all learners were briefed on the importance to speak about positive experiences (and that those listening to the audio resource afterwards would infer from the research that ‘bad teaching’ would be the opposite of ‘good teaching’). In this way, the institutions themselves were comfortable with the recordings taking place and the learners themselves were comfortable with the idea that others would get to hear the files. All learners who took part spoke candidly, positively and enthusiastically about the experience and expressed interest and pleasure in the idea that their institutions and teachers new to the profession might develop their practice because of the creation of their participation.</p>
<p>Each interview was 25–40 minutes long and was recorded digitally using MP3 recorders and microphones. Each interview started with the question ‘What makes a good teacher?’ and ended with the question ‘What advice do you have for trainee teachers about to start to teach for the first time?’ Nineteen interviews were recorded in total, generating over nine hours of audio. Audio files were uploaded into sound-editing freeware programs and then edited down into a series of smaller chunks – each lasting between 45 seconds and up to 3 minutes. These chunks of data were re-coded with a file name that best summarised the content of the recording, often where possible drawing upon the exact words of the participants themselves (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020612445684">Table 1</xref> for a selection of file names).</p>

<p>File names coded in this way start to develop a sense of the authentic voice of the participant and yet at the same time help to establish anonymity. Each set of files – later to become part of the audio teaching tool – were then burned onto a CD-ROM and sent back to each institution for internal staff training. This part of the research is still ongoing with two out of the three institutions having made, to date, a strong indication that they are interested in developing an action research project/resource coming out of the data. Final data were coded using tools and a sensibility indebted to the ‘grounded theory’ approach as (re)versioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0892020612445684">Charmaz (2006</xref>), whereby the audios (as data) are brought closer into frame:<disp-quote>

<p>Learners interviewed were able to speak with both clarity and authority of what they felt ‘works’ in the classroom. For many trainee teachers the socioeconomic and geographical location of these voices – their accents and (sub)cultural languages – provided a stark contrast to the depth and authority with which their voices and stories were received by the trainees. The unpacking of judgements and assumptions in this way was also useful in demonstrating to trainee teachers the importance of locating learners as authoritative and ‘expert’ in their own right. However, the audios and voices were not ‘received’ by the trainee teachers in a straightforward way. Presenting the audios in a deconstructed form has the problematic of making, at times, the learners and the learner voice disembodied. Along with this, disembodied voices are themselves unsituated. The audio teaching and learning resource requires great orchestration on behalf of teacher educators to allow the stories and voices to become more fully formed as they become more context-sensitive. The ‘fully realised’, context-dependent voices are themselves reflective – learners are articulating their stories, their voice, through reflection and in doing so are demonstrating the significant degree of reflective pedagogic work they have already added to the frame through which they see the classrooms and institutions they inhabit. Thus we have a relationship between the reflective practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0892020612445684">Schön, 1983</xref>) and the reflective learner.</p>

<title>Hermeneutical voices</title>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020612445684">Brookfield (1995</xref>) we have four ‘lenses’ through which reflective practice for professional learners can be developed: the autobiographical, fellow professionals, research literature and our students. The student voice movement and this enquiry seek to demonstrate the value to be had in adopting this fourth lens. In this enquiry, and the research-informed practice it supports, I seek to demonstrate to trainee teachers that their learners are ‘reflective learners’ too, and that what such learners bring to the classroom and interactional encounters is an often detailed and well-articulated understanding of pedagogy – more so, perhaps, than many trainee teachers when they start their professional learning. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0892020612445684">Charmaz (2006</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Neither observer nor observed come to a scene untouched by the world.

</disp-quote>The enquiry herein, and the wider student voice movement, conceives participants (in both learning partnerships and research enquiry) to also be ‘reflexive’ (and reflective) about what they ‘bring’ – about their stock of knowledge and its value in forming the world as seen around them. This image of the learner-participant as having a reflective self (of being articulate, opinionated and grounded) is embedded in some of the literature around student voice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2004</xref>) and action research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445684">Grant, 2007</xref>) – itself often employed by student voice practitioner-researchers. The cultivation of this reflective self is also what is both asked and required of trainee teachers as they move from teacher-in-the-making to ‘novice outsiders’, ready to legitimately participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0892020612445684">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>) in first employments and new socio-cultural surroundings. Contrary to the ‘dangerous’ and ‘therapeutic education’ heavily critiqued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0892020612445684">Ecclestone and Hayes (2008)</xref>, this enquiry is an attempt to place learners at both the heart of teaching and at the training of teachers, seeking to capture and be sensitive to their voice, development and emotional and relational qualities and encounters. In this process I seek to demonstrate to trainee teachers the legitimate value of what learners know and the stock of knowledge they bring to interactional encounters in the classroom. However, this is far from uncontested. Post-structural readings of power show us that knowledge is constructed by the ‘knower’ and about the ‘known’ through the objectification of the known in the interplay of discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0892020612445684">Derrida, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0892020612445684">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0892020612445684">Foucault, 1984</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding (2004)</xref> notes:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>In working with students, whether we are teachers, teacher-researchers, or researchers, we will inevitably find ourselves talking about them and, perhaps less frequently, on behalf of them or for them.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2004</xref>: 302)</p>
</disp-quote>For Fielding, student voice research, not uncontested by any means, raises three key problematics for the power dynamic embedded in research. We have: ‘Problems of speaking <italic>about</italic> others’; ‘problems of speaking <italic>for</italic> others’; and problems of ‘getting heard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445684">Fielding, 2004</xref>: 296). In this enquiry, I have sought to speak ‘with’ rather than ‘for’ learners – although at times the distinction is tenuous. In using student voice for the training of teachers and to develop their reflective (and reflexive) practices, I seek to encourage teachers to relate to learners with the ‘radical collegiality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0892020612445684">Fielding, 1999</xref>) needed to demonstrate that learners and what they have to say are both valued and can inform the professional learning of the teacher.

<p>This enquiry, like a great deal of small-scale, qualitative student voice work, can only hope to begin to support transformation and democratic education on a local level.

</disp-quote>It has been important for this enquiry to frame trainee teachers as able to learn from the authority of authentic student voice, and to conceptualise learners as having useful and meaningful insights and stories to share. I have attempted to talk with learners, although at times I have had no choice but to allow them to talk through, my teacher education pedagogy. But in this small way we attempt to ensure that trainee teachers, as they become novice and then legitimate participants understand the democratic value in the co-construction of meanings of teaching and learning with learners. We need to encourage trainee teachers to understand that these voices should command our attention. Again, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445684">Back (2007</xref>) suggests, ‘the task of sociology is to admit these voices and pay them the courtesy of serious attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445684">Back, 2007</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>To do this is, though, a highly modernist approach to the problems of the managerial, marketised and post-Fordist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445684">Avis, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445684">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445684">Salisbury et al., 2009</xref>), changes sweeping across the lifelong learning sector in the UK, as elsewhere in other northern European societies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0892020612445684">Savage and Warde (1993</xref>) have noted, modernity is itself ‘double-edged’: on the one hand it promises the ‘self’ ripe for active development – a personal identity project; and yet, on the other, the need to shape and mould self-identity comes with it risk and anxiety. For Savage and Warde modernity is thus ‘disorderly’ since it ‘obliges individuals to experiment, to hope, to gamble and to be ambitious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0892020612445684">Savage and Warde, 1993</xref>: 150). This means that the project of the self, of becoming who one is, for teachers and other professional learners, is fundamentally a risky proposition. Notwithstanding post-structural insights into the way teachers and learners are formed as objects through power relations, I have argued here that teachers and trainee teachers are best conceptualised as active agents – that the rapid and hyper-intensive ebb and flow of structural and discourse changes which characterise the UK lifelong learning sector in turn creates places and spaces for identity-work, and for the learning from learners as much as from other sources. In this sense, I argue here that it is better not just to conceive trainee teachers as ‘boundary-crossers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445684">Heggen, 2008</xref>) but also as in need of (successful) ‘relational agency’:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Relational agency involves a capacity to offer support and to ask for support from others. One’s ability to engage with the world is enhanced by doing so alongside others.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0892020612445684">Edwards and Mackenzie, 2005</xref>: 282)</p>
</disp-quote>
As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445684">Edwards (2005</xref>) notes, the problems and social change associated with late capitalism ‘create paradoxical tensions for those who inhabit them and put strain on a sense of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445684">Edwards, 2005</xref>: 169). This is true for teachers and for trainee teachers – they need to locate themselves within a world which is redefining around them what it means to be a teacher. To do so, locating professional practice in authentic student voice might offer a counterpoint to more market-driven educational sensibilities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445684">Edwards (2005</xref>) also contends:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>strong forms of agency are required to help people, such as practitioners who need to collaborate across organisational boundaries, to find moments of stability as they move in and out of different settings without the protection of what Sennett (1999) describes as ‘institutional shelters’.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445684">Edwards, 2005</xref>: 169)</p>
</disp-quote>
With relational agency comes the need for relational intimacy: for those who engage in collective social encounters to better understand each other so that mutual support can be established − mutual support which might fend off the risks and tensions of the project of the self in the late capitalist and post-modern age. Teachers need to work with each other; but they need to work with learners too. Only by capturing and utilising student voice can we hope to redefine what it means to teach – and to learn how to teach.</p>

<p>The trainee teachers that are supported by myself and colleagues undertake an extensive ‘induction’ programme to help build more firmly the ‘bridge’ between professional learner and novice practitioner. This induction concentrates upon issues of professional identity, reflection as a professional learning tool, and the socio-economic context within which colleges local to the university work. This practice also adopts the use of a reflective journal to allow and encourage trainees to formally express their ongoing and changing professional identity and to encourage the recording of critical incidents and lesson self-reflections and evaluations. Some of this content is formally assessed since it makes up part of marked assignments, but a great deal is there for the self-reflection and professional learning of the individual involved.</p>
