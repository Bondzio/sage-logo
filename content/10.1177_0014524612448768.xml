<p>Though my American daughter has tried to explain it to me, I find it hard to follow the intricacies of Baseball; but even I am moved at the thought of one of the greatest baseball tragedies in the history of the game. It occurred on October 25, 1986, when the Boston Red Sox, the team my daughter supports, had a comfortable two-run lead against the Mets, in what the Americans modestly call the World Series. The Mets were batting and a veteran of the Red Sox called Bill Buckner was fielding at 1<sup>st</sup> base. Tragically, inexplicably, he let a lightly tapped ball roll between his legs into outfield, enabling the Mets to get a home run and victory in the series. Buckner was a baseball hero who had won thousands of games for the Red Sox over the years with his line drives and brilliant fielding. All that was forgotten, and he is now famous for the day he lost the Red Sox the World Series.</p>
<p>This incident in baseball history lead the scientist and baseball fan, Stephen Jay Gould, to pen an interesting meditation. He observed that triumph’s pleasures are intense but brief, while remembrance of our failures remain with us for ever. He went on to suggest that this is a good thing, because it is failure that is really expressive of our common humanity, and is our best teacher. Gould was right to say failure is expressive of our humanity, so why do we so often associate it with shame and why should the memory of our failures live with us forever? There is certainly something about society at the moment that makes it difficult for people in public life to be honest about their mistakes, as though success and not failure were thought to be the human norm.</p>
<p>I suspect that this reluctance to own up to our failures has something to do with the eclipse of religious understanding in our culture today. One of the most attractive aspects of the Christian account of humanity is its robust attitude to human failure: it simply takes it for granted that we are ‘miserable sinners’, so it is never surprised by our failures. OK, the language can be a bit extreme sometimes, and the guilt can be laid on too thickly, but there is a realism about Christian anthropology and its emphasis on our ‘fallen’ status that we need to re-inject into public discourse today. And the funny thing is that admitting we are flawed creatures can be liberating.</p>
<p>Arthur Stanton, a famous East End priest in 19<sup>th</sup> Century London, loved to quote Psalm 103 to his poor parishioners of St Alban’s Holborn: ‘The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long suffering and of great goodness…For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust’. Then he would lean over the edge of the pulpit and add with a mischievous smile, ‘and dust can’t always be up to the mark’. Amen to that.</p>
