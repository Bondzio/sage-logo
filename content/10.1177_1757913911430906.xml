<p>The current economic crisis has re-energised the debate about the purposes of education. Whereas utilitarians continue to argue that fundamentally schools should prepare children to serve the economic and employment needs of the nation, academic idealists look to the value of education for its own sake and the need to nurture thinking skills, research and high culture.</p>
<p>While the policy balance between these two ideologies will undoubtedly become readjusted again in due course, the one aspect which continues to be missing from this discussion is what learners themselves require. In particular, how they can be helped to lead purposeful existences in which they are capable of making decisions about their own life and health choices through effective understanding and evaluation of the options available to them.</p>
<p>At present, most health education is piecemeal and focussed on specific crises in the nation’s well-being – e.g. increasing levels of obesity or drug usage (Sanderson, p. 19). In order to introduce some much needed coherence, a planned health literacy implementation model is required that is holistic and develops skills and attitudes as well as basic knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430906">1</xref></sup> Key to this will be how and by whom the messages are delivered. Firstly we consider how teachers and health professionals are not always best suited to delivering such messages and the article on page 17 describes a successful peer education strategy in which the students themselves take a leading role.</p>
<p>Essentially, health literacy is about empowering people to take better control of their lives through appropriate experiences and understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430906">2</xref></sup> Marshall <italic>et al.</italic> (p. 31) argue also that: <italic>“An investment in health literacy will ultimately increase a patient’s self-esteem, compliance and capacity to self-manage”</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition, the resultant improvement in people’s health literacy levels should help increase their proficiency as parents to pass on appropriate attitudes and behaviours to their children, which in turn will help create a sustainably healthier population in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430906">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have previously argued for health literacy to be on an equal standing with English language &amp; literacy and numeracy in the primary school curriculum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430906">1</xref></sup> on the basis that this is the most effective way of generating the behavioural changes that will allow society to move to a position where prevention of ill health becomes more fundamental and acceptable than treatment alone.</p>
<p>Clearly, proficiency in English language is an essential prerequisite for the development of good health literacy, and with the increasing numbers of UK residents with mother tongue languages other than English, the need for approaches that successfully link learning in English language and health literacy is becoming critical. Stewart (p. 21) describes how one college in Birmingham has been tackling this issue.</p>
<p>The role of social marketing in assisting individuals to make appropriate decisions about their lives is also an important component in improving health literacy. Fortunately, Reynolds (p. 24) concludes that the future ahead for social marketing seems positive, both at the operational level of individual behavioural change and at the strategic level of the emerging Government’s public health policy.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, Brosnan <italic>et al.</italic> (p. 39) have shown that more than a quarter of the Irish population have marginal or low health literacy, while Marshall <italic>et al</italic>. (p. 29) consider health literacy to be a national issue in Ireland, which could have drastic consequences yet is readily surmountable.</p>
<p>Of most concern, however, is that previous research into health literacy has been limited and focussed mainly on adults; largely around helping them understand better the illnesses that they have developed already e.g. cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430906">3</xref></sup> As a result, little attention has been paid to the best ways of developing health literacy in children. Indeed Sanderson (p. 19) argues that despite substantial investment in the Healthy Schools programme, there has been little evaluation of its real effectiveness, and in many respects health education has now lost its sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, an urgent need for the current debate about the purposes of education, particularly for young children, to focus much more on health and well-being and the development of health literacy, since this will not only support the establishment of a healthier population but also reduce the economic costs of ill-health and healthcare; help diminish health and social inequalities; and enable health professionals to have a much more powerful impact upon the lives of a properly informed and aware population.</p>
<p>The RSPH recently organized a workshop to examine the current state of health literacy development among primary age school children and to establish possible policy changes and practical interventions that could be introduced in the future. The outcomes of this workshop are described in a report assembled by Menzies (p. 43), which concludes with a series of suggestions for further action. Readers are most welcome to write to the Editor of this journal about the views expressed in this report and to become actively involved in advancing the discussion around this vital aspect of health improvement. As Sanderson concludes: <italic>“There should be a clear commitment at all levels that children do deserve better than they have had so far”</italic>.</p>
