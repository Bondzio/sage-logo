<abstract>
<p>Biocomposites of polylactic acid with cellulose whiskers from grass were prepared and reinforced with nanolayer-filled ionomer (Surlyn®). Three types of polymer composites were fabricated by filling the whiskers in polylactic acid at 5, 10, and 15% concentration. The analysis of resulting products was conducted by monitoring the functional group variation, crystallinity, and thermal behavior. The addition of clay-filled ionomer appeared to enhance the interfacial adhesion between filler and matrix by chemical and physical bonding. The migration tendency of different components inside silicate layers was also studied where the confinement of host polymer chains occurred between clay platelets, after modification through ionomer.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312438174" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites have proven their high potential in almost every sector of life and broadly developed to reduce the metal dependence in automotive and other construction industries. Other than their light weight, cheap, ubiquitous availability in a variety of forms, low density and comparable material properties with high molding flexibility, natural fiber-reinforced composites have been accepted as nature-friendly filler, which make them a conceivable option in comparison of traditional fillers like mica, calcium carbonate, glass, and so on and allowing researchers to imagine the growing of car on trees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312438174">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312438174">2</xref></sup> The use of the biocomposites for constructive purpose is expected to improve manufacturing speed and recycling with enhanced environmental compatibility. This realization has driven the origin of numerous approaches for development of biodegradable material as evidenced from their gradually increasing use year-by-year in different sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312438174">3</xref></sup> The composites of petroleum-based polymer with cellulose fiber are popular as environmental-friendly material. However, there are reports of preferable consumption of bio-part by microbes leaving behind fragmented host polymer matrix, which may be as harmful as neat/virgin host polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312438174">4</xref></sup> To overcome such type of shortcomings, biodegradable polymer matrix has been popularly selected for reinforcement by natural fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312438174">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312438174">6</xref></sup> and products with appropriate biodegradability have been prepared. The use of fully biodegradable host matrix to replace nonbiodegradable polymer is sometime restricted due to their relatively higher cost and lower mechanical properties, regardless of its ecofriendly behavior.</p>
<p>Earlier, the adhesion between both, natural filer and polymer, phases was considered as the biggest challenge in this area that finally influences the properties of resulting product. There are many reports addressing the satisfactory solution for interface compatibilization in terms of their mechanical character by different chemical and physical treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312438174">7</xref></sup> One of the critical factors emerging as limitation for use of biocomposites is the increase in weight of resulting hybrid due to requirement of higher filler load, which inhibits the penetration of these kinds of biocomposites in many applications. Approximately, 90% of the total energy used by an automobile during its whole span of life is from the fuel it consumed, and reduction in weight must save the fuel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312438174">8</xref></sup> Therefore, an essential requirement to maintain the optimum property balance at desirably low filler concentration with meeting the environmental regulations has been of great concern in this area of research.</p>
<p>A comparatively new possibility is arising by obtaining the cellulose whiskers (CW) of nanodimensions from different sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312438174">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312438174">12</xref></sup> and their blending with synthetic biodegradable and nonbiodegradable polymers. The weight reduction may be assumed due to the high surface area of nanofiber, which may be required at fairly lower concentration. The cellulose chains are biochemically synthesized in microfibrils that constitute amorphous and crystalline domains. The amorphous region is susceptible to acid attack and can be removed by penetration of hydronium ions, hydrolytically cleaving glycoside bonds and releasing the nanolevel crystallites. These highly crystalline nanofibers have emerged as filler for many polymer matrixes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312438174">10</xref></sup> and their properties depend on the degree of chemical and physical treatments. The main obstacle in the use of CW is their commercial unavailability and very low yield from cellulose-rich sources with time-consuming extraction procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312438174">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present work is aimed to prepare and analyze the composites from the CW of grass, to maintain the cost, with biodegradable polymer and reinforcing them by silicate layer-filled ionomer. Ionomers are ion-containing polymer, and their composites with polyesters including polylactic acid (PLA) have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312438174">14</xref></sup> The pendent ions of ionomer may establish unique interaction inside host matrix and influence the properties at appropriate filler-level. PLA was selected as host matrix, typical linear aliphatic thermoplastic polyester, known for its high modulus, satisfying physicochemical properties, possibility of production from annually renewable resources, and degradability to carbon dioxide and water in a short period of time more easily than conventional plastics. This part of the paper is focused on the structural analysis and compatibilization extent in obtained composites of PLA and CW by monitoring the variation in functional groups, thermal behavior, crystallinity, and morphology through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively.</p></sec>

<p>The neat clay (Cloisite 20 A, d-spacing = 2.42 nm, 2θ = 3.64°) was from Southern Clay Products, Inc., United States, having density of 1.77 g/cc and modifier concentration of 95 meq/100 gm of clay. PLA of specific gravity 1.24 and melt density of 1.08–1.12 (at 230°C) was kindly donated by Natureworks LLC. Ionomer (Surlyn®) of 8320 grade was kindly donated by DuPont Co., Korea. Other chemicals were from Dae Jung Chemicals and Metals Co. Ltd, Gyonggi-do, Korea, and used after drying and purification wherever needed. Sodium chlorite was obtained from Kanto Chemical Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan, and used as received.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998312438174"><title>Extraction of CW from grass</title>
<p>The CW were obtained from grass of genus <italic>Zoysia</italic> (<italic>Z. japonica</italic> and <italic>Z. tenuifolia</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312438174">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312438174">18</xref></sup> The collected grass fibers were washed, sun–dried, followed by grinding and passing through a sieve of 45 µm. The grass powder was treated for 1 h in 2% alkali solution after alkali soaking. Bleaching was conducted by mixture of acetic buffer and chlorite solution, till the removal of colored substances from the grass. The acid hydrolysis (65% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) provides CW of nanodimension (∼10–60 nm width and 200–300 nm length) after centrifuge (3600 r/min, till the supernatant become turbid) and sonication (15 min), respectively. All treatments were conducted by mechanical stirring in two-necked flask equipped for continuous supply of inert gas to avoid extensive oxidative degradation of components. For the composite preparation, PLA and CW were mixed after solvent exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312438174">17</xref></sup> followed by sonication at 40% power output and 5 × 10% cycle for 25 min at 5, 10, and 15% CW content (weight by weight [w/w] of PLA) and kept at room temperature under continuous mechanical stirring, till the evaporation of 70% solvent. Clay was filled in ionomer by mixing at 130°C followed by addition of overnight dry powder of clay at 5% (of ionomer) filler load. Samples of the clay modified by ionomer were named as IC. The IC was filled in PLA–CW at 5% load by mixing in Laboratory Mixing Extruder F255A (ATLAS, United States). The composites (PFC) were called PFC 5, PFC 10, and PFC 15, respectively, for 5, 10, 15% filler concentration of CW. Neat samples were also prepared in similar conditions for comparative study.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of samples were recorded using the FT-IR 300E, Jasco spectrometer. The incident beam angle was 458°. At each measurement, 60 scans were acquired with a spectral resolution of 4 per centimeter. The Win First computer program, version 3.57 (Mattson Instruments), was used for acquisition and elaboration of IR spectra.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998312438174"><title>X-ray diffraction</title>
<p>The XRD pattern of samples was obtained by a Rigaku (Japan) diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation at 50 kV at the scan rate of 1°/min. The d-spacing was calculated by Bragg’s equation, where the λ was 0.154 nm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998312438174"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>The stained samples were dried under vacuum for 24 h at 50°C. These gold-coated samples were examined under electron microscope (DS-130C; Topcon) for morphological changes.</p></sec>

<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2010 operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV) was applied to monitor the extent of modification/treatment on the fiber and to measure the shape and size of fiber. One drop of the suspension of CW (0.1% w/w) was put on carbon grid and allowed to stand under vacuum for overnight at 50°C. Specimens of clay-filled composites were taken from epoxy blocks at room temperature (10–15°C) and an ultra microtome (Ultracut-1, United Kingdom) with a diamond knife was used.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec13-0021998312438174"><title>FT-IR spectroscopy</title>
<p>FT-IR is a well-established, sensitive analytical tool for the monitoring of different functional groups and specific intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. The regions of interest were 1800–1600 per centimeter for the −C=O and 3200–3600 per centimeter for the −OH vibrations. It was possible to qualitatively observe peak shifts in the composites and draw persuasive conclusions about their structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312438174">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312438174">Table 1</xref> present the characteristics spectra and peak assignment, respectively, where the significant shift in hydroxyl part toward higher frequencies (area under the peak ∼43 per centimeter) in case of treated fiber was attributed to the more number of free exposed OH groups at the surface. The peaks at 1645 and 1245 per centimeter, assigned to carboxylic acid and methyl ester groups, respectively, were highly reduced after treatment and confirm the removal of hemicellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312438174">19</xref></sup> Additionally, the vibration peaks at 1257,1425, and 1510 per centimeter for benzene ring and −C–O stretching of lignin disappeared, maybe due to the elimination of lignin from the treated fiber. The reduction of peak around 1044 cm<sup>−1</sup>, assigned for −C–O− stretching of hemicellulose, further supports the removal of hemicellulose during treatment. The FT-IR variation in composites was also studied to find out the effect of filler on the functional group variation. Shifting of hydroxyl region at higher frequency was indication of engaged hydroxyl groups of CW by hydrogen bonding with matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312438174">20</xref></sup>

<p>The expanded IR spectra of CW–IC (15% CW w/w) are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312438174">Figure 2</xref> from 1800 to 1600 per centimeter with comparison of other specimens. In samples of CW–IC, origin of a small, but detectable peak at around 1738 per centimeter in magnified graph, known for C=O of ester, may be used for the indication of esterification between cellulose and ionomer during composite preparation. Ionomer is a type of random copolymer with many pendent acid groups, a fraction of ions neutralized by metal counter ions, whereas un-neutralized acids interacts each other and form acid dimer via hydrogen bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312438174">14</xref></sup> The reaction of IC with CW may take place by the cleavage of this dimer as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312438174">Figure 3</xref>. There is a possibility of reaction between un-neutralized associated acids of ionomer with hydroxyl group of CW, giving rise to an ester peak. The FT-IR of PLA, treated fiber, and polymer filled with cellulose whiskers (PFC) 5 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312438174">Figure 4</xref> where a clear increase of area under the peak was observed in the region of ester bond vibrations. Therefore, the prepared composites appeared to be of high compatibilization than composites of PLA–clay without ionomer. This type of FT-IR variations could not be observed in PLA and cellulose composites (without IC), because it may overlap with the PLA from 1800 to 1700 per centimeter due to C=O and C–O groups. But, the equal area under the peak (1800–1700 per centimeter) of PLA and PLA–CW support the conclusion of no esterification between PLA and cellulose fibers. Thus, CW were unable to establish adhesion with host polymer matrix and this observation was in congruence with the reports of other researchers, where a grafting reaction in cellulose fiber is appropriately required in order to enhance the adhesion PLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312438174">21</xref></sup>

<p>Thus, treated fiber has more crystalline part in comparison of nontreated one, possible only after selective removal of amorphous portion during acid treatment.

<p>The silicate layers are highly ordered; consequently, give a clear peak in XRD graph from which the gallery height can be calculated. The high value of d-spacing indicates more dispersion and individualization of clay layers. If clay is totally dispersed, periodicity is no longer available, results in a flat, peak-less diffractogram. The degree of distribution of layers inside matrix play a key role for deciding the material characteristics of composites and uniformly distributed clay platelet generally associated with the improved mechanical properties of polymers. Since the highest peak or lowest gallery space is present in neat clay, the area of interest was from 2θ = 3° to 10° value.</p>
<p>XRD data collected for the different specimens for clay dispersion are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312438174">Figure 6(a)</xref> and respective diffraction angles with intergallery space (d-spacing) is tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312438174">Table 2</xref>. An increase in gallery space was observed and peak-less diffraction originated when clay was mixed with ionomer, must be due to the migration of functionalized ionomer chains inside the clay gallery. The increase in gallery height was also attributed to the matching surface energies between matrix and filler because of polarity in ionomer, leads to more dispersion of clay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312438174">23</xref></sup> The increase was highest in 5% than 10 and 15% concentration of clay and confirm that 5% concentration of ionomer was at the optimum state and chains are able to penetrate gallery space, causing separation of tactoids and individualization of many layers to make them highly dispersed. This fact was supported by TEM micrograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312438174">Figure 6(b)</xref>. The gray lines, may be representing single layer or small stacks of clay platelets, indicate a state of clay exfoliation in the matrix. Composites may be referred as highly intercalated nanocomposites with loosely preserved periodicity of silicate layers. TEM of different samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312438174">Figure 6(b)</xref> showed the individualization of silicate platelets inside matrix for PFCs where almost similar pattern for PFCs 5, 10, and 15 was observed indicating that addition of cellulose did not change the original intercalated nanocomposites structure. All composites show similar XRD signals as in clay-filled ionomer and support the TEM observations that cellulose chains or other components did not penetrate through intergallery of clays.

<p>To measure the role of ionomer during clay dispersion, a set of composites was prepared by mixing clay, ionomer, and PLA and CW together. These composites showed XRD peaks similar to neat clay, which suggest that no component was able to penetrate the clay layer in these specimens. This may be due to formation of cross-linked network by electrostatic attraction between polar and nonpolar groups of cellulose, PLA, and ionomer, which slowed down the migration of individual chains toward nanosilicate layers. The diffraction peak of clay-filled ionomer–PLA (5% IC w/w of PLA mixed together) composites exhibited distinct shift toward lower θ angle, that is, increase in gallery height, fueled the fact of PLA chains migration inside clay layers. This observation indicates that Surlyn-modified clay was more dispersible than clay without Surlyn. There is another possibility of the shifting of peak that upon repeated heating during mixing with PLA, the ionomer may undergo thermal degradation and small fragments may generate. These small fragments can be responsible for increase of clay gallery due to their easy transport inside silicate layers. To confirm this fact, a repeated mixing of IC in identical conditions was carried out and did not result in any variation in XRD. Further, the compatibilizing role of ionomer was evidenced by receiving almost the same gallery height as for the neat clay in the specimens of PLA–clay composites prepared without ionomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312438174">Figure 6(a)</xref>). The XRD data were in accordance with TEM observations where a clear difference in the nature of clay distribution was detected in (a) and (f) micrographs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312438174">Figure 6(b)</xref>, those show poor dispersion of clay platelets and intact tactoids without presence of ionomer. Thus, it was migration of PLA chains in IC–PLA composites that was responsible to increase the intergallery space and ionomer helps the dispersion of silicate layers in polymer matrix.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-0021998312438174"><title>Crystallinity of composites</title>
<p>The effect of filler content on the crystallinity of samples was monitored by inspection of XRD spectra in the region from 2θ = 10° to 40°. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312438174">Figure 7</xref> exhibited the crystallinity variation in CW-filled composites. The merging of both distinct peaks of CW except PFC 5 was observed as a hump. The broadening shows that crystallinity of system decreased with increase in CW amount. The samples of PFCs 15 and 10 showed the smearing of both peaks (2θ = 16.2° and 15.5°) with the origin of shoulder at around 2θ = 16.4° due to presence of more predominant amorphous material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312438174">24</xref></sup> In the present study, the smooth spectra of PFC 5 exhibited both peaks in diffused pattern, and it was inferred that this specimen may have slightly higher crystallinity in comparison of other samples and was explainable by chemical reaction between free acids of ionomer and hydroxyl group of CW. During the esterification reaction of cellulose with reagents, for example, anhydrides, disordered chains on the surface of crystallites are easily available for the reaction; consequently, increase in crystalline region takes place due to the removal of disordered domains as those chains with converted functionality may not contribute to the crystallinity of system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312438174">25</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig7-0021998312438174" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) of (i) PFC 15, (ii) PFC 10, and (iii) PFC 5.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312438174-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Thus, amorphous portion consumed slowly with the reaction of reagent molecules leaving behind more crystalline region. There are reports of lowering in crystallinity also during esterification reaction. It was discussed that as soon as reaction proceeds, other reagent molecules become available for reaction and this process may reopen the hydrogen-bonded ordered cellulose chains; those were contributing in the crystallinity and increase the amount of amorphous part.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312438174">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312438174">27</xref></sup> Since, the reagent, ionomer in the present case, is limited in amount, it may not further proceed the esterification reaction, and process may not occur concurrently leading to more crystallinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312438174">25</xref></sup> The cause of lower crystallinity in PFCs 10 and 15 may be high availability of OH groups those entangled each other with intermolecular and intramolecular electrostatic bonding and restrict the interaction of hydroxyl groups with other polar chains and that is why the carbonyl region of spectra of PFCs 10 and 15 were not changed significantly.</p></sec>

<p>Optical micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312438174">Figure 8</xref>) of fiber showed scattered floating strands in water with a shape like rounded-ends tube. Micrographs of alkali-soaked fiber reveal the swelling of cellulosic material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312438174">Figure 9</xref>) where a whitened and swelled upper surface indicates the penetration of sodium hydroxide in between the cementing material. This conclusion was confirmed by collecting the micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312438174">Figure 10</xref>) of 1 h alkali-treated specimens where separation of strands takes place after dissolving of interfibrillar region. The cellulose fibrils are embedded in the matrix of hemicellulose and pectin or lignin. These materials are soluble in the alkali by conversion of their carboxylic acid groups in the carboxylate anion. This is proved in FT-IR due to reduction in carbonyl region of 1600–1800 per centimeter. The SEM overview of bleached fibers of grass reveals many small fibrils entangled on the surface, and it appeared that fiber is now clean and have shining on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312438174">Figure 11</xref>).

<p>Acid hydrolysis causes the splitting of cellulose bundles in small packets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312438174">Figure 12</xref> of SEM micrographs shows that single cellulose bundle composed of many small entities appeared like arranged one above other. Thus, acid hydrolysis do not produce or individualize the microfiber to nanofiber from its close-packed system, and the separation of nanowhiskers was achieved after sonication as can be detected in TEM.

The whiskers remain as suspension in water as could be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312438174">Figure 13(a)</xref>, due to the particular alignment of nanocrystals, which may generate the phenomenon of birefringence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312438174">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312438174">12</xref></sup> The similar observations for cellulose nanowhiskers obtained from microcrystalline cellulose have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312438174">11</xref></sup> The agglomeration of fibers was observed during TEM analysis and increase in clumping of crystals with time may be due to evaporation of water and increasing tendency of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

<p>Thermal study is of paramount interest to increase the limit of biocomposite application, and it is imperative to determine the profile of degradation of any product intended to use or processed at a span of different temperature ranges. The degradation in cellulose is found due to the evaluation of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, acetic, and formic acids after decomposition of different cementing material in the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312438174">28</xref></sup> The temperature of 50% weight loss of different components under study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312438174">Figure 15</xref>. The CW showed a degradation pattern start at 120°C with moisture loss. Untreated fiber composed of different matrixes and showed the first loss of mass at 110°C, must be due to absorption of water molecules.
<fig id="fig15-0021998312438174" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>Temperature of different material and composites at which 50% weight loss occurred.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312438174-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The increased temperature of moisture loss in CW is an indication of high degree of hydrogen bonding between cellulose fiber and water due to increase in number of exposed hydroxyl groups on the surface of fiber. The CW underwent higher weight loss earlier than untreated fiber. The lower thermal stability of cellulose nanocrystals maybe caused by easy degradation of end chains, and decomposed at lower temperature as has been observed in earlier reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312438174">29</xref></sup> The degradation pattern of PLA exhibited the stability in the region of 200°C, whereas it loses 50% weight at 270°C.</p>
<p>The silicate layers are believed to increase the thermal stability of polymer matrices. The ablative reassembling of the silicate layers may occur on the surface of the nanocomposites, creating a physical protective barrier and may cause the delay in volatilization by labyrinth effect. The thermal stability of PLA–IC did not changed significantly in comparison of unfilled PLA in the present composites. Chang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998312438174">30</xref></sup> have also observed a decrease in initial thermal stability of PLA–clay nanocomposites; whereas, the real mechanism is unknown to understand this behavior of PLA-based nanocomposites. The present composites showed the linear decrease in thermal stability with increase in cellulose content and there were no significant difference between PLA and its composites with ionomer-modified clay. The increase in content of CW and the sonication in current case may generate the small fragments that are degraded more easily than bulk chains. Further, esterification of cellulose fibers may also reduce the thermal resistance. The esterification with different anhydrides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312438174">28</xref></sup> causes the decrease in thermal resistance due to the partial degradation of ester linkages, whereas the fatty acids, acrylonitrile, and methyl methacrylate were found to have inverse effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998312438174">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998312438174">32</xref></sup> Moreover, in the present context, it is sentient that thermal properties of composites were directly related to concentration of cellulose part in the system, and composites were stable around 190–200°C that may be considered as safe temperature for processing.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec19-0021998312438174" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The reinforced composites of biodegradable polymer matrix with CW were prepared and analysis of their structure was carried out. The approach was to balance extraction cost of whiskers through one of the cheapest source, that is, grass and accelerate the adhesion between matrices through clay-filled ionomer. The acid hydrolysis generates microfibrils after removal of amorphous region, which were separated into nanofibrils by mechanical treatment through sonication. The tentative compatibilization of CW and clay-filled ionomer through esterification reaction was observed due to the tendency to react through electrostatic bonding between two polar groups; those may be responsible to increase the adhesion of filler and matrices. All composites exhibited a peak-less diffraction during X-ray analysis, and it was indication of more dispersion of silicate layers as could be evidenced by transmission electron spectroscopy. The results showed that the dispersion of clay in host matrix was enhanced in the presence of ionomer. Thus, in general, ionomer may have dual advantage not only by providing nano-sized reinforcement but also by increasing the interaction. The crystallinity of resulting composites was found to be decreased in comparison of natural filler and host matrix. CW were less thermally stable than macrofibers of grass because of easy degradation of amorphous, unordered free chain ends on the surface of crystalline part. Thermal stability of composites decreased linearly with increasing amount of whiskers, which was attributed to the low thermal stability of CW.</p></sec>
