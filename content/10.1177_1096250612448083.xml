<p>As more and more young children with disabilities participate in everyday routines, activities, and places, it becomes increasingly important to focus on the preparation of the early childhood teachers who will be supporting them in inclusive settings. This column highlights recent reports on how well programs are doing at preparing early childhood teachers for those and other important roles. We hope these resources will inspire you to think about whether these teachers are being prepared to support each young learner in your community or state. What can you do to increase the emphasis on supporting the full participation of children with and without disabilities in preservice preparation programs?</p>

<title>Degrees in Context: Asking the Right Questions About Preparing Skilled and Effective Teachers of Young Children</title>
<p>The Center for the Study of Child Care Employment and the National Institute for Early Education Research jointly published this policy brief, in which the authors argue that too much attention has been given to debating the baseline qualifications required of preschool teachers—AA versus BA. They contend that it is just as necessary to take into account the nature of the education teachers receive en route to a degree, supports for ongoing learning, and the effects of the workplace environment on teaching practice.</p>

<title>Preparing General Educators to Improve Outcomes for Students With Disabilities</title>
<p>General education teachers consistently report that they do not have the skills they need to effectively instruct diverse learners, including students with disabilities. This 32-page report was prepared for the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and the National Center on Learning Disabilities (NCLD) to highlight that “improving the skills of general education teachers is a lynchpin to improving outcomes for students with disabilities.”</p>

<title>Preparing Early Childhood Teachers to Successfully Educate All Children</title>
<p>Researchers from the Erikson Institute report that state-based teacher preparation standards and teacher education programs do not adequately address the developmental and educational needs of children who are culturally, linguistically, and ability diverse.</p>

<title>Getting In Sync: Revamping Licensure and Preparation for Teachers in Pre-K, Kindergarten, and the Early Grades</title>
<p>In this report, authors highlight problems nationwide with the licensing and preparation of teachers who work with young children in pre-K, kindergarten, first-, second- and third-grade classrooms. The authors underscore ways in which pre-K- to 3rd-grade teachers are not well prepared about the science of early childhood development (including a focus on social-emotional growth), family engagement, or specific topics such as early science, early literacy, and the building blocks of mathematics.</p>

<title>Building a High-Quality Teaching Profession: Lessons From Around the World</title>
<p>In this report from the International Summit on the Teaching Profession, authors share findings from research and discussion of four aspects of teacher preparation: (a) how teachers are recruited into the profession and trained initially, (b) how teachers are developed and supported, (c) how teachers are evaluated and compensated, and (d) how teachers are engaged in reform. One key finding highlighted in the report is how the four aspects of teacher preparation are interrelated.</p>
