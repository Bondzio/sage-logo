<p>T<sc>he book of</sc> J<sc>eremiah</sc>, <sc>written</sc> in view of the horrendous disaster inflicted by the Babylonian armies, reflects the intense physical and emotional devastation suffered by the people of Judah, by the prophet himself, and by God. Over the course of the last generation, research in Jeremiah has increasingly drawn on recent trauma and disaster studies to understand this pain that is so much on display in this prophetic book. Kathleen O’Connor is a sure and steady guide to this literature as she moves through the Jeremiah texts to probe the “pain and promise” of the book. At the same time, the personal dimension of her interaction with these difficult texts comes through in a compelling way, not least in her teaching experience and her growing interest in “how the book addressed its readers as survivors of traumatic and disastrous historical events” (p. 2). Indeed, O’Connor says, “Trauma and disaster studies save the book of Jeremiah for me” (p. 137); they “have turned me from a somewhat ambivalent reader into Jeremiah’s enthusiastic defender and promoter in our disaster-afflicted world” (p. 19).</p>
<p>The preface and epilogue gather key themes. Jeremiah is “a work of resilience, a book of massive theological reinvention, and a kind of survival manual for a destroyed society” (p. x). “Every poem, story, and sermon in it addresses the disaster in some way, either to predict it, offer ways to cope with it, or instill hope for living through it” (p. 135). Jeremiah is
<disp-quote>
<p>survival literature. In the face of cascading needs of the destroyed nation, Jeremiah is a moral act, a healing therapy, a redeeming lifeline to survival. . . . It helps survivors to reach out beyond “embeddedness” in their overwhelmed state and to create meaning from the ashes.” (p. 136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The opening chapter includes four imaginative “little stories of families” (p. 8) that “suggest the contexts out of which arose the searing power of Jeremiah’s words” (p. 12). This portrayal is followed by a brief survey of the destructive events that gave birth to Jeremiah (and other literature). Chapter 2 is a closer look at trauma and disaster studies that help “explain why so much of the book depicts brutal scenes, portrays a punishing, violent God, and overflows with suffering and weeping” (p. 19). Such studies “help name the injuries, point to processes of survival, and set societies onto some new form of life” (p. 27). Chapter 3 examines literary issues. O’Connor seeks, not “to figure out how the book came to be,” but what the book might have meant to the survivors of the Babylonian disaster: “I want to ask how the book helps them survive. Its literary confusion contributes to that survival” (p. 30). Jeremiah’s “chaotic over-abundance, its ‘too-muchness,’ its very disorder itself turns the book into a helpful text for survivors of disaster” (p. 31). Jeremiah “names their wretched world and gives it meaning,” providing “words for wounds beyond speaking, and offers hope” for rebuilding (p. 31).</p>
<p>After these introductory chapters, O’Connor divides her study into eight sections, each of which moves through several chapters of Jeremiah. She seeks to “show how the various parts of the book of Jeremiah invent language to contribute to the healing process” (p. 34). I use her compelling language in these descriptions:</p>
<list id="list1-0020964312473070" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“A Family Comes Undone: The Metaphor of a Broken Family” (2:1–4:4). This metaphor “turns readers into voyeurs who watch a messed-up couple and their children interact and fail to connect with each other” (p. 35). This language “finds words for the disaster, simplifies its causes, creates a miniature version of a monstrous reality, and thins it down to approachable segments of pain” (p. 42).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Fragmented Memories of Trauma: The War Poems” (4:5–6:30; 8:16–17; 10:17–22; 13:20–27). Jeremiah’s “poems about warfare remember, express, and reframe the nation’s collective, violent past” (p. 48). A language is created “to name what has happened, to give it shape, and to revisit it emotionally and spiritually. . . . Perhaps they can begin to face their suffering” (p. 57).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“If Only Tears Were Possible: The Weeping Poems” (8:22–9:11). “Israel’s own mourning customs help people face death, express grief, and then begin to come back to life” (p. 61). God also mourns. O’Connor speaks forthrightly about a “startlingly vulnerable depiction of the deity” (p. 64) and a “portrait of the weeping God” (p. 65). It is good to see that O’Connor joins the ranks of those of us who have spoken of the suffering God of the Old Testament.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Telling a Life: Biographical Stories” (1; 16:1–9; 20:1–6; 26; 32; 37:11–38:13; 40–43). O’Connor shows how pain and suffering dominate Jeremiah’s life: “He is an anguished man, a kind of anti-hero, wounded, isolated and broken like the people of Judah in the grip of catastrophe” (p. 69). “His life illuminates the disaster, embodies it, and signifies survival beyond it” (p. 71).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Survive by Praying: The Confessions” (11:18–12:6; 15:1–21; 17:14–18; 18:18–23; 20:7–13, 14–18). These “confessions” are revealing of “God-resisting” laments, “attacks on God” that reveal Jeremiah’s “faltering faith” and indicate how “trustless his relationship with God has become” (p. 87). They provide language for disaster victims, enabling unspeakable suffering to be brought into the light and “turn divine justice into a question.” “Perhaps God has failed” (p. 91).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Encoding Catastrophe: The Sermons” (7:1–8:3; 11:1–14; 17:19–27). These sermons “explain the nation’s fall with confidence [sinful worship], teach lessons aggressively, and restrict their content to a few basic themes” (p. 94). They are a “public defense of God. . . . God is not to blame for the disaster” (pp. 98–99).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Rekindling Hope: The Little Book of Consolation” (30–31). The “new covenant is not radically new; it is the old covenant reasserted, reaffirmed, re-inaugurated.” The newness is to be seen in its “manner of speaking about it as a deeper, more intimate, more egalitarian union” (p. 111). The relatively minor role given to forgiveness is somewhat surprising.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Running Out of Strength: Endings” (45; 50–51; 52). The inclusion of three endings to the book of Jeremiah is a literary act of “refusing closure . . . continuing the work of survival” (p. 115). Justice in these oracles is “retaliation in kind”; at the same time, the “poetry of revenge can heal” (p. 119). The end of the book leaves the effects of the disaster unfinished, honoring the long process of recovery.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A final chapter is entitled “Confusion as Meaning-Making: The Composition of the Book.” O’Connor briefly explores theories of composition, but “Jeremiah’s literary disorder is central to its purpose. . . . Jeremiah’s bewildering shape reflects the massive disorder that produced the book in the first place” (p. 126). Especially noted is the “messy date-line” that “conveys the interruption of time that accompanies trauma and disaster” (p. 132). Readers must “become meaning-makers themselves as they try to make sense of the literature” (p. 126). At the same time, O’Connor seems to take away some of her point by ending this chapter with claims about the predictable character of the disaster. The language of divine “control” enters the picture; God “controls time” (p. 133). It is almost as if what people do and say is irrelevant; God has everything all determined in advance.</p>
<p>This claim about God raises issues about God elsewhere in the book. For example, God “is in control of the overwhelming events of history” (p. 42) and “God controls events” (p. 44). What does “control” mean in such a context? Given the reports of God’s anguish and how unruly everyone is, would it not be more accurate to score God a crashing management failure? Given that Jeremiah often blames the people for what has happened, how can God be “in control”? Given these disastrous events, it is difficult to see how such a claim helps “to defend God” (p. 42).</p>
<p>O’Connor concludes that at the heart of Jeremiah is “resilient confidence in God, defense of God—blazing, angry, emotional, muted, weeping, furious, and always yearning for the beloved. Jeremiah’s God desires love, gives love, brings new life, and reconceives the nations. . . . Jeremiah’s angry, raping, punishing God is healing because this violent theology keeps God alive in the midst of disaster.” Above all, “what drives this God is relentless, passionate desire for relationship with the people. . . . Jeremiah’s God is a living God” (p. 137). I agree that the language of relationship is key to understanding the God of Jeremiah, but the repeated language of divine “control” compromises the language of relationship and makes one wonder how “living” this God really is.</p>
<p>O’Connor has written a very thoughtful exploration of the disaster/trauma themes in Jeremiah. It will certainly prove to be an insightful book for college and seminary classes, indeed for anyone seeking to “get inside” this prophetic gem.</p>
