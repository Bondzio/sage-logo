<sec id="section1-1071100712473740">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes following operative treatment of nonunited rotational distal fibula and medial malleolar ankle fractures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712473740">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seventeen patients were identified as having a nonunion of a rotational ankle fracture. All patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and functionally with the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire. They were divided into lateral and medial malleolus groups and compared with 44 patients following a nonoperative (SE2/3) ankle fracture and 25 patients who underwent operative fixation of their SE4 ankle fracture for functional comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712473740">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Two of the 17 patients were excluded. The patients in the medial malleolar group were notably older than those in the other groups. Nonunions included 12 distal fibulas and 3 medial malleoli. All patients were treated with open reduction with plate and screw fixation or screw fixation alone. Adjunctive grafting was performed in all but 2 cases. The average time to healing was 5.2 months post surgery. At latest follow-up, mean 33.9 months, all nonunions had resolved. Standardized SMFA scores differed notably among the groups in the Bothersome, Emotional, and Mobility categories. There was no difference between lateral malleolar nonunion patients and surgically treated SE4 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712473740">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Reports of nonunions of fractures of lateral and medial malleoli have been rarely reported. Operative treatment of these nonunions in this study led to reliable bony healing. Patients who underwent surgery for these nonunions ultimately had similar outcomes and range of motion compared with patients who underwent operative treatment for acute ankle fractures.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the literature, nonunion following rotationally induced distal fibula and tibia malleolar ankle fractures is infrequently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712473740">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712473740">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712473740">6</xref></sup> Little has been written about this topic in the literature, and no studies exist comparing the outcomes of nonunion patients with the outcomes of patients who have had normal healing following their distal fibula and medial malleolar ankle fractures.</p>
<p>The pathophysiological features of fracture nonunions are well known. Fracture healing depends on blood supply and stability of the fracture ends. Therefore, excess motion at the fracture site due to no or poor reduction and fixation, a large interfragmentary gap, and loss of blood supply due to periosteal stripping contribute to the formation of nonunions. Other factors such as infection, obesity, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, and advanced age may also contribute to the development of fracture nonunions. There is little recent information available regarding the influence of these factors specifically on the development of fracture nonunion about the ankle mortise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712473740">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712473740">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712473740">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712473740">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712473740">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to report outcomes in patients who were treated surgically for a nonunion following a rotational ankle fracture and to compare this cohort with other patients who had successful healing following an acute rotational ankle fracture.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Between September 2004 and January 2011, 251 patients who presented with a fracture nonunion at a single institution were followed in an institutional review board–approved prospective database. Inclusion criteria included the presence of asymptomatic fracture nonunion, age greater than 18 years, and willingness and ability to cognitively participate in the study. Patient consent was obtained, and hospital, radiographic, range of motion, and clinical data were collected. Seventeen patients (6.8%) were identified as having a nonunion of a rotational ankle fracture involving either the medial malleolus or distal fibula or both (group 1A, distal fibula; group 1B, medial malleolus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712473740">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1071100712473740-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The diagnosis of nonunion was made based on the radiographic appearance of absence of bony bridging in the face of continued pain with weight-bearing, obvious hardware failure, persistence of fracture line with no radiographic progression to healing following several months of follow-up, or confirmation with computed tomography scan after a minimum of 6 months from the fracture in patients treated nonoperatively initially or after the index surgery in patients initially treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Two patients were not treated with a repair: 1 patient elected to be treated without surgery, and the second patient was treated with an ankle fusion due to the presence of advanced degenerative changes. These 2 patients were excluded. Operative repair was indicated if patients had radiographic evidence of nonunion, pain, and reduced function. A single surgeon (K.A.E.) was involved in all operative treatments. All patients had debridement with curettage and removal of fibrous tissue of the nonunion site, followed by fixation. If flat bony surfaces were present, a lag screw for compression was used. If a gap was present, it was bridge-plated and grafted. Twelve patients (80%) underwent plate and screw fixation along with some type of grafting based on surgeon and patient preference, 1 patient underwent plate and screw fixation alone with no grafting, 1 patient with a nonunion of the medial malleolus underwent screw fixation alone with grafting, and 1 patient underwent excision of the medial malleolar fragment. All patients were followed radiographically until they were healed. A nonunion was considered healed when remodeled callus was present in at least 3 of 4 cortices on radiographic imaging (determined by the operating surgeon in consultation with a musculoskeletal radiologist) and patients reported painless weight-bearing. Intraoperative cultures were obtained in 14 of the 15 patients (93%). None of the 15 patients were suspected to have an infection based on clinical presentation and laboratory investigation. This was confirmed with the presence of negative intraoperative deep tissue cultures. All patients underwent similar postoperative protocol, including application of a plaster splint and then fracture brace (CAM boot) and non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks, followed by progression to full weight-bearing as tolerated.</p>
<p>To gauge patient outcomes, we compared this cohort with 2 other groups of patients who had sustained acute ankle fractures and were treated either with surgery or without. Forty-four patients who were treated for a nonoperative (SE2/3) ankle fracture (group 2) and 25 patients who had undergone operative fixation of their unstable ankle fracture (SE4) (group 3) with adequate follow-up were identified from a prospective trauma database. The inclusion criteria for group 2 included patient age between 18 and 85 years and presentation of distal fibula fractures that did not need operative treatment. The inclusion criteria for group 3 was patient age between 18 to 85 years, soft tissue status amenable to operative treatment, closed unstable supination eversion type Weber B fibula fracture, ability to follow up for 1 year, and consent for operative treatment of the fracture. These groups were used for comparison in functional and range of ankle motion outcomes. Patients in all 4 groups were evaluated at regular follow-up appointments by the same surgeon, and the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire was administered at 3, 6, and 12 months post operatively. Patients in groups 1A, 1B, and 2 were also called for additional SMFA follow-up after the 12-month postoperative period. Standardized SMFA scores were used to compare the groups. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test, 1-way analysis of variance, Fisher’s exact test, and Tukey’s test using PASW Statistics 18, Release Version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 4 males and 8 females in group 1A; they had an average age of 43 years (range, 23-63 years). There were 2 females and 1 male in group 1B, with an average age of 69 years (range, 64-75 years). The average age of group 2 was 44 years (range, 19-90 years) and of group 3 was 41 years (range, 19-71 years). With the numbers available, the patients in group 1B were notably older than the other groups (<italic>P</italic> = .038), but there was no difference in gender makeup between the 4 groups. The average body mass index (BMI) of the patients with a fibula nonunion was 30.8, of those with medial malleolar nonunion 28.3, and of those with SE4 30.4 (<italic>P</italic> = .85) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712473740">Table 1</xref>). Ten nonunion patients (67%) and 21 SE4 patients (84%) had a BMI classified as overweight or obese. BMI data were not kept for the SE2/3 group; therefore, no comparison could be made. Nonunion sites included 12 distal fibulas (80%) and 2 medial malleoli (20%). There were 7 right ankles and 8 left ankles. Ten of the nonunions (67%) were classified as atrophic, 3 as oligotrophic (20%), and 2 as hypertrophic (13%). Eight (53%) of the initial fractures were classified as SE4, 1 (8.1%) as SE2, and 4 as pronation-abduction (27%). The initial fracture pattern for 2 patients was unknown (13%). The mechanism of injury was a low-velocity fall in all 15 patients.</p>

<p>Of the nonunion patients, 9 had undergone previous surgery whereas 6 were treated nonoperatively before developing nonunion. The average time from initial injury to nonunion surgery at our institution was 9.5 months (range, 4-14.3 months). Operative treatment of the nonunions included 12 patients (80%) who underwent open reduction with plate and screw fixation and grafting, 1 patient who underwent open reduction with screw fixation only and grafting, 1 patient who was treated with open reduction with plate and screw fixation without grafting, and another who underwent excision of the medial malleolar fragment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712473740">Table 2</xref>). The average length of hospital stay was 3.2 days.</p>

<p>No patients in group 1 were lost to follow-up. The average time to healing was 5.2 months post surgery (range, 3-10.5 months). The average time to union for patients in group 1A was 4.4 months (range, 3-7 months) and for group 1B was 6.5 months (range, 3-10.5 months) (<italic>P</italic> = .136). At latest follow-up, mean 33.9 months (range, 6-86 months), all nonunions aside from the medial malleolar excision had healed. The union time for the patient with plating and no grafting was 6 months, as was the union time for the patient who had only screw fixation and grafting. The average time to union for the 2 patients with diabetes mellitus was 5 months and for the 1 smoker in the study 5.5 months. The average time to union for patients with a BMI category of obese (≥30) was 5.4 months, with a BMI category of overweight (25-29.9) was 4.8 months, and with normal BMI (18.5-24.9) was 3.5 months. The sample size of the smokers and diabetic patients was too small to make valid comparisons regarding union time. With the numbers available, there was no statistical significance in union time between the obese patients compared with the overweight and normal weight patients.</p>
<p>Range of ankle motion data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712473740">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1071100712473740">4</xref>. The average plantar flexion for the fibular nonunion patients was 27.5 degrees and for the medial malleolar patients was 33.3 degrees (<italic>P</italic> = .46). The average dorsiflexion for the fibular nonunion patients was 16.5 degrees and for the medial malleolar patients was 16.7 degrees (<italic>P</italic> = .94). There were notable differences in range of motion between the nonunion patients and the SE2 and SE4 patients. The latest physical examination follow-up time for group 1A was 21.8 months, for group 1B 20.7 months, for the SE2 patients 5.5 months, and for the SE4 patients 10.6 months. These differences were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 for all). However, the time to latest follow-up was not significant between groups 1A and 1B.</p>

<p>There were no differences in SMFA scores between the 2 nonunion groups. Standardized SMFA scores in group 1A patients were comparable with those of the SE2 group in the Functional category (16.4 vs 9.3, <italic>P</italic> = .39) and Daily category (19.2 vs 6.8, <italic>P</italic> = .17) but were worse in Bothersome (17.9 vs 4.6, <italic>P</italic> = .014), Mobility (21.8 vs 6.76, <italic>P</italic> = .046), and Emotional (19.3 vs 4.14, <italic>P</italic> = .018) categories. There was no difference in SMFA scores between the medial malleolar nonunion patients and any other group or between the fibular nonunion patients and SE4 patients. The average latest follow-up time for group 2 was 10 months (range, 6-24 months) and for group 3 was 10.3 months (range, 6-12 months). These differed notably from the follow-up for group 1 patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712473740">Tables 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1071100712473740">7</xref>).</p>

<p>All intraoperative cultures were negative. Postoperatively, 2 nonunion patients developed wound infections, 1 superficial and 1 deep, the latter of which required multiple irrigation and debridement surgeries along with negative pressure wound therapy (V.A.C. Kinetic Concepts, Inc, San Antonio, TX). Two patients underwent elective removal of painful hardware 1 year and 3 years, respectively, after the nonunion surgery. Both the patients with the wound infections and the patients who underwent removal of hardware had distal fibula nonunions. None of the patients with medial malleolar nonunions developed infections or underwent removal of hardware. One patient in the SE4 group developed a wound infection and underwent subsequent removal of hardware. These differences were not significant (<italic>P</italic> = .37 for both).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1071100712473740" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Malleolar nonunions accounted for only 17 of 251 (7%) of all nonunions treated at our institution during the 7 years of the study. Although we don’t know the number of initial fractures that led to these 17 nonunions, we believe that malleolar nonunions are relatively uncommon, which supports the low rate reported in previous studies. The fact that malleolar fracture nonunions are underreported may lead treating physicians to falsely believe that the condition is more rare than it actually is. This series is the largest to date reporting outcomes of patients with these injuries.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of literature about fracture nonunions, but the literature is very limited on the topic of unhealed ankle fractures. To our knowledge, the report by Walsh and DiGiovanni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712473740">14</xref></sup> on distal fibula nonunions and the recent report by Donken et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712473740">5</xref></sup> on nonunions in stable Weber B ankle fractures are the only studies of this kind published in the last 20 years. Walsh and DiGiovanni’s study was limited to patients who developed nonunion of the fibula after closed rotational ankle fractures. Our study includes nonunions of both the medial and lateral malleoli and does not exclude patients who initially underwent open reduction and internal fixation for their rotational ankle fracture. Donken et al evaluated the cause of nonunion in stable Weber B ankle fractures and concluded that the severity of the initial injury in these patients is often underestimated. The result of this misdiagnosis is that patients are inappropriately treated nonoperatively for an SE-IV type fracture. In our study, 10 of the 15 patients were known to have an initial SE-IV fracture pattern, so this misdiagnosis was likely not an issue.</p>
<p>Operative treatment of nonunions about the ankle leads to reliable healing rates, which mirrors other nonunion treatment data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712473740">13</xref></sup> The current study suggests that patients who underwent surgery for nonunion of their fractures ultimately had similar functional outcome scores and range of motion as patients who underwent operative treatment for an acute ankle fracture, although average follow-up times differed. However, neither group appeared to fare as well as patients who sustained more minor ankle fracture patterns. Because the sample size of the medial malleolar patients was very small, it is possible that outcomes for this set of patients may be notable, although no significance was found in our study. Additionally, patients who had distal fibular nonunions appeared to have functional and clinical outcomes similar to those of patients who had medial malleolar nonunions.</p>
<p>Our numbers were too small to make any meaningful conclusions regarding risk factors for the development of these injuries. We observed a low rate of associated risk factors for fracture nonunion in our study, supporting what Walsh and DiGiovanni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712473740">14</xref></sup> observed in their cohort. In our study, 4 patients had 2 or more risk factors for nonunion, but 4 others had no risk factors. Although almost half of our nonunion patients were obese, BMI was not associated with a delayed union time following treatment of these nonunions, in contrast to some literature that reports an association in ankle fractures. Wukich et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712473740">15</xref></sup> compared outcomes of ankle fractures in patients with complicated versus uncomplicated diabetes and found that 2 patients with complicated diabetes developed asymptomatic nonunions that required no further treatment. The sample size of diabetic patients and smokers in our study was too small to determine significance with regard to union time.</p>
<p>Proposed causes of medial malleolar nonunions include soft tissue transposition between the fracture and the tibial shaft, more specifically from the tibialis posterior tendon and/or deltoid ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712473740">3</xref></sup> Other possible factors include blood supply to the fragment, effects of the synovial lining on fracture hematoma, meager osteogenic activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712473740">11</xref></sup> and defective reduction or defective fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712473740">10</xref></sup> The causes of medial malleolus nonunion in our study could be due to any of these factors. However, 2 of the 3 patients were treated nonoperatively after their initial injury, so it is likely that defective reduction caused nonunions in these patients. King et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712473740">9</xref></sup> studied the outcomes of bicortical fixation of medial malleolar fractures. Of the 23 patients in the study, only 1 patient developed a nonunion. This patient had chronic kidney disease, neuropathy, and peripheral arterial disease, all of which play a role in bone healing. All of our medial malleolar patients healed after surgery for their nonunion, but none of them had undergone screw fixation prior to developing a nonunion.</p>
<p>The patients in the medial malleolar group were notably older than the patients in the distal fibula group, and this may have been due to several reasons. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nonunion simply because of old age, malnutrition, and anticoagulant use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712473740">13</xref></sup> They may also develop painless nonunions that do not require operative intervention, and it is possible that this happened to patients in this age group with distal fibula nonunions and thus they did not qualify for our study.</p>
<p>There were no confirmed infected nonunions in our study. Although it is possible that the 2 patients with postoperative infections represented “missed” infected nonunions, this cannot be confirmed, so the conclusions of this study apply only to aseptic nonunions of the malleoli. Furthermore, the low number of diabetic patients in this study may represent a selection bias based on referral patterns at our institution, and thus our conclusions may not apply to the diabetic population either.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study include our 100% follow-up rate of the nonunion patients, the retrospective review of the prospectively collected data, and the review of medial and lateral malleolar nonunions separately. There was also no variation in operative skill and technique, as a single experienced surgeon was involved in all the surgeries. Additionally, our study included 2 control groups and thus a means of comparing and evaluating outcomes. The greatest limitation of this study is its small sample size; however, this is the largest series examining ankle nonunions to date, which reflects the very low incidence of this fracture complication. Additionally, we were unable to determine the exact rate of malleolar nonunion in our study population. Another limitation may be the notable difference in latest follow-up times between the 4 groups, although if the patients in group 2 and 3 were doing well clinically at 10 months postoperatively, it may be assumed that they would still be functioning as well 3 years after surgery.</p>

<sec id="section8-1071100712473740" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that operative treatment of aseptic nonunions about the ankle following rotational injury leads to reliable healing rates with minimal complications. Patients with distal fibular nonunions can expect functional outcomes and range of motion comparable to those of patients who have had normal healing after undergoing surgery for a rotational ankle fracture. The sample size of our medial malleolar group was too small to determine statistical significance. Patients with malleolar nonunions should be prepared for a more difficult recovery and reduced functionality compared with those patients who undergo successful healing of a low-energy rotational ankle fracture that does not require operative intervention.</p>
