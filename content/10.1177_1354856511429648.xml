<abstract>
<p>This study takes a journalistic professional approach to examine integration patterns of interactive features in news media websites. It draws from two aspects of journalistic work – the relationship with audiences and medium-related practices. Consequently, two frameworks are proposed for categorizing interactive features: the first is based on the relationships news media allow their audiences to have with news content – consuming content, influencing content, or passing it beyond the news site; the second is based on the characteristics of features – textual or visual. Findings from 100 news organizations show that, overall, news media preferred applying features that allow users to interact with content, but without the ability to influence it. In addition, the use of features was tightly related to the technology associated with a news organization; newspapers’ websites were more likely to use text-based features and vice versa.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856511429648">Bardoel (1996</xref>: 283) suggested ‘… the traditional task of journalism will shift from collecting information to directing the social flow of information and public debate.’ The internet allows news organizations to overcome major drawbacks of traditional media, including the primarily one-way flow of information of news and views from media to audiences and technological restrictions of space and time. Integrating new technologies and applications, new media can serve the news media’s social role of providing information on a wide range of issues, and from a variety of perspectives. News media can now present information in new ways, giving visitors more control to personalize their news consumption. They can also open their websites to contributions from users, including via blogs and video or discussion forums, and can allow information to disseminate in new ways, such as via social networking sites and emailing articles.</p>
<p>Studies examining how news media use their websites are often descriptive and draw from literature on human–computer interaction to classify interactive features based on their technical characteristics (for instance: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856511429648">Greer and Mensing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856511429648">Quandt, 2008</xref>). Literature indicates that news media are often slow to take advantage of the potential of the internet and selective in the types of interactive features they use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354856511429648">Oblak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856511429648">Quandt, 2008</xref>), but suggests only broad, often economic explanations for these trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511429648">Allan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856511429648">Carlson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856511429648">McManus, 1994</xref>). Current literature, then, focuses on the technical aspects of user–computer interactions on news sites and rarely attempts to explain the selective use of features.</p>
<p>This study examines the media’s adoption of interactive features. Drawing from the literature review, this study suggests professional explanations for the selective and slow adoption of these features. Many features available for news organizations to use on their websites, such as user blogs and discussion boards, break the historical one-way communication flow, as they allow audiences to influence content presented on the site. Such features can conflict with journalistic normative, professional, social, and economic positions, particularly the interest for exclusivity and credibility. Other features, such as multimedia options and emailing a story to a friend, are less likely to pose such a professional conflict. We propose then to examine the use of interactive features based on the relationships they allow users to have with content on the site — content consumption, content influence, and content forwarding features. Furthermore, considering the convergence of technologies the internet allows for, this study also proposes examining whether news organizations break their traditional medium-bounded professional practices, by categorizing features based on their textual versus visual characteristics. Taking a professional approach, this study aims to add an explanatory-professional dimension to the literature about news media and the internet.</p>
<p>This study draws from the websites of 100 news organizations from 30 countries to examine to what extent news media take advantage of the internet to break certain traditional practices and norms, which the New York Times’ editors suggest is needed for a successful transformation into the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856511429648">Keller and Nisenholtz, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>With the decline of readership and revenue and the growth of internet use for news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856511429648">Pew, 2010</xref>), media organizations are increasingly looking to their websites to retain existing audiences and attract new ones. The internet provides news media with new tools to interact with users. Audiences now have control over presented content, can post content, and can send articles to friends and their own social media sites’ profiles. From a journalistic perspective, though, changing the relationship between media and audiences can potentially be perceived as a threat to traditional norms and practices. This study proposes examining the decision of which interactive features to use on news sites as a professional-normative one. We start by reviewing literature about the use of interactive features by news media. Then, scholarship about journalism and professionalism is examined and potential conflicts with the range of ways news media can use the web are identified. Synthesizing the literature on news media and the internet from a professional perspective, we then draw research hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section2-1354856511429648">
<title>Interactive features on news websites</title>
<p>‘The new journalism must be a journalism of partnership,’ between news media and audiences, suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354856511429648">Skoler (2009</xref>: 40). The literature on the use of interactive features on news websites goes almost as far as the scholarship on interactivity itself. A common thread, even if implicit, is the categorization of features based on the type of relationships users can have with journalists and content on news websites. Specifically, two types of features were identified: features that allow users to control the presentation of news content, but without the ability influence it; and features that allow users to contribute content to a news site or influence it in ways that are visible to others (see as early as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354856511429648">Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856511429648">Chan-Olmstead and Park, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856511429648">Massey and Levy (1999)</xref> suggested four dimensions of media production websites. Two are based on one-way flow of information between news media and their audiences: complexity of choice available and responsiveness of technology to the user. The other two dimensions are based on multi-way information flow on the site: the ease of adding information; and facilitation of interpersonal communication on the site. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856511429648">Paulussen (2004)</xref>, examining Flemish journalists, suggested a similar categorization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856511429648">Greer and Mensing (2004)</xref> suggested a dichotomy of features of multimedia elements that provide the opportunity to interact with existing content on a website, and interactive features that allow email, discussion forums, letters to the editor, and individually-customized news. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856511429648">Quandt's (2008)</xref> categorization consisted of multimedia content, interaction options, and links such as those to related stories and external hyperlinks. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856511429648">Chung (2008)</xref>, using factor analysis, identified the following features' factors: human–medium interactivity such as user submission of stories, photos, news tips, emailing reporters, and sending letters to the editor; medium–human interactivity such as customized content, search features, and email updates and alerts; human–human features such as message boards and chat functions; and medium features such as audio and video files. She found certain features – especially human–human features and those that allow consumers to express their opinions – to be lacking.</p>
<p>Social networking features are a recent addition to news media’s choices that can be fully integrated into their sites. The Huffington Post is one success story for such integration, approaching the top five newspapers in terms of readership. According to the Associate Press, the online newspaper has integrated itself with social networks, partnering with Facebook and Twitter, and is using content from about 6000 bloggers, who are writing for free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856511429648">Coyle, 2010</xref>). SNS can form partnerships with news sites. For example, in 2007, ABC News and Facebook established a partnership that allowed Facebook members to follow ABC reporters, view reports and videos, and participate in polls and debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856511429648">Stelter, 2007</xref>). News media can create accounts on SNS, such as Twitter or Facebook, and use these spaces to disseminate their headlines, often accompanied by links to the original articles on the organizations’ websites. According to a recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856511429648">Bivings Group survey (2009)</xref>, of the top 100 US newspapers, 62 percent included links to at least one of their Twitter accounts. Probably the easiest and least expensive way, though, is to use SNS to allow users to share articles with their friends. Including a sharing feature is free and requires no extra effort from a news organization or its employees.</p>
<p>The use of social networking sites as part of a news site, then, is primarily related to the features that allow users to share stories with friends, by tagging a story or link to it from their social networking pages. This type of user interaction with news content is different from the categories described earlier. Although sharing a story is more than simply consuming news, it does not open a two-way information flow with a media organization, as it cannot influence the content presented on the site. A third category of interactive features, then, is forwarding news stories. Via SNS, stories or parts of them are reposted on individuals’ pages. Other features, however, can fall under the same category, including features that allow emailing a story or RSS.</p>
<p>This section examines interactive features from a user perspective, focusing on the type of relationship one can have with news content – control over content presentation, influencing content, and passing content beyond the news site. But what do these different types of feature mean to journalists and the media?</p>

<title>A professional-journalistic standpoint</title>
<p>Research scholars long have wrestled with the fascinating question of whether journalism is a profession, a semi-profession, or perhaps only an occupation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856511429648">Dennis and Merill, 1996</xref>). However, journalists are often seen as a group of professionals with a specific occupational identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856511429648">Deuze, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856511429648">Singer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354856511429648">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>). Journalism possesses some salient features of professions, such as common norms and work techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856511429648">Schudson, 1978</xref>), work patterns for evaluating changing realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354856511429648">Tuchman, 1973</xref>), and adopting objectivity as its vanguard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354856511429648">Schiller, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856511429648">Schudson, 1990</xref>). For journalists, professional identification is also technology specific. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856511429648">Singer (2004</xref>: 839), ‘identification with a particular medium is part of formative educational and professional processes for many journalists.’ Interactive features will be examined broadly next, both in terms of the journalistic professional interests, and more specifically, by considering differences between print and broadcast media.</p>

<sec id="section4-1354856511429648">
<title>Exclusivity and autonomy of journalism</title>
<p>A profession has a unique status in society. It declares that its members know better than society-at-large, and its clients in particular, about the nature of certain spheres of activity. At least two of the demands derived from this basic statement justify what a profession requires of itself and of society – exclusivity and credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856511429648">Hughes, 1971</xref>). Professional credibility is also the basis for a profession’s insistence on autonomy, including internal adjudication of its members, claiming it is the sole possessor of the appropriate tools to do so. Journalists do profess they know better than the public how to serve society as reliable distributors of information, opinion, and commentaries, as well as how to serve as watchdogs in society. Isolation of a profession from other occupations preserves its special social status and the hierarchical relations between it, the public, and other occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856511429648">Broddason, 1994</xref>). A continuous legitimization of the profession also justifies the market shelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856511429648">Freidson, 1994</xref>), or more broadly, its occupational monopoly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511429648">Larkin, 1983</xref>). In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856511429648">Hermida and colleagues (2011</xref>: 16) interviewed journalists in online news sites and concluded that: ‘Journalists still see themselves as an elite group which mediates the flow of information to the public.’ Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354856511429648">Rebillard and Touboul (2010</xref>: 331) examined news websites from France, Argentina, the USA, and the UK, and confirmed their difficulty in welcoming nonprofessional expression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354856511429648">Timmermans (2008)</xref> suggests that the market shelter also can suppress innovations needed for adapting to a changing scientific and economic landscape. Is the importance of exclusivity and autonomy a global professional ideal?</p>
<p>A rich body of literature has identified international and intercultural differences in journalistic norms, practices, and social role perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354856511429648">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354856511429648">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>). Studies indicated, for example, cross-national differences in professional ideals, such as journalists as advocates, educators, and watchdogs (see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856511429648">Alves, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856511429648">Hackett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856511429648">Köcher, 1986</xref>). The more general importance of a profession, however, is becoming stronger across national boundaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354856511429648">Reese (2008)</xref> suggests evidence that news professionalism itself becomes more of a cross-national phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354856511429648">O'Sullivan and Heinonen (2008</xref>: 12) found that across 11 European countries, and even with the integration of the internet in newsrooms, ‘there seems to be an internal need to adhere to practices which ensure that [social] status, and to maintain the particular values that both generate and legitimize those practices.’ Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354856511429648">Weaver et al. (2007)</xref> showed that journalists around the world continue to rate one of the most fundamental one-to-many journalistic roles – the interpretative/investigative role – as most important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1354856511429648">
<title>Professional norms and the use of interactive features</title>
<p>From a professional-normative perspective, then, the three types of features identified earlier – content consumption, influence, and passing – can have very different implications on professional interests. Of the three types of features, content influence features are more likely to be perceived as a threat to the interest of isolation of the profession and its credibility. If users publish information, such as on discussion forums or blogs, they become contributors to the market of opinions and ideas, media’s social role by tradition. More subtle ways of influencing news content, including allowing users to rate articles, make audiences rank the importance of news – again a traditionally fundamental role of journalists. The ability of individuals other than journalists, then, to influence the dissemination of news or views can work against the professional interest of securing the journalist’s social status.</p>
<p>Literature supports the argument that professional and normative concerns characterize journalists’ and editors’ decisions regarding the level of involvement they allow users in the news production and presentation process. Shirky (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354856511429648">Pesce, 2002</xref>) observed that media people often criticize the user-generated content (UGC) for being unedited and low quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856511429648">Chung (2007)</xref> interviewed news website producers and found that journalists indicated that they find it difficult to navigate the challenges that user-generated news content brings to established notions of professional identity and their role as gatekeepers. She found that journalists are uncomfortable in fully adopting interpersonal and interactive features onto their websites. Studies also showed that many online news operations have been slow to offer audiences the means necessary to interact with journalists, sources, and other audience members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354856511429648">Lowrey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354856511429648">Singer, 2002</xref>). Among BBC journalists, user participation terminology itself was not interpreted as such, as UGC is perceived ‘in newsgathering terms, rather than as a tool for widespreading participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354856511429648">Wardle and Williams, 2008</xref>: 58). Other studies, nonetheless, indicated that journalists are more responsive to their audiences, assuming the role of ‘partner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856511429648">Bardoel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856511429648">Pavlik, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856511429648">Deuze, Bruns, and Neuberger (2007)</xref> found that when journalists engaged citizens in the production of news, it was not because they believed that such practices would provide society with better information, but because of economic reasons, such as attracting advertisers and winning back otherwise non-reading newspaper audiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856511429648">Lewis, Kaufhold, and Lasorsa (2010)</xref> interviewed editors of community newspapers about the integration of citizen journalists. They found that some editors favor or disfavor the use of citizen journalism based on professional concerns, such as objectivity and accuracy, while others cite practical concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354856511429648">Robinson (2006)</xref> found that although editors are still concerned about authority and traditional standards such as gatekeeping, they also commented about the future, in which news would transform itself from an ‘institution’ to a ‘platform.’ In Belgium, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354856511429648">Paulussen and Ugille (2008)</xref> found that the slow adoption of user-generated content is due to newsroom structures, work routines, and professional beliefs.</p>
<p>Features that allow users to control content presentation, such as via multimedia features or personalization options, nonetheless, do not seem to threaten the professional interests of journalistic autonomy and credibility. Audiences can interact with content only to the extent that they can influence their own experience, but with no effect on other users’ experiences or of the journalistic work, as they cannot affect content presented on the news site. Using these features, the traditional one-way flow of information from media to audiences does not break, and users remain consumers of information. Referring to this category as <italic>content consumption</italic> features henceforth, one can include features such as multimedia, personalizing options, and other new features that preserve the one-way information flow, such as blogs written by journalists. As discussed earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856511429648">Chung (2008)</xref> found that medium–human interactivity features were more frequently used than features that allow consumers to express their opinions.</p>
<p>
<italic>Passing content</italic>-related features are those that allow users to forward articles to new audiences via email or social networking sites, or to stay updated without going to the website, via RSS feeds, for example. With resources tight, many news media focus their investments on existing rich engagement in social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, while increasing involvement with conversations around their content. In such third party networks, social recommendations play a role in driving traffic to news content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856511429648">Newman, 2009</xref>). From a professional standpoint, these types of features allow news organizations to harness some of the more popular activities on the internet to reach new audiences, keep their own audiences connected (even if not on the site), and allow them to interact about the news (via Facebook, for example) without affecting their own platforms.</p>
<p>Literature suggests a limited examination of the normative approaches journalists take to interact with their audiences via the internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856511429648">Fortunati et al. (2009)</xref> found that journalists in south-central and Scandinavian countries were less in agreement than other European journalists about the argument that audiences need news rather than interaction with journalists. Journalists in the UK and Ireland were more likely to agree that linking with their audiences is an important benefit of online journalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354856511429648">Schmitz Weiss and de Macedo Higgins Joyce (2009)</xref> interviewed online journalists around the world and found two main perceptions of audience–media interaction: American and British journalists tended to perceive a closer relationship in terms of feedback, while maintaining the role of news producer; and some journalists in Latin America saw the audience as an active collaborator in the news production cycle. The limited international examination of journalistic perceptions of their ideal relationship with audiences via the internet suggests, then, some country-specific differences, but no overarching predictors of international perceptions of the ideal journalist–audience relationship that takes place via the internet. Although these studies touch on the issue of journalists’ interactions with their audiences, the issue of user influence of content remains overall underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Many features, regardless of the earlier categorization, can easily be embedded in news websites. From a professional standpoint, however, <italic>content influence</italic> features are most likely to threaten the journalistic interest of protecting its unique role in society and market shelter. Interacting with content without influencing it, via <italic>content consumption, </italic>or <italic>passing content</italic> to other users or to social networking sites, pose no professional threat. Based on this triadic categorization, then, the first research hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p>H1: Overall, news media will be more likely to use <italic>content consumption</italic> and <italic>passing content</italic>-related features than <italic>content influence</italic>-related features.</p>

<title>Convergence of technologies: New opportunities, new practices?</title>
<p>Traditionally, news media were limited by their technologies. Print media were limited to text and still images and broadcast media were more visual in nature. One of the key characteristics of the internet is that it allows the convergence of technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856511429648">Newhagen and Rafaeli, 1996)</xref>. Via their websites, print news organizations can use video and audio, broadcast organizations can use text, while all news media can allow users to interact with one another and journalists on their news sites and through social networking sites. Do journalists then use interactive features that cross their medium-related boundaries?</p>
<p>During the 1990s, news organizations were quick to introduce online outlets, motivated in part by their concern with new competitors entering into the digital arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511429648">Allan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856511429648">Carlson, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511429648">Boczkowski (2004)</xref> suggested that the culture of innovation was reactive, defensive, and pragmatic, in a way that defended existing territories rather than conquering new ones. Newspapers’ actions were pragmatically centered on making a profit in the short term rather than more idealistically pursuing opportunities that could only pan out in the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856511429648">Boczkowski, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856511429648">Singer (2004</xref>: 839) found that even in a world of convergence, ‘identification with a particular medium is part of formative educational and professional processes for many journalists.’</p>
<p>The possibility that print journalists will adopt practices that are associated with broadcast journalism, and vice versa, may be related to how these two industries are perceived. Broadcast journalism has often been seen as emphasizing sensationalism and entertainment values and as being more profit oriented, while print journalists are seen as more public interest motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511429648">Chan-Olmsted and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856511429648">Ehrlich, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354856511429648">Tuggle and Huffman (2001)</xref> have argued that television’s emphasis on live shots leads to an over emphasis on emotional reaction to a story, pushing aside newsworthiness. When newspaper and television newsrooms converged, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856511429648">Fee (2002</xref>: 2) found a ‘collision of values and beliefs about the role of journalism and what journalists do and should do in covering the news.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856511429648">Singer (2004</xref>) found that at a professional level, some print journalists continued to see television journalism as inferior – that it is more likely to focus on visually-interesting spot news than on issue-oriented stories. She found that although a growing appreciation of ‘the other’s’ journalistic work was noticed, overall habits and learned skills related to newsroom structure and storytelling norms were more resistant to change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354856511429648">O'Sullivan and Heinonen (2008</xref>: 12) summarized: ‘Newspaper journalists appear to want to stay newspaper journalists.’</p>
<p>Literature therefore suggests that innovation in news organizations is likely to follow narrow confines. In other words, the media are more likely to innovate in ways consistent with past habits than by breaking from those habits. If indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856511429648">Boczkowski (2010)</xref> argues, new media’s culture of innovations is not aimed toward the long run, and considering the long-held rivalries between the two news industries, one should ask whether news media’s journalistic offline outlet practices could predict the selection of features for their websites. We propose a categorization of interactive features based on the type of presentation that they use to present content – text or visual. The next set of hypotheses is therefore:<disp-quote>
<p>H2a: Newspapers’ websites will use more text-based features than websites of broadcast media.</p>
<p>H2b: Newspapers’ websites will use less visual-based features than websites of broadcast media.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, literature did not lead the researchers to expect specific differences among countries in terms of the research hypotheses. Countries from around the world were selected in order to provide a broader sample that is not limited to a given country. A total of 100 news websites were chosen, consisting of two major newspaper and two broadcast news organizations from 30 countries (where available). In order to examine websites in their native languages, countries were first selected based on the availability of multi-lingual coders. From there, countries were then selected based on their order of listing in the BBC’s ‘Country Profiles’ portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856511429648">BBC, 2011</xref>). Considering the non-probability sampling of countries, then, running statistical procedures, two characteristics of countries were controlled for – countries’ economic and press freedom levels.</p>
<p>A coding sheet was developed to capture all features based on a pilot analysis of 10 percent of the websites (for the list of features, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856511429648">Table 1</xref>). Each feature was coded 1 if appeared in the site and 0 if it did not. Five multi-lingual students from a large Midwestern university were recruited and trained to code the websites in the sites’ local languages. Webpages were recorded for one composite week during November 2007, using SurfSaver software. All coders were gathered in a computer lab, where one of the researchers was able to supervise their coding and respond to problems and questions. Each coder coded websites in one language (e.g., the Spanish-speaking coder coded all Spanish websites). Inter-coder reliability was medium to high, based on the recoding of 10 percent of the sites for each language (English: Scott’s Pi = .91; Spanish: Scott’s Pi = .87; French: Scott’s Pi = .89; Chinese: Scott’s Pi = .91, Japanese: Scott’s Pi = .89).</p>

<p>
<italic>Dependent variables. </italic>Twenty-three types of feature were identified in the analysis of websites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856511429648">Table 1</xref>). The first is the total number of features per website (range between 0 and 23). The main dependent variables were drawn from the two conceptual frameworks.</p>
<p>The first categorization was based on categorization of features based on the relationship they allow users to have with content – consume, influence, or forward. Drawing from this categorization, three dependent variables were identified and computed. (1) The <italic>content consumption</italic> features dependent variable included all features that secure the one-way media-audience information flow, where users utilize the content presentation, but cannot add or affect content. This variable was calculated as the mean value of the following items: search options, personalization, access to print edition, multimedia, videos to watch, videos to download, audio to listen to, audio to download, printer-friendly option, blogs by journalists, and blogs by experts. Reliability values approached the acceptable 0.7 threshold (K-R 20 = 0.69). (2) The <italic>content influence </italic>category included features that allow users to influence content on the website. This dependent variable was calculated as the mean of the following items: Chat rooms, forums/bulletin boards, rating stories, blogs by readers, list of most-emailed stories, list of most-read stories, and polls and surveys. The latter was included as a form of influencing journalists and, indirectly, their work. Testing for reliability, the value approached the 0.7 acceptable thresholds (K-R 20 = 0.67). (3) The <italic>content passing</italic> category included all features that allow content to flow beyond the audience-website channel of information flow, to include individuals or third-party platforms. This dependent variable was calculated as the mean of the following items: email story to a friend, share on social SNS options, RSS feeds, mobile phone updates, and email updates. Testing for reliability, the value met the acceptable thresholds (K-R 20 = 0.70).</p>
<p>Examining whether media are innovating in ways consistent with past practices, the second categorization is based on the conceptualization of features as text or visual. The following two dependent variables were drawn from the textual-visual categorization. (1) The <italic>text-based features</italic> variable was calculated as the mean of all features that were based on text, whether presented mainly in a textual form, or whether it allows or requires users to use text in order to use the feature. These features are: chat rooms, forums, blogs by journalists, blogs by experts, blogs by readers, printer-friendly option, and access to print edition. Testing for reliability, the value met the acceptable thresholds (K-R 20 = 0.72). (2) The <italic>visual-based features</italic> variable was calculated as the mean of the following items: videos to watch, videos to download, audio to listen to, audio to download, and multimedia. Testing for reliability, the value approached the acceptable thresholds (K-R 20 = 0.68). Overall, all reliability values met or closely approached the .7 acceptable value. The relatively low values, though, can be attributed to the narrow range of items’ measures (0 or 1).</p>
<p>The <italic>independent variable </italic>was the medium associated with the news organization (print or broadcast). The <italic>control variables</italic> were economic level (low, medium, or high, as adopted from the World Bank report; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354856511429648">World Bank, 2007</xref>) and press level freedom (no, partial, or full freedom, based on the 2007 Freedom House report; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856511429648">Freedom House, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Findings showed that the most popular features were searching (72% of news sites), printer friendly option (54%) and playing video (47%). The least popular features were rating stories (9%) and listing the most-emailed stories (8%). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856511429648">Table 1</xref> for a complete list.<disp-quote>
<p>H1: Overall, news media will be more likely to use <italic>content consumption</italic> and <italic>passing content</italic>-related features than <italic>content influence</italic>-related features.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>News organizations around the world preferred, by and large, providing features that allow one-way interaction with their websites and their content over features that allow users to make visible contributions to the sites. Features were categorized into three groups, and a value was calculated for each, based on the mean of values (0 or 1) assigned to each feature in that category: content consumption (M = .30; SD = .21), content influence (M = .18; SD = .21), and passing content (M = .24; .24). Corresponding with the first hypothesis and controlling for economic and press freedom levels, paired sampled T-tests showed significant differences between the average use of content consumption and influence features (t = 5.87, p &lt; .001), and between the use of content consumption and passing features (t = 2.35, p &lt; .05).</p>
<p>
<italic>Medium.</italic> Websites of newspapers (M = 6.47; SD = 3.72) and broadcast news media (M = 5.26; SD = 4.7) showed a subtle but not significant difference in their overall uses of interactive features.<disp-quote>
<p>H2a: Newspapers’ websites will use more text-based features than websites of broadcast media.</p>
<p>H2b: Newspapers’ websites will use less visual-based features than websites of broadcast media.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A multiple regression analysis was applied to examine the foregoing hypotheses. Corresponding with the hypotheses and controlling for economic and press freedom levels, medium was found to be a predictor of the two categories of features – text and visual based. Medium significantly (F = 17.87; p &lt; .001) explained 25 percent of variance in the dependent variables – use of textual and visual features (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = .25). Websites of newspapers used more textual features (M = .32, SD = .19) than visual features (M = .16, SD = .22), whereas websites of broadcast organizations used more visual features (M = .17, SD = .25) than textual features (M = .30, SD = .29). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354856511429648">Table 2</xref>. For illustration, availability of forums and chats was more common in newspapers (51%) than broadcast (29.4%), whereas features allowing video and audio to play was more frequently used in broadcast sites (66.7%) than in newspapers’ sites (36.7).</p>

<p>Differences at the individual features level appeared both in the more and less popular features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354856511429648">Figure 1</xref>). We did not test for significance here, as multiple tests increase the chance of false positive tests. For illustration, differences were found in searching options (85.7% on newspapers' websites and 58.8% on broadcast organizations' websites), printer-friendly options (65.3% and 43.1%, respectively), emailing a story to a friend (53.1% and 29.4%, respectively), availability of forums and chats in general (51% and 29.4%, respectively) and specifically next to stories (14.35% and 7.8%, respectively), blogs by journalists and experts (4.9% and 15.5%, respectively), and blogs by readers (28.6% and 9.8%, respectively). The reverse relationship was found only for the availability of video and audio to play (36.7% of newspaper and 66.7% of TV sites) and for downloading (12.5% and 23.5%, respectively). For other features, such as polls and surveys, the use of external hyperlinks, multimedia, and sharing options, the main medium of the news organization made no difference.</p>

</fig>
<p>As detailed earlier, economic press freedom level was used as a control variable and was not found to affect the patterns of interactive features use (virtual-textual and user-relationship with content). As an ad hoc examination, however, economic level was also examined as a predictor for the use of interactive features. Overall, findings suggest that news media in richer countries used more interactive features on their news websites (M = 10.12, SD = 4.60) than in medium (M = 5.63, SD = 3.15) and lower economic countries (M = 3.54, SD = 2.72). This relationship was significant (F = 54.4, p &lt; 0.001), where economic level explained 35.71% (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) of variance in the dependent variable – use of interactive features.</p>
<p>The second control variable was press freedom. As press freedom and economic level were found to be strongly positively associated with one another, press freedom was added to a regression analysis together with countries’ economic levels to find whether it adds to the explanatory power of the model. Findings showed press freedom made no significant or meaningful addition to the model, and therefore was not examined further.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>‘By integrating the newsrooms we plan to diminish and eventually eliminate the difference between newspaper journalists and Web journalists’ (<italic>New York Times</italic> editors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856511429648">Keller and Nisenholtz, 2005</xref>: 6). With the decline of readership and revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856511429648">Pew, 2010</xref>) and the increase of internet use for news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856511429648">Pew, 2006</xref>), the <italic>New York Times</italic> has understood that newspapers’ best chance of meeting audiences’ changing demands and growing competition from the internet is to embrace the opportunities the new technologies have to offer. While the data cannot be generalized to news organizations around the world, this study provides some indication that news media’s resistance to adapting their traditional professional norms and practices to the changing environment is not limited to one country or another. The websites examined here are far from diminishing the differences between their newspaper or broadcast practices and Web practices, as choices regarding features on news sites are still determined by the technology of their traditional media – print or broadcast. Furthermore, interactive features selections reflected the traditional user-producer relationship that preserves the hierarchical relationship with audiences.</p>
<p>Journalistic professional interests successfully predicted the use of interactive features by news media. News media examined here preferred features that correspond with the traditional role of disseminating information to the public, over features that allow the flow of information from their audiences back to their websites, whether in the form of feedback or a conversation (findings that are supported by literature see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856511429648">Chung, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856511429648">Quandt, 2008</xref>). In order to discuss news topics with one another, users are often directed to a designated space on a news website, separate from the articles, or pushed to third parties, often social networking sites, through provided sharing options on the news sites. These findings correspond with interviews with online journalists, who seem to protect the traditional one-way flow of information between news media and their audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856511429648">Hermida et al., 2011</xref>). It provides further support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354856511429648">Singer’s (2011)</xref> conclusion that newspapers have accommodated users’ participation within traditional static principles, where audiences are viewed as sources for limited information and opinions. One can wonder whether early criticism of user-generated content as misinformative and insulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856511429648">Cooper, 1998</xref>), and attitudes toward journalists’ interactions with the public as, in the words of art critic Robert Hughes, ‘a giant waste of time that takes away from what writers are suppose to do …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354856511429648">Wolff, 1994</xref>: 63) are still how journalists approach audience-generated content.</p>
<p>The state of the news media report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856511429648">Pew, 2010</xref>: 4) suggests that the SNS’s power has less to do with reporting and more with serving as ‘a place for people to come together around an issue that they feel passionately about to share concerns, pass along information, offer financial contributions and in several cases bring about change.’ News media examined here often took advantage of SNS-enabled opportunities to allow their audiences to disseminate articles to larger audiences. By doing so, content can reach more readers. But public discussion is diverted from news websites to social networking sites, from which (at least for now) news organizations receive no advertising revenue. In a time of great crisis for the news industry and growing competition from other online news sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856511429648">Cowen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856511429648">Pew, 2006</xref>), news media often use Facebook or Twitter (Bivings, 2009), but they miss the social media zeitgeist and its potential financial benefits by limiting interactions with their audiences. It is also somewhat ironic that news media are now contemplating closing off their content to aggregators such as Google if not compensated for doing what they encourage their users to do for free via their social networking accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354856511429648">Rainie and Purcell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptualization of features, where possible, as visual or text-based, allowed us to examine another aspect of the process of adapting to internet-based spaces – the willingness to break from the professional practices dictated by older technologies and embrace new practices of information presentation and dissemination. Findings suggest that whereas newspapers and broadcast media did not differ much in terms of their overall use of interactive features, both industries were more likely to adopt features that are more native to their traditional practices. Newspapers preferred features that are text based, either in their presentation (e.g., printer friendly options) or that involve the use of text for interaction (e.g., forums, blogs, and a variety of email-related features). Broadcast media, in contrast, favored visual features (e.g., use of video presentation and downloading). For features that can be less defined as textual or visual, such as sharing an article on social networking websites, and web-personalizing options, medium made little or no difference. In other words, overall news media were slow in breaking from their ‘comfort zones’ and adopting new practices they could not have used before, but were as likely to reach beyond their traditional practices to features that are associated only with the internet. A complementing explanation would be the availability of images and video for broadcast-based sites, material that newspapers will have to generate.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856511429648">McManus (1994)</xref> predicted that news media’s websites may be only as interactive as the level of its funding will allow. Indeed, the economic level of a country was associated with the amount of use of interactive features. Across almost all features, news organizations in poorer countries, indeed, were less likely to take full advantage of the technology than news media in richer countries. This is not surprising, considering that taking advantage of the technological opportunities of the internet, even if not very expensive to implement, costs money in terms of labor. Furthermore, in poorer countries, fewer people have access to the internet, and connections are slower.</p>
<p>Most importantly, patterns of the use of interactive features, nonetheless, were similar. Features associated with influencing content were lower than features associated with content consumption, across economic levels. In other words, whether news media could afford using few or many features, the selection of features corresponded with the professional interest to protect the isolation of the profession. Further research on the international use of features, taking into account a wider range of country-related characteristics, is of course needed.</p>
<sec id="section10-1354856511429648">
<title>Limitations and future studies</title>
<p>Although the focus of this study is not the international comparison of the use of interactive features, a limitation is its convenience sampling resulting from constraints related to analyzing websites in their native languages. Also, countries in the Middle East and Western Europe, for example, are underrepresented in the study. The external validity of this research is therefore limited. Future studies’ analyses of more representative sets of websites will allow researchers to better generalize the findings and could help identify more subtle differences in the use of websites based on specific cultural, economic, and political distinctions. Other research methods, such as interviews of media professionals, individual newsroom cultures’ ethnography, spending on infrastructure, relationships between reporters and web masters, and limitations in terms of resources could shed more light on the reasons behind the selection of interactive features.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>‘The whole idea of the first amendment,’ suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856511429648">Hamilton (1994</xref>: 47) ‘was to empower people to use the news, not to make them dependent on government or few journalists … New communication technologies have the potential of letting the public come closer than ever to realizing the full value of the first amendment.’ This study suggests that the news media that were examined are slow to adapt their traditional professional norms and practices to the internet era. News media rarely take advantage of their major online outlets – their websites – to establish new relationships with their audiences and give them the space to engage in discussions about their topics of interest. Such discussions were distanced from news content on the websites, altogether unavailable on the sites, or linked to social networking sites, where users can share news articles and opinions.</p>
<p>At the theoretical level, the two categorizations suggested here – based on relationship with content and type of medium – were found to be useful in examining how news media adapt to new technologies. Expanding the analysis beyond websites of newspapers, which previous studies where mostly limited to, and toward the analysis of television websites, allowed us not only a glimpse into this industry’s websites, but it also gave us a comparison with the newspaper industry. Last, examining news sites from a wider array of countries, beyond the less surprising relationship between economic level and extent of use of features, we learned that professional interests held across economic levels.</p>
<p>In these harsh economic times, news media compete not only with one another, but also with other sources of online information, such as highly popular blogs, internet-only news organizations, and news aggregators such as Yahoo! and Google news. Taking full advantage of the internet is not only an opportunity for news media to expand their social roles, but it can also help in adapting to a changing and more competitive news market. This study has illustrated how traditional values of journalism, that come to protect the profession’s own societal status, may shape news practices.</p>
