<abstract>
<p>Adolescents who live in low-income neighborhoods face numerous unique challenges. Examining their resilience in multiple contexts sheds light on what contributes to the diverse outcomes of these youth. The current study examines how adolescents’ reports of structural and experiential neighborhood characteristics buffered the impact of exposure to community violence on academic performance. A total of 206 African American high school students completed a series of questionnaires; some of the item measures covered by the questionnaires include the following: exposure to community violence; opportunities for involvement and actual engagement in neighborhood-based structured activities; and self-reported grades for the school year. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that structural and experiential factors buffered the impact of exposure to community violence on academic performance. These findings suggest that in the face of exposure to community violence, adolescents who are involved in neighborhood activities, even when opportunities for involvement are minimal, have better academic outcomes.</p>

<p>Research examining the impact of neighborhoods on adolescent development has tended to focus exclusively on either structural characteristics of neighborhoods or experiential processes within those neighborhoods. The structural characteristics of a neighborhood reflect the socioeconomic makeup of that neighborhood and social resources available in it; whereas the experiential characteristics of a neighborhood reflect individuals’ involvement in and perceptions of that neighborhood. Fewer studies on neighborhoods have explored the interactive effect of structural and experiential processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11399109">Wilson, 2008</xref>). Interactions between structural and experiential factors can reveal a more complex picture of how neighborhoods affect adolescents. As a result, current neighborhood research is now charged with examining the confluence of both the structural and the experiential characteristics of neighborhoods in influencing adolescent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11399109">Wilson, 2008</xref>). Thus, the current study examines the individual and interactive effects of neighborhood-level structural and experiential protective factors on the relationship between ECV and academic functioning.</p>
<p>Whether at the structural (e.g., crime statistics) or experiential (e.g., personal victimization) level, poor, urban neighborhoods characterized by crime and danger have been linked to negative adolescent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11399109">Sieger, Rojas-Vilches, &amp; McKinney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X11399109">Solberg, Carlstrom, Howard, &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>). This relationship is particularly strong when neighborhood danger is experienced personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11399109">Rosenfeld, Richman, Bowen, &amp; Wynns, 2006</xref>). Personal exposure to community violence (ECV) has been associated with decreased academic performance, including lower grades, more absences, and lower standardized test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X11399109">Henrich, Schwab-Stone, Fanti, Jones, &amp; Ruchkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11399109">Kennedy &amp; Bennett, 2006</xref>; Rosenfeld et al.). For example, Henrich et al. found that adolescents who witnessed more types of violence performed less well academically (β = −.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, a number of studies have demonstrated that ECV and academic achievement are negatively correlated among low-income and African American early adolescents (Henrich et al.; Solberg et al.). In fact, one study found that students who were exposed to more violence during the sixth grade performed less well academically in the eighth grade (β = −.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thus demonstrating the potentially long-term negative effects of ECV (Henrich et al.). Thus, the ECV literature demonstrates the negative associations between such exposure and poor academic outcomes among adolescents, especially ethnic minority youth from low-income and urban neighborhoods who tend to be at risk for such exposure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the impact of adolescents’ experiences with community violence is often dependent on the presence or absence of protective factors. Researchers have begun to identify protective factors at the individual and relational levels that support academic competence in the face of ECV, including intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X11399109">Solberg et al., 2007</xref>), positive attitudes toward school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11399109">Kennedy &amp; Bennett, 2006</xref>), and family and teacher support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11399109">Rosenfeld et al., 2006</xref>). However, researchers have yet to identify neighborhood-level protective factors that may buffer the impact of ECV on academic functioning.</p>
<p>Two neighborhood-level protective factors that are associated with positive outcomes in youth and may have particular relevance for those exposed to violence in their neighborhoods are the presence of facilities that provide opportunities for youth to be involved in structured activities and their actual involvement in those activities. Facilities such as recreational centers, community centers, boys and girls clubs, and churches contribute to the structural makeup of neighborhoods and provide opportunities for youth to engage in structured activities in their neighborhoods and outside of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11399109">Spencer, McDermott, Burton, &amp; Kochman, 1997</xref>). Research has demonstrated a positive relationship between having opportunities for involvement in structured neighborhood activities and positive youth outcomes, such as youth development, psychosocial functioning, and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X11399109">Kahne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11399109">Roffman, Pagano, &amp; Hirsch, 2001</xref>). For example, Kahne et al. found that adolescents rated the support for youth development they received in community-based programs higher than what they received in school, <italic>t</italic>(27) = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Youths’ actual involvement in neighborhood-based activities plays a role in their experiences in and perceptions of their neighborhood. For African American adolescents in particular, those who participated in structured activities (i.e., community service learning projects and recreational sports teams; β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and religious activities in 10th grade were most prepared for school in the 12th grade (β = .07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Also, time spent involved in neighborhood-based structured activities in the 10th grade predicted math and science achievement in the 12th grade (β = .03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11399109">Jordan &amp; Nettles, 1999</xref>). Overall, having opportunities to be involved in neighborhood-based activities and actually getting involved in each seem to be associated with better outcomes among adolescents.</p>
<p>Opportunities for involvement and actual involvement in structured neighborhood activities may be a means for youth to establish neighborhood-based social networks and a connectedness to their neighborhood. Also, these protective factors may help youth negotiate their emotional, psychological, and behavioral responses to violence in their neighborhoods and ultimately contribute to their academic success. Specifically, one potential mechanism through which ECV may influence academic performance is disrupted perceptions of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0044118X11399109">Twemlow, Fonagy, &amp; Sacco, 2002</xref>). Exposure to community violence can negatively affect perceptions of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11399109">Overstreet &amp; Braun, 2000</xref>), which researchers argue is a prerequisite to successful learning (Twemlow et al.). Youth need to feel safe and experience a sense of well-being to successfully learn in school (Twemlow et al.).</p>
<p>The presence of structural opportunities for youth involvement, including organizations like the YMCA or a boys and girls club, make neighborhoods feel more welcoming and less dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11399109">Roffman et al., 2001</xref>). Even when faced with personal experiences with violence, the availability of supportive organizations in the neighborhood might buffer those experiences and allow youth to maintain a general sense of safety. Actual involvement in those organizations could also ameliorate the negative effects of ECV through access to caring and supportive adults, responsible peers, and skill-building academic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X11399109">Scales, Benson, Leffert, &amp; Blythe, 2000</xref>). Perhaps even more powerful than either of these protective factors alone is the interaction between the two. Given the lack of literature examining the interactive effect of structural and experiential protective factors, the current study will explore the interaction between opportunities for involvement in the neighborhood and adolescents’ actual involvement. This line of questioning may reveal a more complex picture of how neighborhoods affect youth and their outcomes.</p>

<title>The Current Study and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Although there is a wealth of literature indicating the powerful influence of neighborhoods on adolescent development, the literature reviewed above show that conceptual variables have been operationalized in a number of ways, and there is still much that is not known. Also, the existing literature has tended to focus on direct relationships between neighborhoods and outcomes. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine both the direct and the interactive effects of structural characteristics and experiential factors in neighborhoods in moderating the relationship between exposure to community violence and academic performance in a sample of African American adolescents who have demonstrated academic resilience. Specifically, the present study aims to address the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0044118X11399109" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Opportunities for involvement will moderate the relationship between ECV and grades such that the negative impact of ECV on grades will be weakened when opportunities for involvement are high.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Actual involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities will moderate the relationship between ECV and grades such that the negative impact of ECV on grades will be weakened when actual involvement is high.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The interaction between opportunities and actual involvement will further buffer the negative impact of ECV on grades, to a greater degree than either alone. More opportunities and greater involvement will diminish the negative effect of ECV on grades, and fewer opportunities and less involvement will maintain the negative effect of ECV on grades.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0044118X11399109">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 206 African American high school students between the ages of 13 and 19 (<italic>M</italic> = 15.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20). The majority were female (<italic>n</italic> = 136). All participants attended a Center for Science and Math in a large Southern city, a voluntary program for students interested in completing advanced or specialized classes in science and math. Students spent half their day at their district public high school and the other half of the day at the Center for Science and Math.</p>
<p>The students who attended this school were characterized as low-income because past evaluations have shown that approximately 80% of Center students qualified for and received free lunch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X11399109">Foney &amp; Cunningham, 2002</xref>), and 46.1% lived in single parent (mother-headed) households.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0044118X11399109">1</xref></sup> Demographics for this population were similar to the rest of the public school district, which is primarily made up of youth who come from households at or below the poverty line. As of the fall of 2002, the final year of data collection for this study, 73.6% of the students in this school district qualified for and received free lunch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11399109">Louisiana Department of Education: Planning, Analysis, and Information Resources, n.d.</xref>). Thus, the fact that most of the participants came from homes and neighborhoods where risk factors and challenges are present and at the same time they are high-achieving demonstrates the academic resilience of the participants in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0044118X11399109">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The participants for the current study were part of a larger longitudinal study that aimed to identify contributors to success among urban adolescents. Participation in the project was open to all students enrolled in the Center; however, the goal was to sample 25% of the student population, which was achieved. This study’s participants’ mean grade point average (GPA) did not significantly differ from the GPA of the students who were not sampled. Before participating in the research project, each student and his or her guardian signed informed consent forms, and all students signed assent forms. The students were told their responses would be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Data collection for the study was done with small groups of students in a large meeting area at the center with an advanced undergraduate or graduate student experimenter present at all times. Each student participant completed surveys, and the participants did not discuss responses with one another. Completion time for the entire survey packet took approximately one hr. Upon final completion of the study, participants were given US$5.00 for their participation.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0044118X11399109">
<title>Exposure to community violence</title>
<p>ECV was assessed with six items from a revised version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11399109">Coddington’s (1972)</xref> Life Events Questionnaire (LEQ). The LEQ, which includes 61 items, was designed to measure significant events in youths’ lives over the past year. The original LEQ was altered in sequence and language for the current study to best fit with additions to the scale that were included in an effort to add events commonly associated with high-risk neighborhoods.</p>
<p>For the present study, six events from the LEQ that assessed knowing of and being victimized by community violence were used to measure ECV. The six items chosen are similar to items used in other widely used measures of ECV (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X11399109">Richters &amp; Martinez, 1993</xref>). The response prompt asked the respondents to place a mark next to an event if that event happened to them in the past year. Examples of items that were included are, “One or two people you knew were killed,” and “You were personally victimized (mugged, ‘jumped’, humiliated, or embarrassed<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0044118X11399109">2</xref></sup>).” If the event occurred, it was coded 1, and if it did not occur it was coded 0. Two items assessed whether participants knew of someone who had been killed. One item was, “One or two people you knew were killed,” and the other was, “Three or more people you knew were killed.” To be consistent with the other items, which did not assess frequency of exposure, these two items were recoded as 1 if the participant indicated that either event happened or 0 if neither of the events happened to them. After recoding the two items, there was a total of five items which were summed to obtain a single ECV prevalence score where the maximum possible score was 5, indicating <italic>the most exposure</italic>, and the minimum possible score was 0, indicating <italic>no exposure</italic>.</p>
<p>Content validity of the revised LEQ was established for this study using confirmatory factor analysis. The five items loaded onto a single factor (Eigenvalue = 2.07, total variance explained = 41.47%). All items had factor loadings greater than 0.5. These findings suggested that the five items in the revised LEQ were representative of the ECV construct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0044118X11399109">
<title>Structural protective factor: Opportunities for involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities</title>
<p>The measure of opportunities for involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities included four items from the Neighborhood Assessment of Community Characteristics—Youth Self-Report Inventory (NACC-YSR). The NACC-YSR Inventory was modeled after the drive-by NACC, which describes census tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11399109">Spencer et al., 1997</xref>). The original 108-item inventory asks respondents to rate the quality, frequency of occurrence, or presence of housing, recreational areas, food and beverage–related stores, transportation, security devices, police visibility, people, and stray animals in their neighborhoods. Thus, this inventory assesses a respondent’s perception of his or her neighborhood characteristics.</p>
<p>The version of the NACC-YSR used in the current longitudinal study used only 79 of the original 108 items. Of those 79 items, 4 items were used in the current study to assess opportunities for involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities: presence of recreational areas, traditional recreation centers (e.g., YMCA, neighborhood recreation center, playground, boys and girls club, etc.), nontraditional recreation centers (e.g., open field where people can play),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0044118X11399109">3</xref></sup> and religious buildings (e.g., churches, temples, mosques, etc.). Each of these items was coded 0 if respondents report that the facility was not present and 1 if the facility was present in their neighborhoods. The four items were summed to obtain a prevalence score for opportunity for involvement, where a score of 4 was the highest, indicating <italic>the most opportunity</italic>, and 0 was the lowest, indicating <italic>no opportunity</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0044118X11399109">
<title>Experiential protective factor: Actual involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities</title>
<p>Actual involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities was measured with the following 3 self-report items from a 152-item questionnaire given to the participants in the larger study: (1) “During an average week, how many hours do you spend in clubs or organizations outside of school?”; (2) “During an average week, how many hours do you attend services, groups, or programs at a church or synagogue?”; and (3) “Over a school year, how many hours on average per week do you spend doing volunteer work to help other people (such as helping out at a hospital, day care center or nursery, food shelter, youth program, community service agency, etc).” The three items measured frequency of involvement on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 = <italic>0 hr</italic> to 5 = <italic>more than 10 hr</italic>. The three items were averaged to obtain a single prevalence score for actual involvement, where a score of 5 is the highest, indicating <italic>10 or more hours spent</italic> in all three activities, and 1 is the lowest, indicating <italic>no hours spent</italic> in all three activities. Cronbach’s alpha of this measure was .71, indicating acceptable internal consistency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0044118X11399109">
<title>Academic performance</title>
<p>The academic outcome was students’ self-reported grades. Participants were asked, “What kinds of grades do you earn in school?,” and were to choose one of following eight responses: (1) <italic>mostly As</italic>, (2) <italic>about half As and Bs</italic>, (3) <italic>mostly Bs</italic>, (4) <italic>about half Bs and Cs</italic>, (5) <italic>mostly Cs</italic>, (6) <italic>about half Cs and Ds</italic>, (7) <italic>mostly Ds, and</italic> (8) <italic>mostly below Ds</italic>. The eight choices were coded in the following manner to simulate a 4.0 scale: 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5, respectively.</p>
<p>The validity of using self-reported grades as the measure of academic performance with the current sample was obtained through correlation analysis and a <italic>t</italic> test. There was a subsample of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 129) for whom we obtained their science and math overall GPA for the school year prior to data collection from their official school records. There was a moderate correlation between self-reported grades and GPA (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and the difference between self-reported grades (<italic>M</italic> = 2.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00) and GPA (<italic>M</italic> = 2.69, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.76) was not statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(128) = −0.74, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, for the subsample.</p>

Regarding opportunities for involvement, 38.3% of the participants reported that all 4 of the facilities that provide opportunities for involvement included in the measure were present in their neighborhoods, whereas only 4.4% reported that there were no opportunities for involvement in their neighborhoods. Thus, more than half of the adolescents reported that their neighborhoods had facilities such as recreational areas, traditional and nontraditional recreation centers, and religious buildings.</p>

<title>Hierarchical Regression Analyses</title>
<p>The interactive effects of ECV, opportunities for involvement, and actual involvement after controlling for age and sex were examined to test the three hypotheses. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to test whether opportunities for involvement or actual involvement moderated the relationship between ECV and grades (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0044118X11399109">Table 3</xref>). All variables used in the regression analyses were centered to avoid multicollinearity. Although correlation analyses revealed that age was not correlated with grades, this variable was entered in the first step of the regression along with sex as control variables. Main effects of opportunities for involvement, ECV, and actual involvement were entered in the second step. Two-way interactions between all independent variables were entered in the third step. The fourth step included the three-way interaction between ECV, opportunities for involvement, and actual involvement.</p>

<title>Hypotheses 1 and 2</title>
<p>The overall model was statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(10, 156) = 2.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Consistent with the correlation results, there were no statistically significant main effects. However, the two-way interactions entered in the third step resulted in a statistically significant change in <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>. The beta weight for the interaction between ECV and opportunities for involvement was statistically significant (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thus supporting the first hypothesis; ECV and grades were negatively related when opportunities for involvement were low, and ECV and grades were positively related when opportunities for involvement were high. Thus, opportunities for involvement buffered the influence of ECV on adolescents’ grades, especially when their exposure was high. The second hypothesis, on the other hand, was not supported. The interaction between ECV and actual involvement was not statistically significant (β = .01, <italic>p</italic> = n.s.), suggesting that the relationship between ECV and grades is not affected by adolescents’ actual involvement in neighborhood activities. The lack of a statistically significant interaction between ECV and actual involvement could be explained by the nature of the activities the adolescents were involved with, their degree of involvement, or the presence of a more complex interactive relationship as observed by the statistically significant three-way interaction between ECV, opportunities for involvement, and actual involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0044118X11399109">
<title>Hypothesis 3</title>
<p>The two-way interaction between ECV and opportunities for involvement was qualified by a statistically significant three-way interaction between opportunities for involvement, actual involvement, and ECV entered on the fourth step (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), which demonstrated a complex relationship among structural and experiential neighborhood factors for academically resilient adolescents. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0044118X11399109">Figure 1</xref>, the three-way interaction was depicted by plotting the ECV × Actual Involvement interaction under conditions of low and high opportunities for involvement. The plot illustrates that in neighborhoods with few opportunities for involvement, ECV and self-reported grades were negatively related when actual involvement was low. In the same context, ECV and grades were positively related when actual involvement was high. In other words, as ECV increased grades increased when actual involvement was high with few opportunities for involvement in the neighborhood.</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast to these findings, in neighborhoods with greater opportunities for involvement, the opposite results were found. A negative relationship between ECV and self-reported grades was observed when actual involvement was high in neighborhoods with greater opportunities for involvement. This suggests that adolescents’ grades are negatively affected when they spend more time involved in neighborhood activities when they have been exposed to violence in those neighborhoods. In addition, a positive relationship between ECV and self-reported grades was observed when actual involvement was low in neighborhoods with greater opportunities for involvement. In other words, adolescents who reported more ECV reported better grades when they spent less time involved in neighborhood activities, even though their neighborhoods provided a lot of opportunities for involvement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>African American children and adolescents from low-income urban neighborhoods are potentially at risk due to the challenges that are frequently associated with impoverished neighborhoods. Challenges such as exposure to violence in their neighborhoods and a lack of structured neighborhood-based activities seemingly pervade the neighborhoods where these children and adolescents live. However, existing literature, as well as the current study, also documents the presence of positive aspects of these same neighborhoods that potentially serve as protective factors, which contribute to resilience among African American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X11399109">Lerner, Almerigi, Theokas, &amp; Lerner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the current study revealed an interactive association between structural and experiential neighborhood factors. The three-way interaction between ECV, opportunities for involvement, and actual involvement was statistically significant even after controlling for sex and age. Specifically, with few opportunities for involvement, greater exposure to community violence was related to poorer academic performance for adolescents who spent less time involved in neighborhood-based structured activities. Thus, not surprisingly, when adolescents have more negative experiences in a neighborhood context with high risks, they have poorer academic functioning. This interaction demonstrates that the ability of involvement in neighborhood-based activities to act as a protective factor and buffer the challenge of ECV depends on the structural characteristics of the neighborhood. Blighted property, unemployment, drugs and violence, and few community resources (e.g., recreation centers, playgrounds, parks, and community centers) may also characterize neighborhoods with few opportunities for involvement. These neighborhood characteristics combined with adolescents’ lack of involvement in structured neighborhood activities may leave adolescents exposed to community violence with no place go and no one to consult to help them cope with the distress they experience as a result of exposure; thus, their academic performance is negatively impacted.</p>
<p>The buffering effect of actual involvement on the relationship between ECV and grades in a neighborhood with poor structural characteristics could be explained by what might be happening in the neighborhood activities in which the adolescents are involved. These activities may offer adolescents a means to escape the distress potentially associated with ECV in a high-risk neighborhood context, thereby making adolescents feel more capable at achieving academically. Likewise, involvement in structured activities may expose adolescents to adults and peers who model effective ways of coping with ECV, and through these coping skills, adolescents are able to effectively deal with their experiences and have productive outcomes.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the ability of actual involvement in structured activities to serve as a support was dependent on the structural characteristics of the neighborhood. In contrast to the protective-enhancing function of the actual involvement observed in contexts with few opportunities for involvement, in contexts characterized by greater opportunities for involvement, actual involvement assumed a protective-reactive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X11399109">Luthar, Cicchetti, &amp; Becker, 2000</xref>). Protective-reactive interactive relationships are those in which a factor loses its protective function as risks and challenges increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X11399109">Luthar et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the present study showed that in a low-risk neighborhood context, ECV and grades were negatively related when actual involvement was high. Although high actual involvement appeared to serve a protective function when ECV was low, as exposure increased, actual involvement lost its protective role in this context, failing to buffer the impact of high levels of ECV on academic functioning. Thus, not surprisingly, the combination of few neighborhood risks, low ECV, and high actual involvement was optimal for producing better academic outcomes, but actual involvement alone was not enough to balance the challenge of high ECV even within a low risk neighborhood.</p>
<p>This pattern of findings may relate to the perceptions of exposure held by adolescents who are taking advantage of the opportunities their neighborhoods have to offer. Their high level of involvement may suggest an investment in their neighborhood that could influence how they perceive the neighborhood and events taking place in the neighborhood. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X11399109">Spencer (2006)</xref> notes, context and perception are inextricably linked in the meaning-making processes of adolescents. Adolescents who are involved and invested in their neighborhoods may have greater perceptions of neighborhood safety and cohesion. When these adolescents do encounter violence in their neighborhoods, they may perceive the violence as <italic>more</italic> threatening because it challenges their beliefs about the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11399109">Overstreet &amp; Braun, 2000</xref>), leading to greater distress over the experience and poorer academic outcomes.</p>
<p>Oddly, in neighborhoods with greater opportunities for involvement, more exposure to community violence was associated with better self-reported grades when actual involvement was low. Although low actual involvement in a high-opportunity context was associated with lower grades at low levels of exposure to community violence, as ECV increased, academic performance also increased. Thus, in the absence of ECV, <italic>not</italic> taking advantage of opportunities for involvement seemed to be associated with risk for poor academic performance. However, as ECV increased in this context, academic performance increased when actual involvement was low. This pattern of findings parallels findings related to coping with exposure to community violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X11399109">Dempsey, Overstreet, and Moely (2000)</xref> found that middle school students who reported frequent use of avoidant coping strategies (e.g., watching TV or playing a game to forget about stress) reported greater arousal symptoms at low levels of community violence exposure compared to students who reported infrequent use of the same strategies. However, greater use of avoidant coping strategies seemed to serve as a protective factor at high levels of violence exposure. The authors concluded that avoidant strategies may serve a protective function when youth are faced with uncontrollable events, such as community violence. In the current study, adolescents who report low involvement despite greater opportunities for involvement may have emotionally, psychologically, and/or behaviorally detached themselves from the community violence they have experienced, which seems to serve as a protective factor for academic functioning. In addition, by detaching themselves from the neighborhood context, these particular adolescents may be seeking support for dealing with ECV in other contexts, namely, school. As mentioned earlier, these adolescents attended a high-achieving specialized school, and in such a context, there may be supports not measured in the current study that might explain their academic resilience. Future research needs to explore these potential sources of the resilience adolescents who have been exposed to great amounts of community violence.</p>
<p>In sum, the interaction between structural and experiential neighborhood processes demonstrated in the current study showed that high rates of actual involvement in neighborhood-based structured activities serve a protective-enhancing function in the face of ECV in a high-risk neighborhood. Interestingly, in what was conceptualized as a low-risk neighborhood, high rates of actual involvement served a protective-reactive function when adolescents faced increased ECV.</p>
<sec id="section16-0044118X11399109">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>The level of exposure to community violence in the current sample was low. This finding stands out in light of other studies using demographically similar samples that have found higher rates of exposure among their participants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0044118X11399109">Stein, Jaycox, Kataoka, Rhodes, &amp; Vestal, 2003</xref>). This difference could be due to measurement differences, as the measure used in the current study is shorter than those used in other studies. Nonetheless, even when rates of exposure to specific items were compared, the participants in the current study reported less exposure compared to similar participants in other studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11399109">McGee (2003)</xref> reported that 56% of their sample participants reported being slapped, punched, or hit by someone, and 51.3% of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11399109">Schwartz and Gorman’s (2003)</xref> sample participants reported this same type of exposure. However, in the current study only 12.6% of the sample reported experiencing this type of physical exposure. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X11399109">Perez-Smith, Albus, and Weist (2001)</xref> reported that 52% of their sample participants reported knowing of someone who had been shot, whereas 35% of the current sample reported this type of exposure.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent studies on ECV have begun to examine the construct from three different perspectives: direct victimization, witnessing, and knowing about an act of personal violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0044118X11399109">Stein et al., 2003</xref>, for a review). These studies are finding that the three different experiences with community violence have a differential impact on children and adolescents’ outcomes. However, the current study’s ECV measure did not tap into this multifaceted operationalization of the construct. Therefore, future research aimed at examining the direct impact and moderators of ECV among urban African American adolescents from low-income neighborhoods should incorporate this operationalization of ECV to gain a more complete picture of the impact of this neighborhood challenge and the protective factors that buffer it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the adolescents in the current study were unique in that they attended a specialized math and science high school. Selective admissions criteria and high expectations for academic performance may also explain why the direct negative relationship between ECV and academic functioning was not observed in the current study. There may be support mechanisms in the school that might be helping these students cope with ECV, mitigating the potentially negative impact of ECV on their academic functioning. Thus, analysis of the neighborhood environment is necessary to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the quality of neighborhood resources, including schools (which neighborhood and community research view as part of the neighborhood community), traditional (e.g., a neighborhood recreation center) and nontraditional (e.g., an open field or basketball court) recreational centers, and adolescents’ level of involvement with these neighborhood resources. Such an analysis will increase our understanding of how in the context of poor neighborhood structural characteristics positive neighborhood experiences may buffer the impact of negative neighborhood experiences on adolescent outcomes.</p>
<p>A number of studies have demonstrated a negative association between ECV and academic functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X11399109">Henrich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11399109">Schwartz &amp; Gorman, 2003</xref>) that can possibly be explained by the psychological distress associated with such exposure and the disruption to opportunities to learn. However, the current study did not observe a direct predictive relationship between ECV and academic performance. This could be explained by the possibility that the relationship between ECV and academic outcome depends on the interaction between structural and experiential factors, as observed by the three-way interaction in the current study. Thus, the interactive influence of poor structural neighborhood characteristics in the absence of positive neighborhood experiences makes youth vulnerable to unproductive outcomes; as expected, the current study’s findings support this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0044118X11399109">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Future studies investigating protective factors in the academic resilience of urban African American children and adolescents from low-income neighborhoods may also investigate perceptions of teacher support and expectations and its influence on academic performance. The current study did not examine potential protective factors or supports in the school context because the focus was on the neighborhood; however, an examination of school-based factors is appropriate given the unique characteristics of the school from which the adolescents were sampled. Previous research has demonstrated that perceived support from teachers and peers as well as teacher expectations is associated with academic functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11399109">Cunningham, Hurley, Foney, &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X11399109">Swanson, Cunningham, &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, neighborhood and community literature view schools as an integral part of the neighborhood; consequently, future studies aimed at examining structural and experiential neighborhood processes on academic resilience might also include the roles of teachers and peers and school characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0044118X11399109">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings in this study suggest that the influence of structural and experiential neighborhood processes on adolescents’ academic performance is not as simple as previously conceptualized, which is supported by the statistically significant three-way interaction. Thus, future research investigating the impact of neighborhood risk and protective factors and direct experiences with these factors on adolescent development should examine these factors interactively rather than in isolation. The implication of the interactive nature of these constructs is that theories and interventions must consider the dynamic nature of resilience and diverse outcomes that result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X11399109">Luthar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X11399109">Spencer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, fewer opportunities for involvement in urban neighborhoods do not necessarily translate into poor outcomes. In fact, the current study found that fewer opportunities for involvement in the face of high exposure to community violence resulted in better academic performance when adolescents were involved in neighborhood-based structured activities, so even though adolescents may not have opportunities to be involved in neighborhood-based structured activities in their own neighborhoods, their involvement in activities in some neighborhood or community does have a beneficial impact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0044118X11399109">Gershoff and Aber (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11399109">Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn (2004)</xref> demonstrated that neighborhoods that have more perceived social cohesion, social control, employed adults, and less neighborhood violence are associated with youth with better mental health outcomes, social behaviors, and academic achievement. Therefore, adolescents who are involved in neighborhood-based structured activities, which the current study found to be associated with academic performance, may be getting involved in neighborhoods that not only have opportunities for involvement but also have the other neighborhood elements cited in the above literature. Future research should include an analysis of the neighborhood environment to examine the influence of the presence and absence of these elements when opportunities for involvement are both present and absent to investigate the interactive effect of these elements with ECV and actual involvement and their relationship to academic performance.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, interventions aimed at targeting adolescents with a lot of exposure to community violence may tap other neighborhood, home, or school resources rather than those neighborhood-based resources that adolescents may have linked to their negative experiences in their neighborhoods. Specifically, youth outreach programs aimed at providing structured academic, social, and personal enrichment activities should recruit adolescents through schools, churches, and existing facilities in their neighborhoods. This recruitment strategy would provide adolescents from multiple neighborhoods with opportunities to be involved in activities and exposure to individuals that may help them cope with the challenges faced in their neighborhoods.</p>
