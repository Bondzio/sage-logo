<abstract>
<p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)1 and NOD2 are intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) gene family involved in innate immune responses. Their centrally located NACHT domain displays ATPase activity and is necessary for activation and oligomerization leading to inflammatory signaling responses. Mutations affecting key residues of the ATPase domain of NOD2 are linked to severe auto-inflammatory diseases, such as Blau syndrome and early-onset sarcoidosis. By mutational dissection of the ATPase domain function, we show that the NLR-specific extended Walker B box (DGhDE) can functionally replace the canonical Walker B sequence (DDhWD) found in other ATPases. A requirement for an intact Walker A box and the magnesium-co-ordinating aspartate of the classical Walker B box suggest that an initial ATP hydrolysis step is necessary for activation of both NOD1 and NOD2. In contrast, a Blau-syndrome associated mutation located in the extended Walker B box of NOD2 that results in higher autoactivation and ligand-induced signaling does not affect NOD1 function. Moreover, mutation of a conserved histidine in the NACHT domain also has contrasting effects on NOD1 and NOD2 mediated NF-κB activation. We conclude that these two NLRs employ different modes of activation and propose distinct models for activation of NOD1 and NOD2.</p>

<p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)1 and NOD2 are intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) gene family that are involved in host defence against pathogens by recognition of so called microbe associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) (reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425910394002">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910394002">3</xref></sup>). The NLRs have a tripartite domain architecture similar to apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1). Signal transduction of activated NLRs relies on the N-terminal effector domain, which adopts a death domain fold, and is either a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) as in the case for NOD1 and NOD2, or a pyrin domain (PYD). However, some NLR members (such as NLRX1 and NLRC5) have no obvious CARD or PYD homolog N-terminal domains. The effector domain is followed by the centrally located NACHT-WH-SH domain mediating activation and oligomerization of the protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910394002">4</xref></sup> Finally, the C-terminal part, a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), constitutes the recognition motif for their cognate MAMPs.</p>
<p>NOD1 and NOD2 sense specific fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) in the cytoplasm and their minimal elicitor motifs are <sc>L</sc>-Ala-γ-<sc>D</sc>-Glu-<italic>meso</italic>-diaminopimelic acid (triDAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425910394002">5</xref></sup> and muramyl dipeptide (MDP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425910394002">6</xref></sup> respectively. Recognition of these elicitors induces NACHT-mediated oligomerization and formation of a signaling platform, that recruits the downstream CARD domain containing adaptor receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2; also called RICK or RIP2) through homotypic CARD–CARD interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910394002">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910394002">8</xref></sup> Thereby, RIPK2 is activated by induced proximity and subsequently triggers NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades (reviewed by Kufer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425910394002">9</xref></sup>). The NOD1 and NOD2 are tightly regulated molecular switches and mutations in their genes leading to a gain-of-function phenotype, have been linked with severe auto-inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>Like all NLRs, NOD1 and NOD2 are members of the signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) clade within the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) ATPase superfamily. Experimental evidence obtained from several STAND ATPases, like the bacterial transcription regulator MalT and the human regulator of apoptosis APAF-1, led to the development of a model for the activation of AAA+ ATPases. It suggests cycling of the protein between a monomeric, inactive and a multimeric, active state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910394002">10</xref></sup> Elicitor recognition leads to conformational changes of the ADP-bound molecule, which finally allows nucleotide exchange to ATP. The ATP-bound NLR then oligomerizes to form an active platform that recruits downstream signaling adaptors. According to this model, only one ATP hydrolysis step is needed, namely to switch the signaling platform off and to return the molecule into a closed, ADP-bound, resting state. However, this model is based on experimental data of only a limited number of STAND ATPases characterized to date. Adenosine triphosphate binding and hydrolysis in AAA+ ATPases is mediated by conserved residues within the ATPase domain, most prominent the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B box.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910394002">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910394002">11</xref></sup> The Walker A box is crucial for ATP binding which is mediated by a conserved lysine residue (GKS/T; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425910394002">Table 1</xref>). The Walker B box (DD/E) consists of two acidic residues: the first (aspartate) co-ordinates the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation and is required for ATP binding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910394002">12</xref></sup> whereas the second (usually glutamate) primes a water molecule for ATP hydrolysis. Previous work revealed that all NLRs, with the exception of NAIP and NLRP11, contain a modified Walker B box, where the second acidic residue is missing (DG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910394002">4</xref></sup> Instead, they contain two conserved acidic residues distal to the Walker B box, which we term extended Walker B box (DGhDE), suggesting that NLRs might be activated differently than other AAA+ family members. This raises the question of how exactly nucleotide hydrolysis is carried out in NLR proteins and, in particular, if the extended Walker B box can replace the function of the classical Walker B box. In fact, there is indication of a pivotal function of the extended Walker B box in NOD2 signaling provided by the analysis of mutations in <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic>, that are found in patients with Blau syndrome (BS) and early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS), two autosomal dominant genetic disorders characterized by granulomatous inflammation of multiple organs. At least one mutation of NOD2 that correlates with the development of BS and increased basal NOD2-mediated NF-κB activity – E383K – is located in the extended Walker B box.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910394002">13</xref></sup> Additionally, the EOS-associated NOD2 D382E/A612T mutation, also affects a residue in the extended Walker B box,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910394002">14</xref></sup> indicating a common molecular mechanism for the development of NLR-mediated auto-inflammatory diseases.

<p>Here, we characterized the mechanistic details underlying activation of human NOD1 and NOD2. Functional analysis of conserved residues in their NACHT domains revealed that the Walker A and B box, Sensor 1 and GxP motif are crucial for activation of both NOD1 and NOD2. Most interestingly, we elucidated a fundamental difference in NOD1 and NOD2 activation, as several gain-of-function mutations in the NOD2 NACHT domain are non-functional in NOD1.</p>

<p>In order to decipher the molecular details involved in NOD1 and NOD2 activation, we analyzed the role of conserved residues predicted to be involved in ATP-binding and hydrolysis. Based on sequence alignments of the human NLRs and APAF-1, we previously identified highly conserved residues in the NACHT domain which supposedly affect ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910394002">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425910394002">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910394002">4</xref></sup> To determine their role in NOD1 and NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation, we mutated these residues and evaluated their effect on elicitor- and autoactivation-induced NF-κB activity in luciferase reporter gene assays in HEK293T cells. Overexpression of NOD1 and NOD2 is known to induce autoactivation; therefore, the amount of NOD1 and NOD2 used was carefully titrated in preliminary assays (data not shown) and three established DNA concentrations were used for each construct.

The NLR proteins, however, contain a modified Walker B box which lacks the second acidic residue (DG instead of DD) that is usually responsible for priming of a water molecule and required for ATP hydrolysis.<sup>4</sup> However, in most NLR proteins, including NOD1 and NOD2, the Walker B box is followed by a highly conserved patch of acidic residues, the extended Walker B box (DGhDE), suggesting that these acidic residues can functionally compensate for the missing second aspartate of the canonical Walker B box. To establish the function of this modified Walker B box, we replaced the corresponding amino acids in NOD1 and NOD2 by alanine. Mutation of the first aspartic acid of the extended Walker B box (NOD1, D287; NOD2, D382) significantly reduced elicitor-mediated NF-κB activation and led to loss of autoactivation of both NOD1 and NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>A,B). This suggested that this residue of the extended Walker B box can functionally complement the missing second acidic residue of a canonical Walker B box in NLRs. In agreement, also the second acidic residue of the extended Walker B box (E288) was found to be essential for NF-κB activation and displayed an even stronger phenotype in NOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>A). In sharp contrast, mutation of the corresponding amino acid in NOD2 (E383) led to significantly increased basal NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>B). This unexpected finding revealed a fundamentally different function of the extended Walker B box residues in NOD1 and NOD2 signaling. Of note, this result fits very well with the fact that natural occurring mutations in the extended Walker B box residues lead to autoactivation of NOD2, whereas such mutations have not yet been reported for NOD1. Mutations in the NOD2 extended Walker B box are associated with early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS, D382E/A612T)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910394002">14</xref></sup> and BS (E383K),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910394002">13</xref></sup> two severe auto-inflammatory human diseases resulting in hyperactive NOD2. In our assay system, we could recapitulate this phenotype and observed that both NOD2 D382E and E383K led to enhanced autoactivation compared to the wild-type, whereas a somewhat lower response was observed with MDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>C). Of note, the EOS mutation D382E displayed less hyperactivity than the E383K mutation which we attributed to the fact that we used NOD2 D382E instead of a double mutant D382E/A612T usually found in patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910394002">14</xref></sup> Since both glutamate and aspartate are acidic residues, we suggest that glutamate partially adopts the function of D382.

<p>Next, we explored the contribution of the conserved ATPase-related features Sensor 1, the GxP motif, and the WH-histidine to NOD1 and NOD2 activation. The Sensor 1 motif is involved in co-ordinating the γ-phosphate of ATP, whereas the conserved proline residue in the GxP motif is thought to interact with the adenine moiety of ATP (for review, see Hanson and Whiteheart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910394002">11</xref></sup>). Mutation of the Sensor 1 domain in NOD1 (R333A) resulted in complete loss of NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>A), whereas the corresponding mutation in NOD2 (R426A) still showed residual NF-κB activation after MDP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>B). Mutation of the conserved proline in the GxP motif abolished elicitor-dependent NF-κB activation in both NOD1 (P391A) and NOD2 (P486A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>A,B). Furthermore, mutation of the WH-histidine completely blocked NF-κB activation by NOD1 (H517A). In contrast, NOD2 H603A was still able to respond to MDP, albeit at reduced levels compared to the wild-type and showed increased autoactivation-mediated NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910394002">Fig. 2</xref>A,B). The latter finding was similar to the results obtained when exchanging the glutamic acid in the extended Walker B box supporting our conclusion that NOD1 and NOD2 are differentially activated.

<p>Taken together, we conclude that a functional Walker A and B box as well as Sensor 1 and GxP motifs are crucial for NOD1 and NOD2 activation. Most importantly, we assign a function to the extended Walker B box in NLRs and demonstrate that mutations of the extended Walker B box and the WH-histidine have opposing effects on NOD1- and NOD2-mediated signaling, revealing different mechanisms for their activation and regulation.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1753425910394002"><title>The NOD1 and NOD2 activation status is reflected by their subcellular localization</title>
<p>Recently, we and others reported that exogenously expressed active NOD1 and NOD2 localize to the plasma membrane in different human cells which relates to autoactivation of the overexpressed NLRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910394002">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910394002">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425910394002">21</xref></sup> In order to complement the results from the NF-κB activation assays presented above in a further cell-line and read-out, we determined the subcellular localization of the described NOD1 and NOD2 constructs in HeLa cells by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910394002">Figure 3</xref>A shows that only NOD1 wild-type localized to actin-rich regions at the plasma membrane, whereas all mutants of NOD1 that did not display autoactivation in the NF-κB reporter assays (NOD1 K208A, D284A, E288A, R333A, P391A, and H517A) were restricted to the cytoplasm. Accordingly, also NOD1 D287A, which showed only elictor-mediated activation failed to localize to the plasma membrane upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910394002">Fig. 3</xref>A). Similar results were obtained for NOD2. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of NOD2 revealed pronounced membrane localization of the wild-type, the highly auto-active NOD2 mutant E383A, and to a lesser extent NOD2 H603A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910394002">Fig. 3</xref>B). The two disease-associated NOD2 mutants D382E (EOS) and E383K (BS), which exhibited the highest autoactivation in the NF-κB assays showed also a prominent membrane recruitment, whereas non-signaling active NOD2 mutants (NOD2 K305R, D379A, D382A, R426A, and P486A) exhibited an explicitly cytoplasmic localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910394002">Fig. 3</xref>B). To analyze if the membrane-bound fraction of NOD1 is in exchange with the cytoplasmic pool, we used NOD1 fused to a photo-activatable (PA) version of GFP. A region in the cytosol of HeLa cells transiently transfected with this construct was activated by a 405 nm laser pulse. Subsequently, the subcellular distribution of the activated (green) NOD1 protein was monitored. This revealed that NOD1 was readily recruited to the plasma membrane, indicating that the pool of NOD1 (and likely also NOD2) at the membrane reflects a steady state equilibrium exchange of NOD1 between a membrane bound fraction and a cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910394002">Fig. 4</xref>A).

<p>To substantiate the different membrane association of the NOD1 and NOD2 mutants, we furthermore conducted membrane fractionations in HEK293T cells transfected with different versions of NOD1 and NOD2. In line with the data obtained in the immunofluorescence analysis in HeLa cells, wild-type NOD1 and wild-type NOD2 as well as the auto-activating mutants NOD2 E383A and NOD2 H603A were found to be present in the membrane fraction, whereas the non-autoactivating mutants NOD1 K208A, NOD1 D287A, NOD1 E288A and NOD1 H517A as well as NOD2 K305R and NOD2 D382A were only detectable in the cytosolic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910394002">Fig. 4</xref>B). In summary, this showed that membrane recruitment of NOD1 and NOD2 reflects their activation status. It also confirmed the conclusions from the NF-κB activation assays, supporting different functions of the second extended Walker B residue and the conserved histidine in the WH motif in NOD1 versus NOD2 activation.</p>

<p>Both, NOD1 and NOD2 are pivotal PRRs that mediate induction of innate and adaptive immune responses in the mammalian host and are involved in regulating tissue and immune homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910394002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425910394002">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910394002">23</xref></sup> Studies in mice suggest that lack of either of these NLRs results in reduced immune competence of the affected animals. In contrast, certain polymorphisms in NOD2 increase its activity and are linked to severe inflammatory diseases, suggesting that NOD2 hyperactivation can be detrimental to the host. However, our picture of the molecular details underlying activation and control of NOD1 and NOD2 still remains fragmentary. In particular, despite the general perception that members of the NLR family function as nucleotide binding proteins, the role of ATP hydrolysis in NLR signaling is poorly understood. Since no structural data on full-length or LRR-deleted NLRs are available at present, the current model of NLR activation is deducted from their apoptotic relative APAF-1 and from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on purified NLR proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910394002">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425910394002">25</xref></sup> Sequence analysis and homology modeling revealed that most NLRs not only share similar domain architecture with APAF-1, but also display a high degree of conservation within catalytically important motifs. Furthermore, by using purified NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP12, and NLRC4 (IPAF) several groups established that these NLR family members do bind and hydrolyze ATP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910394002">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425910394002">27</xref></sup> Accordingly, to these studies the general assumption has been that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are required for the function of these proteins, <italic>i.e</italic>. for the induction of higher molecular platforms that promote downstream signaling events. To date, it has been unclear how these proteins achieve nucleotide hydrolysis despite their obvious lack of the second acidic Walker B residue required for catalysis. In the present study, we explain the evident ATPase activity of NLR proteins by systematically analyzing the functional role of highly conserved residues in the NACHT domain of NOD1 and NOD2 and their impact on NF-κB activation. Our data indicate that ATP binding is essential for both NOD1 and NOD2 signaling as the Walker A box residue in NOD1 (K208) and NOD2 (K305) turned out to be crucial for activation. This finding is supported by previously published reports, which show that NOD1 and NOD2 require ATP binding for activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910394002">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910394002">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, we could assign a functional role of the Walker B box in NOD1 (D284) and NOD2 (D379), which is essential for co-ordination of the magnesium ion required for catalyzing the nucleotide hydrolysis step. Mutations affecting this residue lead to complete loss of signaling. Therefore, we conclude that NOD1 and NOD2 use a nucleotide hydrolysis step for their activation. Hitherto, the fact that most NLRs contain a modified Walker B box, which lacks the second acidic residue required for hydrolysis (DG instead of DD) has not been addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910394002">4</xref></sup> This raises the question how exactly nucleotide hydrolysis is carried out in NLR proteins. In a recent study, Ye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910394002">24</xref></sup> used an NLRP12 Walker A/B box mutant where the Walker A signature and the first acidic residues of the classic and extended Walker B box were mutated to alanine (GKS → AAA and DxxDE → AxxAE). This variant of NLRP12 displayed decreased ATP binding capacity and no ATPase activity. However, this study did not identify the specific function of the individual catalytic residues involved. Therefore, we explicitly aimed to identify the residues that complement for the function of the missing second acidic residue in the classic Walker B box. To this end, we introduced single point mutations in NOD1 and NOD2 affecting the corresponding residues of the extended Walker B box. While mutation of the first acidic residue of the extended Walker B box in NOD1 (D287A) dampened autoactivation and reduced elicitor-mediated NF-κB activation to about 50% compared to wild-type, mutation of the second acidic residue (E288A) almost completely blocked NF-κB activation. Remarkably, mutations of the corresponding residues in NOD2 had significantly different effects. Exchange of the first acidic residue of the extended Walker B box to alanine in NOD2 (D382A) almost completely abolished NF-κB activation. On the contrary, NOD2 E383A exhibited elicitor-mediated NF-κB activation and displayed significantly higher autoactivation compared to wild-type NOD2. This important finding shows that the extended Walker B in NLR proteins compensates for the second acidic  Walker B residue usually found in ATPases. Notably, the EOS- and BS-associated mutations in NOD2 affect the two acidic residues of the extended Walker B box (D382E and E383K). Whereas NOD2 D382E was already known to be a gain-of-function mutation, we showed that also the BS-associated E383K mutation increased basal NF-κB activation. These data indicate that E383 is required for NOD2 deactivation. Mutation of this residue necessarily leads to autoactivation, most likely because the NOD2 signaling platform is trapped in an ‘on’ state incapable of returning into a dormant form. Analysis of auxiliary residues important for ATPase activity showed that mutations in the Sensor 1 motif, the GxP and the WH-histidine motif of NOD1 resulted in complete loss of NF-κB activation, providing evidence that these motifs are implicated in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Since no autoactivation for any of these NOD1 mutants was observed, we propose an important role for the respective motifs in co-ordinating ATP binding and or the first ATP hydrolysis step. Accordingly, mutation of the GxP motif in NOD2 also resulted in complete loss of NF-κB signaling and a mutated Sensor 1 led to significantly reduced NF-κB activation. In contrast, the NOD2 WH-histidine mutant (H603A) only showed reduced NF-κB activation (about 50% compared to wild-type), and exhibited even higher levels of autoactivation than wild-type NOD2. This further supports fundamental differences in the mode of activation used by NOD1 and NOD2. To substantiate the data obtained in HEK293T cells, we additionally analyzed the subcellular localization of the NOD1 and NOD2 mutants in HeLa cells. In accordance with recent reports showing that signaling active NOD1 and NOD2 are recruited to the plasma membrane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910394002">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910394002">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425910394002">21</xref></sup> we observed a membrane association only for constructs displaying autoactivation in the NF-κB assay. This result was also confirmed by biochemical cellular fractionation in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910394002">Fig. 4</xref>B).</p>
<p>Analysis of photo-activatable GFP-tagged NOD1 indicated that the membrane fraction of NOD1 was in a stead-state exchange with the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910394002">Fig. 4</xref>A). We, therefore, propose that NOD1 and NOD2 constantly switch to autoactivation in the cytosol and thereby get recruited to the plasma membrane where they are finally de-activated in a steady-state process. This process likely explains the presence of a small fraction of endogenous NOD1 and NOD2 found at the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910394002">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910394002">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425910394002">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425910394002">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we show for the first time that the extended Walker B in NLR proteins compensates for the second acidic Walker B residue usually found in ATPases and that this domain and the WH histidine have a different functional implication in NOD1 and NOD2 signaling.</p>
<p>The current model for the activation mechanism of ‘nodosome’ formation comprises the following steps: (i) elicitor recognition; (ii) conformational changes leading to a semi-opened state; (iii) nucleotide exchange (ATP for ADP) to drive oligomerization; and (iv) deactivation of the signaling platform by ATP hydrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910394002">10</xref></sup> According to this model, an ATP hydrolysis step is necessary only to stop signaling and, consequently, mutations of residues crucial for ATP hydrolysis should result in autoactivation. Our data do not entirely support this model for NOD1 and NOD2, as they clearly show that certain mutations in NOD1 and NOD2 that have a crucial function in ATP hydrolysis completely abolish NF-κB activation. We provide evidence that an initial ATP hydrolysis step is required for NOD1 and NOD2 activation and subsequent signaling. However, while NOD1 seems to require only one ATP hydrolysis step for activation, NOD2 uses an additional hydrolysis step for deactivation: Thus NOD2 requires: (i) a first ATP hydrolysis step essential for its activation; and (ii) a second ATP hydrolysis step mediated by the second acidic residue of the extended Walker B box (E383), that is crucial for proper deactivation of the NOD2 signaling platform.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between NOD1 and NOD2 deactivation could be explained by different oligomerization mechanisms. Based on the overall similarity of the NLR proteins with APAF-1 and cryo-EM analysis of recombinant NLRP1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425910394002">27</xref></sup> we assume that NOD2 forms wheel-like oligomers where E383 is necessary for the second ATP hydrolysis step which is crucial for NOD2 deactivation. Results obtained for NOD1, however, indicate that NOD1 might not form such multimeric signaling complexes, as the corresponding residue is not involved in its deactivation, but rather in the activation process. NOD1, therefore, might use a mechanism other than ATP hydrolysis for deactivation. Of note, the NOD1 CARD domain was recently reported to form dimers, which could be involved in the different formation of a signaling complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425910394002">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>This model also predicts that NOD2 is more prone for autoactivation <italic>in vivo</italic> than NOD1. Indeed, to obtain comparable autoactivation in transient transfection assays less NOD2 is needed than NOD1 (data not shown) and numerous auxiliary control factors that negatively affect NOD2 activation have been reported. Contrary, only a limited number of factors have been proposed to function in controlling NOD1 (reviewed by Kufer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425910394002">9</xref></sup>). In addition, NOD1 and NOD2 show different expression profiles and are linked to specific downstream signaling processes. Whereas both proteins can activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways by TAK1, NOD1 might also act on caspase-8 pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425910394002">31</xref></sup> In contrast, NOD2 has also been implicated in the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and type I interferon responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425910394002">32</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425910394002">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, autoactivation seems to be prevented <italic>in vivo</italic> by low protein expression.
