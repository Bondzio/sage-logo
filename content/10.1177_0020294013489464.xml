<p>The Royal Academy of Engineering, in collaboration with Engineering Council (United Kingdom) and a number of the leading professional engineering institutions, has created a Statement of Ethical Principles to which it believes all professional engineers and related bodies should subscribe.</p>
<p>Professional Engineers work to enhance the welfare, health and safety of all while paying due regard to the environment and the sustainability of resources. They have made personal and professional commitments to enhance the well-being of society through the exploitation of knowledge and the management of creative teams.</p>
<p>This Statement of Ethical Principles sets a standard to which members of the engineering profession should aspire in their working habits and relationships. There are four fundamental principles that should guide an engineer in achieving the high ideals of professional life. These express the beliefs and values of the profession and are amplified below.</p>
