<p>One of the reasonable criticisms of rehabilitation research is that it is often difficult to know what treatment intervention was actually given. Nowhere is this more true than for ‘cognitive rehabilitation’ (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2012.680891">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09602011.2012.680891</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512460167">1</xref></sup>). This issue includes two new studies of cognitive rehabilitation where interventions are described, hopefully in sufficient detail to allow replication. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511435424">One on people with memory problems</related-article> includes people with a mixture of neurological disorders, which helps generalisation. Conversely, <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434997">the other focuses on a single disorder</related-article>, but a variety of cognitive deficits. The intervention is also described specifically in photographs in a trial <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512441484">comparing two taping techniques for people with back pain</related-article>, in which there was a minor symptomatic difference only. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511435688">Whole body vibration</related-article> is another easily described treatment, and is compared with exercise as a treatment to improve function in frail older people in a trial where it seemed to have a short-term functional benefit. In contrast, the neurodevelopmental or Bobath treatment approach has always been difficult to describe and <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434648">in a randomised controlled trial in this issue it is compared with a metronome</related-article> as a way of altering gait pattern; it was found that the differences are small. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511431902">Neuromuscular stimulation</related-article> is another treatment that is, or should be, easy to describe and a systematic review managed to obtain descriptions for the studies included – but there was considerable variation in the parameters used and no firm conclusion can be drawn about its use for people with osteo-arthritis of the knee. Another problem for systematic reviewers is the variety of measures of outcome used, and perhaps some reduction will occur in studies of osteoarthritis of the knee or hip following <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434993">a comparative study of six measures</related-article>. However, further studies should continue to compare measures. Recent concerns about the introduction of technologically-based treatments (prosthetic hips) without adequate research can be mirrored for technological measures, and <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434994">a systematic review on the use of ultrasound to measure muscle size</related-article> shows that there is little evidence of reliability. Last but not least, <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512460167" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434995">a study on podiatry and foot care in rheumatoid arthritis</related-article> shows that we pay little attention to feet despite their obvious importance.</p>
