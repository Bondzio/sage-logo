<p>This handbook by McKinley and McVittie effectively presents the contributions of discursive researchers worldwide in various fields of social psychology. The preface identifies it as the ‘first general book on social psychology and discourse’, which is organized around central themes of social psychology (i.e. groups, attraction and relationships, health or organizations), instead of presenting the strands of discursive research. This book is oriented towards both undergraduate and postgraduate students of social psychology. In effect, it is divided into 13 chapters, each a ‘stand-alone’ text.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the two core themes of the book – social psychology and discourse. It elaborates on their space of intersection, that is qualitative research in social psychology. Furthermore, it introduces the different traditions of discursive research. The following chapters (Chapters 2–11), forming the core of the book, overview in detail the discursive research on central thematic areas of social psychology. They bear the titles: ‘Self and Identity’, ‘Groups’, ‘Attraction and Relationships’, ‘Social Cognition’, ‘Attitudes and Persuasion’, ‘Prejudice’, ‘Dispute and Aggression’, ‘Social Psychology, Law and Order’, ‘Social Psychology and Health’, and ‘Social Psychology and Organizations’. Each chapter starts with a general introduction to the thematic area, followed by an authoritative presentation of the contributions of discursive research to the topic. The discursive social psychological theory is illustrated and empirically grounded by extracts of discourse data, in various lengths.</p>
<p>The last two chapters focus more on specific theoretical issues of discursive research. Chapter 12 examines the side-arguments of the debates within the field, on the ‘external context’, ‘membership categorization analysis’ and ‘social constructionism vs realism’. The final chapter, ambitiously entitled ‘Social Psychology in the 21st Century’, brings back into perspective the differences between discursive and experimental research in social psychology. These two systematic positions evolve into the methodological directives of ‘research independence’ and ‘research integration’. The former claims that the discursive and experimental tradition are mutually exclusive, while the latter advances the possibility of mixing the two methodologies. Even though this chapter is the most theoretical of the book, advancing an interesting viewpoint in the realm of discourse studies, it is nevertheless the most abstract-termed chapter, grounded in Wittgensteinian philosophical theories and methodological integrative arguments, and ends up being quite heavy to be grasped by students not so familiar with the scholarly discussions within discursive social psychology.</p>
<p>A very helpful feature of the book is the pattern structure of all the chapters, designed with a student readership in mind. Each chapter begins with a page containing a list of the topics covered and a list of key terms to be encountered, rendering it easy to scan the chapter diagonally. It ends with a summary-box, a suggested activity and further reading references. What I, as a graduate student perplexed by the intricacies of discourse theory, found most appealing were the text boxes at the foot of a page. They serve to provide ultra-brief definitions of the hard-to-understand key terms of professional jargon discussed in the text, helping one to clarify misunderstandings, revise on theory and, why not, discover new theoretical ideas. All these text boxes of definitions comprise the alphabetically ordered ‘glossary’ at the end of the book, making it easy for the reader to track definitions of terminology. The ‘classic text’ boxes in every chapter serve also to remind the reader of the historical development of the research informing each chapter.</p>
<p>This handbook comes in just at the right time as there is a proliferation of discursive research and teaching in the faculties of psychology and social sciences worldwide. In the meantime, discourse study is becoming even more diverse by drawing on many different disciplines. For a scholar of discourse in social psychology, it can be a reference text for the contributions of discursive research in so many fields of the discipline. For a potential teacher of introductory courses, it can be useful as an additional reference handbook providing a detailed introduction in the discourse tradition, aimed at novice students. More advanced students of social sciences will find this book an interesting stepping-stone text for the exploration of more in-depth research in the relevant fields of social sciences and humanities.</p>
