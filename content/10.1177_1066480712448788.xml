<abstract>
<p>Parallel process and isomorphism are two supervisory concepts that are often discussed independently but rarely discussed in connection with each other. These two concepts, philosophically, have different historical roots, as well as different implications for interventions with regard to the supervisory triad. The authors examine the difference between the two concepts, as well as present a new model of decision making, the iso-para/para-iso (IPPI) model, to inform supervisors’ interventions in the supervisory triad.</p>

<p>Relationships permeate human existence and have the potential to provide emotional connections, increase well-being, and provide a contextual format for interpersonal learning to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). Clinical supervision is a professional relationship, which provides an environment in which to learn how to become a counselor. As such, supervisory relationships tend to be complex and multidimensional. Contributing to the complexity is the potential for numerous individuals to impact the supervisory session besides the supervisor and supervisee. The supervisory relationship may be impacted by individuals who are not present during supervision, such as the client, yet this presence profoundly impacts the quality of the supervision taking place. While the relationship system in a supervisory context could include a myriad of other persons, for the purpose of this article the authors will be limiting the discussion to include three people: the supervisor, the supervisee, and the client.</p>
<p>Within the supervisory triad numerous communicative exchanges take place, not surprising is that within these exchanges the potential exists for both parallel process and isomorphism to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). In counselor education, these two terms are often used interchangeably; yet philosophically, these terms come from very different historical roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>). Parallel process is grounded in psychodynamic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448788">Morrissey &amp; Tribe, 2001</xref>), while isomorphism has roots in systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>). Though similar in definition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard and Goodyear (2009)</xref> have described these two terms as a coin and have further contended that the terms are uniquely distinct. Further exploration of these two distinct terms provides insight regarding supervisee experiences that impact their growth and development as a counselor. The authors will define parallel process and isomorphism, as well as present a model for decision making in the supervisory triad.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712448788">
<title>Parallel Process</title>
<p>As previously stated, parallel process originates from psychodynamic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448788">Morrissey &amp; Tribe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448788">Schneider, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>) and is a phenomenon that is reflective of interpersonal relationships of both the supervisee and the supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). Parallel process is an intrapsychic phenomenon that unconsciously occurs on the part of the supervisee and originates in a relationship in one setting and is reflected in a relationship in a different setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448788">Jacobsen, 2007</xref>). For the supervisee, this phenomenon often occurs as a characteristic of the client portrayed by the supervisee in the context of supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448788">Friedlander, Siegel, &amp; Brenock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448788">Jacobsen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While this relationship parallel has often been viewed as an enigmatic phenomenon, parallel process is generated by some process at work in the client–counselor relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448788">Friedlander et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, it is not within the supervisee’s or client’s awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>); therefore, the supervisee is the means of expression regarding the process from the counseling relationship to the supervisory relationship, making it critical for supervisors to be able to recognize it. Parallel process can present in numerous ways in supervision, for example, a client may present as angry in session during a confrontation. In supervision the following week, the counselor presents as angry when the supervisor suggests some potential courses of action. More than likely, the counselor is not aware that he or she is essentially presenting the same characteristic in supervision that the client brings to counseling. The question of how to approach parallel process as a supervisor is addressed in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1066480712448788">
<title>Supervisory Interventions for Parallel Process</title>
<p>The purpose of supervision is twofold: protect client welfare and promote supervisee professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). When considering parallel process with regard to supervision, the supervisor notices similarities between the supervisee’s reactions and the client’s reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448788">Jacobsen, 2007</xref>). In a qualitative, single case study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448788">Jacobsen (2007)</xref> contended that when supervisors recognize parallel process they must, first, contain anxiety and then point out the parallel process directly while maintaining the supervisory alliance. Furthermore, the supervisor has the opportunity to role model an intervention that is in accordance with the verbal content and spirit of what the supervisor intends; otherwise, it is possible that an isomorphism could be occurring in the supervisory triad.</p>
<p>Using the original example given above (angry client and supervisee), the supervisor might validate the supervisee’s anger and then point out the parallel process occurring with regard to the client’s anger, as well as the supervisee’s own anger at the confrontation. The supervisor then might take the role of counselor and help the supervisee further explore their own reactions and feelings with regard to confrontation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480712448788">
<title>Isomorphism</title>
<p>Unlike the intrapsychic nature of parallel process, isomorphism is inter-relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). Originally, this concept was developed in the field of mathematics and was later developed in the field of family therapy as a systemic counterpart to parallel process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448788">Kaufman, Morgan, &amp; Ladany, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>). Systemic supervisors tend to focus on the inter-relational and systemic structural similarities between counseling and supervision with supervisees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>) and recognize that the patterns that emerge are bidirectional in that they can emerge from counseling into supervision and supervision into counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>So, while isomorphism has often been used interchangeably with the term parallel process, it is quite different with regard to focus. Parallel process’s focus is intrapsychic or internal, an interpersonal dynamic that occurs in both counseling and supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448788">Bradley &amp; Gould, 2001</xref>), while isomorphism’s focus is inter-relational and presents itself as replicating structural patterns between counseling and supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>). When replicating patterns between counseling and supervision occur, the role of the supervisee and supervisor duplicate the role of client and counselor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>). Essentially, an isomorphism is a repetitive relational pattern that occurs in supervision, and this focus on a recurrent pattern is what separates a parallel process from an isomorphism. It is critical for the supervisor to be aware of isomorphism in order to be aware of his or her own process in order to identify similar dynamics in the supervisory relationship that are occurring in the counseling relationship.</p>
<p>If an isomorphism were to occur during supervision, this is how it might look—using the angry client from the parallel process example—the counselor during the session would ignore the anger; therefore, never giving the client valuable feedback. In the supervisory session, the supervisor also ignores the anger from the supervisee; therefore, the supervisee never receives valuable feedback. This is an example of an isomorphism; essentially the inter-relational pattern occurring in counseling is now occurring in supervision. This is why it is so critical for supervisors to be aware of the isomorphic phenomenon as patterns of relational interaction in the supervisory relationship have the potential to imitate patterns of interaction in the counseling relationship. So, the question at this juncture is how would a supervisor intervene?</p>
<sec id="section4-1066480712448788">
<title>Supervisory Intervention for Isomorphism</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448788">White and Russell (1997)</xref> have made some suggestions based upon their qualitative study regarding the use of isomorphism in marriage and family therapy supervision. The researchers used a Delphi method to explore with a panel of marriage and family therapy supervisors the importance and relevance of isomorphism to therapy and supervision. From that study, some suggestions for supervision emerged. First, when discussing isomorphism with supervisees, one must determine whether discussing the isomorphic interaction will help the supervisee know what to do with the client. In the example cited above, will addressing the isomorphic pattern of anger at confrontation elicit a change or shift in the therapeutic relationship? Second, White and Russell suggested that the use of isomorphism should not be oversimplified. The results of their study indicated that while counseling and supervision do overlap with regard to repeating patterns, supervision is much more complex. There is an overt focus on conceptualization and theory for the purpose of training that contributes to increased complexity in the triad. They advise supervisors to avoid overusing isomorphism during supervision.</p>
<p>Again, using the example outlined in the parallel process section, identification must occur: is the anger a replicating pattern or a circumstance unique to that particular supervision session? The supervisor could use transparency regarding their reaction to the anger from the supervisee in session. In addition, the supervisor could point out the isomorphism taking place and provide some teaching regarding how to approach anger in a counseling session through modeling with the supervisee. By taking the above outlined actions, hopefully the isomorphism is shifted in a more positive direction. However, when presenting the supervisee with the isomorphism, care must be taken to ensure that the disclosure will aid in the development of the supervisee as a counselor.</p>
<p>Even with the above suggestions outlined for both parallel process and isomorphism, it is often difficult deciding how to intervene with supervisees. Contributing to the difficulty is that parallel process and isomorphism are, often, experienced simultaneously in supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). The supervisor must decide whether or not it would be more beneficial to the supervisee to intervene intrapsychically or systemically. What follows is a discussion of a model to aid supervisors in identification of the two phenomena, as well as a diagram to aid in deciding how to intervene in supervision to provide optimal results with regard to counselor development. This model suggests that while these two concepts are uniquely different, the presentation in supervision is likely to occur simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480712448788">
<title>The Iso-Para/Para-Iso (IPPI) Model</title>
<p>As stated earlier, supervision tends to be complex and multidimensional; therefore, the IPPI model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066480712448788">Figure 1</xref>) was developed for three reasons: (1) to aid in the distinction between the two concepts, and (2) to aid supervisors in decision making with regard to supervisee intervention, and (3) to accommodate the complexity of the two concepts. Given that the supervisory triad consist of a complex dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>), it is not surprising that distinguishing between a parallel process and an isomorphism can also be complex. It is often too simple to assume that it is one or the other. This model was developed to not only distinguish between the two concepts, but provide a model for when the answer is best served that it is both a parallel process and an isomorphism.</p>

<title>Explaining the IPPI Model</title>
<p>The IPPI model was deliberately constructed to visually aid the supervisor when making complex decisions related to parallel process and isomorphism. When the first author was a student in her doctoral program, these concepts were discussed in a supervision class. Initially, during class there was some confusion regarding the distinction between the two concepts. To aid in understanding, the first author brought in an initial diagram to understand the concepts, which was later developed into the current IPPI model with the help of the instructor and her cohort. However, given that the visual diagram was useful to the class, it was later decided to develop the concept further to help other individuals who learn and understand with visual means. The diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066480712448788">Figure 1</xref>) has many visual clues to understand and distinguish between the two concepts—parallel process and isomorphism. It was developed to aid visual learners in understanding the two processes, as well as facilitates a decision-making process for appropriate intervention in the supervisory relationship. </p>
<p>For example, the parallel process box has parallel lines providing a visual clue regarding this process in the supervisory relationship, and the isomorphism is represented by an hexagon with points representing a systems perspective. The center circle is more prominent and is indicative of how both concepts often present at the same time. Similarly, the arrows above the circle represent the complexity of parallel process and isomorphism by depicting the notion that both could be occurring, and deciding which direction to intervene in the supervisory does not necessarily mean that both (parallel process and isomorphism) are addressed. The arrows are indicative of two focus questions: (1) Should the focus be long term or short term? and (2) Should the focus be intrapsychic or relational?</p>
<p>Essentially, the arrows are symbolic of the choices that must be made in the supervisory with regard to which direction to intervene first. The question box reiterates the steps that will be addressed in the next section of this article as a reminder regarding how to use the model. Determining an intervention starts with personal awareness of the supervisor regarding their own impact on the triad, in addition to what will be more impactful with regard to professional growth for the supervisee and whether the triad requires long-term or short-term intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480712448788">
<title>Using the IPPI Model Diagram</title>
<p>There are four steps to consider when using the diagram to determine intervention in supervisory situations in which parallel process and/or isomorphism might be occurring. In the first step, decide whether an intervention is needed. Often, this process involves supervision of your own supervision to begin to hone one’s ability to recognize parallel process and isomorphism within the supervisory triad. Using the diagram, determine whether what you are witnessing is a parallel process, or whether what you are witnessing is an isomorphism; or, potentially, a combination of both.</p>
<p>In the second step, consider whether intervention in one sphere is needed more than the other. This often is dependent upon the rapport established in a supervisory relationship. In addition, what is the condition of your relationship with your supervisee? In some instances, when rapport is not sufficiently established, it might be more beneficial to intervene identifying a parallel process with your supervisee rather than addressing the isomorphism that is occurring within the triad. When the relationship is more established, it might be beneficial to address the isomorphism within the supervisory triad.</p>
<p>In the third step, consider who is involved? If an intervention is needed, what is the best direction to intervene for the supervisee? Also, what is best for the client? Supervision is a dynamic process that focuses not only on supervisee professional growth but protection of the clients they are serving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the fourth step, decide what type of role to use when intervening with the supervisee. The discrimination model outlines three roles that are common for supervisors to use: counselor, teacher, and consultant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448788">Bernard, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). Using the discrimination model can be helpful when determining the relational approach a supervisor might take. For example, if the client’s anger in session is ignored by the counselor, and the supervisee’s anger is ignored by the supervisor then it would be beneficial for the supervisor to use the counselor role and intervene with self-disclosure through expressing how he or she is experiencing the anger in session. Using the same example as a teacher role, a supervisor might discuss how to process anger directed at the counselor in a session. Dependent upon the situation, a consultant role might be more appropriate, therefore the supervisor would recognize and ask the counselor how they want to proceed with the anger.</p>
<p>Deciding whether an intervention is needed, determining which direction to intervene, considering who is involved, and selecting the type of role to use when intervening with the supervisee are the four steps outlining how a supervisor would use the IPPI model. These four steps delineate how a supervisor would use the IPPI model to recognize and address parallel process and isomorphism in the supervisory triad. The following case study will provide an example of how to use the IPPI model in supervision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480712448788">
<title>Case Study: Applying the IPPI Model—Maggie</title>
<p>To fully understand how to implement the IPPI model with Maggie, it is important to identify the context of the supervisory triad. Using the IPPI model aided the second author in identifying and intervening in her supervisory session. The first aspect of the triad is the client. The identified client was a 16-year-old female challenged with feelings of insecurity connected to making decision with regard to future career plans. The second aspect of the triad is the supervisee. The supervisee was a school counseling first semester intern. Her challenges were developing confidence in counseling sessions with her students. The third aspect of the triad is the supervisor. The supervisor was a first year, second semester doctoral intern challenged with her own insecurities related to supervisor development.</p>
<p>Doctoral interns met weekly to process supervisee cases with supervisee peers and their professor (third author). During the course of doctoral supervision, the supervisor in training shared her experience of intervening with this supervisee. The following excerpt captures the supervisor’s experience of using the IPPI model in her supervision with Maggie:<disp-quote>
<p>As I was working with Maggie, I was challenged with considering how to intervene in one of my supervision sessions with her. Upon review of her tape in our supervisory session, I noticed that she failed to confront her student regarding how the student was addressing/taking responsibility for her insecurities. Maggie was working with this student for several weeks and had an established rapport/relationship with the student. Maggie was also struggling with her own insecurities of utilizing appropriate interventions with her high school students. Following the review of her tape, I decided to ask her what prevented her from being more active in session with her student. Maggie shared her challenges of wanting to be empathic and maintain a strong rapport with her student, yet struggled with how to do this and maintain her boundaries as a school counselor. We then discussed ways she could challenge her own development through addressing her concerns with students in a more active manner. This included not only paraphrasing and reflecting feelings but also integrating confrontation in her sessions with students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above case study provides a context that informs the following discussion of the case within the IPPI model. Upon review of the supervision session with the professor of the class, the supervisor in training recognized how she implemented the model. To review the steps of the model, the supervisor must decide whether an intervention is needed, determine which direction to intervene, consider who is involved, and select the type of role to use when intervening with the supervisee. </p>
<p>The supervisor in training recognized the need to intervene with Maggie upon review of her taped counseling session. Given that the supervisee was challenged to confront, the supervisor in training decided to intervene using parallel process. The supervisor considered that both the client and the supervisee were struggling with insecurities connected to their own decision-making processes. The supervisor then chose to address the supervisee by identifying the parallel process between the student and the supervisee through integrating the teaching role. The supervisor stopped the supervisee and asked her what prevented her from confronting her student. By addressing the parallel process, the supervisor prevented an isomorphism from occurring in the triadic relationship. The supervisor did not allow her own insecurities as a developing supervisor impeded her interactions with her supervisee and challenged the supervisee’s lack of confrontation with her own student. Thus, the complexity of supervision occurs when awareness happens not only for the client and supervisee but also for the supervisor.</p>

<title>Implications for Supervision</title>
<p>As stated, the IPPI model was developed to visually aid supervisors in the distinction between two supervision processes: parallel process and isomorphism. The IPPI model can potentially aid counselor educators in two ways: (1) Recognizing these two supervision concepts in their own supervision, and (2) Providing a tool to train their doctoral students regarding these two concepts. Using the IPPI model can cultivate professional growth in both educators and supervisors under their supervision as it provides a visual stimulus within which to have conversations. Counselor education indicates that relationships have great significance in the training process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448788">Cormier, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448788">Furr &amp; Carroll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448788">Skovholt &amp; Ronnestad, 1992</xref>), and given the importance of relationships within the training process, recognition of these two concepts which are grounded in relationships seems important. </p>
<p>With regard to supervision, the use of this model allows the supervisor to approach supervision with intentionality. The goals of supervision and the goals of therapy are not mutually exclusive and often share the same elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448788">Williams, 1997</xref>). For example, both supervision and counseling place an emphasis on learning, personal growth, and empathy. With all of these similarities, it is only natural that parallel process and isomorphism occur.</p>

<title>Areas for Future Research</title>
<p>There is little research that explores parallel process and isomorphism. Given that the IPPI model is new, there are numerous areas for potential research. Exploring the use of the IPPI model and the short-term and long-term results of its use in supervision might provide additional information to inform supervisors. Another potential research question that emerged in the creation of the IPPI model was—Do the values or specialization areas of the supervisor influence intervention? More specifically, do supervisors trained in counseling specialties that focus on traditionally intrapsychic methods of counseling (mental health) and those that focus on systems methods of counseling (marriage, couple, and family) tend to focus on one direction in the model over the other? For example, would supervisors trained in systems work primarily intervene in the direction of isomorphism? Essentially, does one’s training potentially impact how one views, understands, and potentially intervenes in the supervisory triad?</p>
<p>Another area of research relates to supervisory experience. For example, do years of experience in supervision have an impact on one’s ability to recognize isomorphism in supervision? A supervisor might be able to identify parallel processes occurring in the supervisee’s counseling; yet, the same supervisor might not yet recognize the isomorphism in supervision due to inexperience. Therefore, studies exploring a correlation between years of experience and supervisors’ ability to recognize isomorphism in the supervisory triad might be an area to explore.</p>
<p>Finally, using a qualitative methodology one might explore the experiences of supervisors when deciding to choose an iso-para process versus a para-iso process? Also, it would seem important to explore the experiences of the supervisee when one process is used in an intervention, rather than another.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this model was developed for three reasons: (1) to aid in the distinction between the two concepts and (2) to aid supervisors in decision making with regard to supervisee intervention, and (3) to accommodate the complexity of the two concepts. The IPPI model was discussed and demonstrated through a case study which included deciding whether an intervention is needed, determining which direction to intervene, considering who is involved, and selecting the type of role to use when intervening with the supervisee. These four steps outline how a supervisor would use the IPPI model to recognize and address parallel process and isomorphism in the supervisory triad. There is little attention in the literature that attends to these concepts together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448788">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>). The above discussion makes a case for intentionally utilizing these concepts in supervision in order to enhance the supervisory triad.</p>
