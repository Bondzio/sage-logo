<abstract>
<p>A study in the history of the history of religions at Princeton Theological Seminary, the article reflects on the contribution of an under-appreciated figure on the faculty, Edward Jurji, a Syrian Christian acclaimed as a scholar of Islam and as a phenomenologist. Jurji’s intellectual odyssey is traced as he emerged from the shadow of his predecessor Samuel Zwemer, famed (and reviled) as a missionary polemicist in the Middle East, to become an avid proponent of a dialogical approach to the history of religions. Much is owed to Jurji for pioneering the seminary’s first large-scale interfaith colloquies.</p>

<p>Religion is never adequately grasped through books alone. Persons and communities are the true repositories of faith.</p>
<p>—Edward Jurji<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573612453161">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
<sec id="sec1-0040573612453161"><title>Princeton’s Museum of Religion and Missions</title>
<p>Among the lesser-known chapters of Princeton history is that Stuart Hall, the venerable building of Venetian Gothic that still serves as the primary classroom building on our New Jersey campus, once housed a small Museum of Religion and Missions on its upper floor from the late 1920s to the early 1950s. One prominent feature of this collection was an array of religious artifacts called a “Pantheon of Strange Gods.” What the exhibit looked like, ca. 1930, we know from a photograph in the museum’s brochure, “Visualizing Non-Christian Religions,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573612453161">2</xref></sup> authored by the curator Samuel Zwemer (1867–1952), a missionary figure of great renown who happened also to be the seminary’s history of religions professor. Besides a Hindu divinity or two (Krishna, for example), one sees more images of the Buddha than anything else, ironically a decidedly un-theistic figure in the Theravada societies of Southeast Asia from which most of them happened to come. Mingled into the display, one sees an assortment of other statuary, including a celestial nymph from India (called an <italic>apsaras</italic>; this one in all likelihood a replica), whose torso has a hip thrust out, suggestively, and a Yoruba woodcarving called an <italic>ibeji</italic>, which housed the spirit of a dead twin.</p>
<p><italic>In situ</italic>, none of these artifacts would have seemed strange at all. However, when placed behind glass in a museum that also paid tribute to the progress and triumphs of Christian missions, they arguably also may have been on display in no small part to serve a specifically missional goal, although the museum’s purpose, overall, was unobjectionably preservationist and educational. And that goal, consciously or not, may have been to imbue the “non-Christian religions” with an unsettling sense of alterity in the mind of the viewer. The vision of a perishing world in dire need of conversion to the Christian gospel, of which Zwemer was an ardent and indeed zealous proponent, would then not only have had a biblical and theological warrant but one that was also (as it were) material (in metal, stone, wood, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573612453161">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Princeton’s contribution to foreign missions during the museum’s lifetime was enormous, and, naturally, in an enterprise so large the motivations of Presbyterians who served overseas resist reductionism and defy simplistic characterization (Zwemer himself was affiliated with the Reformed Church in America, although as a missionary in the Middle East he collaborated ecumenically with a broad range of Protestant mission societies). That said, the period into which this article largely falls, the mid 1960s, saw a shift toward interreligious dialogue occur, although hardly all at once. And while the museum lasted, the reigning paradigm was still that of competition, with the displacement of other religions by Christianity as the ideal consummation of the missionary endeavor. Despite this, and in tension with it, the museum also bears testimony to an undeniable interest in the religions on their own terms—almost—and evinces an unmistakable curiosity about them. A splendid collection of rosaries, partly of Islamic provenance, in a glass case all to itself, illustrates the point. About them, Zwemer waxed truly eloquent, impressed with their beauty and even more with their prominent place in Islamic devotional practice; for the time, it comes as something of a surprise to hear him speak in un-Protestant tones of being “moved to reverence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573612453161">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the final “big push” in Christian missions among the mainline denominations was underway in the first half of the twentieth century, museums like Zwemer’s—his was hardly the first and should in fact be seen as one of the last in a long succession going back to the early eighteenth century<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573612453161">5</xref></sup>—had an impact of some uncertain kind on the image Princeton students had of the world’s religions. And even though Zwemer will reappear in the pages ahead, I am more interested in Edward Jabra Jurji (1907–90),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573612453161">6</xref></sup> his successor in the history of religions at Princeton, who eventually had the whole collection boxed up and stowed away, despite having been its curator—a very active one—for a number of years after his predecessor’s departure. Arriving at the seminary on the cusp of a paradigm shift in Christian mission, Jurji was a Syrian Christian who happened to come from the same Islamic world that the museum had so visibly placed on display. Boxing the museum up might have been the work of a few days or weeks; for several decades thereafter, however, Jurji faced a far greater challenge, that of overcoming a stubborn propensity to treat the religions as though they are objectifiable.</p>
<p>From nearly the time of its origin, Jurji knew the museum from the inside out as the seminary’s instructor of Islamics and history of religions, but also concurrently—a most unusual arrangement—from the outside in as a B.D. student (graduating in the class of ‘42 with Sam Moffett, who became the seminary’s Luce Professor of Mission and Ecumenics). A 1941 article by Jurji for <italic>The Moslem World</italic> (published today as <italic>The Muslim World</italic>) is one of the few accounts of the museum I know of by a contemporary who had first-hand experience of Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573612453161">7</xref></sup> Not only had Jurji been born in Latakia under the Ottomans on Syria’s Mediterranean coast, he already had a Ph.D. from Princeton University for a dissertation on medieval Sufism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573612453161">8</xref></sup> Afterwards, he spent a few years at the Institute for Advanced Studies, also in Princeton. With this background, it may seem counterintuitive that Jurji would find anything much to admire in the museum’s mélange of artifacts, but the same collection of rosaries that Zwemer also admired elicited from him a reverie of heartfelt reverence for the discipline of Islamic piety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573612453161">9</xref></sup> As already observed, however, not long after Zwemer passed on, Jurji played a decision-making role in the museum’s dismantlement. Although the reasons for his actions remain uncertain, my reading of Jurji’s private papers as well as his publications tells me that he was searching for a new approach to the history of religions and that Zwemer exemplified a good deal of what he thought had been wrong with the old.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573612453161"><title>Instead of Provocation, Charity</title>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, most Islamicists who had missiological interests aspired to publish in <italic>The Moslem World</italic>, of which Zwemer was the founder and editor, and Jurji did, too. Despite the enormous influence he wielded over many years until he stepped down in the late 1940s, Zwemer opened the journal to a variety of emerging perspectives on Islam that differed from his own. A case in point were those of Jurji himself, who the same year he came to the seminary had a study published in <italic>The Moslem World</italic> on the Islamic Christology of Muhyi al-Din Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 638/1240), a Sufi mystic of Andalusia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573612453161">10</xref></sup> The approach has a contemporary feel, not unlike Tarif Khalidi’s in <italic>The Muslim Jesus</italic> (2001), which in part draws on the same source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573612453161">11</xref></sup> Impressed with Ibn ‘Arabi’s “conciliatory tone,” Jurji let him speak uninterruptedly, without commentary or editorial comment: for example, “You may recognize [Christians] by their sign, which includes compassion for the world of men and that spirit of pity for others, no matter who the other men are. Furthermore, they avowedly surrender themselves to God and do not give utterance to any provocative words.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573612453161">12</xref></sup> This, indeed, was a far cry from the bellicose tone of Zwemer’s <italic>The Moslem Christ</italic> (1912), which began with a bugle call: “there is hardly an important fact concerning …  our Saviour which is not ignored, perverted, or denied by Islam.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573612453161">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, as a major figure in Euro-American foreign missions, Zwemer was also a staunch defender of its legacy, as Jurji discovered in 1943 when <italic>The Moslem World</italic> declined to publish a manuscript of his on the importance of rethinking missions in the Middle East. Jurji’s tenor, to be sure, was testy, and his judgments sweeping. Exasperated, Zwemer penciled a total of seven question marks in the margins beside statements like the following:<disp-quote>
<p>There is an imperative need for the complete revision of methods and techniques forming our approach to Islam. It is a source of deep regret that missionary strategy today is helpless to cope adequately with the Moslem situation. Chronically vacillating from one extreme to another, at one time it engages in frontal attack and encroachment against the person of Muhammad, and at another it lapses [into] languid futility and frustration. It is no exaggeration that Moslem missionary policy has hitherto been weighed and found wanting. It is wanting in clarity and charity. It is wanting in flexibility and resilience. It is half-hearted, old-fashioned and unimaginative. All that when it could have been the world’s greatest testimony to Christ—the mortar and the power-house of the Ecumenical Church, a refreshment to the saints. When have the manipulators of missionary policies considered the advisability of calling the leaders of Islamic thought and theology into conference with themselves?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573612453161">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Regrettably, Jurji rarely again alluded to the need for more “charity” toward Islam; nor did he clarify what “charity” might imply, theologically, except once in a work called <italic>The Christian Interpretation of Religion</italic> (1952): “Only when the relation of Christianity to Islam is fashioned after the pattern of Christ’s relation to us will the approach of the Christian to the Moslem be right.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573612453161">15</xref></sup> Of this, the more the better (that we should be as gracious to others as our Lord is to us, across religious boundaries), but Jurji’s concerns were actually different. To understand them, it helps to use a more contemporary idiom and substitute “dialogue” for “conference” in the manuscript Zwemer rejected. In effect, Jurji was proposing that Muslims be invited to teach Christians what Islam means to them. In the margins, Zwemer scribbled: “Is that possible or practicable?” Obliged by grace, Jurji thereafter applied himself to honing methodologies for the history of religions, convinced that Zwemer and others did not know how religion was to be studied. In short, Jurji would argue that theologians (missiologists, etc.) who endeavor to engage the religions constructively need to take the self-understandings of other believing communities (for example, Muslims, Buddhists, or Hindus) into serious account as indispensable points of reference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573612453161"><title>Hard Sayings</title>
<p>At Princeton, this was easier said than done, although President Mackay concurred with Jurji’s concerns: “I am eager,” a letter of 1948 declares, “that everything in the nature of the interpretation of Christianity and the non-Christian religions and their relationship should be founded upon the facts of history.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573612453161">16</xref></sup> The two had already begun to work together well enough that Mackay contributed a chapter on “Protestantism” in 1946 to Jurji’s <italic>Great Religions of the Modern World</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573612453161">17</xref></sup> The irony of Christianity’s post-Reformation developments being described by the president of a leading seminary of the Reformed tradition as one religion among others alongside Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and Judaism ought to raise an eyebrow. Elsewhere, Mackay pressed Jurji to clarify his Christian commitments theologically. In a letter of 1949 about a draft article of Jurji’s that later appeared in <italic>Theology Today</italic> as “The Science of Religion: A Christian Interpretation,” Mackay voiced some trenchant criticism: “The analysis … is largely descriptive. You do not really deal with the problem as to what religion is in its essence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573612453161">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Years later, on the penultimate page of his classic work, <italic>The Phenomenology of Religions</italic> (1963), Jurji in turn voiced some trenchant criticism of his own: “Any definition [of religion] must prove inadequate that condemns the religions of mankind out of hand. Any theology is deficient at the core that regards the religions as man’s wasted effort and lets the matter go at that.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573612453161">19</xref></sup> Although Jurji did not shrink from identifying Karl Barth and Hendrik Kraemer as the targets of this critique (both of whom had lectured or taught at Princeton in the years Jurji was here), his estrangement from them worsened only gradually. The “Science of Religion” article referred to above defended the much-contested thesis “that God revealed himself in nature and that, in the light of the Gospel, a general revelation—though challenged [by Barth and Kraemer]—is manifest, despite many disqualifying features, in most all the religions of the world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573612453161">20</xref></sup> Then, as if looking down upon the religions from some majestic Himalayan height, Jurji gravely enumerated their errors and evils. For someone who had once scolded pro-Christian apologists for their “arbitrary condemnation” of Islam (perhaps having Zwemer in mind), he now sounded just as injudicious.</p>
<p>Well into the 1950s, which saw a book-length sequel to his <italic>Theology Today</italic> article on “The Science of Religion” come out as <italic>The Christian Interpretation of Religion</italic>, Jurji managed to convince himself that the history of religions entitled him to make magisterial judgments: “Everything becomes … God except God himself.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573612453161">21</xref></sup> His formulaic, a priori convictions, transparently based on a (mis)reading of Rom 1:18, come across as unconvincing even to him. By 1963, however, Jurji had made a <italic>volte face</italic>. Thus, although <italic>The Christian Interpretation of Religion</italic> had stated categorically a decade earlier that “Christianity in essence is … the Gospel,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573612453161">22</xref></sup> <italic>The Phenomenology of Religion</italic> abandons the customary qualifiers and conditionals and argues the very opposite, uninhibitedly: “Christianity is a religion”—period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573612453161">23</xref></sup> Not that the matter rested there, but a divide had been crossed, and the difference here is that on the heels of his apostasy from Barth and Kraemer Jurji had discovered Paul Tillich.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573612453161"><title>The Believer as “Living Text”</title>
<p>From the 1960s onward, Jurji sounded more like himself the more he sounded like Tillich in <italic>Christianity and the Encounter of World Religions</italic>, fresh off the press in 1963.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573612453161">24</xref></sup> “Every dialogue among followers of different religions,” Jurji wrote, echoing Tillich’s concept of inclusive polarity, “evokes a silent response of self-criticism within the representatives of each participating religion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573612453161">25</xref></sup> Actually, the words just quoted come from a memo addressed to President James I. McCord. In that memo, Jurji maked a surprising proposal: Princeton ought to have a Center for Interfaith Communication. Unmentioned is that Harvard Divinity School already had a similar project under way, the Center for the Study of World Religions; nor is there a hint of apprehension that such a move might place the seminary’s commitment to Christian ministry into jeopardy. For good or ill, Princeton did not get the center Jurji envisioned, but not for lack of high-level support.</p>
<p>As elsewhere, the early 1960s at Princeton were a time of optimism and possibility for the history of religions; it so happened that the seminary’s sesquicentennial (1962) also fell into the same period. For his part, Jurji organized a conference on the history of religions with a plenary address by Wilfred Cantwell Smith. <italic>The Meaning and End of Religion</italic>, Smith’s revolutionary critique of the field had not yet come out<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573612453161">26</xref></sup> and it was not until afterward that he joined the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard as its second director (1964). A transcript of the proceedings, however, indicates that he did not stint on criticism of an assumption widely prevalent in the history of religions and held by Jurji himself: “There are no such things as religions in the world,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573612453161">27</xref></sup> he pronounced, as if the “things” we routinely call religions were chimeras.</p>
<p>My conclusion will comment on Jurji’s failure to understand or accept fully what Smith was saying about essentialization and reification, two cardinal sins of the history of religions that nowadays refer to the mistake of turning religion into a timeless generic “thing” (of which the individual, named religions would be the several species).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573612453161">28</xref></sup> Still, one finds change, development, and growth in Jurji, much of it catalyzed intellectually by the interactions he had had with Smith. On certain issues, their agreement was profound. The transcript of Smith’s sesquicentennial lecture, for instance, contained wonderfully pithy aphorisms such as this: “Our study must be of persons, not things.” While Jurji may have closed the museum, he was not about to lock the library; and yet, as the inscription at the top of this article indicates, he had begun to recognize that <italic>persons and communities are the true repositories of faith</italic>. And this despite having lectured at the seminary on the Qur’an since 1939!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573612453161"><title>The Primrose Path?</title>
<p>A shift like this meant that Princeton would be hosting more of the people Christians used to call “non-Christians,” as if the only identity that mattered was the one they did not have. Programmatically, however, a change of the kind Jurji envisioned was almost impossible to effect. The country was just on the cusp of far-reaching demographic changes brought about by the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which helped turn the United States into what Diana Eck of Harvard calls (with some exaggeration) “the world’s most religiously diverse nation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573612453161">29</xref></sup> Even for Princeton, an area where the population is now as pluralized as any in the nation and where houses of worship for most of the world’s religions are found alongside of churches and synagogues, American religion was still strikingly homogeneous half a century ago. And so, for the groundwork on a conference series that would capitalize on the sesquicentennial success, Jurji took advantage of a Fulbright appointment in Asia to make an around-the-world journey for sounding out potential participants such as Hajime Nakamura of the University of Tokyo, a renowned Buddhologist. There is even a memo from President McCord complaining of how he had been talking with the State Department to wrangle a visa for Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, at the time the most distinguished living proponent of neo-Hinduism. Radhakrishnan also happened to be his country’s president when India was a non-aligned nation, and the visa was refused.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573612453161">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Cold War may have put a damper on such affairs, but Jurji enjoyed warm support from President McCord, who saw them as contributing to “a process of theological broadening” and greeted interreligious scholars from abroad with self-effacing humor: systematic theology “has probably been guilty of more arrant nonsense being written about the history of religion than perhaps any other discipline I’m familiar with.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573612453161">31</xref></sup> McCord was actually so invested in these projects, which had brought Abraham Heschel and Fazlur Rahman among many others to our campus, that even before they ended in 1966 he had approached the same Midwestern philanthropist who had provided funds for the costly affairs already sponsored, to consider donating an even heftier sum—a million dollars over five years—to get the Center for Interfaith Communication he and Jurji had envisioned up and running.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573612453161">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>As I write, a claim on the history page of the website of Harvard’s Center for the Study of World Religions gives me pause for thought: “At the time of the Center’s founding, Harvard Divinity School was primarily a Christian Seminary. Its current orientation toward the study of world religions can be seen as a measure of the CSWR’s success.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573612453161">33</xref></sup> Naively or not, President McCord spoke of Princeton’s “unabashedly” Protestant identity as an advantage: “We do not believe that interfaith communication becomes better when the sponsoring agency professes neutrality.” Indeed, that would be true, but my concern is different, that Jurji—who would have been the sponsoring agency’s primary agent—was a scholar too preoccupied with a philosophical quest for the essence of religion, a quest that President Mackay had first urged upon him in 1949. Unlike Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Jurji remained committed to an essentializing <italic>sine qua non</italic> approach (i.e. that without which religion would not be religion). He was always on the lookout for “representatives” among the many religions (a Rahman, a Nakamura, or a Radhakrishnan) who might speak for the part about the whole—as if anyone could!—and thus pin down the “thing” itself that the religions (Islam or Buddhism or Hinduism) appear to name. Still, his was an intellectual odyssey, and the legacy I celebrate is that instead of letting Princeton remain content to only talk to itself, Jurji pushed it, constructively and programmatically, to open up its conversations to include the voices of believers belonging to other religious communities.</p>

On the troubling complexities of that legacy, see Heather Sharkey, <italic>American Evangelicals in Egypt: Missionary Encounters in an Age of Empire</italic> (Princeton: Princeton University Press), 94: “Zwemer took an aggressive approach to Christian missionary work among Muslims and published many works in English about Islam, a religion that he described as retrograde, fanatical, and intellectually and spiritually impoverished. …  As the twentieth century ended, some Arab Muslim thinkers wrote anti-missionary treatises that portrayed Zwemer … as the chief villain in a Christian evangelical and Western imperial plot to subvert Islam. In the long run, Zwemer aroused such bitter animosity among Muslims that he proved to be more of a liability than an asset to the work of Christian missionaries in Egypt and other parts of the Muslim world.” Later, Sharkey reconstructs an incident precipitated by Zwemer at Cairo’s al-Azhar where he distributed tracts critical of Islam; in her reading of contemporary Arabic accounts, Sharkey finds (115) that Zwemer is depicted as having “invaded al-Azhar” and attempting to “strike at [Islam’s] heart.” Tellingly, for our purposes, Sharkey suggests (113) that Zwemer’s Princeton appointment, which came just after the Cairo incident, afforded him an opportunity to retreat with dignity, as his welcome in the Middle East may have worn out.</p></fn>

Missionaries were a constant presence in the home and Jurji remembered one who boarded with his parents in Aleppo; to her, he attributed his English fluency. From age 12, Jurji was educated in Beirut at the preparatory school attached to American College (then very much a Christian missionary institution), from which he went on to graduate in 1928. On the ethos there, see Betty S. Anderson, <italic>The American University of Beirut: Arab Nationalism and Liberal Education</italic> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2011). Unfortunately, nothing certain is known of the Jurji family’s religious identity prior to their conversion to Protestantism in the latter half of the nineteenth century.</p></fn>

Personal communication, May 20, 2006. As she writes, “The article was returned with a request for revision because it might offend the missionaries.” Indeed, where Jurji had written of mission in the Middle East that it was “half-hearted, old-fashioned, and unimaginative,” Zwemer penciled into the margin the name of Henry Martyn (1781–1812), an iconic Anglican missionary figure, as if to lodge a protest against a perceived insult.</p></fn>

For him, the earlier Barth drowned out the later Barth, and §17 of <italic>Church Dogmatics</italic> I.2 (“The Revelation of God as the Abolition [<italic>Aufhebung</italic>] of Religion”) overshadowed §69.2 of IV.3.1–2 (on the <italic>Lichterlehre</italic>). At the time, Jurji simply could not do what Geoff Thompson, a contemporary Barthian, cogently recommends: to get the most good out of §69.2, let go of §17. See his “Religious Diversity, Christian Doctrine and Karl Barth,” <italic>International Journal of Systematic Theology</italic> 8.1 (2006): 8. In a somewhat similar vein, Glenn A. Chestnutt argues for the relevance of the later Barth to interreligious dialogue (a concern that had begun to preoccupy Jurji), especially in relation to Islam.

Gallahue of Indianapolis: one in 1964 on “The Phenomenon of Convergence and the Course of Prejudice,” and one in 1966 on “Religious Pluralism and World Community.” Jurji’s papers in the Jurji Collection, Special Collections, Princeton Theological Seminary Library, preserve a good deal of the planning records and oral exchanges at the panels. The ambitious million-dollar proposal drawn up by McCord and Jurji was intended to capitalize on the short-term gains of the “Gallahue conferences,” as they were called. Besides additional symposia, national and international, faculty exchanges were envisioned (no less than five, annually!), a doctoral and post-doctoral program, a monograph series, and a “world religions library.” From “Center for Comparative Studies and World Communion: Proposed Annual Budget.” Jurji Collection, Box 3.
