<p>We first began thinking about this special issue on the Family Management Style Framework (FMSF)in 2009 during the 9th International Family Conference in Iceland. Debra Weigand had taken the lead in organizing a symposium on the FMSF. Following the conference she continued to “nudge” us to think about a special issue. We broached the possibility with Janice Bell, editor of the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic>, who was wonderfully receptive to the idea and who worked with us from the beginning to develop a plan of action for turning the possibility into a reality. With Janice’s support, we took the plunge and issued a call for papers that would focus on new applications of the framework and held our breath to see if anyone would respond. We were delighted with the responses (10 manuscripts), and 6 of them are included in this issue. Thank you to everyone who submitted the manuscripts.</p>
<p>Committed to <italic>JFN</italic>’s strong tradition of peer review, we worked with Janice to identify a team of peer reviewers, all of whom agreed to review multiple manuscripts. Their reviews were stellar—pithy, helpful, and far exceeding our expectations for input. To our peer reviewers, Denise Angst, Anne Ersig, Marilyn Ford-Gilboe, Wendy Looman, Roberta Rehm, and Sally Thorne, we say thank you for your effort and for contributing to the development of every article in this special issue. They offered important developmental advice to authors whose manuscripts were not yet ready for acceptance as well as important critique for authors who were asked to revise and resubmit. We offer our appreciation and sincere thanks as well to our authors. They have forged new directions for the FMSF and worked with us to further refine and develop their manuscripts. The turn-around times often were challenging and they always rose to the occasion. It has been a pleasure to work with them. We thank them for their contributions to this issue and are honored that they have found the FMSF applicable to their important lines of inquiry. We want also to thank Lamia Barakat for her insightful guest editorial. Lamia is a psychologist whose research has focused on predictors risk and resilience in disease management and health-related quality of life for children with serious illnesses and their families. In addition, she maintains a clinical practice in psychosocial oncology. Her comments on the linkages between the FMSF and social ecology theory are especially insightful and provide important food for thought for others applying the FMSF to different family contexts and health care challenges.</p>
<p>Finally, a special word of thanks to Janice Bell. Throughout the process of developing this special issue Janice has provided us with an inside look at the work of being an editor; it is substantial. Our efforts to develop the issue benefitted from Janice’s considerable skills as a family scholar, writer, editor, and people person. All were essential to the project, and we thank you.</p>
