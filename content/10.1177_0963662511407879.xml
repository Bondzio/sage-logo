<p>Diversity is a central theme of Kohlstedt’s comprehensive volume on the public elementary school subject of nature study, primarily in the United States. The diversity of lesson content, teaching methods, and people involved in this widespread curricular movement at first defined – and later destroyed – nature study. Nature study, broadly defined, called for children to learn about nature through handling specimens. The use of plants, animals, and rocks as teaching objects ensured that lessons were drawn from students’ local environment, and that learning relied on students’ own observations.</p>
<p>Kohlstedt argues that the methods of nature study were co-opted for diverse aims, including natural scientists’ desire to instill scientific facts and observation skills; child psychologists’ interest in child development; educational theorists’ belief in constructivist, child-centered teaching; nature conservationists’ push to teach children to appreciate nature; teacher educators’ goal to make nature study achievable for teachers with limited training; and teachers’ need to prepare children for modern life. Kohlstedt revealingly suggests that southern schools, particularly those for African Americans, taught vocational skills such as gardening as part of nature study.</p>
<p>Nature study may have served another significant purpose that Kohlstedt does not address. As school populations grew enormously in turn-of-the-century North America, teacher numbers could not keep up. An emphasis on activities such as outdoor trips, handling objects, drawing, and discussing could have been an effective crowd-control strategy to engage large classes of young children. This diversity of goals was answered with a diversity of methods, documented by the explosion of teachers’ guides, children’s books, and even a journal, <italic>Nature-Study Review</italic>. The diversity of nature itself, particularly each school’s local environment, required a diversity of sources and approaches.</p>
<p>This lack of common goals and methods, Kohlstedt argues, ultimately led to nature study’s downfall in public schools. Diversity came to be seen as disunity, and scientists and educators called for a more structured and more scientific curriculum. Although the term fell out of favor, Kohlstedt highlights the many aspects of nature study that became incorporated into the new “elementary science.” Throughout her account, the key viewpoint that is missing, perhaps inevitably, is that of the children themselves.</p>
<p>Kohlstedt’s impressive research reveals a complex, interwoven story of many disciplines, people, and texts. This contested communication circuit concerning <italic>what</italic> and <italic>how</italic> children should learn about nature offers a fascinating view into early twentieth-century North Americans’ goals for their future citizens, regarding science education, child development, vocational ability, nature conservation beliefs, and more.</p>
