<abstract>
<p>In certain respects, contemporary thought treats the politics of revenge with disdain while celebrating and employing a politics that is decidedly nostalgic. And yet, following Nietzsche’s work regarding the inherent vengefulness of nostalgic political programs, one is led to an impasse. This article attempts to make plain for politics what is at stake in Nietzsche’s account of revenge, and how political and social action might navigate the distance between revenge and nostalgia. The article brings the thought of Nietzsche and Heidegger together in a new way by asking whether and how Heidegger’s thought could suffer from a hidden vengefulness by adopting a nostalgic pose, one that haunts Nietzsche’s own drive for overcoming. Through an elucidation of the difference between nostalgia and revenge, the article gestures towards the nostalgic and vengeful possibilities that politics holds.</p>

<p>The Makah are a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and on 17 May 1999 they reinstituted the whale hunt for the first time in 70 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453711421602">1</xref>
</sup> The Makah were diplomatic, recognizing that the international community would be worried that such an act might encourage Norwegian, Russian and Japanese industries to attempt their own revitalization – and they only sought one gray whale. As the US National Marine Fisheries Service had removed the animal from its list of endangered species five years prior, the Makah promised to take only one whale, which they subsequently did.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453711421602">2</xref>
</sup> They were not interested in creating the basis for an industrialized venture, but only to revitalize a cultural tradition that might, in their words, assist them in ‘rediscovering the roots of lost traditions’. However, certain segments of non-Makah culture mobilized a collective outrage when high-powered whaling boats with harpoon guns took to the waves to carry out this rediscovery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453711421602">3</xref>
</sup> The ‘discomfort’ with the Makah carrying out a traditional exercise through modern means is instructive: were the Makah to don skins and brandish spears while using cedar carved boats? What image of ‘natural culture’ had been projected on the Makah then and there? Beyond, or rather besides, the question of legacy and tradition with which the Makah were struggling, what nostalgic ‘savage’ did settler culture unwittingly and nostalgically project and impose upon the Makah? In June of 2000, effective pressure by activists resulted in an overturning of the decision to grant permission to the Makah to hunt a whale, and those opposed claimed a victory for the environment and for what they dubbed ‘intelligent animals’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453711421602">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nostalgia is clearly at work here, and its duplicity is almost obvious. When the settler comes to the Makah and wonders why the gunboat does not accord with the settler’s notion of Makah tradition, there is more than a subtle hint of exotic nostalgia, a latent drive to project indigenous people as somehow ‘part of nature’ in some way that the settler is not. The original attempt to assuage settler guilt turned to a disappointment and outrage that sought to hold the Makah accountable, and did so with both a reminiscent and accusatory gesture. The ‘authorization’ and ‘canceling’ of the whale hunt by settler powers highlights what must have been the strangely distasteful desires of non-natives to ‘see’ the natives taking up the whale hunt in some kind of ‘noble savage’ form. When the Makah take to whaling boats with guns, suddenly settlers and non-natives became uncomfortable with their own nostalgic expectations, and were quick to respond. This is the terrain in which Nietzsche’s and Heidegger’s work is at play. For Nietzsche sees the moralizing of the western world as integral to its own understanding of what politics is. Heidegger sees the way that nostalgia goes to work to present the past as something lost, something to be remembered and memorialized, <italic>but not to be regained</italic>. And here, then, is the problem of nostalgia, of the longing for the purity and wholesomeness of a lost homeland: it works revenge on the present.<disp-quote>
<p>There will be no unique name, even if it were the name of Being. And we must think this without nostalgia, that is, outside of the myth of a purely maternal or paternal language, a lost native country of thought. On the contrary, we must affirm this, in the sense in which Nietzsche puts the affirmation into play, in a certain laughter and a certain step of dance.</p>
<p>(Jacques Derrida, Margins of Philosophy<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453711421602">5</xref>
</sup>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Anyone drawn to think of politics in terms of struggle also does well to notice the nostalgia that often characterizes the longing to overcome present circumstances – a nostalgia not limited to the disputes between cultural groups but present in the struggles with and against ‘progress’. And as nostalgic longing crystallizes into a plan for present action and reform, the character of nostalgia discloses itself as tinged with revenge – of finding present circumstances poor and horrid and in need of redemptive, reformative, or emancipatory action. Nietzsche will go further in specifying these latent ‘drives’: he calls nostalgia <italic>nihilism</italic>: ‘a nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought <italic>not</italic> to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453711421602">6</xref>
</sup> Whenever one draws on ‘the way things used to be’ as a form of critique of the present, we are invited to be nostalgic and to long for a time when our lives seemed more wholesome. Whenever we are so invited, we are also recruited into a political project of reconstruction of one kind or another by way of an invitation to take judgment on the present. We are provided memories of times when things seemed simpler and more worthwhile, memories that are said to be somehow ours but that we may not have experienced personally. There is a tension between nostalgia and revenge in modern politics – one that continues to buttress and plague hopeful efforts at emancipation and reform.</p>
<p>There are varieties of false nostalgia. False nostalgia is a yearning for a kind of home that we may have never had, as when I wander through the supermarket and marvel at how out of touch our society seems with conditions of production that offer avocados and potatoes and hair wax, bundled together without irony or awareness. Such wandering and marveling imagines a lost world – a time when life was simpler, when living was tied to practices of eating and grooming which in turn were tied to local production: but of course these are not my own memories. I grew up among the products of postwar progress, among Wonder Bread, Cheez Whiz, candy machines and freeways. False nostalgia of this sort is tinged with revenge insofar as the occasion of its presence in one’s marveling is indistinguishable from the particular ill that the nostalgia seeks to remedy: ‘we need to live more closely to the land.’ Indeed, false nostalgia has a very long shelf-life: the elaboration of models of deliberative democracy is often carried out using Athenian democracy as an example of the kind of wholesome political engagement that we have lost (and the gesture of ‘we’ recruits us into this nostalgic pose). The saying ‘that we have lost …’ comes to rally us against the politics of our time as <italic>dis</italic>engaged, as lacking meaning, as lacking any sense of moving the everyday (<italic>un</italic>concerned, <italic>un</italic>intelligent) citizen beyond his or her ken. Whether Athenian democracy is the proper aim of our longings, is the source of our ‘homesickness’ and hence the longing for our ‘homecoming’, is a question separable from one that asks after the sense that nostalgia has when so mobilized, and from whether deliberation improves or belongs to democracy. That is, we need to ask about the relationship between the kinds of longing present in nostalgia, and of their vengeful provenance, in order to understand the sense that nostalgia might have for politics.</p>
<p>I wish to raise the question of the relation of nostalgia and revenge not only because its resolution is of critical import for politics, but also because it is precisely the relation between nostalgia and revenge that differentiates the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger. Nietzsche first articulated the way revenge and resentment sit at the base of modern thinking, of how revenge clouds and befuddles our attempts to articulate what a ‘human subject’ is, and the way a will is implicated in the projection of truths that gird our understandings of the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453711421602">7</xref>
</sup> Heidegger was the first thinker to give thorough and considerable attention to Nietzsche’s work,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453711421602">8</xref>
</sup> and he was also the first to articulate the way homelessness and nostalgia animate who we have become.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453711421602">9</xref>
</sup> Nietzsche was wary and critical of nostalgia; so how can the first philosopher to think through Nietzsche’s work turn to nostalgia as an appropriate way to gather our time in thought?</p>
<p>The fruitful occasion for thinking through nostalgia must also acknowledge that false nostalgia may be false not only because one has not personally experienced the ‘loss of home’, but also because it may become manifest even when we have experienced the particular loss in question. That is, the falseness or genuineness of nostalgia does not hinge on whether the object of our nostalgic longing is an existent past that we have ourselves lost. I may take up a language to reflect roots I have lost – but this does not render my nostalgia any less worrisome. What is false about this nostalgia is the sense that I could recover my ‘connection’ to a homeland by learning the European language of my forebears. Nostalgia, in the sense I will be developing, often has a particular object or situation in mind when it becomes manifest, and the drive to find or re-create the conditions of home is what renders nostalgia suspect, showing most presciently its vengeful provenance. But, again, could we imagine a nostalgia free of revenge?</p>
<p>Putting the question of nostalgia this way, one wonders whether modern homelessness (in the sense articulated by both Hannah Arendt<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453711421602">10</xref>
</sup> and Heidegger) is nothing other than the resentful projection of the disillusioned (given profound expression by Nietzsche); one wonders whether there is a nostalgia free of the mobilizing tactics of modern political life. In what follows I work through the particular relation that nostalgia and revenge have, and orchestrate a confrontation of Heidegger’s understanding of nostalgia with Nietzsche’s understanding of revenge. And so this article asks a set of decisive questions of Heidegger’s thought. Are all nostalgic postures always already vengeful? Does Heidegger remain trapped within the final metaphysics of Nietzsche that he so carefully chronicled in the 1930s? Are we free to think of nostalgia another way? Can the nostalgia that comes ‘after revenge’, so to speak, orient our thinking in such a way as not to consign politics and ways of being together to an ever-increasing darkness, twilight and oblivion? The stakes are high.</p>

<title>I Revenge</title>
<p>In <italic>The Genealogy of Morals</italic>, Nietzsche first develops the notion of <italic>ressentiment</italic>, or resentment, as that seething hatred underlying the creation of moral values in the West. Unable to bear the suffering imposed by ‘Masters’, and yet unable to resist, the deep resentment of the ‘Slaves’ imagines and creates a world of moral principles according to which the ‘Masters’ can be held accountable as the perpetrators of suffering: the very notion of a ‘free will’ is grounded in an activity, an exercise, of finding a being blameworthy for the purpose of punishment, hence revenge. The genesis of morals is thus not of fraternal or civic love but of the cruel desire to punish and stand over those too unconcerned to notice. Most importantly, <italic>ressentiment</italic> and the creation of values is not just one aspect of the moral stock of the West, but defines its metaphysical orientation, and thus also its understanding of life, of being and of time itself.</p>
<p>Revenge <italic>creates</italic> a world by stamping becoming with the character of being, as with a foot stamping its print in the moist sand of a beach at the ocean’s edge. But Nietzsche tells us this stamp has withstood the ocean, and western history proper is the story of this withstanding. ‘Being’, for Nietzsche, is only ever the making-sense of becoming. Nothing holds or has permanence, and the fleeting character of our temporal existence, of moment disappearing into moment, brings resentment at the way we undergo our own existence. That is, the suffering occasioned by time’s relentlessness is resented (passively), and becoming comes to be resisted in the creative act of revenge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453711421602">11</xref>
</sup> We come to imagine ‘truth’ as having the character of that which endures the passage of time, such that ‘being’ refers to that which <italic>is</italic> despite the passage of time. To say that something is or has being is to set it up over and against the world of things that comes into being and passes away (i.e. the world of becoming). The human comes into existence in this great moment of saying ‘No’ to the passage of time and the suffering of the will. Indeed, the suffering will come into existence <italic>as</italic> that which stands in the face of time, as something over and against time. The great act of revenge for Nietzsche is to set up a world – and that world is the world of the human. In setting up this world for the human, the human gives birth to itself in revolt against the suffering of time. ‘World’, for Nietzsche, is nothing other than the separation of the human <italic>in</italic> time: the distance between the dual commanding and suffering will that belongs to every human qua human.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453711421602">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the work that pushes the logic of revenge to its conclusion, <italic>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</italic>, Nietzsche shows that revenge underlies a ‘morality of pity’, or a morality that finds fault with the way the world turns out. Zarathustra feels a desperate disappointment, pity and anger that the world of these ‘last ones’ could not be otherwise, and we follow the story of this archetypically strong individual as he faces up to what the temporal tectonics of revenge require: a moment of ‘yes-saying’ as redeeming. This pose, of standing over and against the events of the world in a moment of judgment (or even clarity), characterizes almost all knowing and thinking in the West, defining the scientific posture towards entities, threatening even to envelop art.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453711421602">13</xref>
</sup> In <italic>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</italic>, Nietzsche shows the great revenge that the human takes against time with his portrait of Zarathustra’s attempt to overcome pity. There, Zarathustra comes to see human striving against suffering as an ‘ill-willing against time’ in a moment when he confronts the ‘spirit of gravity’, the ‘devil’ that makes all things heavy. In this confrontation Zarathustra sees that the notions of time and of the moment are interwoven into the human interpretation of ‘what is to be done’ and why we do what we do. This interpretive insight allows Zarathustra to see that the notion of will-to-power – that every truth-claim is grounded in the will that sees it and claims it – must exhaust itself in attempting to come to terms in time with the vagaries of a time that is always moving forward towards an end that (one silently hopes) redeems the suffering it occasions. Truth and time belong to the desire for redemption, and exist as a projection that ‘sets’ time as the plane along which ‘truth’, as ‘that which shows what is’, can be made manifest by an articulating will: Zarathustra sees (ironically) that all attempts to render suffering and seeming injustice redeemed ‘in’ time are an ill-willing against time for the purpose of redeeming suffering. This ‘redeeming’ places the human in relation to time and yet also in time, as though we stand in a relation of redemption to those things that come before. Overcoming revenge, then, is possible <italic>only</italic> if the human can grasp the present moment as eternal; that is, if present moments were to repeat themselves eternally, only then would it become impossible to redeem a past event unless every moment was redeemed in advance, or if we can see our present as an Eternity of the Same. And thus the will-to-power exhausts itself in the eternal return of the same, of the continual re-presentation of myself to myself in time, a necessary consequence of the metaphysics of revenge.</p>
<p>The existence of a seething resentment that surfaces as revenge can be seen to characterize the drive to achieve justice, even in our day. As Wendy Brown has shown, the pursuit of justice requires an articulation of the liberal legal person as a victim, as a sufferer, and liberal justice comes only when legal persons can be so articulated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453711421602">14</xref>
</sup> Nietzsche’s presentation of Zarathustra suggests that we can find revenge in the discrete acts of human beings, but also that the vengeful elaboration of tables of values is not just a discrete act but a kind of achievement that underlies all human willing insofar as it is tinged with morality and moralizing. That is to say, the essence of the human is its first appearance and defining of itself, and this is the great crime, the great act of revenge – but it presupposes a ‘law’ that the vengeful antecedently erect, the godhead (or, for Brown, the state). It is both present in our moralizing, and yet is not simply reducible to it simply because, for Nietzsche, it is the moralizing of the herd that characterizes human beings (for the most part).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453711421602">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is deep duplicity involved in setting up this world, as the human shrinks back from the colossal nature of its deed, and does not own up or take credit for it. Instead, the human sets up a past, honors its traditions and ancestors, and installs idols and gods as forebears and creators. In setting up this world of being human, the duplicity authorizes the invention and transference of responsibility for the suffering that befalls the human. By locating all that is permanent outside the world of becoming, the human can take constant revenge on the flux of becoming by identifying causes for suffering in those beings that (or, more properly, <italic>who</italic>) do not uphold the world of permanence. We are given to understand the freedom and agency of human beings in a moral way when we understand the conditions under which we can hold them responsible. Thus we do not ‘find’ freedom as something in the world, but postulate its existence in order to make sense of ‘moral phenomena’ – an ‘act’ we carry out continually in our daily mental perambulations through newspapers and amid others.<disp-quote>
<p>[I]t is high time to replace the Kantian question ‘how are synthetic judgements <italic>a priori</italic> possible?’ with another question: ‘why is belief in such judgements <italic>necessary</italic>?’ – that is to say, it is time to grasp that, for the purpose of preserving beings such as ourselves, such judgements must be <italic>believed</italic> to be true; although they might of course still be <italic>false</italic> judgements!<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453711421602">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nietzsche calls this identification of the a priori conditions (the being stamped on becoming) nothing more than a ‘tartuffery’ and tautology – that we look for and find the principle of freedom where we want to, and do so in order to hold up and make sense of a moral world. But to ‘find’ the moral agent, we have to posit the will that acts, the doer behind deeds, when there is nothing that necessitates we do so other than a moral world – making sense of our suffering. We presume there is a ‘doer’ behind every deed in order to make sense of the deed – but we do so duplicitously, Nietzsche says.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453711421602">17</xref>
</sup> We give birth to freedom only to uphold moral sensibilities.</p>
<p>The way we give birth to our freedom, the way we ‘find it’, is in relation to the past as <italic>our</italic> past, and hence is bound up with the problem of how and why we turn to the past. Our common sense tells us that history often serves the purposes of the present; Nietzsche tells us that it is hard to understand our turning to history in any other terms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0191453711421602">18</xref>
</sup> Our, that is, western, longing for the past, as an honoring of tradition, often takes the form of nostalgia, a bemoaning that celebrates what went before and is now lost – be it monumentalizing or archiving: the past seems lost to us. From the Greek, it is a painful longing for home, a <italic>nostos algein</italic>. As such a longing, our nostalgia often takes the form of a critique of who we are and how we now live, of showing our homelessness and alienation. Nietzsche demands that we be honest about the source and nature of our longings, that we recognize them for the vengeful attempts at politics that they are.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0191453711421602">
<title>II Nostalgia as revenge</title>
<p>Nostalgia surfaces in politics as a particular way of speaking about the times in which we live. More often than not, it is a longing for a particular set of circumstances from an age gone by; it is a <italic>set</italic> of circumstances because what is longed for is not simply this or that person, place, or thing. What is often nostalgically longed for is a whole sense of how life was, of the way things were, of what it meant to be someone living in a given time and place. What has been ‘lost’, then, is never just one particular item, but the sensibility and worldliness that goes with it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453711421602">19</xref>
</sup> The outrage of settlers at the Makah in their gunboats shares kinship with the exasperation at ‘new-fangled’ ideas, tools, or projects that seem to disclose to us some aspect of our world that has disappeared for ever, from the family farm and wholesome living and eating to the times when people understood and relied upon each other. It is not clear, of course, that such times actually ever existed,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453711421602">20</xref>
</sup> and it is not important whether they did: the point is to bring this way of speaking about the past into dialogue, as it were, with Nietzsche’s infamous notion of <italic>revenge</italic>.</p>
<p>In navigating between the gestures and postures of nostalgia and outrage and the thoughts of Nietzsche on revenge and nihilism, there appears an ambivalent and often troublesome place for nostalgia. Nostalgia is one way we continue to carry out our revenge, and for Nietzsche our metaphysics rests on a grand and resentful longing. Through nostalgia we vengefully create a past out of our present sufferings, a past to which we can refer and which spurs action towards a future that will redeem the present along with the past. With nostalgia we are seeking something. The human person that is the settler is also the Cartesian and Kantian subject, the human being that stands over against a world and acts in a juridical manner to cast judgment. Nietzsche calls this vengeful stance nihilism. Nihilism is a particular evaluative stance (not just instance) toward the world as it is in the present, one that judges it as lacking in some particular way, and one that thereby seeks to create a ‘better world’ by ‘improving’ the conditions of this world. It is, as Nietzsche calls it, the drive to grasp all conditions of the world in terms of the knowing and willing subject, in terms of something that the subject acts upon and justifies. No longer the purview of a deity, the world of the Cartesian subject, of the nihilist, is one where all relations are thinkable a priori. And for this very reason, this vengeful subject of western thinking often speaks nostalgically of other times when the human spirit was something other and better than it is today. Recall that the nihilist is not the believer in a Great Nothing, nor even one who consciously wills nothingness. The nihilist is simply one who despairs at the present and longs to overcome it, and ‘judges of the world as it is that it ought <italic>not</italic> to be’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453711421602">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The gesturing to a homeland and its times was, <italic>ab initio</italic>, false in Nietzsche’s accusing eye because the remembrance of homelands was the creative act of the resentful. Recall that ‘the Birth of the Human’, for Nietzsche, was <italic>and is</italic> the Great Crime, and it presupposes a Law – which the Human subsequently authors, and then proceeds to shrink from the crime and the deed of authorship. It both <italic>was and is</italic> not only because it is ongoing but because it does not occur in chronological time in order to ‘be’. This is not an isolated instance for Nietzsche, one that is to be thought of as an attribute of being human, but rather the defining property of being human. The vengeful act of projecting a future by way of a past that we have invented is what it is to be human. That is, according to Nietzsche, we are locked into a sphere of ever-projecting our past onto a future, and thereby giving birth to ourselves: revenge is nostalgia. But all ways of giving birth to ourselves are not equal, and the particular way the Judeo-Christian world has done so is suspect to Nietzsche. It is suspect because it has created a particular kind of human being, and with it a particular logic for giving birth to itself while also deceiving itself about its provenance. This deceit conceals the great act of revenge that installs a world of being beyond becoming – and it is arguably at the core of Nietzsche’s thought to overcome the vengefulness that defines western metaphysics. The separation in time, of time, of a past and future situated in a single being: this is the difficulty to be overcome with the eternal return.</p>
<p>Despite Nietzsche’s exhibition of the disturbing presence of nostalgia in our thinking, have we yet asked the question of nostalgia’s provenance? Much less the question of nostalgia itself? Who are we when we speak nostalgically, and what does our speech portend? Even if we grant the vengeful heritage to our nostalgic longings, must all of our longings end in nihilism? Are the original stories of western nostalgia, of the Odyssey and the Exodus, part of a nihilistic heritage? And in what way does nihilism have its own nostalgic projections? As surely as the past lays claim to us, so too must we begin to think through nostalgia and the way it lays claim to our thinking.</p>
<p>One of the most insightful readings of Nietzsche’s account of nihilism to date remains the one given by Martin Heidegger in his lectures of the 1930s and 1940s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453711421602">22</xref>
</sup> There he gave thorough coverage to a thinker who had yet to be properly read, as the Nazis had usurped Nietzschean notions of the will for their ulterior politics of mastery. Heidegger’s reading is remarkable if only for the sustained treatment he gives to the troubled notion of the will, the way ‘will’ sits as the central and last concept of western metaphysics, and of its unmistakable grounding in a temporality of revenge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453711421602">23</xref>
</sup> Heidegger’s unraveling of Nietzsche’s notion of revenge is compelling not only because Heidegger is often thought of as the thinker of nostalgia par excellence, but also because he thinks of Nietzsche in terms of the closing-down of philosophy not only out of revenge but out of nostalgia: ‘Nietzsche was the last to experience this homelessness.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453711421602">24</xref>
</sup> Indeed, Heidegger is the first thinker to invite us to consider the question of Being not simply despite what Nietzsche says about nihilism but precisely because of it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453711421602">25</xref>

<italic>The difficult question at the core of Heidegger’s confrontation with Nietzsche explicitly involves the question of nostalgia</italic>. Heidegger is often maligned for harboring a nostalgia that somehow suffers the pangs of regret and resentment, a desire and drive to return to conditions of an earlier age or even to bring about new conditions based on a fruitful and thoughtful appropriation of the old – and not only from the pen of Derrida. And a lot hinges on this question for anyone concerned with the politics latent within Heidegger’s thinking. Let us proceed to examine this curious tension between Nietzsche and Heidegger by asking whether nostalgia is always already vengeful, and, if so, how we might think of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0191453711421602">
<title>III Ontic/ontological</title>
<p>For Heidegger, the essence and sense of nostalgia is not itself anything nostalgic, perhaps somewhat obviously so. Although the idea that the essence of a being is not itself another being seems logically true, it was only with Heidegger that the weighty truthfulness of this differentiation of beings from their essence as beings, a difference he calls ‘the ontological difference’, comes home to us. Commencing in <italic>Being and Time</italic>, Heidegger begins his exploration of the ontological difference, an exploration of the differentiation between ‘Being and beings’ that he says defines western philosophical thinking from the outset. The beings (or, as sometimes translated, entities) of the world are <italic>ontic</italic>, while the Being of beings is <italic>ontological</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453711421602">26</xref>
</sup> Ontic inquiry pursues actual beings; ontological inquiry concerns the conditions of the possibility of beings as such, and is thus synonymous with the question of Being. To ask questions ‘ontologically’ is to ask after the conditions that must be the case in order for the beings under scrutiny to be the beings they are at all. As Heidegger shows, to ask ontological questions is not to simply presume a tradition, but to ask in an <italic>originary</italic> manner – something that goes to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>However, the ontological difference characterizes the history of western thought insofar as that history has elided the difference. That is, every philosophical thinker in the West, according to Heidegger, has tried to ground Being in beings by articulating the Being of beings as another being. Thus Plato sees the Being of beings as idea; Hegel sees the Being of beings as <italic>Geist</italic>; Nietzsche sees the Being of beings as will-to-power. Heidegger says the Being of beings is not itself a being. Even to begin to ask ‘what is it?’ presumes that it lies in relation to us as a ‘what’ and hence as another being. And so for Heidegger the question of Being, as the question we must learn to face, is one we will have difficulty posing as a question even though we can grasp the questionable character of Being – even if we can grant that for the most part Being has been articulated as that which has the most duration or presence through time, such that temporality becomes the proper horizon according to which we can begin to think towards such a question. But we do well to ask what happens to this difference if it has erroneously characterized the history of thinking hitherto. If we begin with a phenomenon in the world, and work out its character ontologically, it seems initially that we are led further and further away from the entity or phenomenon itself. Specifically, if we ask the question of what it is to exist as a human being (or <italic>Dasein</italic> for Heidegger), we eventually come to the question of what it is to be in the world. And we then come to ask what it is for a world to be a world, or of the essence of world as such. This crux brings us to the ‘worldhood of the world’ (the Being of the world is the ‘worldhood’ of the world), and we find that the worldhood of the world inheres in its being not just <italic>a</italic> world but precisely <italic>this world, the world we have come to be in</italic> … and so we are back with the beings of this world as it has come to be: the world itself becomes present to us through time as history (<italic>Geschichte</italic>). We are inescapably in a world, <italic>this</italic> world. And the events that have gone on in the world, that have given rise to our modes of being, thus become relevant to who we are. Indeed, what we have lost matters as much as what we have ‘produced’ or ‘accomplished’.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the ontological difference ‘leads nowhere’, or is somehow objectionable by virtue of its circularity. It is truthfully the opposite, for it shows that every act of inquiry comes to be an interpretation of what it is to exist as a human being in the world, of the world we have come to be in, read through the historical trajectory of this world. Thus the question of world is itself the question of how we are at home, or not, in the world. And thus the question of nostalgia is a question of Being, for we ask what beings are in a way that takes us backwards and forwards. Taking the ontological difference as a clue to our interpretation of nostalgia, therefore, we begin with ontic nostalgia and proceed towards ontological nostalgia. This means that we take actual examples of nostalgia (ontic, whether genuine occasions of loss or not) and ask about the conditions of the possibility of nostalgia as nostalgia in the world. How is it possible to long for an actual past? Is it possible to long for the past, but not to re-create it, simply because it would no longer be the past? In order for nostalgia to be actual, we must experience a particular loss of something from the past – and what is lost is home. Hence for nostalgia as <italic>nostos algein</italic>, a painful longing for home, to gnaw at us, we need not long for our actual home if it no longer is, and perhaps even if it somehow never was actual for us. Nostalgia speaks to us by <italic>speaking of our homelessness in today’s world</italic>, not of our actual homes. Alienation, distance, separation: these are phenomena that belong to homelessness for Heidegger, and give credence to his kinship with a seemingly unrelated thinker like Marx.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0191453711421602">27</xref>
</sup> Marx understood that the events and artifacts of our world showcase our own alienation, our own unrelatedness to ourselves, in a way that does not prefigure a ‘return’ to species-being but to a moment of conscious encounter.</p>
<p>Ontic nostalgia is actual nostalgia, and is found in examples like the case of the settler support of Makah whaling. It also tells of settler outrage as <italic>ressentiment</italic> insofar as it not only seeks the past for remembrance or even for memorialization but to make it actual again in a redemptive form. Ontic nostalgia, then, <italic>always</italic> threatens to become actual revenge. But remember that the importance of revenge for Nietzsche was not that it was grounded in actual occasions of revenge, or that it was an actual aspect of being human. On the contrary: revenge is the condition of the possibility of being human. There is no activity for the human that is not always already an expression of the freedom wrought by revenge. Perhaps we can wonder about a nostalgia that is not a nostalgia for this or that past, but sees the loss of our past in a variety of present miseries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0191453711421602">
<title>IV Nostalgia</title>
<p>But what of situations of (seemingly false) nostalgia where we sense a loss and an alienation even when we cannot say that we ourselves have lost anything? For example, there is nostalgia in the desire to live close to the land, to preserve one’s food, to resist technological society by returning to the ways of living of the past. This nostalgia is ontic insofar as it is present in an actual longing, or is actual insofar as one is party to an actual loss, or becomes present itself in the guise of actual practices that turn us to take concrete action in the face of present circumstances. It ‘judges of the world as it is that it ought <italic>not</italic> to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist’, thereby showing its vengeful and nihilistic heritage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0191453711421602">28</xref>
</sup> But perhaps our nostalgia can survive without working to ‘create change’.</p>
<p>Ontological nostalgia does not only gather ontic instances of nostalgia (for it must presuppose these in some way), but also moves our thinking to the conditions that allow for nostalgia to be possible at all. How is it that we can experience our own homelessness and loss and alienation in simple everyday ways without ever having experienced the loss personally? How is it that any one of us might wander into a supermarket and marvel at how far removed we seem to be from where our food originates without ever having farmed or lived close to the land? What is it that makes itself present to us in these ontic examples?</p>
<p>To stay close to what is made manifest, we do well to avoid seeking the source of nostalgia in another being; nostalgia, properly speaking, does not only refer to an actual moment of loss or even necessarily to an actual loss itself. Similarly, Nietzsche’s characterization of revenge is important precisely because it is not only ontic but ontological: it specifies the condition of the possibility of being human rather than simply another attribute of human behavior. If revenge is the condition of the possibility of being human for Nietzsche, nostalgia is the condition of the possibility of the thinking being for Heidegger. Nostalgia, thought ontologically, is a remembering that does not remember instances or specific practices but rather stands to memorialize in the very activity of recognizing one’s homelessness. It is a sorrowful stance, and is heard in <italic>Sorge</italic> – as ‘sorrow’ is both a cognate and a denotative sense the term bears.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0191453711421602">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Let me take a moment to characterize how this is possible and what it looks like. In ‘The Question Concerning Technique’ Heidegger gives a number of examples of the way technical thinking covers over any more traditional way of relating to a variety of things across the landscape.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0191453711421602">30</xref>
</sup> He notes that the technological forester and timber-cruiser has replaced the woodsman, that the hydroelectric dam on the Rhine has replaced Hölderlin’s poetizing of the river in the poem ‘The Rhine’, and that the tourist industry keeps the Rhine river on display in a way that blocks any more traditional way of confronting it. While one might remark that the Rhine is still there, it is no longer the Rhine of Hölderlin’s poem: there is no return to the way it was, to what is remembered in the poem by that name. <italic>But by giving thought to this, we can recognize that there is no return, and can experience sorrow in its wake.</italic> We can see that we cannot see. Marx foresaw that as a worker one can experience one’s alienation and exploitation without ever recalling a time when one’s labor was not already a commodity. As in Rousseau, one can recognize the <italic>un</italic>freedom and veritable slavery of existence in contemporary society without ever having had a taste of the freedom that Emile experiences in nature or of being aligned with the General Will.</p>
<p>This way of speaking of nostalgia, as the recognition of existing in a profoundly alienated way, is an exceedingly important possibility today. To think through what it is to be human, to be a thinking being, is to think through how we are called forth to belong together and with others, and how far and foreign such belonging seems. ‘Politics’ is this calling forth. Today we often think of politics in terms of how we gather to have a say over our affairs, but stumble over the import of politics simply as how it is we are called forth to belong. We can begin to think and act politically only when we cease to think of our struggles as instrumentally effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0191453711421602">
<title>To conclude: nostalgia ain’t what it used to be</title>
<p>Just as revenge is thought non-ontically, so too with nostalgia, and it is precisely here that nostalgia shows itself capable of a remembering that, while made possible on the ontic scaffolding of revenge, is <italic>not necessarily</italic> aiming to redeem or hold accountable. Nostalgia properly understood must avoid cascading into a political project that attempts to redeem or hold responsible. The ‘loss’ that is made manifest by nostalgia cannot be made whole. Nostalgia properly understood is important for the political landscape of modernity because in it we experience our loss and distance from each other; with nostalgia we are reminded that <italic>politics</italic> involves those things around which our lives revolve and how these slip from our grasp, morning to night. Insofar as it remains possible to hearken to this loss, these losses, we stand to gain. But if we mobilize our nostalgia into political projects, suddenly we slip away from the thoughtful oasis of memorializing and bearing witness towards revenge and redemption.</p>
<p>Now we must also be clear about the relation of ontic and ontological nostalgia, since the distinction between ontic and ontological breaks down when we recognize that the conditions of the possibility of any discrete instance of nostalgia come to presence not in their conditions but in the nostalgic instance itself! Nostalgia always presents itself to us in the world, in relation to others in the world. By retreating to ‘ontological’ nostalgia we are not re-creating the conditions for metaphysics; rather, we aim to ‘think through’ the kind of world and humans we must be in order for such a loss to make sense at all, and are attuned to it in sorrow. And that is all that can fairly be expected.</p>
<p>I think we are at last in a position to give a rejoinder to Derrida’s divisive and somewhat cryptic note that begins this article. But I think Rorty self-incriminates more effectively:<disp-quote>
<p>The $32 question of whether the later Heidegger still believes there is an ahistorical discipline called ‘ontology’ leads fairly quickly to the $64 question of whether he has a right to the nostalgia for which Derrida and others have criticized him, and to the hostility he displays toward pragmatism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0191453711421602">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>I hope the foregoing shows why Richard Rorty (and, by extension, Derrida) misinterprets Heidegger’s work after <italic>Being and Time</italic>. ‘Metaphysics’ is not something that we simply leave behind, for it truly is part of the world in which we live, part of the grammar that lets beings be. It means that we are continually faced with the task of thinking through who we are and who we have become, and of the nihilism that threatens us historically and not incidentally. And if we are so disposed, our ‘nostalgia’ does not mean there can be no laughter, much less no dancing. Nostalgia is not necessarily deep and dark, despite its sorrow. Ontic nostalgia harbors fruitful possibilities for remembrance insofar as it hearkens to its ontological mode, namely that we are encouraged to think of what has been lost, or transformed, not as a task before us to be redeemed or reckoned with through actions that wash hands, but as an opportunity for witnessing and memorializing. This cuts against the way we had characterized nostalgia at the outset, and perhaps even in memorializing we risk projecting a future from a past out of revenge. Nostalgia, today, from now on, must be something new.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon ... for Indian tribes to resurrect old customs and find a host of complications they had not foreseen. Like any group of humans, tribes often disagree about the virtue of their customs. And the starry-eyed encouragement of other Americans, wowed by the ‘spiritualism’ of Indians, can soon turn to taunts once endangered species are involved. One writer to a Seattle newspaper said the hunting crew – once idolized for plunging into cold mountain streams in the pre-dawn hours – were a bunch of testosterone-loaded young men who mainly wanted to shoot something. The fact is that whale-hunts were once a male rite of passage, and neither hunts nor male rites are now particularly acceptable.
