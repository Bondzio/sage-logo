<abstract>
<p>This research presents results from the 2009 and 2011 evaluations of a biweekly program offered by Sunday Friends, a nonsectarian, nonprofit organization in Santa Clara County, California. The central focus of Sunday Friends is to empower families to “break the cycle of poverty” by providing programming that strengthens families and promotes healthy development of children and youth. Targeting financially needy families, the program uses a unique token economy to reward participation in educational and prosocial activities. Participants earn tickets that may be used to purchase a variety of goods and supplies. Most of the participating families are immigrant, Latino, and bilingual. The primary goal of the evaluations was to determine whether Sunday Friends fosters developmental assets for children and youth. Data were gathered from family members (i.e., adults and minors) and volunteers in 2009 and 2011. Questionnaires were administered to families face-to-face in English or Spanish during program hours, while volunteers were surveyed via an Internet questionnaire in English. We conclude that the token economy at Sunday Friends encourages a positive work ethic and motivates participation in transformative activities. Within an atmosphere of respect, helpfulness, and friendliness, the program fosters healthy family relationships, positive attitudes and behaviors, educational engagement, social capital, and healthy eating. Program volunteers are liked, respected, and viewed as role models. Data from volunteers confirm the reports by family members that the program has positive influences on participants’ lives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article presents the results of two evaluations of the unique token economy programs offered by a nonsectarian, nonprofit low-income assistance organization in Silicon Valley called Sunday Friends. Sunday Friends aims to eliminate “learned helplessness,” a situation where social and economic challenges make upward mobility seem to be an illusion for disadvantaged people, despite their diligence and hard work. “Learned helplessness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1936724412475138">Seligman 1975</xref>) is seen in the defeatist attitude of those who give up on seeking success when trapped in adverse conditions for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>The families that participate in the Sunday Friends community experience significant disadvantages that can trim aspirations. As low-income immigrants, they face language barriers, limited social capital, and scarce employment and educational opportunities, just to name a few. For example, although immigrants register a high participation rate in the workforce, they are often concentrated in the agricultural sector and in menial occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1936724412475138">Pew Hispanic Center 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There is little doubt that as a social welfare provider to poor immigrant families, Sunday Friends serves an important role in the community. Whereas most people are likely aware of contemporary sentiment against serving undocumented immigrants, most are probably unaware of, or have profound misconceptions about, the state of aid to poor people in the United States in general. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412475138">Allard (2009)</xref> explained that while no complete portrait of services to the poor exists—in part, because the United States does not have a coordinated antipoverty system—two things are clear: First, public sentiment against cash payments to poor persons eventually led to dramatic state and local cuts to such programs (e.g., the end of Aid to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC) in favor of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF)), and second, a lesser known, but longer lasting, trend has been a shift to nonprofit service providers of responsibility for providing antipoverty social services—to the degree that now far more money is sent to nonprofits for services than is distributed directly in payments to the poor.</p>
<p>Arguably, government cutbacks in cash assistance to the poor left many female-headed families in the clutches of poverty, leading some to do desperate things such as sell blood, scavenge trashcans for food, or return to abusive partners to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724412475138">DeParle 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412475138">Allard (2009)</xref> explained, the “outsourced safety net” also serves mostly women, but unlike cash assistance, which is portable, social services are geographically restricted, hardening barriers to access for racial minorities who have access to few providers. That safety net also primarily trains people for employment, assists job seekers, and helps those already working keep their jobs. Other services are typically for mental health and substance-abuse treatment, domestic violence, and child care.</p>
<p>It is within this context that Sunday Friends operates. Without federal or state funding, Sunday Friends attempts to address the obstacles that low-income and immigrant families face to cultivate self-reliance while providing the much-needed direct aid (e.g., food, educational supplies, etc.). To extend program influence at home, Sunday Friends includes parents or guardians in its programs. The objective of this evaluation is to assess whether Sunday Friends is achieving these goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1936724412475138">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The theory of learned helplessness suggests that persons ensnared within disadvantaged settings over long periods of time, who experience repeated failure to improve their conditions, are more likely to lack self-reliance and to suffer helplessness and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724412475138">Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1936724412475138">Seligman 1975</xref>). Even if not universally applicable to disadvantaged persons, this construct is useful for guiding interventions. Chronic childhood poverty is a strong predictor of adult poverty, education, and occupational attainment, and this is likely an outcome of causal pathways that run through the negative effects of poverty on children, such as poorer health, higher stress levels, lower cognitive skills, poorer quality schools, exposure to violence, and living in “bad” neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724412475138">Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724412475138">Corcoran 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Pathways to negative outcomes produced by poverty could be addressed through programs that target improving health and nutrition, parental engagement with children, and access to necessary goods and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724412475138">Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997</xref>). In the last decade, grassroots asset-building programs have emerged throughout the United States. These have the goal of strengthening community life for children and youth, and many are guided by a comprehensive approach called the Developmental Assets framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1936724412475138">Mannes, Roehlkepartain, and Benson 2005</xref>). Sunday Friends was created to address the needs of a particular group of children, but on seeing a similar vision within the Developmental Assets framework, the organization later embraced that model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1936724412475138">
<title>The Program</title>
<p>Sunday Friends is an organization that was founded in 1997 by a former Silicon Valley engineer. It has served thousands of children in the community with more than 1,500 volunteers each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1936724412475138">Sunday Friends 2011</xref>). Sunday Friends relies heavily on volunteers in part because it does not receive government funding and in part because many of its activities involve one-on-one—volunteer to family member—engagement. Sunday Friends also relies heavily on donations to the organization (especially for items in the store) to accomplish its work.</p>
<p>The Sunday Friends mission statement reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sunday Friends empowers families in need to break the cycle of poverty. Children and parents earn basic necessities while they contribute to their community, learn life skills and develop self-sufficiency.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As seen in the mission statement, a guiding principle of Sunday Friends is to not treat participants as “charity cases,” but rather as agents for community and social change. The organization’s tagline, “the working alternative to charity,” underscores this philosophy. It is implemented through a unique token economy that sets this “charitable” program apart from others. The concept is to provide a nurturing environment where low-income family members earn tickets to purchase the things they need from the Sunday Friends store by participating in activities that teach manners, contributing to the community, English language skills, money management, and healthy living. While learning life skills, ideally children also learn to cherish things because they actually earned them, and in turn, they learn to value work.</p>
<p>Two Sundays each month, about 300 persons—minors, adults, and volunteers—gather at Lowell Elementary School in San José, California, the 10th most populous U.S. city. Families learn about the program primarily via word of mouth. The only eligibility rules are as follows: (1) Minors must be accompanied by an adult and (2) adults must be accompanied by a minor.</p>
<p>Although families and staff often arrive earlier, activities begin at noon. Parents and guardians attend English as a second language (ESL) classes, courses about money management, parenting effectiveness, or health and nutrition, and children work with volunteers on craft projects that are educational and that serve the community (e.g., gifts for persons in convalescent homes). Crafts are typically seasonally appropriate (e.g., patriotic crafts for Independence Day). The day progresses with children and youth preparing and serving healthy foods under the guidance of volunteers while other activities continue. Additional activities vary with the talents of the volunteers and may include things such as piano lessons, gardening, cleaning the school grounds, and educational activities. Stations for particular types of assistance, such as the bank and the credit check station, operate during programming.</p>
<p>Through the bank, and a system of tickets, Sunday Friends teaches financial literacy. Tickets that are earned belong to individuals who earn them and may be transferred to others (or even stashed in a mattress). The bank encourages saving, a fundamental financial skill. Through savings, families may eventually purchase items that require a large number of tickets. In other instances, for example, times of need, families may draw on savings to purchase more basic necessities. One incentive for saving is the very high interest rate (10 percent APY).</p>
<p>Tickets may be redeemed in the Treasure Chest, the small Sunday Friends store, at the end of the day. Families take turns at the store with the assistance of volunteers who help them shop responsibly. The Treasure Chest remains open until all families have been served—typically around 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Families are predominantly of Latino descent, including first- and second-generation immigrants from Mexico. Program activities are located at an elementary school that donates the space, a location chosen to draw on nearby low-income residents. Largely an immigrant city, San José has multiple low-income, immigrant Latino neighborhoods. The racial/ethnic profile of the city in 2010 was as follows: 33.2 percent Hispanic or Latino, 32.1 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 28.7 percent White, 2.9 percent African American, and 2.9 percent Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1936724412475138">Bay Area Census 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We present results from the 2009 and 2011 program evaluations to assess the effectiveness of Sunday Friends at accomplishing its goals. Because Sunday Friends embraces an assets-building approach, the first effort of the evaluation is to assess whether Sunday Friends fosters assets in children and youth. Other areas that we focus on are the efficacy of the educational programs, the progam’s economy, social capital, and healthy eating activities.</p>

<title>Fostering Assets in Children</title>
<sec id="section6-1936724412475138">
<title>Review of prior research</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1936724412475138">Search Institute (2011)</xref> formed the Developmental Assets model through its work preventing high-risk behaviors, and promoting school success, caring, and healthy communities for children and youth. Their work identified a set of internal and external assets that young people need to thrive. Youth with more assets report fewer high-risk behaviors, such as alcohol and illicit drug use and school problems, and more thriving behaviors, such as avoiding danger, impulse control, and school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1936724412475138">Mannes et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Developmental Assets approach is consistent with a framework called “Positive Youth Development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724412475138">Catalano et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1936724412475138">Damon 2004</xref>). This approach focuses on the resiliency and potential in each young person, and it asserts that experiences that promote success also prevent failure. From this perspective, intervention for children and youth should be multifaceted, not focused on a particular problem or a crisis. Successful interventions promote (1) personal and social competencies, (2) self-efficacy, (3) social norms for youth, (4) social bonds with others, (5) increased opportunities, and (6) recognition for accomplishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724412475138">Catalano et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive Youth Development and Developmental Assets point out the oppositional nature of thriving and being at risk, as these are generated in tandem by more or less access to family and community resources. Support for this dynamic, however, is not limited to these two perspectives. For example, it was in delinquency research long ago that so-called inner and outer containments were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1936724412475138">Reckless 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1936724412475138">Reckless et al. 1956</xref>). Inner containment, such as a positive sense of self that develops in the family, and outer containment, such as supervision and discipline that reflect relationships with teachers and other conventional people in the community, were found to suppress delinquent behaviors in boys in disadvantaged neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1936724412475138">Reckless 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1936724412475138">Reckless et al. 1956</xref>). Thus, there is wider support for a model that asserts that children and youth require strong internal and external assets derived from family and community to grow up well.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1936724412475138">Mannes et al. (2005)</xref> found that despite the number of assets they have, low-income youth are twice as likely as other youth to participate in delinquent behavior. However, when family economic status is controlled for, youth with higher asset levels are four times more likely to engage in thriving behaviors. In particular, Latino/a youth with 0 to 10 of the 40 assets, on average, engage in 2.7 of 8 measured thriving behaviors; those with 31 to 40 assets, on average, engage in 6.1 of the 8 thriving behaviors. Thus, if Sunday Friends programming successfully fosters assets, then there is promise that young people participating in the programs will have more successful lives.</p>
<p>The programming of activities by Sunday Friends is advisable because, compared with informal adult supervision, structured interventions produce stronger social skills and better academic performance in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1936724412475138">Posner and Vandell 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1936724412475138">Wright et al. 2006</xref>). Likewise, when local organizations provide African American youth with organized and challenging leisure activities that require perseverance and dedicated efforts, they improve participants’ self-concepts, educational expectations, and social development, regardless of neighborhood disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1936724412475138">Quane and Rankin 2006</xref>). Finally, programs fostering active involvement among young persons and their families see increased learning and development, and strengthened family bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1936724412475138">Edington and Randall 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Sunday Friends focus on families is important too because, across social groups, parent–child bonds and good parenting provide support, regulation of behavior, and values as youth grow into adulthood; these, in turn, facilitate conventional success and minimize problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1936724412475138">Rice and Mulkeen 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1936724412475138">Steinberg et al. 1991</xref>). In fact, well into adolescence, youth need attachments and strong relationships with their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1936724412475138">Scales 1997</xref>). Finally, youth who feel connected with parents, and receive discipline and moral guidance from them, demonstrate higher levels of self-control, conflict resolution, peer resistance, well-being, and overall psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1936724412475138">Nandeau et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1936724412475138">Shyamala, McGee, and Stanton 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1936724412475138">Steinberg et al. 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The steady contact between volunteers and family members at Sunday Friends may also prove beneficial—in part, because adolescents have been observed putting greater value on relationships with volunteer mentors than they put on professionals who are dedicated to helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1936724412475138">de Anda 2001</xref>). Also, in an intervention for disadvantaged Latinos, learning and behavior were improved by forming personal relationships with volunteers over participation in activities alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412475138">Barron-McKeagney, Woody, and D’Souza 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1936724412475138">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>The emphasis on building assets at Sunday Friends is appropriate. The families served are largely Latino immigrants, a group that faces multiple obstacles in the United States. Moreover, Latino youth are a group at most risk of underachieving and dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1936724412475138">Karcher 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1936724412475138">Rodriguez and Morrobel (2004</xref>:107) stated, “Latino youths . . . have high rates of developmental deficits,” and “attention to youth development is potentially our greatest strategy in building communities.”</p>
<p>Consistent with the Developmental Assets approach, most activities at Sunday Friends target internal assets such as positive self-concepts and prosocial values, and external assets such as family unity and good parenting. Consistent with Positive Youth Development, coupled with the assistance of volunteers, the program provides educational activities that help them build skills, encourages prosocial attitudes and behaviors, strengthens families, provides opportunities to serve the community, and recognizes and rewards participation in activities.</p>
<p>In light of the research, our view is that Sunday Friends has characteristics that reflect those of a successful program. By involving parents, children, and volunteers in its structured asset-building program activities, Sunday Friends is set to build competencies, community, and stronger families, while it improves prosocial attitudes and positive self-concepts.</p>

<title>Educational Activities</title>
<sec id="section9-1936724412475138">
<title>Review of prior research</title>
<p>Growing up underprivileged limits children’s academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1936724412475138">Gephart 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1936724412475138">McLoyd 1998</xref>) and facilitates negative outcomes throughout their lives such as higher rates of unemployment, drug use, and criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1936724412475138">Gephart 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1936724412475138">Kelly 2000</xref>). Schools in lower income areas are also of lower quality, limiting educational opportunities for area residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1936724412475138">Darling-Hammond 2004</xref>). Compounding the problem of educational access, low-income families typically have one or both parents who did not graduate from high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1936724412475138">Choy 2001</xref>), further restricting poor children’s opportunities for success.</p>
<p>One program that can help is Head Start. This program proves that interventions can produce long-term benefits in education, employment, and prosocial characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412475138">Barnett and Hustedt 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1936724412475138">St. Pierre, Layzer, and Barnes (1996)</xref> pointed out that improvement in children’s learning and family milieu is disappointing in narrowly focused programs that target only children’s development, adults’ parenting skills, or adults’ other life skills. However, they did find promising short-term benefits in programs that simultaneously target parents and children. These include improvement in educational attainment and employment of parents—and perhaps more importantly—parental attitudes toward childrearing, the home learning environment for children, and parents’ nurturing behaviors. Other work has also shown that more comprehensive approaches can help disadvantaged children with language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412475138">Benzies et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Limited English language proficiency is a barrier to success. There are financial consequences of not knowing English such as restricted employment opportunities and getting locked into low-wage jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1936724412475138">Moran and Petsod 2003</xref>). Immigrants can also become entrapped to particular financial networks. For example, the lack of proficiency in written English, regardless of skill in spoken English, leads Latino homebuyers into dealing with Latino lenders only; those with greater skill are actually more likely to choose non-Latino lenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1936724412475138">Toussaint-Comeau and Rhine 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1936724412475138">Larrotta (2009)</xref> explained that ESL education aimed at adults is effective when offered in learning communities that incorporate discussion of adult-relevant topics and inclusion of activities that allow expression and appreciation of cultural identities (e.g., a class on immigration laws). Therefore, ESL instruction outside of traditional classrooms may be an effective educational strategy for adults in program communities like Sunday Friends, because their feelings of membership in the program will heighten motivation to participate and communicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1936724412475138">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Sunday Friends uses education as an intervention for all family members. Education, seen as a pathway out of poverty, is consistently stressed in the program. Primary goals are to teach English language skills, financial literacy, nutrition, and caring for the community and family. These goals are taught in classes (such as a parenting class) and through program rules and program activities. Children and youth’s educational activities include letter writing, educational games, food preparation, and crafts for the community.</p>
<p>Adults regularly take English classes from a community volunteer who teaches speaking, reading, and writing. Consistent with past research, Sunday Friends approaches ESL not only in the classroom, but also through its multiple activities that are rewarded with tickets. In fact, Sunday Friends officially conducts all activities in English—although to bridge communication gaps, it also has a system whereby Spanish-speaking volunteers are easily identified. In addition to the desire to earn tickets, participants may be motivated to learn English by the desire to belong to the larger English-speaking Sunday Friends community.</p>
<p>We believe that the educational activities at Sunday Friends may be sustained, and the lessons internalized, because they are rewarded both intrinsically (fun to do, community-oriented, and culturally relevant) and extrinsically (with payment using tickets, utility of skills). Given that educational interventions can work, Sunday Friends’ emphasis on educational activities for the family is appropriate and suggests greater potential for success.</p>

<title>Program Economy</title>
<sec id="section12-1936724412475138">
<title>Review of prior research</title>
<p>Although not designed to be one per se, the Sunday Friends economy fits within the framework of a token economy, starting with the fact that all completed activities at Sunday Friends are rewarded with tickets. Token economies are focused on producing positive behavior modification, as is Sunday Friends. The components of the Sunday Friends economy align easily with those of a token economy: A specified number of symbolic objects (tickets) that can be exchanged for other reinforcements (goods in the Treasure Chest) are used to reward select target behaviors (such as community engagement, healthy food preparation, etc.). One difference, however, is that although the activities to be rewarded, the rates of reward, and the prices in the store, are all determined in advance by program staff, the Sunday Friends economy is less tightly regulated than is the norm in formally designed behavior modification programs.</p>
<p>The token economy approach is novel for private, nonprofit interventions for families; programs for low-income persons typically do not make resource distribution contingent on rewarded behaviors—although the concept is appealing to Americans and likely what many wish for when they say that welfare should be contingent on work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412475138">Allard 2009</xref>). While token-economy-type programs like Sunday Friends may exist elsewhere, a comprehensive review of evaluations of incentive-based interventions uncovered none that targeted overall success in general or fostering Developmental Assets in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1936724412475138">Kavanagh et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In support of Sunday Friends’ approach, token economies appear to be largely successful at producing desired behavior modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1936724412475138">Hackenberg 2009</xref>). However, they are typically only applied successfully in four types of institutional settings: (1) mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1936724412475138">Glynn 1990</xref>), (2) education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1936724412475138">Reitman et al. 2004</xref>), (3) corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724412475138">Andrews et al. 1990</xref>), and (4) medicine—for healthy behaviors and treatment compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1936724412475138">Bernard and Cohen 2004</xref>). As one can see, these settings are in specialized institutions, targeting behaviors among “problem” populations. While token economy systems are effective with these populations, limited research shows that they can work in other areas. For example, a token economy works to improve safety practices in a hazardous occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1936724412475138">Fox, Hopkins, and Anger 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The research on sustained token economies shows that changes in targeted behaviors are partially maintained long after participation in an intervention program, a finding consistent across treatment settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1936724412475138">Kazdin 1982</xref>). If rigidly implemented, however, token economies are not as effective. Flexibility—variations in rewards given, ways to be rewarded, cost of items, or even allowing participants to transfer their earnings to others—has been shown to augment responsiveness to token economy rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1936724412475138">Kazdin 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we mention one last objective of the program economy: to promote financial literacy. Research into immigrant experiences indicates that people such as those in the program—immigrant, lower income, Latinos—operate outside the financial mainstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1936724412475138">Osili and Paulson 2009</xref>). This group has lower rates of checking and savings accounts, homeownership, investments, and so forth that trigger higher costs and disadvantages such as check cashing service fees, minimal wealth accumulation, substandard living conditions, lower quality schools, and so forth. Promoting financial literacy may be a partial remedy to the economic disadvantages faced by this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1936724412475138">Osili and Paulson 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1936724412475138">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Sunday Friends uses an economic system that is designed to motivate self-reliance and working for the common good. Although the goals of the organization are humanitarian, participants learn capitalist work ethics and responsibilities. Both parents and children earn tickets when they complete activities. With the tickets, participants may purchase goods and everyday necessities, such as soap, diapers, school supplies, toys, and so forth.</p>
<p>Items in the Treasure Chest are bound by general principles of supply and demand. Volunteers set prices by roughly matching ticket prices of merchandize with dollar prices in discount stores—more tickets for things of higher value and fewer tickets for things of lower value. These volunteers also set higher prices for in-demand items and lower prices for overstocked goods (i.e., they have clearance sales). However, items that advance the goals of Sunday Friends, such as school supplies, are often sold at reduced cost.</p>
<p>As noted before, the economy at Sunday Friends is by and large a token economy. Moreover, the program economy has the kind of flexibility that should enhance its effectiveness, a flexibility derived from the program’s attempt to mimic economic organizations and practices in the American economy. Unlike the typical token economy, Sunday Friends does not target a narrow range of specific behaviors. However, it does reward participation in prosocial and educational activities, and that dynamic holds promise of increasing those behaviors over time.</p>
<p>An important element of the Sunday Friends economy is the banking system, which mirrors the structure of a typical U.S. bank. Through Sunday Friends’ banking system, participants are socialized to banking, learning how to, among other things, balance accounts, save, withdraw tickets, and with time, trust the bank. The bank pays interest on tickets saved, and persons may use, give away, store, and exchange tickets at will. In addition, workshops are offered to teach individuals about the process of opening checking accounts and managing them (e.g., how to keep them from over drafting).</p>
<p>These efforts to promote financial literacy may partially remedy the economic disadvantages faced by the families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1936724412475138">Osili and Paulson 2009</xref>). The ability to safely secure savings and to avoid fees associated with check cashing or low balances may allow them to build capital. For the children and youth, getting a healthy financial start could give them advantages that accelerate financial asset building earlier in their lives.</p>

<title>Developing Social Capital</title>
<sec id="section15-1936724412475138">
<title>Review of prior research</title>
<p>Social capital is a critical element of building trust and social networks between community members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1936724412475138">Putnam (2000)</xref> defined social capital as “the features of social organizations such as networks, norms and social trust that facilitate the coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit” (p. 19). While lower income communities often have strong concentrations of social capital, networks rarely extend beyond class boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1936724412475138">Putnam 2000</xref>), making it difficult to access the privileges associated with wealthier networks.</p>
<p>Social capital can be understood like other forms of capital such as human and physical capital. Whereas human capital consists of individual skills and knowledge, and physical capital constitutes tangible tools and machines, social capital represents the ability for persons to leverage their social ties to accomplish a task. The linked social networks, norms, and trust that constitute social capital can produce many benefits such as increased solidarity, community involvement, and empowerment; however, these are typically exclusionary along race, class, and gender lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1936724412475138">Putnam 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The shared norms and trust that constitute social capital facilitate frequent relationships among homogeneous groups, but persons who have different norms than those of established groups are alienated, perpetuating exclusion and inequality. Acknowledging the dividing aspects of social capital, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1936724412475138">Putnam (2000)</xref> defined two types of social capital: bonding and bridging. Bonding occurs within homogeneous social groups, while bridging establishes links between different bonded social groups for access to otherwise closed-off resources and information.</p>
<p>Examining the bonding and bridging types of social capital, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1936724412475138">Schneider (2006)</xref> critically examined the role that social capital plays in community-based organizations for lower income persons. She asserted that the term “closed” is more appropriate than “bonding” because it better describes the benefits of particular networks that are inaccessible to outsiders. From this perspective, facilitating bridging social capital and reducing that which is “closed” is an important goal of community-based organizations; bridging can foster trust and connection between lower income participants and better-off program staff, granting each side access to otherwise unavailable assets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1936724412475138">Schneider (2006)</xref> warned, however, that to develop bridging social capital, deliberate and time-intensive effort must be allocated to cultivating shared norms and tolerance between closed groups.</p>
<p>Community-based organizations are essential to develop bridging social capital in low-income communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724412475138">Brisson and Usher 2005</xref>). For bridging to occur, program staff must consistently participate in activities, and they must be available to informally transmit information about things such as job searching, family rearing, and coping strategies to overcome common quality of life challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1936724412475138">Lockhart 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although community-based organizations can successfully build bridging social capital, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724412475138">Brisson and Usher (2005)</xref> reported that they are also important places for stimulating “bonding” social capital within communities; they are considered safe environments, allowing participants to establish social ties, networks, and trust among themselves. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724412475138">Brisson and Usher (2005)</xref> discovered that these outlets are especially beneficial to lower income African American and Latino women who often feel isolated within their communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1936724412475138">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>The literature indicates that bridging social capital can improve the living conditions of low-income and minority persons. Examining the Sunday Friends model, one observes that it includes components that contribute to bridging social capital. These involve long-term family participation in consistently programmed activities that are directed by long-serving, experienced volunteers. Volunteers typically differ from family members by age, race, social class, and education, but the two groups work side-by-side in all aspects of the program; family members and volunteers (including staff) develop a high level of familiarity with each other. In our time there, it was rare to encounter someone who did not know who almost everyone else was. Family members and volunteers may form relationships that become friendly or even closely personal, promoting the exchange of social and economic-based assets (e.g., job opportunities).</p>
<p>However, bonding social capital may also be enhanced as participants work together in the Sunday Friends “community” over the years. In addition, if participants were to learn prosocial attitudes at Sunday Friends and apply them in their home communities, bonding social capital at home would be strengthened as well.</p>

<title>Healthy Eating</title>
<sec id="section18-1936724412475138">
<title>Review of prior research</title>
<p>Mexican Americans are among the most overweight of racial and ethnic groups whether one focuses on children, adolescents, or adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1936724412475138">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997</xref>). Signaling future problems, about one-fourth of Mexican American children are obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1936724412475138">Suminski et al. 1999</xref>). Being overweight or obese is a concern because excess weight predicts several diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1936724412475138">Crawford et al. 2010</xref>), and even periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1936724412475138">Gorman et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The apparent epidemic of type 2 diabetes among the young is increasingly hitting Mexican American children and youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724412475138">Alberti et al. 2004</xref>); they now have elevated rates of adverse outcomes from the disease, including hospitalization and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1936724412475138">National Council of La Raza 2009</xref>). Factors putting this group at risk include unhealthy, high-fat diets, with fruit and vegetable consumption rates at half that considered healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1936724412475138">Treviño et al. 1999</xref>). Health trends make healthy eating essential to improving the well-being of Latinos. However, more successful interventions into diets will likely be those targeted at families, not individuals, because Latinos are frequently more family-centric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1936724412475138">Teufel-Shone, Drummond, and Rawiel 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1936724412475138">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Food sharing is a central component of Sunday Friends. Originating with family members early in the program’s history, potluck lunches and snacks are served. Assisted by children and youth, food preparation and cooking are done on-site by parents and volunteers. Sunday Friends uses this activity to promote healthy eating habits by encouraging and allowing only healthy food to be served—foods that are high in fat or sugar, such as soft drinks and potato chips are actively prohibited. This tradition teaches which foods are healthy, how to prepare them, and that healthy food can taste good.</p>
<p>Sunday Friends also promotes healthy eating through classes in nutrition, and even through games that volunteers play with children. As with other things, participants are rewarded with tickets for food-related activities too, and when spending those tickets, they find that the rules about healthy foods apply there too. The store does not carry any foods that are deemed unhealthy (e.g., candy bars).</p>
<p>The focus on healthy foods at Sunday Friends is appropriate for the mostly Latino participants. The fact that the message is partly integrated within a community framework where food sharing is normative suggests that Sunday Friends can succeed at changing participating families’ eating habits.</p>

<sec id="section20-1936724412475138">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The Sunday Friends program is designed appropriately to achieve the organization’s goals for the population being served. The program economy and the ticket system should work to teach financial literacy and to motivate participation in program activities. The activities are designed consistent with practices vetted by research. Sunday Friends is positioned well to foster developmental assets, support educational success, build social capital, and promote healthy eating among its participating families.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section22-1936724412475138">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data are from two biannual surveys (2009 and 2011) of families (children, youth, parents, and guardians) and volunteers at Sunday Friends. We surveyed families over four Sundays, in February and March 2009, and during March and April 2011, during regular program hours. Research team members and program staff recruited family members in person, on-site.</p>
<p>Following procedures approved by San José State University’s Institutional Review Board, informed consent—participation voluntary, withdrawal permitted without consequences—was obtained from participants prior to interviews. Although questions were not about sensitive topics, participants were instructed to skip any that discomforted them. Participants were paid Sunday Friends tickets for completing an interview (amounts set by Sunday Friends include the following: children and youth, 100 in 2009, 150 in 2011; adults, for a longer interview, 150 in 2009, 200 in 2011). The compensation rate for this project was like that for other activities.</p>
<p>However, volunteers were recruited, and data collected from them, in different ways. In 2009, program staff chose a core group of volunteers to survey and recruited them via email—The first author wrote the email script. Consenting participants completed an online questionnaire at their leisure. In 2011, program staff again chose a core group of volunteers, but this time they were recruited on-site by program staff and research team members. Consenting participants were taken to computer stations where they completed their questionnaires online. Those not recruited on-site were solicited, and consenting participants responded, in the same manner as described for 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1936724412475138">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>Participants were asked about Sunday Friends and themselves, and parents or guardians were asked additional questions about their children. The questions may be classified as (1) demographics, (2) core issues (Developmental Assets, educational activities, program economy, social capital, and healthy eating), (3) influence of Sunday Friends on daily living, and (4) satisfaction with Sunday Friends. Most items, or previous versions of them, were used by prior Sunday Friends evaluations. There were two versions of the questionnaire: English and Spanish (with translation from English, with professional verification of translation accuracy). The survey items are included in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1936724412475138">Appendices A</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1936724412475138">B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1936724412475138">C</xref>.</p>
<p>Each family member was interviewed face-to-face. Written questions and response options were visible to them during the interview—For children, response options were accompanied by iconic symbols. Each interviewer wrote answers down on a questionnaire booklet. These were later entered into a data file by the evaluation team.</p>
<p>However, Sunday Friends volunteers answered a self-administered electronic questionnaire about themselves and Sunday Friends in English only (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1936724412475138">Appendix C</xref>). Their answers were automatically entered into a database by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surveymonkey.com">surveymonkey.com</ext-link>. Questions generally asked for volunteers’ opinions of the effects of Sunday Friends on families. However, they were also asked to report about themselves: (1) demographics and (2) the ways that Sunday Friends participation has affected them personally.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This evaluation assesses whether Sunday Friends participation may be fostering developmental assets in children and youth, and whether any effects of Sunday Friends appear to continue in the home environment. This evaluation will also report participants’ and volunteers’ views of Sunday Friends activities. Although the two evaluation reports submitted to Sunday Friends covered more issues, our presentation here focuses on selected results of the effects of the program on children and youth from the perspectives of family members and volunteers. We start by presenting characteristics of participating families.</p>

<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Demographic information on family members is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1936724412475138">Table 1</xref>. Children and youth range in age from 7 to 17, with a mean age of 10.6 years; they are in Grades 2 through 12 in school, and two-thirds of them are girls.

<p>Parents and guardians report that they are mostly immigrant women with an average age of approximately 31 years. Almost all were born outside the United States, in Central or South America, but most are from Mexico; consequently, the majority is Latino. Although overwhelmingly immigrants, most have resided in the United States for longer than six years. Most report renting their home, earning below median family income, having high school or less education, and less than full-time employment.</p>
<p>Participants’ family structures defy popular stereotypes about people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Most report living in two-parent households, mother and father, although single-mother households are common too. Roughly half of the children and youth attend Sunday Friends with “their families.” Approximately a quarter say they attend only with their mother. As one might expect, very few attend only with their father.</p>
<p>Much like those who attend Sunday Friends, the volunteers are disproportionately female (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1936724412475138">Table 1</xref>). Their employment profiles are similar too, although being a housewife is less common among the volunteers. At this point, however, the similarity between family members and volunteers ends.</p>
<p>In contrast with mostly Latino family members, volunteers report being almost two-thirds white and Asian. In terms of income and education, the volunteers also enjoy a noticeably more privileged background. Although many volunteers currently attend high school, the proportion of college educated among them is substantially higher, nearly one-half compared with one-fifth of parents. The volunteers’ income is also considerably higher. More than two-thirds of volunteers report family income that is <italic>above</italic> $60,000, while more than 90 percent of parents or guardians report family income <italic>below</italic> $50,000.</p>
<p>The differences between volunteers and family members have potential to influence the effects of Sunday Friends on children and youth. The differences could create social distance and work against Sunday Friends programming. However, if strong relationships were to form between them, then bridging social capital could develop. Volunteers could also serve as models for attaining success.</p>

<sec id="section26-1936724412475138">
<title>Influence of Sunday Friends on Children and Youth</title>
<p>We now turn to the ways that Sunday Friends influences children and youth, as seen from the perspectives of family members. These perceptions were measured with items that reflect whether the effects of Sunday Friends programming is consistent with promoting developmental assets and prosocial behaviors. Mean responses can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412475138">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">3</xref>. The results reveal remarkable agreement between the younger family members and the adults, and a high consistency in perceptions across the two evaluation years. Although data from 2009 and 2011 are presented side-by-side in the tables, displaying similarity of results, statistical tests of differences between means from these overlapping samples were not conducted.</p>

<title>Children’s Feelings While at Sunday Friends</title>
<p>Children and youth were asked the degree to which they feel positive emotions while participating at Sunday Friends. The prompt was, “When you are at Sunday Friends, do you feel . . .” with items such as feeling safe, happy, proud, and so forth to be rated on a scale from, 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very</italic>. Overwhelmingly, in both evaluations, young people agree that they have these positive emotions, giving high marks on each evaluative item (ranging from 3.95 to 4.77; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412475138">Table 2</xref>). Disagreement with a positive item was rare; the majority indicated the highest agreement.</p>
<p>Four items for negative feelings were also included. Apart from being measures of feelings, we also see these as indicators of the validity of positive responses. Response patterns to these suggest that young people really do experience positive feelings at Sunday Friends. Instead of response-set bias, the negative items show reversal from agreement to disagreement (with means ranging from 1.36 to 2.27; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412475138">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, children, overall, perceive that Sunday Friends has a positive impact on their feelings and not a negative one.</p>
<p>Further validation of children and youth’s positive feelings while at Sunday Friends is seen in reports about them by parents and guardians. In both evaluations, adults strongly agree that their children have positive feelings while at Sunday Friends (means range from 3.98 to 4.74; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412475138">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, when solicited to report negative emotions, just like their children, the parents report strong disagreement on those items (means range from 1.58 to 2.17; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412475138">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1936724412475138">
<title>Children’s Thoughts and Behaviors</title>
<p>This next section covers whether, relative to time spent elsewhere, Sunday Friends prompts thoughts and behaviors that foster assets and prosocial attitudes. Children and youth were asked, “Compared to other times during the week, when you are at Sunday Friends, do you . . .” followed by seven individual item choices with response options ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very</italic>. Ratings cover manners, appreciation of family, enjoyment of learning, and so on. Like previous results, in both evaluation years, young respondents overwhelmingly report high agreement with these items, with responses concentrated at the higher end of the scale. Mean responses range from 3.64 to 4.67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">Table 3</xref>). The lowest score each year is found in response to “gets help with oral English.”</p>
<p>Parents and guardians’ ratings on the same aforementioned items were in response to the prompt, “Tell us in what ways do you think your children’s participation in Sunday Friends has influenced their life? They . . . .” Once again, results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">Table 3</xref> show strong agreement with the items as mean responses range from 3.67 to 4.73 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">Table 3</xref>). Consistent with their children’s responses, parents show robust agreement that Sunday Friends is fostering assets and encouraging prosocial behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1936724412475138">
<title>Critical Assessment of Programming for Children</title>
<p>Improving from 2009, the 2011 evaluation included additional items that allow for a more nuanced assessment of the effectiveness of the programming for children at Sunday Friends. These address satisfaction, developing social capital, and the extent to which the program influences children and youth in other settings. The results are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">Table 3</xref>. Younger participants say that they are satisfied—they like attending (<italic>M</italic> = 4.54), they attend not because of coercion (<italic>M</italic> = 1.51), they want to be like the volunteers (<italic>M</italic> = 4.28), and they think that the volunteers are nice to them (<italic>M</italic> = 4.79). The positive perceptions of volunteers suggest potential for bridging social capital. Responses to other items also indicate a positive effect on social capital. Children and youth report trying to belong to activity groups (<italic>M</italic> = 4.31), and their parents agree (<italic>M</italic> = 4.04). They also agree that Sunday Friends helps them to like other people more (<italic>M</italic> = 4.41) and to be a leader (<italic>M</italic> = 4.26).</p>
<p>Finally, responses from children and youth suggest a continuing influence of Sunday Friends into other settings. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1936724412475138">Table 3</xref> show that younger participants say they practice English with others while away from the program (<italic>M</italic> = 4.23). However, they report only modest agreement with also talking about Sunday Friends with others (<italic>M</italic> = 3.67). Supporting the program’s token economy system is the fact that children and youth report feeling proud when they work for the things they want (<italic>M</italic> = 4.64), a sentiment echoed by parents about them (<italic>M</italic> = 4.61).</p>
<p>On the whole, data from younger participants, and their parents and guardians point to a positive influence of Sunday Friends on children and youth’s feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. They also suggest that Sunday Friends has an enduring effect on young persons, not just a temporary influence on Sunday afternoons. These findings are buttressed by our use of negative items when measuring feelings, by the consistency of opinions across items, and by the ways adults’ responses substantiate those of their children. The consistent positive reports given by both children and parents strengthen, and are consistent with, the argument that Sunday Friends influences the experiences and behaviors of participating children and youth as intended.</p>

<title>Influence on Parents and Guardians</title>
<p>Given the importance of the parent–child relationship, Sunday Friends involves parents to extend its influence on children. Supportive parents also represent a critical asset, and they can foster various other developmental assets. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1936724412475138">Table 4</xref> are from items intended to grade Sunday Friends’ efforts to influence them. These items rely on the parents or guardians’ perceptions of the ways that Sunday Friends has affected their feelings and behaviors in four domains: family, self, language, and social capital.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>“Family” items show parents and guardians reporting high agreement that confidence as a parent, and support and interaction with their children, has improved. There is more than 90 percent agreement for all but one item, which is that they are more involved with helping their children succeed in school (89.2 and 85.7 percent). The difference with this item is minor, but it could be a product of parents’ lower educational attainment.</p>
<p>“Self” items in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1936724412475138">Table 4</xref> also show agreement—ranging from 90 to 100 percent. These suggest that Sunday Friends participation is associated with improved positive self-concepts among the adults. However, responses in the areas of “social capital” and “language skills” suggest that programming is not as effective in these domains.</p>
<p>Social capital was measured with items that were new in the 2011 evaluation. While parents feel like they belong and are willing to get more involved—with agreement approximating 90 percent—most do not report getting involved more as a result of attending Sunday Friends, and they report low levels of trust in other people (42.9 percent) and minimal increase in comfort around those from different races or ethnicities (61.2 percent). Perhaps the fact that the majority of participants in Sunday Friends are Latino plays a role here, but volunteers are not. All in all, the suggestive portrait of social capital is one where parents maintain <italic>bonding</italic> social capital within their own social group, but fail to develop <italic>bridging</italic> social capital with others outside of their network.</p>
<p>Improvement in “language skills” also receives lower ratings among the adults. On the upside, most interviewees reported being more confident about writing in general, and those for whom Spanish is the primary language report that Sunday Friends has improved their English skills. On the downside, however, comfort with speaking and writing in English is limited to about half of the respondents. The data suggest improvement in English skills, but lack of comfort when using them.</p>
<p>The low marks for social capital and language skills are noteworthy given the overwhelmingly positive reviews of most aspects of the program. The results reveal that Sunday Friends is only marginally helpful at helping parents or guardians build bridging social networks and learn English language skills. These results suggest that many families will continue to face obstacles with economic success. These diverging ratings imply something else too: Respondents are willing to rate some aspects of Sunday Friends lower, pointing to more confidence in the validity of the positive ratings elsewhere.</p>

<title>Critical Assessment of Programming for Adults</title>
<p>The final component of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1936724412475138">Table 4</xref> includes items added in 2011 for the purpose of allowing more critical feedback about the quality of programs and the extent to which programming is influential in other settings. The results show support for most aspects of the program, with mean ratings around 4.5 (1–5 scale) for all but two items. It is important to note that parents or guardians rated the volunteers higher than most other aspects of Sunday Friends, saying that they are friendly and good role models for their children. The two exceptions to highly positive reviews were the ratings of practicing English while away from the program (<italic>M</italic> = 3.47) and prices at the Treasure Chest (<italic>M</italic> = 2.60). Responses to the first of these items reinforce the concerns about English skills development at Sunday Friends, but concerns about prices are likely a running concern among these low-income families. Dissatisfaction may also be generated by efforts to make prices at the Sunday Friends store comparable with those at discount retailers—prices that families likely complain about routinely.</p>

<title>Effects of Sunday Friends as Seen by Volunteers</title>
<p>Volunteers were also asked to rate items about family members and about their connectedness to Sunday Friends families. Like participants, in both evaluation years, the volunteers view Sunday Friends as having a positive influence on the children. Volunteers’ average ratings of Sunday Friends helping children with positive feelings and behaviors such as using good manners, money management, and sense of security range between 4.12 and 4.64 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1936724412475138">Table 5</xref> for more items).

<title>Healthy Eating</title>
<p>The last component of Sunday Friends programming to be evaluated is eating habits. We asked parents a small set of questions—more in 2009 than in 2011—to determine whether the programming and food rules influence families in the intended ways. As results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1936724412475138">Table 6</xref> indicate, parents are trying to get their children to eat healthier and are also trying to do so themselves. Parents also claim that they and their children actually eat healthier than they did before. When asked in 2011, parents also report trying to shop for healthier foods. Means for the five items above, on a scale from 1 to 3—<italic>no, maybe, yes</italic>—range from 2.66 to 2.93.</p>

<p>Other results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1936724412475138">Table 6</xref> are for questions only asked of adults in 2009. These covered efforts to eat or avoid specific food types such as fruits and vegetables, and sugar; ratings are on a scale from 1 = <italic>given no thought</italic> to 4 = <italic>conscientiously doing</italic>. On average, parents and guardians report a high level of effort. The lowest effort (<italic>M</italic> = 3.04) is for “eats unhealthy foods no more than once a day.” With means ranging from 3.45 to 3.70, more effort is reported for other healthy eating choices such as eating whole grains and limiting the amount of sugar their children eat. Overall, adults’ responses indicate efforts to eat healthier as a result of involvement in Sunday Friends.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>A cumulative review of results from two evaluations of Sunday Friends, with data taken from three perspectives—children and youth, parents or guardians, and volunteers—shows consistent agreement that Sunday Friends offers a supportive atmosphere, with positive experiences for children and their families, that fosters assets and prosocial values for children. Moreover, the results add credibility to the unique token economy at Sunday Friends, which appears to motivate educational and prosocial activities that reward and reinforce healthy attitudes and behaviors. Important for the immigrant Latino children who participate, those attitudes and behaviors also support increasing social capital and eating a healthier diet too. The evidence from this evaluation suggests that the Sunday Friends approach is working.</p>
<p>The growing body of research on Developmental Assets and Positive Youth Development demonstrates that the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors like those fostered among the children and youth, and their families bode well for their future success. The evidence here is that Sunday Friends participation increases the odds of children thriving.</p>
<p>The educational activities at Sunday Friends appear to be beneficial and appropriate. Participants are satisfied with what the program offers, and they generally report a positive attitude toward education in general. An important skill for families at Sunday Friends to learn, however, is English language usage. Children and youth appear fine in that regard, as they are comfortable using English—Most chose English language interviews. The parents or guardians, however, report greater difficulty with English—The majority of them chose Spanish language interviews.</p>
<p>Although the program focus is not on helping adults, because language barriers affect family mobility, the program may want to direct more effort to encourage and reward the use of English, without invalidating the value of the Spanish language or culture. If parents or guardians were to become more comfortable with using the English language, their children would likely benefit. Parents would likely be exposed to more diverse and enriching social networks and resources, and they would also likely become more effective advocates for their children at school and in their community.</p>
<p>The novel token economy employed by Sunday Friends, rewarding learning and community engagement in a way that allows families to feel like they have earned the things they need or want, appears to be effective. Given that the Sunday Friends economy is threaded through all activities, satisfaction with programming also suggests satisfaction with the token economy model. Responses from family members indicate that Sunday Friends programming is advancing program goals; this is further evidence that the economy works. The fact that children are proud of working for tangible items (e.g., a bicycle) they want is evidence of successful socialization into the prevailing capitalist economy. The evaluations reported here, however, did not include items assessing financial literacy; therefore, claims in this domain remain limited and suited for future evaluations.</p>
<p>The 2011 evaluation introduced a more critical assessment of the impact of Sunday Friends. The added assessment provides more support for their model. One main aspect of the new assessment was whether Sunday Friends promoted social capital formation because the prospects of success are improved when social networks provide opportunities and resources. Besides questions dedicated to social capital formation beyond Sunday Friends, social capital formation within Sunday Friends was also assessed with measures of satisfaction with programming and volunteers.</p>
<p>Sunday Friends can boast that there is a high level of satisfaction with its programming and its volunteers. This fact, along with results for the topical items, indicates that Sunday Friends helps children and youth develop social capital, both the bonding (within class lines) and bridging (across class lines) types. Family members and volunteers report mutually positive evaluations of each other. More important, however, is the fact that children and youth aspire to be like the volunteers and that parents or guardians believe that the volunteers are good role models for their children. Given that the volunteers are remarkably different in racial and socioeconomic profile from the families, the positive sentiment between families and volunteers paves the way for children and youth to establish beneficial social engagement outside of the boundaries of Latino immigrants’ social and economic networks.</p>
<p>Although our results suggest that Sunday Friends may help to develop social capital among children and youth, they do not so much for parents or guardians. Social capital formation appears more limited to bonding (within social class groups). Although there is little attitudinal resistance to network diversification among them, parents or guardians report much lower levels of comfort and engagement with others as a result of Sunday Friends attendance. One reason is likely language related. Spanish-speaking adults credit Sunday Friends for improving their English, but there remains a high level of discomfort with using the English language. Undoubtedly, other factors such as immigration-based experiences, and cultural and socioeconomic differences from the broader society also affect their network affiliations. It is encouraging to see, however, that the adults show little resistance to their children cultivating pathways into broader social networks.</p>
<p>Finally, Sunday Friends programming encourages healthier eating at home. Parents or guardians report that they have been monitoring their families’ diets more and that they and their children have been eating healthier foods since attending the program. The payoff for healthier eating may literally last a lifetime. Since the families attending Sunday Friends are at great risk of adverse health effects resulting from a poor diet, changes resulting from the influence of Sunday Friends has the potential to make a difference in the future health of the communities that it serves.</p>
<sec id="section35-1936724412475138">
<title>Credibility of the Evaluation</title>
<p>The most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of Sunday Friends, arguably, originates from the responses of children and youth. Children and youth have little conception of “stake” when it comes to confirming the effectiveness of the Sunday friends program. Self-ratings by children and youth support the notion that Sunday Friends is effective at accomplishing its mission and goals. All ratings point toward psychosocial thriving that children attribute to their participation.</p>
<p>Most self-rating items measured positive feelings and behaviors associated with Sunday Friends. However, to introduce counterfactual evidence as a basis of comparison, opposite direction items were also incorporated into the questionnaire. This safeguard offers an assessment, to a certain extent, of whether young participants are paying attention, or are instead thoughtlessly responding the same to all items or showing agreement bias. All in all, negative items are rated opposite of positive items; younger participants do voice strong disagreement with negative items. Children and youth intentionally credit Sunday Friends for positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Providing further evidence of the positive influence on children and youth, adults reporting about their own children reiterate the things that children and youth reported about themselves. It is worth repeating that parents or guardians were interviewed separately from the children and youth, and that each could not have been influenced by the other. The agreement in magnitude and patterns of response lends validity to the reports made by family members.</p>
<p>Through triangulation over two evaluations, results from parents and volunteers corroborate the results from children and youth that show positive influences of Sunday Friends on them. The overall pattern of results is that Sunday Friends is achieving its goals. Not only is the programming influencing the families as planned, but the children also reportedly carry the lessons from Sunday Friends with them into other domains.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>Sunday Friends bills itself as “the working alternative to charity.” In many ways, this tagline reflects the public’s perceptions of and frustrations with contemporary welfare programs. It is thought that Federal programs promote handout dependency and “learned helplessness.” This image of welfare is erroneous because direct cash aid is now a thing of the past with work being a requirement for aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412475138">Allard 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Government assistance, however, may be more likely now to contribute to a cycle of poverty. Most government antipoverty money is now sent to nonprofits, where there is no systematic antipoverty strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412475138">Allard 2009</xref>). In addition, the work requirement of welfare fails to consider the costs of employment—wage reduction in benefits, cab fare or automobile expenses, cost of clothes for work, expensive child care—for minimum wage jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412475138">Alexander 2012</xref>). Compounding that picture is that many immigrants are ineligible for public assistance.</p>
<p>Sunday Friends provides assistance to poor families with a philosophy that is consistent with American attitudes—that benefits should be tied to work. There are no cash handouts, and the participants embrace a work ethic while also gaining resources, attitudes, and skills that empower them to become self-sufficient. Sunday Friends may serve as a model for how to provide services in a way that the U.S. public would endorse. If replicated, this approach could alter perceptions of the poor and convince the public of the importance of supporting antipoverty programs.</p>
<p>Although Sunday Friends could be a model for others, it is a program that does not receive government aid. As such, it has no restrictions placed on whom it may help. Currently, Sunday Friends serves mostly immigrant families. As such, it appears promising as a model for how to help immigrant families succeed in the U.S. mainstream economy. Critics may argue that programs such as Sunday Friends risk erasing ethnic identity. First, to address concerns of assimilation at the cost of ethnic identity, there is no evidence that Sunday Friends negates or devalues Latino cultures. Furthermore, some argue that immigrants want to assimilate, experiencing extraordinary circumstances to migrate to a country where the primary language is English and hard work is valued as a precursor to success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412475138">D’Souza 2005</xref>). We would likely benefit if more programs like Sunday Friends capitalized on immigrants’ work ethic and channeled it toward community engagement and self-efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-1936724412475138">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of our evaluations is self-selection bias. Persons who attend Sunday Friends once and fail to continue the program may differ from those committed to attend regularly. Attrition from this program is multifaceted. Many families relocate due to unstable economic conditions. Others may prefer not to return since extended involvement in activities is required to acquire tangible and intangible benefits. We did not collect data from those who ceased attending the program. Therefore, self-selection remains an artifact of the data. If self-selection is a factor, those who continue to participate in Sunday Friends may possess a different philosophy about work and achievement than individuals who fail to return. In that case, the positive results may apply only to those who to some degree are better suited for token economy intervention. Nonetheless, the results are still consistent with effective programming.</p>
<p>Another limitation is related to participants’ motivational factors. Those participants who continue the program may be more motivated to improve their lives than those who discontinue. Arguably, those who cease attending may need the program more than those who remain, and those who stay could show improvement in a program without a token economy. Obviously, such factors cannot be controlled for in our evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section38-1936724412475138">
<title>Final Remarks</title>
<p>The results of this evaluation suggest that the Sunday Friends’ intervention may help marginalized individuals prevail against their social conditions, practice agency and resistance, and avoid “learned helplessness.” Overall, the findings support the effectiveness of Sunday Friends’ philosophy of providing low-income families with resources earned through community engagement, and acquiring assets and tools to empower themselves. It is safe to conclude that this community-based, token economy approach to empowering families has great promise.</p>
<p>As other research suggested (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1936724412475138">Mannes et al. 2005</xref>), young persons who gain developmental assets, social capital, skills, and healthy habits are able to thrive, become successful, and help develop stronger communities. Programs like Sunday Friends would likely add value to other lower income communities. Those wishing to start programs intended to help lower income children and youth achieve success may wish to replicate the Sunday Friends community-based, family-centered, token economy approach to being a “working alternative to charity.”</p>
