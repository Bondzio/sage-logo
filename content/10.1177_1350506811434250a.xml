<p>In recent years, African women’s writing has gained increased visibility, not only in its own continent but also within world literature. This can be observed in the high literary output of recent African female writers, whose presence in jointly edited volumes is evident today, with examples such as the short story collection <italic>A Life in Full and Other Stories</italic> (2010) edited by The Caine Prize for African Writing – where 9 of its 17 stories are female authored – as well as the launch of the ambitious <italic>Women Writing Africa</italic> series by The Feminist Press, with volumes published biennially from 2003. The extensive anthology <italic>African Women Writing Resistance: An Anthology of Contemporary Voices</italic> can be considered an outstanding contribution in terms of its thematic unity, the quality of much of its writing and its objective of ‘bringing the voices of emerging African women writers to a wider audience’, as stated in its introduction (p. xiii). Published by Pambazuka Press, though originally published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2010, it includes 36 texts linked in having been written in the last few years by African-born women and to illustrate, as the title suggests, different forms of resistance to oppression in the continent.</p>
<p>The texts, most previously unpublished, belong to a great diversity of genres and nationalities, which makes the volume all the more interesting and illustrative of African women’s contemporary writing. Poetry, short fiction, interviews, essays, autobiographical reflections, letters and extracts from novels, all enrich the reader’s perception of African women’s concerns both in the literary and social fields. Its meticulous organization is one of the strong points of the anthology, since readers soon get the impression that every detail has been thoughtfully planned, from the carefully chosen epigraphs by Zimbabwean novelist Yvonne Vera and Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, which highlight the importance of hope and the imagination in the search for freedom, to the endearing dedication and empowering feminist poems by Ghanaian Abena P.A. Busia, which open and close the volume. These contribute to establishing a tone of sorority, which is further supported by the explanation of the genesis of the project offered in its preface.</p>
<p>Under the experienced hand of American feminist academic Jennifer Browdy de Hernandez, co-editor in 2004 of a similar anthology focused on Latin American and Caribbean women’s writing (Cambridge, MA: South End Press), African literature specialist Anne Serafin and African-born university students Pauline Dongala and Omotayo Jolaosho worked together on this compilation, selected from numerous submissions in response to their 2005 call for papers. The collaborative nature of the project is highlighted at diverse points in the book through phrases such as ‘[t]he four sister editors of this anthology’ (p. xiii), ‘collective vision’ (p. xiii), ‘our sisters and brothers’ (p. 294) and ‘embrace in sisterhood’ (p. 304), which emphasize bonds of solidarity in ways which bring to mind the idealism of 1970s feminism. Although the book can be accused of being too optimistic considering the still difficult situation of many African women today, it succeeds in sending an empowering message, which stems from a consciousness of the volume as a political statement. Furthermore, frequent references to solidarity and sorority and dreams and visions of a better future and bonds across generations are echoed in the editorial sections as well as in the roundtable at the end of the anthology, thus reinforcing its resemblance to 1970s feminism. However, it must be noted that some of the contributors have openly rejected any alignment with a ‘white feminist discourse’, suggesting that any similarity is ‘a result of the universal nature of female oppression and the common emotional reactions which are stimulated by such oppression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506811434250">Chapman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its overtly idealistic tone, the anthology has the merit of being closely in touch with African reality, as it provides space for a wide range of genres and the exploration of a great diversity of forms of oppression and resistance. The contributions are arranged thematically in seven sections, each preceded by a brief introduction whose aim is to clarify the link between them and the relevance of the topic as a form of resistance in Africa. These sections cover different facets of women’s lives in Africa, from marriage, tradition and sexuality to health, activism and diaspora, with a higher number of contributions dealing with sexuality and health.</p>
<p>Although the majority of contributors are emergent writers, the contributions of several established feminists or ‘activist “mothers”’, as they are called by the editors (p. 5), such as Nawal El Saadawi from Egypt or Abena Busia from Ghana, reinforce the links across generations and the diverse profiles of contributors, who come from different ethnic (and linguistic) backgrounds and 13 different countries, namely, Zimbabwe, Congo-Brazzaville, South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, Botswana, Zambia, Senegal, Egypt and Morocco. Taking into consideration the vastness of the African continent, I would have liked to find contributions from some other nationalities, as only 13 of the 53 African countries are represented in the anthology. However, it must also be admitted that a balanced representation of nationalities would be very difficult to achieve. In any case, this imbalance is compensated by the balanced selection of approaches and forms of resistance portrayed.</p>
<p>Tradition stands as the first site of conflict for African women and gives, therefore, its title to the first group of texts in the anthology, initiated with an empowering story about a woman warrior by Zimbabwean E.Z. Nyemba. This section includes two insightful interviews which reveal the strategies for survival of two elderly women from conflicting ethnic communities in Congo: Babongos (Pygmies) and Bantus. The difficulties of translation and intercultural communication in these texts bear witness to the linguistic richness of the continent and remind us of Kenyan novelist and activist Ngũgĩ Wa Thiong’o’s argument that it is important to translate between African languages, an argument that has met with little success so far, as he has recently pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506811434250">Wa Thiong’o, 2010</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>Most of the texts dealing with sexuality in the anthology are autobiographical. The topics approached include male violence, child sexual abuse, prostitution, the fear of AIDS and violence towards lesbians, among others. Particularly powerful are the autobiographical ‘Letters to My Cousin’ by C. Makoni, where a feminist activist in her 30s sends worried emails to her younger cousin warning her about her sexual affair with an older, married man, or ‘Story of Faith’ by M. Kabu, where a young university student chooses prostitution as her way of life. In these eight texts, female solidarity and feminist activism feature prominently as empowering strategies, as can be especially observed in ‘Woman Weep No More’ by S. Mtungwa and ‘To Be or Not to Be a Lesbian’ by S.N. Nyeck.</p>
<p>The following section, titled ‘Challenging the Institution of Marriage’, comprises not only short stories but also poetry and an essay, and explores conflicts within marriage such as male violence, male sterility and its social consequences for the wife, the painful process of divorce for African women, the unfairness of society towards widows, the difficult female relationships within polygamous marriages and the death penalty decreed for adulterous women in countries like Nigeria. The most interesting text in the section is, from an ethnographic point of view, ‘The Battle of the Words: Oratory as Women’s Tool of Resistance to the Challenges of Polygamy in Contemporary Wolof Society’ by M. Gueye, which reproduces four traditional songs sung in the polygamous societies of Senegal and Gambia during the Xaxar ceremony, a women-only ceremony organized when a new wife arrives at the husband’s household and is received by his other wives. This piece includes a detailed description of the ceremony and the jealous feelings the wives express in the songs, as experienced by the author herself when she attended one of them, as well as her own reflections on the Xaxar tradition as a form of resistance to male subordination.</p>
<p>The health issues section contains a variety of genres, among which poetry predominates, and it focuses mainly on the two most worrying female health concerns in Africa nowadays: female genital mutilation and AIDS. While the essay by Nawal El Saadawi offers a solid historical overview of female genital mutilation and the struggle against it, the play ‘Surviving Me’ by J. Lewis presents in allegorical form the consequences for female identity of the experience of genital mutilation. Particularly moving is ‘Slow Poison’ by Makuchi, the story of a mother looking after her AIDS-suffering son and the discouraging lack of solidarity she encounters in her own community, as well as the narrative of the psychological wounds left by the Congo War by P. Dongala in ‘Prayers and Meditation Heal Despair’.</p>
<p>The following section explores activism in different fields: against war, against state violence and torture, against the exploitation of child-soldiers or in defence of the environment. Through poetry, an essay, an interview and two extracts from novels, we get to know the different strategies used by African women to combat specific conflicts in their communities. Although the extract from K. Marouazi’s novel <italic>Biography of Ash</italic> was not, in my view, appropriately selected for this anthology – it focuses on the resistance of a male protagonist to state torture, not on female experience – some other texts in the section do offer relevant, insightful accounts, such as the interview with the environmental activist W. Maathai, founder of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya and the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, and the essay by S. Ekine on the difficult situation of native communities in the Niger Delta, where women have used silence, demonstrations and nakedness as ways to protest against exploitation, rape, murder and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>In ‘Writing From a Different Place’, we find four autobiographical pieces which perceptively explore the experience of living in the diaspora and the renegotiation of identity it implies. From Ghanaian K.D. Yomekpe, who has recently started to be proud of her native name and her African facial features, and Moroccan T. Khannous’s reflections on her ‘glocal’ background to Nigerian D.A. Mafe, who explores her in-between identity as a diasporic subject, and Cameroonian S. Akono’s empowering account of a painful growing up in Spain as a result of the stereotyping she was subjected to, all the authors offer complementary views on a fascinating topic on which I would have liked to read more in the volume. The concluding section is titled ‘Standing at the Edge of Time: African Women’s Vision of the Past, Present and Future’ and contains the transcription of a roundtable discussion held in 2007 by some of the editors and contributors at the Center for African Studies at Rutgers University. Probably intended as a launch event for the project (a formal book launch took place on 14 September 2010 at the Brunei Gallery, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), in London), it includes the sharing of autobiographical experiences and a reflection on African women’s past and future generations in a dialogue whose ‘extraordinary lyrical quality’ (Abena P.A. Busia highlights: 308) connects with the poetic, empowering words of the editorial sections.</p>
<p>The book is rounded off by a poem in the same vein authored by Abena Busia, followed by some biographical notes on contributors and an extensive list of suggestions for further reading on women’s writing in Africa. The list, which aims in many respects to be comprehensive, is classified into several categories: fiction and memoirs – with subheadings naming 23 different countries – anthologies and collections, critical writing and non-fiction and online resources. This section is an invaluable resource for research into the field of African women’s writing, despite some omissions of diasporic writers. Thus, although African British authors such as Buchi Emecheta and Aminatta Forna are included in the sections for their countries of descent, others like Helen Oyeyemi, Bernardine Evaristo or Diana Evans are surprisingly omitted, which points to the ambiguous position often occupied by diasporic authors within national literary traditions. To this we must add the issue of the language in which the entries are written, as only English publications were included. Although this might be related to the scarcity of bibliographies in other languages and the scarcity of written resources in African languages – of which Ngũgĩ Wa Thiong’o has often complained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506811434250">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506811434250">2010</xref>) – one cannot help thinking of the enriching possibilities a more linguistically varied selection could have offered.</p>
<p>However, these are small faults if we consider the ambitious project the book represents, which makes it particularly relevant for researchers and students in the fields of women’s studies, postcolonial studies or even sociology, and of great appeal to anyone interested in African cultures and contemporary African writing. <italic>African Women Writing Resistance</italic> manages to communicate an empowering message of solidarity and active resistance and transmit the voices of a new generation of African women, some of whom will surely continue their writing careers with new publications and will gain a place at the forefront of African literature in future years.</p>
