<p>Shivji draws on his experience as both observer and participant of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Tanzania to outline a critique of NGO practice in the political and moral economy of African development. Shivji acknowledges that he is working ‘on a canvas of broad strokes’, but the issues he identifies are important for political and social practices across sites, scales and forms.</p>
<p>The argument opens with a presentation of Africa’s colonial history and the coercive processes of extraction, domination and underdevelopment which continue into the present. He then outlines three failures of the liberation project in Africa: the national territorial state versus pan-Africanism; a developmental versus a democratic state; and nationalism versus imperialism. This is the context for his consideration of NGOs as non-state actors caught up in an imperial project. His observation that civil society in general is not an autonomous ‘third sector’ but a realm of social conflict still bears repeating.</p>
<p>The silences in NGO discourse that Shivji identifies are:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909611425010" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>An ‘activist’ mentality and an anti-theoretical, short-termist, donor-led agenda</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An anti-historical perspective</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A non-conflictual view of social change</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A non-political approach but willingness to become involved in policy making.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I agree that these are significant problems for any organization aiming at social change as I concur with Shivji’s concerns about the direction and limitations of NGO accountability and theoretical perspective. I also agree with his conclusions about ‘globalization’ as a form of imperialism, the importance of bottom–up, democratic and participatory practices, the dangers of statism and chauvinism, the impossibility of neutrality and the importance of an integrated auto-critique and praxis.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if Shivji made it plainer the extension or definition of his use of ‘NGO’: does this refer to international (development, human rights, consultancy?), national, local, campaigning, service-delivery organisations, etc. Ironically the one source that Shivja quotes to substantiate his assertion that ‘NGO leaders’ do not engage in critical analysis is from a book of research published by Oxfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611425010">Murphy, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The apparent lack of clarity over what an NGO is also suggests a lack of clarity over what an NGO <italic>can</italic> be. Given his Gramscian view of civil society, and his rhetoric about NGOs as the footsoldiers of neoliberalism, Shivji still seems to have a certain faith in the possibility and desirability of reforming NGOs.</p>
<p>While the identification of NGOs structural limitations is fair and worth making, I would look forward to a more detailed, case specific analysis of the relationship of NGO practice to development, neoliberalization and the state, as in the case studies in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611425010">Shivji’s 2002</xref> paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611425010">Chatterjee (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611425010">Englund (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611425010">Hopgood (2006)</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611425010">Bayat (1997)</xref>.</p>
