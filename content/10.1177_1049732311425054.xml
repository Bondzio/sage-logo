<abstract>
<p>Health care providers are challenged to use culturally appropriate, low-technology approaches to improve child health in resource-poor countries. Village fathers’ clubs is one approach used in rural Haiti since 1994. Fathers meet regularly for health education and community-building activities. Our aim was to investigate parenting practices and beliefs among Haitian fathers of young children and to explore their views on fathers’ clubs. We conducted semistructured interviews with 18 fathers. Themes identified were fathers’ involvement in routine care of their children, the close partnerships of fathers and mothers in child care, fathers’ responsibilities to their communities, and fathers’ clubs as an important supportive institution for the Haitian fathers and their families. Rural Haitian fathers reported taking a very active role in the lives of their families and children. Increased involvement of fathers should be explored as a strategy to improve child health and survival in other parts of Haiti and throughout the world.</p>

<p>Child health is unacceptably poor in many low-resource countries, including Haiti. Child mortality rates are alarming, with many deaths caused by preventable diseases, although significant strides have been made over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425054">Black, Morris, &amp; Bryce, 2003</xref>). Since 2000, the rate of child deaths has steadily dropped; however, it has not dropped equally in all countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425054">United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], 2009</xref>). Haiti is among the group of countries where more improvement is needed. Child mortality in 2008 was 72 per 1,000 live births, compared to 6 deaths per 1,000 births in developed regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425054">Countdown to 2015, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The serious health challenges in Haiti are related to many factors, including a long history of natural disasters, political and social instability, and crushing poverty. Haiti holds the distinction of being the first Black slave republic to declare independence, which occurred after a prolonged struggle with France. This triumph was followed by international ostracizing by the great powers of that time. The great colonial powers feared that the Haitian example would threaten their own slave-based prosperity. Haiti’s political history includes a series of repressive, violent dictators and corrupt elections, punctuated by U. S. occupations, blocking much economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425054">Arthur, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311425054">Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2011</xref>). Located in the center of the Caribbean, Haiti has endured hurricanes, earthquakes, and flooding. The January, 2010 earthquake that struck near the capital of Port au Prince caused thousands of deaths, massive displacement of the population, economic devastation, and severe destruction of all aspects of society, including the health system at every level (CIA).</p>
<p>Worldwide efforts to improve child health have had variable results. Continued urgent action is needed on the part of governments, nongovernment organizations, and individuals to continue improvement of child health and survival throughout the world. The 2000 United Nations Millennium Development Goal IV is to reduce by two thirds the mortality rate among children less than 5 years of age by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425054">Black et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311425054">World Health Organization [WHO], 2010b</xref>). Vertical programs such as Roll Back Malaria and the Expanded Program on Immunization have helped reduce death and disability from malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311425054">WHO, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311425054">WHO, 2010c</xref>). In addition to these vertical programs, some global initiatives are more comprehensive. One initiative is Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, which focuses more holistically on a child’s health and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311425054">WHO, 2010a</xref>). These varied programs are needed because no single program or organization can adequately address the extensive and pressing issue of improving child health and survival. Of particular note, 80% of the health care in countries such as Haiti occurs in the home, which shows the critical need for families and communities to have the needed knowledge, support, and basic supplies to act appropriately with respect to child health and illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425054">UNICEF, 2009</xref>). UNICEF experts estimate that up to 40% of child deaths could be prevented with improved family and community care including health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425054">UNICEF, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Locally designed, affordable programs with a broad integrated approach can be effective in improving child health and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425054">Bryce et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425054">Jones, Steketee, Black, Bhutta, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>). This is particularly important in Haiti— the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere—where children’s health is exceptionally poor. Although Haiti’s infant and child mortality rates are many times those of surrounding countries, the leading causes of child death—acute respiratory infection and diarrheal diseases—can be addressed using known, low-cost, effective treatments. The severe health situation is compounded by historically unstable government, natural disasters, and poverty. To address the dismal health situation in southwestern Haiti, a local organization provides an integrated approach for families. This organization is a multifaceted program that includes a standing clinic, maternal waiting home, malnutrition center, and primary health care outreach to more than 100 villages. In 1994, as part of its community-based participatory model of care, the organization instituted fathers’ clubs at the village level. This occurred in response to the discovery that in this setting, fathers do a much larger share of child care than in many other places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425054">Devin, 1995</xref>). The clubs, instituted to enhance child health and welfare, are unique in Haiti. The literature reports no similar fathers’ groups worldwide that are focused on child health.</p>
<p>In 1994, UNICEF declared that fathers ought to be more involved in programs that involve child health. UNICEF recognized that men in families could influence child growth, development, and survival in a variety of ways, including supporting mothers in decision making, through economic contributions to the family that affect care seeking, and through their direct care of the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425054">Engle, 1995</xref>). The fathers’ importance in their children’s lives and survival was the theme of the International Fatherhood Summit of 2003, which took a global perspective and included a call to action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425054">Barker et al., 2004</xref>). Almost 20 years later, despite UNICEF’s sweeping statement, the International Fatherhood Summit, and reportedly high levels of interest, only sparse evidence shows much progress in further understanding fathers’ opinions, knowledge, and contributions to child health. Similarly, there is little evidence of fathers’ inclusion in child health programs.</p>
<p>Pediatric clinicians in the United States have asserted the important role that fathers play in their children’s health, and bemoaned the lack of attention that fathers receive from most of the pediatric health care world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425054">Aronson, Whitehead, &amp; Baber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425054">Hudson, Campbell-Grossman, Fleck, Elek, &amp; Shipman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425054">Nelms, 2004</xref>). Some authors have suggested various ways that clinicians can help increase fathers’ involvement in child health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425054">Anderson, Nicklas, Spence, &amp; Kavanagh, 2010</xref>; Hudson et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425054">Moore &amp; Kotelchuck, 2004</xref>; Nelms). Pediatric providers now know that fathers have a significant influence on mothers and on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425054">Alexander, O’Riordan, &amp; Furman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425054">Earle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425054">Hauck &amp; Irurita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425054">Sullivan, Leathers, &amp; Kelley, 2004</xref>). Others have learned that the fathers’ involvement might reduce risky behaviors in youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311425054">Caldwell, Rafferty, Reischl, De Loney, &amp; Brooks, 2010</xref>). Researchers in Sweden have highlighted the role of fathers and their unique contributions and needs with respect to parenting young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425054">Hallberg, Beckman, &amp; Håkansson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311425054">Nystrom &amp; Ohrling, 2004</xref>). There have been rare reports of fathers’ support groups for special circumstances, such as parenting an infant in neonatal intensive care units, or fathering a child who has cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311425054">Neil-Urban &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311425054">Pearson &amp; Andersen, 2001</xref>). Investigators focusing on fathers of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder found that including fathers’ involvement in a behavioral parent training program resulted in improved child outcomes, which highlights the positive impact possible if fathers are included in child health care programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425054">Fabiano et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In resource-poor countries such as Guatemala, researchers found that a majority of mothers sought advice from their husbands when their child was ill, making husbands the most commonly sought source of social support when dealing with a sick child. Guatemalan husbands’ participation in pregnancy and birth is also quite high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425054">Carter, 2002</xref>). Among families in Uganda who had disabled children, fathers did not usually share in the care of the disabled children, and most often acted as gatekeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425054">Hartley, Ojwang, Baguwemu, Ddamulira, &amp; Chavuta, 2005</xref>). In reproductive health, where the role of men has been seen as crucial for longer than in other areas of health care, men continue to be neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311425054">Barua, Pande, MacQuarrie, &amp; Walia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311425054">Dudgeon &amp; Inhorn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425054">Iliyasu, Abubakar, Galadanci, &amp; Aliyu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425054">Sternberg &amp; Hubley, 2004</xref>). Iliyasu and colleagues, in northern Nigeria, confirmed the lack of paternal involvement in young families and the need for peer-led, culturally sensitive community education, which is critically important given the patriarchal societal structure. Fathers from different cultures and countries participate variably in family and child health care; the cultural underpinnings in each case are critical to keep in mind as providers examine ways to enhance fathers’ roles in promoting child health and welfare.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study were to explore the practices and beliefs about parenting among fathers of young children in rural Haitian villages, and to explore the role that fathers’ clubs (<italic>gwoup papa</italic>) play in the lives of the fathers, mothers, children, and communities.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This qualitative study was part of a larger mixed- methods research project: Impact of Fathers’ Clubs on Children’s Health and Survival in Rural Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425054">Sloand, Astone, &amp; Gebrian, 2010</xref>). The researchers in the larger study aimed to explore rural Haitian fathers’ parenting beliefs and practices, to explore the role of fathers’ clubs in the lives of participants and their families, and to investigate the impact of fathers’ clubs on child health and survival. In this article, we report on the qualitative phase of the research and address parenting roles and responsibilities of fathers of young children and the role that fathers’ clubs play in the lives of the fathers, mothers, children, and communities. This descriptive qualitative study illustrates one aspect of a cultural group in the context of their parenting.</p>

<title>Setting and Participants</title>
<p>Fathers’ clubs are an integral part of a public health organization in southwest rural Haiti. The clubs meet regularly in villages; their schedule depends on upcoming activities and the season, because most of the men are farmers and cannot meet during planting season or other busy times. The meetings are open to any of the men in the village and are attended by fathers, the village health agent, and often the public health nurse; attendance at the meetings varies from four to more than 40 men. The main activity of the fathers’ clubs is education regarding child and family health topics. Other activities include preparation for community health care days and repair work on streams and roads.</p>
<p>We recruited fathers for the study using a random purposeful strategy. Eligibility required the father to live in one of four rural villages in southwest Haiti, to have a child younger than 3 years of age, and be living with the child. Village health agents identified all eligible fathers in the four villages. From the list of these fathers, we randomly selected 22 fathers, being sure that there would be broad representation from each of the four villages. The 22 fathers were invited to participate; 18 agreed to participate and were interviewed. Their ages ranged from 27 to 54 years, with a mean of 38 years. The number of children the fathers had ranged from 1 to 7; the youngest child was 4 months old and the oldest was 18 years. Most of the fathers were farmers, although 3 men had other professions: tailor, photographer, and artist. The men reported a wide range of formal schooling, from 0 to 14 years; the mean number of years of formal schooling was five.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311425054">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>We conducted each of the semistructured interviews in the villages based on an interview guide; interviews lasted 30 to 60 minutes. Participants gave written informed consent prior to the interview; the consent form was in Haitian Creole. The first author conducted all of the interviews with the assistance of a Haitian-born translator, a professor of English whose first language was Haitian Creole. The interviewer asked questions in English, and then the questions were translated into Haitian Creole. Fathers’ answers in Creole were translated back to English during the interview. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The translations were verified by a second translator, who listened to the recorded interviews including the translation, confirmed the translation, and compared the interviews to the written transcription. The sample was cohesive, comprised of fathers from rural Haitian villages, which is one of the principles of saturation in qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425054">Morse, 1995</xref>). Data collection continued until saturation was reached.</p>
<p>The interview guide consisted of initial demographic information. The interviewer then asked participants about their activities as fathers and information about the gwoup papa. There was some flexibility in the interview order as long as all items were asked. The interviewer followed up the fathers’ statements with additional probes and questions, allowed them to give more information as they were inclined, and then returned to the questionnaire to be sure that all sections were covered. Participating fathers were not paid; they received a small gift of hygiene products in gratitude for their participation, valued at around $5 US. They also received lunch and a beverage, which they appreciated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311425054">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All audiotapes were transcribed verbatim. The analysis of data followed strategies described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311425054">Corbin and Strauss (2008)</xref>, which include the use of first read, codes, and memos, followed by abstraction and generation of themes. As Corbin and Strauss noted, the exact procedures used for analyzing data are less important than the task of identifying the essence or meaning of data. This analytic process was the best way to identify themes and meaning from the data. Similar to the work of Wagman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311425054">Wagman, Björklund, Håkansson, Jacobsson, &amp; Falkmer, 2011</xref>), in our analysis we aimed to achieve a description grounded in the data, and not to develop a theory.</p>
<p>After several readings, we systematically performed open coding, identifying concepts that appeared prominently in the data and noting themes, trends, and recurrent or prominent ideas. We clarified any language or translation issues that appeared in the transcripts. In subsequent readings we searched for some of the underlying meanings within parts of the text. Common themes across the interviews emerged from the data; we carefully considered these themes with respect to how they were related and interconnected. These relationships helped to suggest a common story imbedded in the data.</p>
<p>We confirmed themes through analysis of additional data sources, including interviews with two key informants who were not fathers or members of the clubs; notes from meetings with individual Haitian village health agents; and notes from a group session of village health agents when they were rating the fathers, mothers, and youth groups in each of the villages. We also mined field notes, memos, and journal entries to augment the initial analysis findings so that the truest picture could be drawn of fathering in rural Haiti. Thus, we triangulated these multiple data sources to provide the most accurate and complete presentation possible of fathers in this cultural context and the role of the gwoup papa.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1049732311425054" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Four overarching themes emerged through analysis of the data: fathers are very involved in the care of their children; fathers work closely with mothers in the care of the children; fathers take responsibility for others in the community; and participation in the gwoup papa is an important strategy for family and community survival. Although presented separately, these themes are interconnected. Taken together, they tell a story of fathers’ lives in rural Haiti and their challenges, convictions, and activities. All names have been changed to protect participant confidentiality.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732311425054">
<title>Theme 1: Fathers are Very Involved in the Routine Care of Their Children and Families</title>
<p>The responsibilities that fathers most frequently stated were the most important for them included feeding their children, sending them to school, and providing health care. This child care by the fathers was reported to happen whether the mother was in the home or away, and included routine child care and episodic or sick care. This finding might be surprising, because the literature typically portrays Haitian fathers as distant and uninvolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425054">Colin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311425054">Pierce &amp; Elisme, 1997</xref>). In rural Haiti, however, this group of fathers sounded adamant about their concerns for their children and family, and their crucial role in the welfare of the family. The fathers also tended to state their beliefs in a simple and straightforward manner, without complicated explanations. For instance, one father of three children explained, “My most important responsibilities to my children are to feed them, clean them, and dress them.” Another stated, “I work to feed them.” Another father of eight children talked about how he had to stay home to care for the children when his wife was away from home on business. She had to periodically travel to other towns or to Port au Prince to purchase items that she would resell for profit. When asked about how he could stay home with the children when he had so much work to farm his vegetable plot, he replied with a Haitian proverb: “Sometimes you have to lose one thing to gain another.” The remarkable part of his statement is the importance he seemed to place on being present to care for his children. The balance of family needs was such that for this father, though fully occupied with subsistence farming to provide for his family, caring for the children at home when the mother was away was sometimes his priority.</p>
<p>A vast majority of the fathers specifically talked about feeding their children, which in some cultures might be taken for granted, and perhaps parents would not bother to mention it. In Haiti, feeding one’s children is a major challenge given the food insecurity of the country in general and the poverty of most of the people. It is a major life-or-death responsibility of parents. It is interesting to note that working hard and feeding children were mentioned by the fathers together in many cases. It seemed as if these two activities were bound together in the fathers’ minds: They had to work to feed their children. The men were straightforward about this. They did not say that they were working to get ahead, and none said that they were working to buy a bigger house, move to a better town, or to buy nicer clothes or other items or conveniences. They simply said that they worked so they could feed their children.</p>
<p>One father of three talked about education, which was prominent for many of the fathers. He stated, “Education, feed them, and health. If they are sick, be ready to sell some products to find the money to pay the doctors and pay for the medicines.” For some fathers, the primary responsibility was education. This might seem puzzling, because there are so few job opportunities for Haitians, even for those with education. Tragically for the country, many of those who do get an education tend to leave the country for the United States, France, Canada, and other countries with more opportunities. Those with an education who choose to stay in Haiti will offer themselves as translators or drivers, even though they might have a law, nursing, or teaching degree. Even though there is a great need for lawyers, nurses, and teachers in Haiti, there are few opportunities for those positions in an organization that will reliably pay one’s salary. The work is there, but often not with consistent pay. Still, it seems that Haitians hold education as a great hope for the future, and view it as critical for their children. One father of three emphasized, “Education. Education is first; other things after it.”</p>
<p>Complicating the situation, some fathers mentioned financial barriers, as exemplified by the statement from one father: “I did not have enough financial means to send my children to school, even for uniforms.” Education is compulsory in Haiti, but there are not enough public schools. In addition, for all schools in Haiti, including public schools, families must pay for uniforms, notebooks and pencils, shoes, and a small school fee. Many private schools, mostly run by religious groups, help fill the gap, but there is often still a small fee. Although the total cost of public and many private schools is typically less than $100 US per child per year, that cost becomes a prohibitive fee for many families with multiple children. The majority of Haitians live on less than $2 US per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311425054">UNICEF, 2010</xref>). Families sometimes alternate children for school, sending some one year and others the next year. As a result, a typical classroom might have students with a wide range of ages; for example, a sixth-grade classroom with 11- to 17-year-olds. A farmer and father of eight children said, “My most important responsibility is sending [the children] to school. Three go to school. I have a lot of children. I cannot send them all to school.” This same father later reported a difficult decision he had to make for his family:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My wife was very, very ill. I sold my house and then took my wife here to the hospital. After a while I took her to the hospital in Jeremie. By God’s grace, my wife is okay now. She had swelling . . . she was not pregnant . . . she had swelling all over. After taking medicine, she is normal now. I sold my house in order to take care of my wife. . . . So I have to be very strong.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The most recent statistics from UNICEF reflect this reality, reporting that approximately 50% of primary-school-age children attend school; the number drops to 20% when considering children of secondary school age who attend school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311425054">UNICEF, 2010</xref>). Despite of the hardships for families and the scarcity of schools, however, Haitians value education. In summary, a father of four children asserted his responsibilities, which encompass the first theme: “The father must work to earn enough so that the mother can feed [the children], take care of them, send them to the hospital when they are sick, and send them to school.”</p>
<p>Notably, one father talked about all the routine care he gave the children, but he mentioned an exception: “When the mother is not at home, I clean them and cook food for them. . . . But I don’t do the hair of the girls; that’s the only thing I don’t do.” This seems to be such an authentic and understandable comment—that a father has trouble fixing his daughter’s hair. It made us wonder whether fathers in other cultures have similar difficulties with daughters’ hair.</p>

<title>Theme 2: Fathers and Mothers Work Together and Support One Another in the Care of Their Children</title>
<p>Participants often described the importance of working together with their children’s mother in the care of children. This was a key finding because, as stated previously, fathers are often assumed to be distant from their families and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425054">Colin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311425054">Pierce &amp; Elisme, 1997</xref>). Beyond their responsibilities with their children in the areas of food, education, and health, these men emphasized that they must work together, <italic>men nan men</italic> (hand in hand), with mothers. Many of these participants strongly stated their important family role, and did so in animated and emphatic voices, as did one young father, when he said, “Helping the mothers in all the things they are doing, for example when the children are sick.” A father of seven children described the various aspects of this responsibility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t leave the mother alone with the children. I help . . . I work and I give money to the mother to help send them to school . . . buy shoes and whatever I can for them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another young father reported his enthusiasm about working with the mother of his children: “I feel very proud and happy that I can help the mother to better raise the child.” He stated an eagerness to be a part of the care of the children, beyond the basic responsibility of it. This man did not sound like he was at all resistant to helping with the children, but instead verbalized that he was happy about participating in the care of his children.</p>
<p>Fathers reported assisting with health care issues. One father stated, “When mothers aren’t at home, the fathers can take the children to the post for vaccination. . . . They don’t wait for the mothers to do that.” A post is a periodic gathering of health personnel from the village and surrounding region to offer a day of health services to the people in that village. Services at a post might include child growth monitoring, vaccines, pre- and postnatal care, health education, and health consultations, including medications for adults and children who are sick.</p>
<p>This concept of fathers’ involvement with children’s health care challenges the historically familiar notions of focusing solely on mothers regarding child care, providing mothers with needed child health education, and funding maternal–child programs with no regard for fathers. Fathers’ assertions of working together with the mothers for the good of their children and of supporting one another in parenting were very poignant. Fathers articulated this support of one another beautifully: “They [the parents] can protect one another better together. The husband can protect the wife and the wife can protect the husband.” The concept of “protection” suggests that fortification is needed for parents raising children in Haiti’s rough environment. This comment also indicates that protection is not a one-sided phenomenon of the father protecting the mother, but one of mutual support and protection for the ultimate benefit of both parents and the family. It suggests equality and support between the sexes in the care of the family. Another father said, “We work together. . . . We help with encouragement. . . . One can encourage the other.” Similarly, a third father said, “The parents will be able to work hand in hand.” For these fathers in Haiti, working “hand in hand” was an essential strategy of parenting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311425054">
<title>Theme Three: Fathers Take Responsibility for Others in the Community</title>
<p>Fathers expressed a sort of collective responsibility for others in the village. They often described their willingness to care for others in their community:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You can see the fathers going from house to house when it is time for the [health] post, so that they can talk with the [other] fathers and encourage them. “Why don’t you take your children to the post?” They are very encouraging to the other fathers about taking their children to the post.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With further questioning, fathers told of their repeated visits to certain families who might otherwise decide not to go to the post with their children who needed vaccinations. They said they “just [had] to do it,” to knock on doors and convince their neighbors to take their newborns to be weighed and vaccinated. The villagers knew one another; there were no strangers among them. They knew one another’s circumstances, and so were well aware when a particular family needed extra help. They felt so strongly about the importance of health visits that they spent their time and energy helping others obtain the best health care for their families.</p>
<p>Fathers discussed their participation in other community activities, such as building a community center and fixing roads. They also reported having a sort of “community chest,” with collective funds used to help others when a need arose, such as a sickness or death in the family. This shared responsibility for the community and one another’s families shows a sort of cohesion within the community, and belief about the importance of working together. One father stated, “Fathers get together in order to move forward together.” Similarly, another one asserted, “We come together in the gwoup papa so we can do great things.”</p>
<p>The fathers seemed to gather great strength from their group efforts; their coming together was a powerful force. This power could help explain the sustainability of these particular fathers’ groups, which had been meeting continuously for 17 years. One participant gave a striking summary regarding fathers and their collective responsibility for all the children in the village: “The children in the village belong to all of us. We are responsible for them.” Fathers’ reports of caring for one another’s families and children suggest an ethnographic norm in these Haitian villages; that is, fathers in these rural villages typically cared for one another’s families. This theme of fathers bonding together in caring for their children, in conjunction with Theme Two—fathers working hand in hand with mothers—combines to become a powerful way to approach the job of raising children in this challenging environment. This combination of themes also shows the high value these fathers placed on caring for all the children in the villages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311425054">
<title>Theme Four: The Gwoup Papa is an Important Strategy for Family and Community Survival</title>
<p>Fathers spoke very convincingly about the importance of the fathers’ clubs. The most prominent activity of the clubs that participants discussed was health education. Some of the fathers gave examples of what they had learned about breastfeeding, vaccinations, and reproductive physiology. One father explained to the interviewer about the changes in cervical mucus that occurs during a woman’s cycle, which he learned about at a group meeting and believed was important for him and other fathers to know. Another father stated that the health education they received was a matter of life and death. He said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The fathers know how to take care of the health of the kids, and know some signs of certain diseases such as pneumonia. . . . Because of the gwoup papa, we have more education. The fathers are helping the mothers to take care of the children better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pneumonia is a leading cause of child mortality in Haiti, so this information is critical for the fathers. Another father spoke directly about how the clubs had made a difference in children’s survival: “The information learned from the gwoup papa will help save the kids from danger. . . . You can save lives, and that can help the village. . . . In the past, our babies died.” The men talked about the entity of the gwoup papa and how important it was for the groups to continue. One participant said, “We sometimes talk about how the gwoup papa is to grow, to always get stronger, like the trees.” At that point, he gestured by moving his clasped hands up toward the sky and looked upward.</p>
<p>In summary, the data show that these rural Haitian fathers report a high level of dedication to the health and well-being of their children and families, and participate in the day-to-day care of them. They routinely help the mothers, and support them with physical assistance as well as money. The gwoup papa has committed members who extend encouragement and assistance to others in the village, and they perform a variety of community-strengthening projects.</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732311425054" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we have presented the insights of rural Haitian fathers regarding their roles in the family and community, fathers’ groups, and their relationship to child and family health. The four major themes identified are interconnected and provide an understanding of an aspect of the culture of fathers in Haiti. Taken together, the data suggest that these fathers were highly dedicated to the health and well-being of their children and families. Additionally, the fathers were very adamant about their community responsibilities and the assistance that the gwoup papa had been for them in their fathering and work in the community. The men discussed the gwoup papa as if it was an entity unto itself, and the importance of its sustainability. These findings about the fathers’ group experiences and the fathers’ positive views and enthusiasm have parallels in other populations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311425054">Novick and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that women in northeastern U.S. urban clinics were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about their group prenatal education. Although the populations were vastly different in gender and location, the desired outcome of the groups was better informed parents and healthier children. In both cases, group health education led to bonding among participants and helped them deal with the challenges of parenthood under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Strikingly, when asked about their prime responsibilities, fathers often spoke of needing to provide the absolute basic necessity of food, but also education. Perhaps this is because of the situation most of the men found themselves in, which was the harsh rural Haitian countryside, an environment with few modern conveniences or physical comforts, and day-to-day subsistence farming. In this setting, families literally struggled for survival on a daily basis, and that struggle consisted of obtaining enough food for their children and attempting to send them to school. They knew that food was required for survival every day. Malnutrition was a familiar and personal reality, and with Haiti’s high infant and child mortality rates, all the men had some experience with the death of a child close to them. They might have considered education to be the key to moving beyond survival in the future.</p>
<p>Fathers might have focused on school and education issues because it was their hope for a better future for their children. This is consistent with the literature on Haitian cultural norms, which confirm that Haitian parents place high value on the education of their children, hoping that it will lead them to a better life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425054">Civan, Vilsaint, &amp; Morisset-Métellus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425054">Cosgray, 2007</xref>). Many of the fathers in the study had limited formal schooling and were working as farmers; their back-breaking work would be strong motivation for getting their children a better education. It is unclear whether similar results would be found in comparably harsh environmental conditions in other parts of the world where there is extreme poverty, lack of resources, little government or other supports, and no expectation of entitlement programs or relief assistance.</p>
<p>The fathers overwhelmingly spoke of their important responsibilities to actively care for their children and to work together with the mothers in this effort. These two themes link together, and suggest that mothers and fathers in rural Haiti form a strong partnership in the effort of caring for their children. The literature presents competing views on the issues of men and women working together. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425054">Civan and colleagues’ research (1994)</xref> suggests a slightly different dynamic with Haitian men and women, wherein men and women assume complementary roles with respect to sharing household and financial responsibilities. According to Civan et al., the women are responsible for child care, daily household tasks, and some of the farming; men are responsible for heavy chores, such as chopping firewood. Other authors have confirmed that gender roles are distinct within Haitian families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425054">Coreil, Augustin, Halsey, &amp; Holt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311425054">Miller, 2000</xref>): Women are in charge of income-generating marketing, domestic household tasks, and child care; men are responsible for home maintenance, farming, and providing for the family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425054">Devin’s (1995)</xref> findings, however, are closer to those of the present study, because she found more overlap in gender roles in her research, which took place in the same region of Haiti as our study. She worked with 121 families from three rural villages in the Jérémie area, and found that although women did not typically report that they were farmers, most of them were engaged in agricultural work for many days per week. She also found that almost half of the women relied on male caregivers (usually the children’s fathers) to watch the children while the mothers did the marketing, laundry, and other tasks.</p>
<p>This interplay of men’s and women’s roles and work found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425054">Devin (1995)</xref> is closer to the results in our study. It is possible that this finding is unique to southwest rural Haiti, because both Devin’s and our study were done in the same region. Alternatively, this might be a phenomenon that could be found throughout Haiti and other parts of the world. In any case, the situation for these families is clear: With the grim statistics of child and maternal mortality against the backdrop of Haiti’s poor economic status, parents might have believed that this strong partnership was necessary for the survival of family members. Many had witnessed the deaths of children in their midst. Sadly, these deaths were often from treatable conditions compounded by malnutrition. The men reported learning key information that could potentially prevent child deaths through health care measures that they can implement themselves, such as getting their children vaccinated, providing oral hydration when a baby has diarrhea, and seeking help from a health agent when a child is sick. The important role of the gwoup papa in educating the fathers on child health cannot be underestimated. The support of one another within the family and within the community is a key factor in caring for children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425054">Coreil and associates (1994)</xref> highlighted how important this support can be in rural Haiti. They studied families in rural central Haiti, and identified important barriers to children receiving preventative health care: the lack of child caretakers and the competing priorities that women managed in their everyday lives. Clearly, parents working together is a potential antidote for the daunting task of raising healthy children in rural Haiti.</p>
<p>Life in Haiti is physically difficult, and it seems to be accompanied by strong camaraderie. The community responsibility that the men related is a strong statement of solidarity with one another and of the sharing of the burden of survival for each family in the village. Similar to the belief that mothers and fathers must bond together in partnership for the survival of their children and one another, the fathers of the village reported taking a community approach to survival, bonding together in the care of other community members. Children were seen as precious and “worth more than money” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425054">Schwartz, 2003</xref>, p. 91). Caring for one another and all families in the community is a cultural phenomenon, a key component of group values and beliefs reflected in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425054">Arthur, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311425054">DeSantis &amp; Thomas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311425054">State University of New York New Paltz Institute for Disaster Mental Health, 2010</xref>). The community efforts of the fathers that were observed in this study were both interpersonal and structural: interpersonal because fathers cared for individuals with whom they lived and worked, both within and outside of their families; structural because they worked together with other fathers to improve village infrastructure. The reason for this shared commitment might have been rooted in their determination to have better health and life outcomes for their children and all those in the village.</p>
<p>The findings of our study took on even more compelling significance in the past 2 years, with the devastating earthquake of January, 2010, which caused mass loss of life and disruption of health systems. More recently, a cholera epidemic occurred in Haiti, in November, 2010, and continues into 2011, infecting children and adults throughout the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311425054">Pan American Health Organization, 2011</xref>). With more than 80% of the deaths from cholera in adults, there are growing numbers of cholera orphans. The cohesion of village groups is even more important and life saving for these children. The fathers’ clubs continue to function in the study area of rural Haiti, carrying on their mission of education and support for one another and their families, which is critically important as Haiti rebuilds from the earthquake and copes with the cholera epidemic.</p>
<sec id="section12-1049732311425054">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One potential limitation of our study is that the translation and working between two languages might have compromised the data and caused a barrier to communication. Additionally, participants’ responses were filtered through knowledge that we, the investigators, were associated with the same local organization that sponsors the fathers’ clubs. Most notably, we learned what fathers believe and say, but do not know what fathers actually do. To further explore these issues, participant observation would add to our knowledge of what actually happens in homes and communities, which would help guide effective interventions.</p>

<sec id="section13-1049732311425054" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this study illustrate the importance of fathers’ clubs in rural Haiti, where life is difficult and health challenges abound. The results of the study suggest that family health providers should explore the potential benefits of integrating fathers as active partners in child health projects and programs. Exploring the perspectives of fathers in other settings and cultures would first have to precede such integration, but this effort might prove to be worthwhile, and might potentially benefit children in other regions. Other settings in Haiti, as well as settings in both developing and industrialized countries, might prove to be fertile ground for including fathers in programming for child health. Such inclusion would likely take varying forms in different settings and cultures. Beyond careful incorporation of fathers into child health programs, health care providers could also explore fathers’ groups as a strategy to educate fathers and to ultimately enhance overall child health.</p>
