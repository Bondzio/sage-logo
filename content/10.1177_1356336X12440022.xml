<p>The main aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity (PA) levels of high school Portuguese students during physical education (PE) and investigate the association of PA levels with students’ goal orientation and intrinsic motivation. Forty-six students from three high schools participated. Heart rate telemetry and pedometry were used to assess PA and the Borg rate of perceived exertion scale was used to measure perceived exertion. Thirty PE lessons were monitored. The results indicated that high school PE lessons involve low levels of PA. Students engaged in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) only in about one-third (29.7 minutes) of the official PE scheduled time (90 minutes) and perceived exertion as light. In general, students seemed to be positively motivated toward PE and mainly task goal orientated. Boys felt more enjoyment/interest and perceived their competence in more positive ways than girls. The number of steps and the rate of perceived exertion were associated with levels of PA measured by heart rate telemetry. Intrinsic motivation and goal orientation were not related with MVPA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a marked trend toward an increase in sedentary lifestyles among school-age children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356336X12440022">Trudeau and Shephard, 2005</xref>). In fact, the decline in physical activity (PA) with age is one of the most consistent findings in PA epidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440022">Sallis, 2000</xref>), and the PA levels among young people are frequently inferior to what is recommended to promote health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440022">Cavill et al., 2001</xref>). It seems that the reduction in PA is one of the factors responsible for the secular trend toward low levels of aerobic fitness and an increase in overweight youth in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356336X12440022">Tomkinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1356336X12440022">Tremblay and Willms, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>It is recognized that the promotion of health and physical fitness is one of the most important roles of physical education (PE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356336X12440022">Sallis and McKenzie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356336X12440022">Trudeau and Shephard, 2005</xref>), and some health and educational organizations have suggested that the PE curriculum must put greater emphasis on increasing the PA levels among young people (e.g. US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356336X12440022">2000</xref>). Thus, it is expected that PE plays an important role in the accomplishment of the guidelines for the practice of PA among young people that have been proposed. According to the programme Healthy People 2010 (US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356336X12440022">2000</xref>) these are 30 minutes of moderate PA per day, or 20 minutes of vigorous PA three times per week, while others suggest at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440022">Cavill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440022">Pate et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>It is expected that PE contributes significantly to achieving the recommended level of daily PA of young people since it provides a context for regular and structured PA participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356336X12440022">Sallis and McKenzie, 1991</xref>). PE seeks to enhance PA engagement in different ways, such as involving the students in PA during PE lessons, influencing their free-time options (in and out of school) and promoting a physically active lifestyle for their future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, it is recommended that both the quantity and quality of PE should be increased, emphasizing the time and intensity of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440022">Laurson et al., 2008</xref>). Some studies reported that PE lessons involve lower levels of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440022">McKenzie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356336X12440022">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and doubts exist regarding the effective contribution of PE to the improvement of students' physical fitness and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440022">Michaud and Andres, 1990</xref>). Conversely, other studies point out that well-structured PE programmes are able to improve students' moderate to vigorous PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356336X12440022">McKenzie et al., 2004</xref>) and physical fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356336X12440022">Shephard and Lavallée, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Some factors could influence the quantity and intensity levels of PA in PE. Goal orientation and intrinsic motivation are considered to be important determinants of achievement behaviours such as persistence in sport and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356336X12440022">Duda, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1356336X12440022">Vallerand and Rousseau, 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, little research has examined the relationship between intrinsic motivation, goal orientation and the PA levels of students during PE lessons.</p>
<p>Social cognitive theories of achievement motivation postulate that two major goal perspectives dominate in achievement contexts. Ability can be conceived with reference to either the individual's own past performance or knowledge, where mastery indicates competence, or as capacity relative to that of others, where mastery alone does not indicate high ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440022">Nicholls, 1984</xref>). The terms ‘task’ and ‘ego’ involvement, have been used to describe these two achievement goal perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440022">Nicholls, 1989</xref>). Task orientation is linked with cognitive and affective motivational patterns, such as intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>), and is usually accepted as an important predictor for involvement in youth sports and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440022">Roberts, 2001</xref>). Conversely, the role of ego orientation in determining sport and exercise involvement has been less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Students' motivation plays an important role in PE participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>), promoting the development of regular patterns of PA, which have the potential to carry over into adulthood and thereby improve public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440022">Koka and Hein, 2003</xref>). Intrinsic motivation is defined as the doing of an activity for its inherent satisfaction rather than for some separable consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440022">Ryan and Deci, 2000</xref>). It has been suggested that task orientation and perceived competence are determinants of intrinsic motivation and the latter has a positive impact on PA involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440022">Chatzisarantis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>). Enjoyment is considered an important facet of intrinsically-motivated behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356336X12440022">Deci and Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440022">Nicholls, 1989</xref>); enjoyment in PE is linked with adolescents’ exercise participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356336X12440022">Sallis et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite PE being an important subject in Portuguese schools (it is included in students’ curricula from the fifth until the twelfth grade) there is little research on the Portuguese students' engagement in PA during PE. Thus, to our knowledge, just one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356336X12440022">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) has investigated the PA levels in Portuguese PE classes (seventh grade), and data were collected in only one school and in only 14 indoor classes. The present study extends this research, assessing the PA levels in an older sample and in a higher number of classes (indoor and outdoor) from three schools. It is of particular relevance to investigate the actual contribution of PE to the international guidelines for the practice of PA among young Portuguese people.</p>
<p>Also, in the specialized literature, there is some evidence that specific goal orientation and/or intrinsic motivation in PE could help to encourage sport and exercise participation in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440022">Cox et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>), but few studies have analysed the relationship between the PA levels of PE lessons and students’ goal orientation and intrinsic motivation. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the PA levels of Portuguese high school students in PE lessons and investigate the association of PA levels with students’ goal orientation and intrinsic motivation.</p>

<title>Participants and procedures</title>
<p>Fifty students from three high schools in the region of Évora (Portugal) were initially assigned to this study. Two classes from each of two schools and one from another school were randomly selected. In each class, five boys and five girls were also randomly selected. During the research, four students were excluded because they did not perform the maximal treadmill test, making it impossible to calculate the heart rate reserve. Therefore, 46 subjects constituted the final sample size of the study. The general sample characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356336X12440022">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For each class, PA assessments took place throughout six consecutive weeks in one of the two 90-minute PE lessons taught per week, creating a total of 30 monitored lessons. All teachers were specialists in PE and had at least 10 years of teaching experience. They were instructed to maintain their normal methods of teaching. The PE classes had between 20 and 25 students. A researcher was present during the monitored lessons to ensure that all procedures were correctly followed and to register the type of physical activities performed.</p>
<p>Prior to participation, the study was explained and written informed consent was obtained. The institutional Human Research Ethics Committee approved this study. All procedures were according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

<title>Assessment of PA</title>
<p>Prior to the study, the data collection procedures were explained to the participants. Three types of instruments were used to assess students’ PA levels: HR telemeters (Polar team, Kempele, Finland), pedometers (New Lifestyles Digi-Walker, SW-200) and Borg’s rate of perceived exertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356336X12440022">Borg, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1356336X12440022">
<title>Heart rate telemetry</title>
<p>Heart rate (HR) telemetry has been shown to be a valid and reliable measurement for young people’s PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356336X12440022">Freedson and Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440022">Rowlands et al., 1997</xref>) and has been used extensively in PE settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440022">Laurson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356336X12440022">Stratton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356336X12440022">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). HR telemetry is also frequently used to validate other methods of measuring PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440022">Eston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440022">Rowlands et al., 1997</xref>). For the current study, students were fitted with the HR telemeters after they changed clothes and immediately before they entered the place where the PE lesson took place. Heart rate was recorded every five seconds. At the end of the lessons the HR telemeters were removed and data were registered for posterior analyses.</p>
<p>Heart rate reserve (HRR, difference between resting and maximum HR) accounts for age and gender HR differences, and is recommended when using HR to assess PA in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356336X12440022">Stratton, 1996</xref>). It was calculated for each student. The percentage of HRR is closely related to the %VO<sub>2</sub> reserve (i.e. a percentage of the difference between resting and maximal VO<sub>2</sub>  at which an individual is exercising) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356336X12440022">Swain and Leutholtz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356336X12440022">Swain et al., 1998</xref>). Resting HRs were obtained on non-PE days while the students lay in a supine position for a period of 10 minutes. The lowest mean value obtained over one minute represented resting HR. Considering that the current prediction formula for maximal HR (220 minus age) contains large standard errors of estimate, which may result in inaccuracy when applied to general populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356336X12440022">Robergs and Landwehr, 2002</xref>), we choose to directly measure maximum HR in a maximum incremental treadmill test (Balke test). Moreover, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, a progressive maximal test is the best to measure maximal HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1356336X12440022">Whaley et al., 2006</xref>). During the entire test the HR was constantly measured by telemetry and the highest HR attained at exhaustion was considered the maximum HR.</p>
<p>The 50% HRR threshold represents moderate PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356336X12440022">Stratton, 1996</xref>), which is the minimal intensity required to contribute to the recommended volume of health-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356336X12440022">Biddle et al., 1998</xref>). Total lesson time spent in health-enhancing moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was calculated for each student by summing the time spent &gt;50% HRR threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>). HRR values &gt;75% correspond to vigorous PA (VPA) and represent the intensity that may stimulate improvements in cardio-respiratory fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356336X12440022">Morrow and Freedson, 1994</xref>). Total lesson time spent in VPA was also calculated for each student.</p>

<title>Pedometry</title>
<p>A commercially available electronic pedometer (New Lifestyles Digi-Walker, SW-200) was used. This unit measures vertical oscillations, providing a total count of the accumulated movements. Commercially available electronic pedometers provide a reasonably accurate estimate of distance walked and number of steps taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356336X12440022">Bassett et al., 1996</xref>) and offer the potential of monitoring during large population studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440022">Eston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356336X12440022">Sequeira et al., 1995</xref>). Pedometers were firmly attached to clothing at the waist (on the right side of the body<bold>) </bold>after students changed their clothes and immediately before they entered the place where the PE lesson took place. At the end of the lessons the pedometers were removed and data (number of steps) were registered for posterior analyses.</p>

<sec id="section7-1356336X12440022">
<title>Rate of perceived exertion (RPE)</title>
<p>The most widely used instrument to measure perceived exertion, or exercise intensity, is the Borg RPE scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356336X12440022">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). This scale has been validated on several tasks (e.g. bicycle ergometry and walking) against physiological measures like HR, %VO<sub>2</sub> max, as well as blood and muscle lactate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440022">Dunbar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440022">Noble and Robertson, 1996</xref>). In the present study, at the end of each PE lesson, the students rated the exertion level that they perceived on a category scale from 6 to 20.</p>

<title>Goal orientation</title>
<p>The task and ego orientation in sport questionnaire (TEOSQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356336X12440022">Duda and Nicholls, 1992</xref>), previously translated and adapted to Portuguese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356336X12440022">Fonseca and Biddle, 1995</xref>), was applied. The TEOSQ is a 13-item scale consisting of seven task (e.g. ‘I learn a new skill by trying hard’) and six ego items (e.g. ‘I can do better than my friends’). In this instance, each participant responded to the stem ‘I feel most successful in PE when…’ Students responded to a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). The TEOSQ has demonstrated acceptable reliability in previous PE research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356336X12440022">Goudas et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI)</title>
<p>We used the four subscale version of the IMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356336X12440022">McAuley et al., 1989</xref>) that comprises 18 items. This version of the IMI represents the sport application of the original IMI developed by Ryan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356336X12440022">Ryan, 1982</xref>). It is constituted by five subscales: enjoyment/interest (four items, e.g. ‘What we do in PE is very interesting’), effort/importance (five items, e.g. ‘I put a lot of effort into PE class’), perceived competence (five items, e.g. ‘I think I am pretty good at PE’), and pressure/tension (four items, e.g. ‘Sometimes I worry about making mistakes in PE’). In the present study the students rated their answers on a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). Previous research suggests that the Portuguese version of the IMI can be used with confidence by measuring the individuals’ intrinsic motivation for sport and exercise activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356336X12440022">Fonseca and Brito, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Data normality was confirmed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test. Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare measures between genders. Pearson’s correlation test was used to study the associations between measures of PA and also between the dimensions of goal orientation and intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>In order to allow for statically meaningful comparisons between different types of activities, the content of each PE lesson was classified as team games (e.g. football, volleyball), individual activities (e.g. gymnastic, dance, physical fitness) or mixed activities (both team and individual activities in the same lesson). One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences in MVPA, VPA and RPE, and number of steps between the three PE lesson types.

<p>A linear multiple regression analysis was used to test the association between PA levels (MVPA) and the dimensions of goal orientation and intrinsic motivation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Two hundred and forty-six individual assessments of PA were conducted during 30 PE lessons (in some cases – the remaining 30 potential assessments – students did not participate in the lesson). The PE lessons’ content included: team games (eight lessons, 67 individual observations), individual activities (nine lessons, 72 individual observations) and mixed activities (13 lessons, 107 individual observations).</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics for each measure (by gender and for the total sample) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356336X12440022">Table 2</xref>. During 33.0% (29.7 minutes) and 10.2% (9.2 minutes) of the official PE lesson time (90 minutes), the students were engaged in MVPA and VPA, respectively. Students’ average HR was 135.2 (18.3) bpm. The RPE showed that students experienced a light degree of physical strain in PE lessons. However, girls considered lessons more exhausting (<italic>p</italic>=.045) and effectuated fewer steps per session (<italic>p</italic>=.001) than boys.</p>

<p>Significant statistical differences between the types of lesson content were found in MVPA, VPA, number of steps and RPE (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). Lessons dedicated to team games required the most time in MVPA, and post-hoc analysis showed a significant difference compared with lessons dedicated to individual activities (35.3 ± 15.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 25.2 ± 15.5 min, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). Mixed activity lessons attained the largest times in VPA, and a significant difference was established compared with lessons dedicated to individual activities (11.4 ± 8.9 <italic>vs</italic>. 7.1 ± 6.6 min, <italic>p</italic>=.004). Students perceived higher exertion levels in individual activity lessons, and the difference was significant compared with the mixed activity lessons (12.1 ± 2.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 10.9 ± 2.2 points, <italic>p</italic>=.001). Team game lessons required the largest number of steps, and the difference was significant compared with the individual activity lessons (3668 ± 1133 <italic>vs</italic>. 2759 ± 1183 steps, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). The mixed activity lessons also involved a higher number of steps than lessons that included only individual activities (3431 ± 1010 <italic>vs</italic>. 2759 ± 1183 steps, <italic>p</italic>=.001).</p>
<p>Regarding the IMI, the enjoyment/interest subscale was classified with the highest scores. On the opposite side was the pressure/tension subscale, which showed low scores. Perceived competence and effort/importance subscales scored approximately in the middle of the five-point Likert scale. Boys felt more enjoyment/interest in PE lessons (<italic>p</italic>=.033) and perceived their competence in a more positive way (<italic>p</italic>=.035) than girls. On the TEOSQ, the task orientation was clearly preferred in comparison with the ego orientation.</p>
<p>The academic classification obtained in PE at the last formal evaluation (in Portugal during the school year there is a quantitative classification in PE at the end of each of three time periods) was higher for boys than for girls (<italic>p</italic>=.001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aim of this study was to measure the current levels of PA in high school PE lessons, to characterize the students’ motivation and goal orientation in PE, and to examine the relationships between those variables. We found low student PA levels in PE, with the students engaged in MVPA in only about one-third of the official 90 minute PE lesson. Considering the international recommendations of 60 minutes per day of moderate PA activity for young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440022">Pate et al., 1998</xref>), we can conclude that the contribution of PE to daily PA is quite small. Thus, PE provides only approximately 50% of the daily-recommended PA, two days per week.</p>
<p>This reality is congruent with previous studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356336X12440022">Strand and Reeder, 1993</xref>). A related investigation, also conducted in Portugal (with students 12.4 ± 0.8 years old), reported that, on average, only 27.9 minutes of the 90 minute PE classes had been spent in MVPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356336X12440022">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). The authors also concluded that 15.7 minutes of the 90 minute PE classes had been spent in VPA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton (2005</xref>) reported that students (aged 11–14 years) were actually engaged in MVPA and VPA for 34.3% and 8.3% of the lesson time, respectively. These total to 17.5 minutes of MVPA and 3.9 minutes of VPA.</p>
<p>Efforts should be taken to determine why PE is making only a modest contribution to the PA levels of young people. This is of great importance, given the close link between the practice of PA, physical fitness and health. However, it should be also taken into account that other important roles ranging from enhancing motor skills to promoting prosocial behaviour are also played by PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356336X12440022">Pate et al., 2011</xref>) and that PE can also influence the PA levels of students by influencing their free-time options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the PE content, team games implicated more MVPA and number of steps. This outcome is similar to former studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440022">Fairclough, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>). Also, it is interesting to note that mixed PE lessons were best suited to promote high PA intensity (they promote greater time in VPA). Nevertheless, the results for VPA were low in all three types of PE lesson. In the current study, students perceived exertion in PE as light. They perceived greater exertion in lessons dedicated to individual activities. Interestingly, both MVPA and number of steps showed the opposite tendency in this type of lesson. One explanation for this apparent contradiction is that several individual activity lessons were dedicated to physical fitness, implying high physical exertion but short dislocations of the students, and considerable recovery time between activities. Among these activities were muscular resistance circuit training and Fitnessgram<sup>® </sup>physical fitness assessments (presently the Fitnessgram<sup>® </sup>integrates the Portuguese high school PE curriculum). In the future, the use of an observation system could help to clarify these results.</p>
<p>The number of steps was the only PA measure that showed significant gender differences with boys achieving higher numbers. In fact, diverging from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356336X12440022">Stratton, 1997</xref>), no significant differences were found between genders in MVPA or VPA. Nevertheless, a trend occurred toward more MVPA among girls than among boys. The HR measure suggests that data differences between genders in the number of steps could be due to a hypothetical better aerobic fitness of the boys. Future studies should address this issue. The students completed 3203 (± 1186) steps per session. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356336X12440022">Choi et al. (2007</xref>), a daily 10,000 step goal is generally suggested for maintaining a desirable and healthy level of PA. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356336X12440022">Scruggs, 2007</xref>) with a sample of middle school students concluded that a steps/minute interval in PE of 82–88 was an accurate indicator of the 50% PA recommendation of the healthy programme 2010 (US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356336X12440022">2000</xref>). The conversion of our results to steps/min (53 and 36 steps/min for the effective and the official lesson time, respectively) confirms once more that the PA levels in PE were low.</p>
<p>The subscale enjoyment/interest of the IMI scored the highest values, and the subscales perceived competence and effort/importance attained scores above the middle of the 0 to 5 scale used. The three subscales were positively correlated and indicate that students seem to be positively motivated toward PE. Perception of competence and enjoyment/interest were previously linked with positive attitudes in PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440022">Carroll and Loumidis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356336X12440022">Luke and Sinclair, 1991</xref>). Enjoyment has been particularly cited as exerting important influences on young people's exercise participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356336X12440022">McCarthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1356336X12440022">Weiss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356336X12440022">Weiss et al., 2001</xref>). Pressure/tension was the subscale with the lowest scores on the IMI. It is important to point out that the occurrence of feelings of pressure and tension in PA situations had been considered a barrier to regular PA, especially among youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440022">Cuddihy et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Girls perceived their competence in a less positive way than boys and were also shown to experience less enjoyment/interest in PE lessons. These findings have been reported consistently in sport and PA contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440022">Carroll and Loumidis, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440022">Fairclough (2003</xref>), the fact that girls tend to be less physically active than boys may be an important determinant of their lower perceived physical competence. Another hypothesis is that schools, and particularly PE, are not able to provide girls with the levels of enjoyment and perceived competence that are necessary for their adherence to a more active lifestyle in and out of school</p>
<p>In the present study, task goal perspective clearly dominated over the ego goal perspective. Task orientation has been related to intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356336X12440022">McCarthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>) and considered an important predictor of youth involvement in sport and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440022">Duda and Ntoumanis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440022">Roberts, 2001</xref>). The moderate to strong positive correlations between task goal orientation, enjoyment/interest, perceived competence and effort/importance (from the IMI) are in line with results from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356336X12440022">Biddle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356336X12440022">Wang and Liu, 2007</xref>). A weak positive relationship emerged between ego orientation and pressure/tension, which suggests that students who provide greater meaning to ego achievement goals in PE experienced the class activities with higher pressure/tension. One barrier to regular PA practice, especially among youth, is the existence of feelings of pressure and tension in PA situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440022">Cuddihy et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Associations were not found between MVPA and intrinsic motivation or goal orientation. In fact, little evidence for their relationship with objective measures of PA within PE has been reported in the literature. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1356336X12440022">Tzetzis et al., 2002</xref>) that assessed 16 PE lessons in Greece, only the time in VPA was related with higher scores of goal orientation. Fairclough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440022">2003</xref>) reported different findings: students classified in the low MVPA group reported higher levels of enjoyment than their high MVPA peers. According to the author, one possible reason for this unexpected result might be that students did not enjoy PE when they were ‘pushed hard’. More recently, a study examined the relationships between students' self-determined motivation and their PA behaviour during a structured PE lesson led by their teacher and a free-choice portion of the class in which they were not required to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356336X12440022">Lonsdale et al., 2009</xref>). Results indicated that self-determined motivation for PE promotes PA (number of steps measured by pedometers), especially in the free-choice condition, suggesting that self-determined motivation is particularly important when students are not supervised. However, caution needs to be taken when generalizing the findings from this study because only one PE lesson per student was assessed and a single content (basketball) was considered. Given the limited number of studies and their contradictory findings, doubts subsist on the relationship between objective measures of PA in PE and the dimensions of intrinsic motivation and goal orientation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a related study showed that the students’ decision to enrol in PE as an optional subject was influenced by the existence of positive motivational experiences in the previous school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440022">Ntoumanis, 2005</xref>). The author concluded that it is necessary to promote self-determined motivation in PE in order to enhance student positive experiences and participation rates.</p>
<p>Consistent results have been reported for the relationship of measures of intrinsic motivation or goal orientation with PA participation outside school. A recent study reported that perceptions of competence and enjoyment (among other variables) in the PE setting predict leisure-time physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440022">Cox et al., 2008</xref>). Other study concluded that the cultivation of task orientation, intrinsic motivation in PE and perceived athletic competence is important to promote sport and exercise participation in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440022">Papaioannou et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The inexistence in the present study of significant associations between MVPA and goal orientated behaviour or intrinsic motivation indicates that there are other possible determinants of PA engagement in PE lessons that should be considered with more detail. The importance of factors like curriculum content, instruction, teaching style, class organization, practice time (and waiting time) and participation in out-of-school athletic activities should be examined in the future.</p>
<p>Looking at the global picture, we can conclude that PE is not contributing in a major way to the recommended daily levels of PA among youth. However, PE is reasonably successful in providing a level of motivation and a type of goal-oriented behaviour that could contribute to promoting exercise adherence in the future. Hence, to develop a lifestyle of regular PA among young people, it is fundamental to make it enjoyable and create an intrinsic desire to be physically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440022">Rowland and Freedson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>HR telemetry has been the device usually used to measure PA in PE settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440022">Fairclough and Stratton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440022">Laurson et al., 2008</xref>). In this study we also explore the hypothesis that other less expensive techniques (pedometry and the Borg’s scale) are possible alternatives to monitor PA in PE. Considering HR data as the PA criterion, the correlation analysis showed that pedometry has a moderate association with MVPA and VPA. Thus, pedometry has a substantially larger level of association with MVPA and VPA than RPE. Electronic pedometers are less expensive than HR telemetry, and also have the advantage of easily providing the student with a result of his/her physical behaviour during PE. The information provided by the pedometers is easily accessed by the teacher and could provide him with a reasonably accurate measure to evaluate the amount of PA that occurred during PE classes. Moreover, the use of a pedometer can function as a motivation tool promoting the increase of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356336X12440022">De Cocker et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies with a broader sample of students and PE classes should explore more deeply the potential role of pedometers for monitoring PA levels in PE settings.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations. Despite the fact that, to our knowledge, this study has collected more data regarding PA in PE in schools in Portugal than any other, it still used a relatively small sample of schools, classes, subjects and lessons. In order to allow for meaningful statistical analyses, PE lessons were grouped into three types (team games, individual activities and mixed activities). This option may have provided a limited picture of the students' PE experiences since it makes it very difficult to control the specific effects of each PE activity on PA. Finally, some uncertainties were raised due to the inexistence of an observation system, which allowed for the analysis of relations between the data collected by the assessment tools we used (PA and psychological measures) and direct observation of variables such as class organization, activity type, instruction, practice time and teacher behaviour.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study we intended to measure the PA levels of Portuguese high school PE lessons and examine their associations with students' intrinsic motivation and goal orientation. We found that high school PE lessons involve low PA levels: students were engaged in MVPA in only about one-third (29.7 minutes) of the official PE scheduled time. The students seemed to recognize this reality since they evaluated PA intensity as light in the RPE. In general, students seem to be positively motivated toward PE and are primarily task goal orientated. Boys experienced more enjoyment/interest in PE and perceived their competence in a more positive way than girls. Intrinsic motivation and goal orientation were not related with MVPA. Both number of steps and RPE were associated with the levels of PA measured by HR telemetry (MVPA and VPA), but the number of steps showed a higher correlation.</p>
