<sec id="sec1-1468017312441852"><title>Geoffrey Greif and Paul Ephross (eds), <italic>Group work with populations at risk</italic>, 3rd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, 522 pp., £30, ISBN 9780195398564.</title>
<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Wulf Livingston, <italic>Glyndwr University, Wales</italic></p>
<p>Group work remains one of the essential national occupational standards that British social workers and in particular social work students are expected to continue to demonstrate. Yet in a current climate where increasingly statutory social work is ascribed an identity synonymous with risk and care management, group work becomes something that is practised at the margins, if at all. The third edition of this book, edited by Grief and Ephross, suggests a different picture in North America in its portrayal of such diverse group work activities and the centrality of social work in their delivery.</p>
<p>This very substantive tome, as with many well edited books can be taken either in its entirety or on a chapter by chapter basis. It is as such, a presentation of a cohesive collection of specific parts. The authorship of its 26 chapters is drawn from a multi-disciplinary Canadian and North American group of university academics and community based practitioners.</p>
<p>The editors have divided the contributions into six themed parts: health issues, adjusting to change, victims and perpetrators of violence, gay men and lesbians, schools and community work, and finally evaluation of practice. Within these sections, each chapter reflects on a specific <italic>at risk population</italic>, with some having a more generic application than others. Thus Wilson and Rice’s exploration of <italic>older adults</italic> or Greif’s of <italic>men</italic> have a much wider resonance than Getzel and Osteen’s investigation of <italic>HIV/AIDS during a changing pandemic</italic>. Each chapter utilizes elements of a common underlying structural approach. In that they each sequentially account for some of: the specific background to their client group, characteristics of that population, group mechanics, practice principles, particular topics or themes, recommended ways of working, evaluation approaches, and finally, the provision of further resources. The familiarity of this consistent framework supports its usefulness as ‘an off the bookshelf’ resource.</p>
<p>The specific chapters are preceded by Ephross’s brief but useful overview of some fundamentals of group work. Readers unfamiliar with social work group work might benefit from prior reading of an additional, larger, core practice guide. As someone who practises, manages, educates and supervisees about and in group work settings, I found much of this book to be really informative and illuminating. One such example is Rose and Dastes’s provision of a particularly insight into how <italic>people with cancer</italic>, can have many differing attributes which then suggest both reasons for running distinct groups and yet some common themes to be managed. Further, it was refreshing to read Ephross’s <italic>people who sexually offend</italic> offering a richly diverse interpretation without the more normative preoccupation with a Duluth model approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017312441852">Dutton &amp; Corvo, 2007</xref>). A final exemplar of the interesting diversity of material is Kaysers’s exploration of the different phases and factors involved in undertaking group work with those who are <italic>disrupted by violence and mass trauma</italic>.</p>
<p>Whilst suggesting that this book has much to offer academics, students and practitioners alike, it also has some limitations. The useful formulaic structure of each chapter, also lends some of the content when read in its entirety to be repeated, for example, numerous authors explore the distinction between open and closed groups. Reflecting its geographical orientation, many of the accounts and resources are located in North American policy, language and interpretation. Much of the group work described within the book, would be undertaken in Britain by other professions, non social service agencies and be quite distant from this book’s assumed identification with social work. Finally, too many of the chapters assume models of staff led expertise in group work and do not sufficiently consider the contribution of peer led and mutual aid group work in enabling <italic>at risk populations</italic> to achieve change, where the social work role is much more of facilitation and resource support rather than instrumental.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would actively recommend the book to a wide audience, as these observations should not detract from the principal value of the book, namely that, it offers some very accurately applied practical interpretations for the specific challenges of delivering group work to certain populations within the context of their unique habitus. Further, it is refreshing to read any book in the current climate of control, risk and care management worlds that so centrally promotes support and change through group work, let alone one that further offers a real primacy for social work involvement.</p>
