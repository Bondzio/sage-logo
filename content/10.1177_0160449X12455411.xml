<p>“Nobody in this town would buy that guy a cup of coffee,” a bitter staffer for the San Francisco Central Labor Council told me a few years ago. He was referring to Service Employees International Union (SEIU) president Andy Stern, then embroiled in a nasty fight with 150,000 California health care workers who objected to Stern’s plans to reorganize their local. Stern placed the local in trusteeship; they responded by forming the breakaway National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) and moved to decertify SEIU at their workplaces. While all this was happening, SEIU became mired in a factional struggle of another union, UNITE-HERE, and engaged in a third dispute, this one with the California Nurses Association (CNA), which got ugly enough to provoke a brawl at the biennial conference of the national publication <italic>Labor Notes</italic>.</p>
<p>Stern has since retired, and SEIU has managed something resembling a truce with both CNA and UNITE-HERE. The fight with NUHW continues; SEIU has invested a staggering amount of money and resources in it and has resorted to some disturbing tactics—including lawsuits against NUHW leaders. On yet another front, Stern’s bid to revitalize organized labor by breaking with the AFL-CIO and launching the new Change to Win federation has not produced positive results.</p>
<p>SEIU remains a large and powerful union and in many respects a genuinely progressive political force. But Andy Stern, once hailed by many as an innovative thinker and leader and a force for needed change in the union movement, is just as likely to be seen today as embodying some of its historic weaknesses: turf wars, top-down leadership, and a tendency to confuse the extension of labor’s institutional power with the broadening of its mass base.</p>
<p>How to account for this? Of the two critiques of SEIU under review, Cal Winslow’s is less helpful. His defense of NUHW seems to have been written in great haste and great anger; it offers little in the way of analysis or even context. Veteran labor journalist Steve Early, who spent years as a staffer for the Communication Workers, is more ambitious in his analysis of these and other internal labor struggles. His exhaustively researched book was originally inspired by a desire to understand the generation of activists, like himself and Andy Stern, who came out of the social movements of the 1960s and joined the labor movement, hoping to make it a force for social change.</p>
<p>Early cut his teeth in Miners for Democracy and Teamsters for a Democratic Union, both rank-and-file movements that successfully challenged mob elements in leadership of their respective unions. For him, rank-and-file initiative and internal democracy are crucial yardsticks for measuring a union’s work. By these standards, he finds SEIU seriously wanting.</p>
<p>He is sharply critical of SEIU’s tendency to “organize the employer,” particularly in the public sector, where its political clout has enabled it to win representation rights for workers who may never have been consulted. Its “neutrality agreements” with employers, Early maintains, are often won at the cost of aggressive representation. He decries SEIU’s growing reliance on call centers to handle grievances. He is uncomfortable with the union’s tendency to hire young, college-educated staffers with minimal experience in labor movement and little connection or accountability to those they represent. And while SEIU has earned praise for focusing on home care workers and other low-paid, highly exploited workers, disproportionately immigrants and people of color, Early questions whether these workers have a meaningful voice in their union, or even good representation.</p>
<p>Most of all, he condemns SEIU for using trusteeships—ostensibly a mechanism for checking corruption and misuse of union funds—as a weapon for silencing internal dissent, something he maintains few other unions have done so freely or so destructively. Given the debacle in California, this criticism is not easily dismissed. What of the others?</p>
<p>What makes Early’s argument interesting is that the policies he criticizes were often attempts to attack problems that have bedeviled the labor movement for years: falling union density, underrepresentation of “marginalized” workers, the difficulty of representing those who labor in isolation in nontraditional workplaces, the near impossibility of conventional organizing under an increasingly dysfunctional regime of labor laws. Early’s issues with SEIU must be viewed in a social and political environment that has become fundamentally hostile to workers.</p>
<p>Early argues that SEIU’s approach backfired because it was the product of social engineering from above rather than mass organizing from below. In his view, too many academic sympathizers with unions don’t seem to know the difference. He disparagingly quotes labor historian Janice Fine, whose defense of SEIU includes the assertion that during all her years as a union organizer she never “worked at a truly democratic organization—staff and elected leaders always exercised power” (p. 246).</p>
<p>Early suggests that Fine’s argument is self-serving: even as an academic, she took SEIU funding. That said, she is on to something. There is always tension between unions’ role as “mass organizations of workers” and the demands of collective bargaining, which require a high level of internal cohesion and discipline. The short-term demands of bargaining and organizational power can be hard to reconcile with unions’ larger mission of class solidarity. It’s tempting to embrace easy “fixes,” which can merely compound the problem. The tension is particularly pronounced in a political system that does not encourage class-based politics, and where unions must assume some of the functions of a working-class political party even as they advocate for their members’ direct economic interests.</p>
<p>Negotiating that tension is a challenge for union leaders and rank-and-file activists alike. If SEIU’s approach has come up short, it’s incumbent on us all to come up with something better.</p>
