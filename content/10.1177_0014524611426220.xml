<body>
<p>In March 2011, after 17 years serving as Vicar or Priest-in-Charge in three different Parishes, I finally left the Church of England Diocese of Newcastle. In terms of Dioceses, the move was as small as it could have been, just to the adjoining Diocese, and in that adjoining Diocese just to a patch that shares a boundary with the Newcastle Diocese.</p>
<p>In that sense, it was just one small step. But in many other senses it has been a giant leap. For I have moved to the Diocese of Edinburgh, where I am now Rector of St Andrew’s Scottish Episcopal Church Kelso and St Mary and All Souls’ Scottish Episcopal Church Coldstream. So I have left England and the Church of England and have come to the Scottish Episcopal Church, like so many of the clergy of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a large number of whom either are English or have served in England, or both. What makes it rather different and perhaps more strange for me is that my departure from England is only just – my new Charges are among the Scottish incumbencies nearest to England, I have only come from the English Diocese nearest to Scotland, many of the members of my two new congregations are themselves English, some even live in England, and my nearest serving Anglican clergy neighbours are at Branxton and Norham – both in England (and in the Diocese of Newcastle)!</p>
<p>Yet the differences between one side of the England-Scotland Border and the other are, in many ways, vast – for being on the north side of the Tweed and on the west side of that line through the countryside that the vicissitudes of history have decreed is now the divide between England and Scotland. At one point near here, the Border is the middle of a country lane – walk on one side and you are in Scotland, on the other and you are in England. But there is nothing to tell you that that is the case except the map! It all looks the same on both sides.</p>
<p>So, that Border is, in some respects, little more than an arbitrary line, and it has shifted over the centuries. I suppose, theoretically it could change again, though who would decide such a change is a mystery to me. In many places, the border does not seem to reflect ‘natural’ geographical or ‘cultural’ boundaries. It has changed in the course of the centuries largely I think due to the ebb and the flow of the wars between England and Scotland in the Middle Ages. Back in the days of Hadrian, the border was the line of the Wall, which runs more or less due West- East between Carlisle and Wallsend, just east of Newcastle. Now it still does start quite close to Carlisle, but then wends its way roughly north-eastwards until it arrives at the North Sea between Berwick-upon-Tweed and Eyemouth. And, of course, for many centuries Berwick itself was independent of both Scotland and England, and was only incorporated into England relatively recently.</p>
<p>Where borders run is often arbitrary. Just looking at the political map of much of Saharan Africa, for instance, reveals the extent to which the borders in that continent have been drawn by running straight lines across the desert, yet one’s whole nationality is dictated by which side of the border you live on – sometimes with fateful consequences, as when tribal boundaries and national boundaries do not correspond.</p>
<p>So which side of the line you live on makes a huge difference, however arbitrarily the line has been drawn.</p>
<p>And the differences between England and Scotland, even or perhaps especially right by the Border, are quite marked, for all that – as yet – England and Scotland are both within the United Kingdom and share a national Government in Westminster. Those differences are cultural, political (I came into post less than three weeks before the SNP won its majority in the Scottish Parliament), legal, linguistic (it is amazing how strong the Scottish accents can be even in Coldstream, right on the Border!), all for crossing what is actually an invisible line.</p>
<p>This reminds me of how much our identity is shaped by borders, boundaries, by which country, region, county, local authority district we happen to live in. Often we are largely unaware of the way in which how we understand ourselves is influenced by which area we live in. Often, too, we are unaware of the ways in which, in the sometimes even quite recent past, the boundaries between areas have changed. There are areas that lie within the present limits of the City of Newcastle-upon-Tyne that within living memory were in the County of Northumberland. The same holds true of the Metropolitan District of North Tyneside, too, which even now within its borders has two different schooling systems – three-tier in the part formerly in Northumberland, two-tier in the rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps those of us who live on or near borders, particularly those of us who have crossed from one side to the other, can be those who remind others of those differences, and of just how much our identity is tied up by which area we happen to live in.</p>
<p>The differences between England and Scotland are ecclesiastical, too. When I announced to my previous congregation, in Scotswood in the west end of Newcastle itself, that I was moving, what caused them the most consternation was my saying that I was leaving the Church of England. They – and not only they – could not grasp the fact that the Church of <italic>England</italic> does not extend into Scotland, that Anglicanism in Scotland is separate from and rather different from Anglicanism in England. They had identified ‘Church of England’ with ‘Anglican’ or ‘Episcopalian’ throughout the UK, and actually, but mistakenly, thought that I was announcing my decision to become a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>Then many in England, when they heard of my impending move to Scotland, assumed that the Scottish equivalent of the Church of England is the Church of Scotland – which it is, but only in the sense of being the ‘State’ or ‘Established’ Church, not in the sense of denomination! People in England simply do not seem to realise that the Queen changes her denomination whenever she crosses the Border, that she is an Anglican in England and a Presbyterian in Scotland, that when she goes to Church from Balmoral she worships in a Presbyterian Church, which is her local Parish Church, just as when she goes to Sandringham she worships at her local Parish Church – except that the Church in Sandringham is an Anglican church. Indeed, it was as a Presbyterian that Her Majesty welcomed Pope Benedict to Britain in September 2010. In England, the denomination that is parochial is the (Anglican) Church of England, in Scotland it is the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland, not the (Anglican) Scottish Episcopal Church. And Scottish Presbyterianism has every bit as strong a conception of the Parish system covering the whole nation as English Anglicanism does. The local Church of Scotland Church is the Parish Church for a particular area, with that right of baptism, marriage and funeral within it. Church of Scotland Churches have often had Glebe land attached to them, as many English Anglican churches have had. The Church of Scotland minister in a particular place is generally viewed as the ‘default’ Christian minister in that locality, just as the Vicar or the Rector is in England.</p>
<p>Yet English Anglicanism, and those who write about ordained ministry from an English Anglican perspective, does seem to tend to assume that being the State or the Established Church, and with that the Parish system, is normative for Anglicanism as a whole. I suppose English Anglican writers would probably recognize that Anglican Provinces elsewhere in the world outside of Britain are not Established Churches, but somehow it seems to get forgotten that that is also the case in Scotland, and in Wales and Ireland, too.</p>
<p>It may, of course, equally be the case that Scottish Presbyterianism also tends to assume that being the ‘State Church’ is of the essence of Presbyterianism when, equally, that is only the case in Scotland and not elsewhere. The nearest denominational equivalent to the Church of Scotland in England is the United Reformed Church, but the URC is a ‘Free Church’, not an ‘Established’ one. I imagine that I will find out in due course the degree to which Scottish Presbyterianism makes that assumption about Presbyterianism elsewhere. Similarly, in parts of Northern Europe, Lutheranism is the ‘State’ or ‘Established’ Church, whereas elsewhere in the world, for instance in America, it most certainly is not.</p>
<p>All of which reminds us that there are huge variations <italic>within</italic> our denominations as well as between them, that there is more than one way of being an Anglican, or a Presbyterian, or a Methodist, even within the UK, and that we should not assume that the way a Christian tradition is in one country, or in one part of one country, is the same as it will be in another country or in another part of the same country (are England and Scotland two separate countries or two parts of one country? That is, of course, just one of the questions in British life and politics at the moment, and the answer to it may change depending on the outcome of the promised referendum on Scottish independence). In particular, being a ‘State’ or an ‘Established’ Church is not of the absolute and invariable essence of any tradition of Christianity. No single denomination has the right to be the ‘State’ Church in any country. For all denominations that are State Churches in particular places, that is a ‘bolt on’ to its essential nature, even if it has been part of the nature of that Church right from its origins, as is the case with the Church of England, certainly.</p>
<p>It is also the case that the nature of Establishment, and the nature of a State Church’s relationship with the State, varies – in England, a number of Church of England Bishops sit in the House of Lords and the monarch is the Supreme Governor of that Church, but that is not the case in Scotland, while in many Scandinavian countries there is the Church Tax, for instance.</p>
<p>So it is dangerous to make assumptions, even about how your own Christian tradition is in a different part of the UK from where you live. I am reminded of the adage that I first learned from the Acorn Christian Foundation’s Christian Listeners’ programme – if you ASSUME you make an ASS of U and ME!</p>
<p>All of this does make me start to re-examine the question, as an Anglican, of what it really is that lies at the core of Anglican identity. It isn’t being Established, certainly.</p>
<p>In coming from North-East England to southern Scottish Borders, I have come from England to Scotland (I don’t have to pay prescription charges now), from inner city to rural, from being responsible for one Church to having charge of two, from ‘State Church’ to a minority denomination at best only third largest in the country, after the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church (which has more Dioceses and Bishops in Scotland than the SEC does). I am now paid by a different body and will receive a pension from a different body from the one which has paid me and made my pension contributions up until now.</p>
<p>The move from Scotswood to Scotland has been ‘one small step’ for me geographically, but in many other respects it has been ‘one giant leap’, for all that the countryside looks the same, the Churches in which I worship and lead services look much the same, and the liturgies that I use to lead those services are very similar. I am beginning to find out just how giant that leap is, how widespread the differences are between being an Anglican priest in England and an Anglican priest in Scotland, even only just over the border. In my first few weeks in post, what I have found the most different and difficult have been having two Churches/ congregations rather than just one (and hence remembering who belongs to which Church) and having a slightly different set of liturgies to master (the Scottish Episcopal Church orders of service are, in many respects, quite similar to the Church of England ones, but not completely – and it is the slight variations that can cause the most problems for someone new to them!). I am also learning how <italic>not</italic> to be a Parish minister, and to refrain from talking about my ‘canonical areas’ as ‘Parishes’ and the members of my congregations as ‘parishioners’!</p>
<p>So I am facing a large number of changes. But it is, at least partly, for my own continuing personal and professional ministerial development that I have moved from the familiarity of the Church of England (and England) to the relative unfamiliarity of the Scottish Episcopal Church (and Scotland). For it is, of course, as we face differences and changes that we can grow spiritually. H. F. Lyte, who was in fact born at Ednam near Kelso, did not necessarily get it right when he wrote in ‘Abide with me’, ‘Change and decay in all around I see’. John Henry Newman was closer to the truth when he said that, ‘To change is to grow and to be perfect is to have changed often’. So it is my hope and prayer that I will indeed grow spiritually through being in a radically new context, through facing all those changes I have described in this article.</p>
