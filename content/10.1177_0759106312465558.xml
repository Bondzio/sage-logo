<p>This issue of the <italic>BMS</italic> includes two research articles in English and four research notes (two in French and two in English, respectively). The first research article is “Extended Field Efforts to Reduce the Risk of Non-response Bias: Have the Effects Changed over Time? Can Weighting Achieve the Same Effects?”, by Julia Hall, Victoria Brown, Gerry Nicolaas and Peter Lynn who provide the first study of changes over time of extended field efforts, define a more precise measure of the difficulty of contact and consider weight adjustments for non-response estimates.</p>
<p>The second research article is “Response Rate and Non-response Bias - Impact of the Number of Contact Attempts on Data Quality in the European Social Survey”, by Marek Fuchs, Dayana Bossert and Sabrina Stukowski, who examine the assumption that higher response rates from increased contact attempts foster data quality and smaller non-response bias by using ESS data for Norway, Finland and Slovenia.</p>
<p>The first research note, in French, is “The Media and Public Opinion - Theoretical and Methodological Analysis of the Debate on National Identity”, by Emmanuel Marty, Pascal Marchand and Pierre Ratinaud, who compare the two sets of six clusters obtained by the lexicometric analysis of the 18,240 ministerial Web site contributions and 1,436 contemporaneous press articles.</p>
<p>The second research note, in French, is “Brief Review of Three Methodological Problems of Life Histories in Sociology”, by Jacques Hamel, who examines the popularity of life histories in sociology in the early 1970s, and considers the issue of representativeness, the status conferred on common sense and the rigor of the analysis as related to grounded theory.</p>
<p>The third research note, in English, is “Meta-Analysis for Sociology - A Measure-Driven Approach”, by David J. Roelfs, Eran Shor, Louise Falzon, Karina W. Davidson and Joseph E. Schwartz, who compare “concept-driven” to “measure-driven” approaches – which increase the range of publications found – on the basis of two meta-analytic projects on all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>The fourth research note, in English, is “Sample Size Requirements for Stable Clustering of Free Partition Sorting Data”, by Joachim Harloff, Adrian Stringer and Jennifer Perry, who study convergence rates of seven cluster analysis methods applied to six sets of partition sorting data – including kinship terms, consultancy Web site items, social groups and prenatal tests – whose interpretations resemble previously published interpretations of results obtained from non-partitioning statistical methods.</p>
