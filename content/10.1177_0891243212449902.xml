<abstract>
<p>Recent scholarship has identified the modern wedding as a principal site for the construction of heteronormativity. This article examines whether and how the participation of same-sex couples in the wedding ritual can challenge this construction. Photographs from the 2004 San Francisco same-sex weddings were quantitatively content-coded for subjects’ gender presentation and for the extent to which the couple embodied the heteronormative wedding standard of one bride and one groom. I find that all the men in these photographs conformed to gender norms and thus no male couple conformed to the wedding standard. In contrast, approximately one-fifth of the women presented non-normative gender, and more than two-thirds of the formally dressed lesbian couples conformed to the wedding standard of a bride and a groom. In a close reading of four photographs, I argue that these images have the potential to challenge assumptions about normative sex, gender, and sexuality at the level of the symbolic when understood in relation to the institution of marriage. Nonetheless, the enactment of weddings depicted in these images may also reify weddings as heteronormative by conforming to expectations about how individuals and couples present themselves when marrying. These findings point to the importance of distinguishing symbolic and enacted heteronormativity.</p>

<p>Recent scholarship has identified the modern wedding as a principal site for the construction of heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212449902">Ingraham 1999</xref>), understood as the social assumption of heterosexuality as both natural and common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891243212449902">Warner 1993</xref>). The so-called white wedding, an overriding heterosexual romance narrative with one (virginal) bride and one groom as its protagonists, perpetuates the construction of heterosexuality as both normal and immutable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212449902">Ingraham 1999</xref>). This unquestioned assumption of the ubiquity of heterosexuality, in weddings and elsewhere, has the further consequence of instituting normative gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212449902">Ingraham 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212449902">2005</xref>): Weddings produce and police gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212449902">Geller 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891243212449902">Howard 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212449902">Otnes and Pleck 2003</xref>). Heteronormativity has very real material consequences (e.g., the gendered division of labor, the social invisibility of children of same-sex couples), and it also actively operates at the level of the symbolic, conditioning individual presentation. As this literature makes clear, in the ritual of the wedding, only specific combinations of sex, gender, and sexuality performances are acceptable. These performances—and the erasure of their construction—mark weddings as a location for the (re)production of heteronormativity.</p>
<p>In recent years, some scholars have argued that heteronormativity’s stranglehold can be undone, or at least contested, through the participation of same-sex couples in marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212449902">Badgett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212449902">Bernstein and Reimann 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212449902">Eskridge 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212449902">Hull 2006</xref>). For the most part, this literature has focused on the potential impacts of the presence of same-sex couples in the institution of marriage. Less work has considered the ways in which same-sex <italic>weddings</italic> contest or reify heteronormativity. Scholars have examined private same-sex commitment ceremonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212449902">Hull 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212449902">Lewin 1998</xref>), but not same-sex commitments made on a public stage, that is, legal same-sex weddings. Given the pervasiveness of heteronormativity in the wedding ritual itself, this is an important oversight. As the ritual of legal same-sex marriage becomes more visible, there are important questions about the extent to which same-sex weddings conform to the heteronormative conventions of different-sex weddings.</p>
<p>To investigate these questions, I analyze gender presentation in 351 wedding photographs from the 2004 same-sex weddings in San Francisco compiled by the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> in an online album.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891243212449902">1</xref></sup> Wedding photographs are a genre that is subject to a complex set of cultural standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891243212449902">Norfleet 1979</xref>), many of which are tied to normative sex, gender, and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212449902">Otnes and Pleck 2003</xref>). As such, they represent a useful entry point for examining whether same-sex weddings echo or ignore the heteronormative standards of different-sex weddings. I consider these images, first, at the level of the individual subjects for the extent to which their presentations conform to normative gender expectations, and second, at the level of the couple, observing the extent to which they meet normative wedding expectations of a bride and a groom. I find that men always presented themselves according to gender-normative expectations and thus never conformed to the normative wedding expectations of a bride and a groom (i.e., there were no men in dresses). Women, on the other hand, had more varied gender presentations, with some defying gender-normative expectations through hairstyle or clothing, for example. In contrast to the men, of the formally dressed lesbian couples, more than two-thirds conformed to the wedding standard of a bride and a groom, albeit with a woman groom.</p>
<p>Following an empirical assessment of the content of these photographs, I offer a deeper reading of four of the photographs that most closely conform to the heteronormative wedding standard of a bride and a groom to consider how the performance of this norm by a same-sex couple may disrupt—or reify—normative assumptions about sex, gender, and sexuality. Because no gay men couples displayed wedding normativity, all four selected photographs depict lesbian couples. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891243212449902">Valocchi’s (2005)</xref> call to situate discursive power in institutional processes, I argue that readings of the gender and sexuality performances in these images are inextricably tied to the institution of marriage; it matters that they are wedding photos. I argue that these performances, when understood in relation to the institution of marriage, hold the potential to challenge symbolic assumptions about normative sex, gender, and sexuality by forcing the viewer to read the individuals in relation to each other. When a gender-normative woman, for instance, is read in relation to another woman, her lesbian sexuality is rendered visible. Considered in terms of enactment, however, the challenge these photos pose to heteronormativity is far more modest. The relative paucity of lesbian couples refusing gender norms and the complete absence of gay men displaying a non-gender-normative appearance suggest the persistence of normative conventions in lesbian and gay couples’ wedding practice. This finding points to the importance of a theoretical distinction between symbolic and enacted challenges to heteronormativity.</p>

<title>Normative Sex, Gender, and Sexuality</title>
<p>As articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212449902">Ingraham (2005)</xref>, heteronormativity is the institutionalized expectation that bodies are constructed into oppositionally situated (sexual and social) categories. I focus here on its production, considering how heteronormativity operates through the symbolic. It is premised on the assumption that sex, gender, and sexuality are fixed and immutable. It assumes an a priori existence of sex, gender, and sexuality that induces particular forms of expression (signs) that are interpreted as evidence of a subject’s sex, gender, and sexuality (the signified). Further, one’s identity in one category is linked to one’s identity in another. Bodies sexed as female, for example, are presumed to have a feminine gender identity and sexually desire bodies sexed as male with masculine-gendered identities. Evidence of a body’s gender is taken as evidence of the body’s sex and sexuality as well; evidence of a body’s sex is read as proof of gender and sexuality, and so on.</p>
<p>Feminist and queer theorists have documented the production and reification of normative sex, gender, and sexuality, arguing that they are neither natural nor fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212449902">Butler 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891243212449902">1997</xref>). All three share a similar binary construction that exclusively and exhaustively sorts all bodies: A body is either a woman or a man, always one and never both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891243212449902">Lorber 1996</xref>); sexuality is presumed permanently and uniquely either heterosexual or homosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243212449902">Butler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212449902">Foucault 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891243212449902">Lorber 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions to these presumed linkages, often accompanied by “scientific” explanations. Extensive scholarship has been devoted to “deviant” women and men. Historically, for example, the mannish lesbian has been a familiar trope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891243212449902">Newton 1984</xref>). Explained by sexologists at the turn of the nineteenth century through theories of inversion, the mannish lesbian is a woman who misidentifies as a man and, because of this, desires feminine women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243212449902">Ellis 1895</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891243212449902">Krafft-Ebing [1886] 1965</xref>). In this construction, the disconnect between proper sex (female), gender (feminine), and sexuality (hetero) is explained as a simple confusion in one of the steps. The woman-desiring, masculine woman was understood as a gender invert: Her mismatched sex and gender led to an inappropriate, or at least non-“normal,” sexual desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891243212449902">Newton 1984</xref>). Notably, the gender invert described only women-desiring women who adopted masculine dress and mannerisms—what we would today term “butch.” Positing an explanation for lesbianism by inversion, however, does not account for the “femme.” The femme is not confused about her gender, but rather appears to have “misidentified” her sexual object as female rather than male even as she desires someone with a masculine gender performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891243212449902">Walker 1993</xref>). In the past, feminine women who had romantic relationships with other women were usually considered confused heterosexuals.</p>
<p>Outside of queer spaces, heteronormative expectations about the relationship between sex, gender, and sexuality frequently serve to marginalize and/or erase the identities of gay men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891243212449902">Dalton 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891243212449902">Lewin 1993</xref>). Perceived gender continues to be implicated in sexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212449902">Calhoun (1995)</xref> asserts that lesbians are marked primarily by public appearance. She argues that sexuality is interpreted based on the viewer’s perception of a match between sex and gender. Thus, a person whose visual presentation betrays a mismatch between sex (female) and gender (masculine)—a butch—is read as a lesbian, while a person whose presentation appears to conform—a femme—is read as heterosexual.</p>

<title>Weddings as Ritualized Heteronormativity</title>
<p>Until recently, weddings were rituals explicitly marked as heterosexual and thus a nonqueer space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891243212449902">Oswald 2000</xref>). In these spaces, nonnormative sexual identities and genders have been invisible and normative sex, gender, and sexuality reinscribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212449902">Geller 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212449902">Ingraham 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891243212449902">2006</xref>). The wedding is written through a heterosexual narrative, reliant on having one bride and one groom who are presumed to have a monogamous sexual relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243212449902">Essig 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891243212449902">Ingraham 2003</xref>). Further, weddings institute normative gender. Scholars have pointed to the ways in which contemporary entertainment and media construct weddings as every little girl’s dream, placing social pressure on women to marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243212449902">Freeman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212449902">Geller 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212449902">Ingraham 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212449902">Otnes and Pleck 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243212449902">Boden (2003)</xref> argues that a bridal consumption culture encourages women to aspire to be a “superbride,” one who consumes all the right magazines and advice columns to make her wedding day ideal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212449902">Geller’s (2001)</xref> study of heteronormative wedding culture based on her own “undercover” experience unearths the extensive privileges afforded a marrying couple—as long as the couple conforms to normative expectations about weddings and gender. Women and men are rewarded, in other words, for participating in the wedding narrative.</p>
<p>One aspect of that narrative is the obligatory wedding portrait. Wedding photographs are subject to a cultural standard of composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891243212449902">Peters and Mergen 1977</xref>): They tend to be formal and consciously staged with the couple centered in the frame, with most of their bodies captured in the image, as opposed to a head or head-and-shoulder shot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891243212449902">Norfleet 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891243212449902">Schuster 1997</xref>). The photographs are often in black and white. The couple is generally dressed formally, usually with the bride in a white dress and the groom in a dark suit or tuxedo. The groom often has his arms around the bride, standing slightly behind her. In addition to the couple, wedding photographs frequently include the active display of symbols of marriage, including wedding and engagement rings and religious or civil licensing documents. Of particular relevance to the analysis presented here, wedding photographs remain sites of clear gender distinction between men’s and women’s bodies, even though gendered standards of presentation and dress have relaxed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212449902">Otnes and Pleck 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some activists and scholars have contended that the advent of same-sex marriage will catalyze the downfall of heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212449902">Calhoun 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212449902">Eskridge 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212449902">Kitzinger and Wilkinson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891243212449902">Stoddard 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891243212449902">Sullivan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0891243212449902">Wolfson 2004</xref>), while others have asserted that the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples in marriage will instead extend the hegemony of heterosexuality into the queer community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212449902">Duggan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212449902">Ettelbrick 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212449902">Kandaswamy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891243212449902">Valverde 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891243212449902">Walters 2001</xref>). Both sides have tended to focus on the consequences of same-sex marriage, particularly insofar as it challenges (or preserves) the institutionalization of heteronormativity in marriage. Less work has explicitly considered the ritual of the same-sex wedding for how it speaks back to or reifies heteronormativity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212449902">Lewin’s (1998)</xref> ethnographic study of gay and lesbian commitment ceremonies is one exception. Through analysis of interviews and ceremony attendance, Lewin finds that some same-sex couples explicitly constructed their ceremonies to resist heteronormativity, but many others actively sought to echo established (heteronormative) traditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212449902">Hull (2006)</xref>, too, has explored same-sex commitment ceremonies, arguing that these ceremonies constitute cultural enactments of marriage outside of legal sanction, making them explicitly political actions that target dominant society’s cultural devaluation of same-sex relationships and expose the lack of legal support for same-sex couples. Both studies, however, are limited by their focus on nonlegal commitment ceremonies as opposed to legal same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>Until recently, this limitation was inevitable, as same-sex marriage was not legal anywhere in the United States. Individual states control access to marriage and none permitted issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples (and, moreover, the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages). That changed following the November 2003 ruling of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <italic>Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</italic>. The court found that limiting marriage to only different-sex unions violated the state’s constitution. It mandated that either same-sex couples be allowed to wed in the state or the constitution be changed by May 17, 2004.</p>
<p>In response to Massachusetts’ landmark ruling, even before a single wedding license was issued to a same-sex couple, opponents of same-sex marriage began talking about a federal constitutional amendment that would restrict marriage to unions between one man and one woman. They had support in high places. Two months after the Massachusetts decision, President George W. Bush conveyed his opposition to same-sex marriage by voicing support for so-called traditional marriage in his State of the Union Address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212449902">Bush 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Same-sex marriage proponents also had support among elected officials. Only weeks into his first term as mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom was troubled by the President’s endorsement of only different-sex marriage in his State of the Union Address. He decided to take a stand for marriage equality. At about noon on Thursday, February 12, 2004, Mayor Newsom directed the county clerk to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He chose this course of action with thought, but much of the specifics came together very quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891243212449902">Chasnoff 2004</xref>). Those who were involved in the whirlwind planning did not expect that the license granting to same-sex couples would last; most assumed the courts would quickly intervene and put a stop to San Francisco’s actions. But the courts did not immediately intervene, and San Francisco issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for the rest of that afternoon, all of the next day, and through the weekend.</p>
<p>As word got out, same-sex couples from near and far traveled to the city and lined up for their opportunity to apply for a marriage license. This line was different from your typical City Hall line. It was especially long–it snaked through the hallways of the building, out the main doors and down the front steps, and around the city block, with media reports estimating the line at several hundred people at any given time. In addition, couples who waited in this line not only waited to apply for a marriage license, but also to actually marry. Subsequent to receiving their marriage licenses, couples were rushed to quiet spaces around City Hall where a (often newly) deputized city official performed their marriage ceremony in just minutes. They then raced to formally register their marriage with the clerk’s office. For these couples, the day they requested their wedding license was their wedding day; the line for receiving a marriage license was a line for getting married.</p>
<p>By the Friday of the following week, the city switched to an appointment system in which couples received their marriage license and were legally wedded in a City Hall ceremony according to a scheduled calendar. Granting same-sex marriage licenses became part of City Hall’s business as usual. Nearly one month later, on March 11, the Supreme Court of California halted the license granting, pending review of the legality of the Mayor’s actions. All told, more than 4,000 same-sex couples received marriage licenses in that time and 3,955 of them registered their marriages (i.e., were legally married). Ultimately, in August of that year, the Court overruled the Mayor’s directive and ruled the licenses invalid. Nonetheless, they were legal at the time issued and thus represent the first large-scale set of same-sex weddings in the United States.</p>

<title>Documenting the San Francisco Weddings</title>
<p>After the weddings were stopped, the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> compiled an online photo album of images from the weddings as a way to celebrate the events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891243212449902">1</xref></sup> Some photos were submitted by the individuals involved, and some came from the <italic>Chronicle</italic>’s own photographers; language on the site suggests that every photograph submitted was published, totaling 351 images in all. The images depict a range of couples. All of them contain at least the two participants (the marrying couple), and many also include a City Hall official and/or additional family members, such as parents or siblings of the brides or grooms or the couple’s own children. The images capture a variety of points in the marriage process, from candid photos of couples waiting in line outside City Hall, exchanging vows, or emerging triumphant from the government building, to more formal, staged compositions memorializing the couples’ participation in this rite of passage. At the most basic level, these images are commemorative of a social ritual: a wedding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891243212449902">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>By producing these images, these couples conform to current social convention marking weddings as important occasions to document and as symbolic of individuals’ position in society and relationship to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891243212449902">Peters and Mergen 1977</xref>). This convention has deep roots, with wedding photographs sometimes being the only photographs possessed by early twentieth-century families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891243212449902">Bourdieu [1965] 1990</xref>). But these images are also documents of an explicit challenge to the social convention that weddings are restricted to different-sex couples, making them a useful case for considering the impact of same-sex weddings on heteronormativity.</p>
<p>I quantitatively content-coded the photographs in the <italic>Chronicle</italic>’s online album for variables related to the gender and wedding presentations of the subjects. First, each image was coded for whether the depicted couple consisted of two men or two women. Then, each spouse (excluding any other subjects in the photo) was coded for whether her or his presentation conformed to normative gender expectations. That is, did the subject’s gender match her or his presumed sex? For subjects whose gender presentation was androgynous, I coded conservatively, erring on the side of their presentation as not contesting heteronormative expectations, and coded them as gender-normative. Next, each spouse was coded for whether his/her presentation was in accordance with normative expectations about wedding appearance appropriate to his/her (presumed) sex. Specifically, women were coded as conforming to normative expectations if they wore a dress or formal white outfit and men were coded as conforming to normative expectations if they wore a formal suit or tuxedo. Finally, each spouse was coded for whether his/her presentation was in accordance with normative expectations about wedding appearance appropriate to the other sex. I then computed descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>While this empirical analysis documents the breadth of gender and wedding presentations during the San Francisco weddings, it does not inform our understanding about the possible impacts of these images on normative expectations. To more fully examine how same-sex wedding photographs may pose a symbolic challenge to heteronormativity, we must also think through the potential readings of these images. Following the empirical analysis of the wedding album, I offer a close reading of four of the photographs that conform to wedding normativity—that is, each has an ostensible bride and an ostensible groom. When same-sex wedding images do not meet the wedding normative standard, they may be dismissed as not weddings. For the heteronormative viewer, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243212449902">Bersani’s (1987)</xref> argument, images that are not wedding normative could be read as evidence of fundamental difference between heterosexual couples and gay and lesbian couples. Such “evidence” could allow heteronormative viewers to find a distance between themselves and this mimic. In these cases, the obviousness of the difference between a heterosexual couple’s wedding (a bride and a groom) and a homosexual couple’s wedding (e.g., two brides or two grooms) could be understood to preserve the authenticity of a sexuality-based difference and, in turn, heteronormativity in (different-sex) weddings. This distancing, however, is not available for photographs of couples who do symbolically conform to the wedding norm of a bride and a groom. To the extent that these photographs enact wedding normativity, they conform to heteronormative conventions about weddings and are thus an important starting point for thinking through how the fact that the subjects are of the same sex matters to the (re)production of heteronormativity through weddings.</p>
<p>Some of the subjects of the photos in this category of wedding normative images display gender normativity while others do not. To best represent this category of images, I purposely select two with one non-gender-normative subject and two with two gender-normative subjects. Photos were selected for their utility in exploring the conceptual issues at hand.</p>

<title>Normativity at Odds with Itself: Gender Normativity vs. Wedding Normativity</title>
<p>The broad cultural standard for wedding photographs was in evidence in the photographs included in the <italic>Chronicle</italic>’s online album of the San Francisco same-sex weddings. Many of the photographs conform to the conventions of how weddings are captured on film, depicting poses, settings, and gestures common to the genre of wedding portraits. The 351 couples in the online album represent roughly 9 percent of the 4,037 couples who received marriage licenses during the month-long events. The photographs are about evenly split between lesbian couples (53 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 187) and gay men (47 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 164), and several trends hold across both groups. For example, both groups are captured in a range of settings—from waiting in line outside City Hall, to in the midst of their ceremony in City Hall’s dramatic rotunda, to celebrations in locales other than City Hall, which often suggest a formal ceremony—and in similar framings, with the couples generally facing either the camera or each other.</p>
<p>Looking first at the photographs of men, I find that all 328 marrying men in the album presented according to normative gender expectations. They all wore pants and shirts, and all but a handful had short hair (the exceptions include men with dreadlocks, a hairstyle not exclusively typed as feminine). None wore discernible makeup. Although the circumstances of the San Francisco weddings meant that many couples had little time to prepare in advance of their wedding, some men did appear to have made an effort in choosing their attire. One hundred six of the men were dressed in formal wear (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891243212449902">Table 1</xref>), meaning suits—all but three of them dark-colored—or black tuxedos. The three light-colored suits were tan, not white. These men were dressed as grooms.</p>

<p>In the photographs of lesbian couples the story is more complex. Two hundred ninety-five of these women (79 percent) conformed to gender expectations in their appearance. Many had long hair, wore makeup, and/or wore accessories like jewelry and scarves. As noted above, this category includes women whose appearance was androgynous so as to make the most conservative case about the extent to which gender appearance in same-sex wedding photos contests normativity. In parallel, 79 women (21 percent) explicitly did not conform to gendered expectations about their appearance (for instance, having buzz-cut hair, wearing no jewelry or discernible makeup). Although, as with the men, many of the women in the images seem to have arrived at City Hall without consciously planning their appearance, eighty-five of the women clearly dressed intentionally for their wedding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891243212449902">Table 1</xref>). Forty-six of these women (54 percent) were dressed as brides, in dresses that were usually white in color. Nearly as many women (46 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 39) were formally dressed as grooms, in suits or tuxedos. Mixing wedding signs, five of these grooms wore light-colored suits, including two women in white tuxedos, thereby donning the color of a bride but the clothing typical of a groom.</p>
<p>Shifting to consideration of the subjects as couples, rather than individuals, we can evaluate the extent to which same-sex weddings, as depicted in these photographs, conform to the heteronormative wedding standard of one bride and one groom. Among the male couples who dressed formally, none conforms to this standard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891243212449902">Table 2</xref>). All of the men who donned formal wedding clothing assumed the clothing of the groom. These 53 couples were instances of two grooms. These photographs, in other words, depict gender normativity but not wedding normativity.</p>

<p>Among the 43 lesbian couples who consciously adopted formal wear, the majority (70 percent) did display wedding normativity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891243212449902">Table 2</xref>). In the photographs of these thirty couples, one subject wears clothing signaling a bride (e.g., a white dress) and the other wears clothing signaling a groom (e.g., a dark suit).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891243212449902">3</xref></sup> It is worth noting that some of the women who dressed as grooms conformed to gender-normative expectations in other ways, such as having long hair. The remaining thirteen lesbian couples who dressed formally (30 percent) consist of seven cases of two brides and six cases of two grooms. As with the male couples, these thirteen photographs depict gender normativity (even the subjects in masculine garb signified femininity) but do not represent a normative wedding photo.</p>
<p>We can see from this examination of the photographs from the 2004 San Francisco online wedding album that same-sex couples do not always conform to normative expectations about weddings (i.e., there is not always a bride and a groom). Indeed, gay men couples never do. But some of the lesbian couples do present as a bride and a groom. I now turn to a close reading of these images, starting with two photos wherein one subject is not gender normative. As I discuss at the end of this close reading, however, this analysis is not restricted to lesbian couples who conformed to wedding norms; it also holds for couples with two brides or two grooms.</p>

<title>Remaking Presumptions of Essentialized Sexuality</title>
<p>In the first pair of photographs I consider here, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891243212449902">2</xref>, the gender performance of one member of each couple is decidedly non-normative. In a quick glance, the couple might look like a different-sex couple. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figure 1</xref>, we find two subjects captured in black and white in a romantic garden setting. The bridal gown and tuxedo mark the couple as bride and groom. The gowned woman has long hair, artistically pulled away from her face, giving her a feminine appearance. The tuxedoed woman has short, spiky hair, imparting the appearance of a man. The masculine woman occupies the center of the frame and appears to have her arm around the waist of the feminine woman, in a gesture that is partly protective and partly possessive. Because the masculine figure faces the camera, dominating the center of the frame, and is attired in a tuxedo, complete with boutonniere, any physical curves are obscured and visually absent. The feminine figure, on the other hand, is in profile to the camera, the rise of her breasts visible. In this photograph, one figure is read as masculine, perhaps even male, based on clothing, position in the frame, and protective relationship to the other figure, and the other figure, with discernible female body parts and dress, signifies femininity.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891243212449902">Figure 2</xref> depicts many of the same conventions: a short-haired woman in a suit and tie paired with a long-haired woman wearing jewelry. Both face the camera and are smiling. The style of the photograph, however, differs from that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figure 1</xref> in that it is more documentary than staged. Its indoor, apparently commercial, setting suggests not the romantic ideal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figure 1</xref>’s garden but instead a secularized, governmental tone. The short-haired woman is slightly further back in the frame than the long-haired woman, with her arm around the long-haired woman’s back. The long-haired woman likewise has her arm around her spouse, but her arm is at a lower angle and more casually placed. The suited woman on the left proudly displays their marriage license, the public proof of their union from the state. The woman on the right, meanwhile, holds a red and white bouquet—while the former holds an item associated with government, the latter holds decorative flowers. In general, relationships with the state and the public sphere are coded male while domestic, ephemeral, and private relationships are coded female, and so the items the figures hold contribute to their gender presentation: The first communicates masculinity, the second, femininity.</p>
<p>In these two images, the figures embody the signs of gender difference not just in their clothing and hair style but also in their positioning in the photographs. Through the presentation of gender difference, they imply sexual difference, according to our social convention of assuming that gender signs signal a body’s sex. But, the inclusion of these photographs in an online album of same-sex wedding pictures suggests instead that they are not sexually different from one another. While normative expectations of sex, gender, and sexuality assert that sexual difference produces gender difference and sexuality is premised on both sexual and gender difference, the publication context of these two images reveals that they depict instead a different equation. In these photographs, gender difference does not reflect sexual difference. Further, while sexuality appears associated with presented gender difference—one desires someone of a different gender—it is not tied here to implied sexual difference since the (same-sex) wedding album context suggests that the subjects are sexually similar.</p>
<p>What these images communicate—or evidence—is the possibility that lesbian couples can look like different-sex couples. Just as the drag queens Taylor, Rupp, and Gamson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891243212449902">Rupp and Taylor 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891243212449902">Taylor, Rupp, and Gamson 2004</xref>) studied moved between and among different gender identities during their stage performances, the masculine members of these lesbian couples perform gender in ways that are decidedly unfeminine in their wedding photographs. The heteronormative presumption that the performance of gender stems from a body’s immutable character is upended in cases such as those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891243212449902">2</xref>, where lesbian couples can look like different-sex couples. These performances refuse the presumed connection between sex and gender, portraying gender difference without sexual difference. Stated differently, the assumed contingency between sex and gender is disrupted. This is a direct violation of the normative assumption that gender is an expression of some a priori sex category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891243212449902">Butler 1991</xref>). In this way, claims of gender as original or natural when embodied by nonlesbian individuals are brought into question: If anyone can perform masculinity, the claim that gender is divined from a preexisting sexed subject is untenable.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, however, these photographs continue the representation of marriage as a union predicated on gender difference, offering fodder for scholars who have asserted that same-sex marriage will perpetuate heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212449902">Duggan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891243212449902">Valverde 2006</xref>). In their enactment of marriage, the subjects assume the traditional trappings of the gendered subjectivities of marriage, from their clothing to their positioning in the frame to the items they hold. While the images may symbolically disrupt expectations of relationships between sex and gender, in conforming to marriage’s expectations of gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243212449902">Cott 2000</xref>), the subjects reify normative assumptions. The perpetuation of normative marital roles, despite the subjects’ nonnormative sexuality, portends what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891243212449902">Valverde (2006)</xref> describes as the advent of the “respectable same-sex couple,” a couple that is notably asexual and shares concerns about family and finances with members of mainstream culture.</p>

<title>Making Lesbian Sexuality Visible Through Marriage</title>

The cuing of these images to their marital context through signs denoting a wedding signals the lesbian sexuality of the subjects—they cannot be read as simply friends because marriage is premised on a sexual relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891243212449902">Goldfarb 1998</xref>).

<p>In the black-and-white <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0891243212449902">Figure 3</xref>, the gowned bride has long hair and wears an elegant white dress and makeup. She epitomizes a feminine bride. The second figure is dressed in a dark suit and collared shirt; she is a groom. The suited figure holds the waist of the gowned woman in an assertive manner while her bride gently lays her hand on the other’s suited forearm. In gesture and dress, the figure on the left signals masculinity while that on the right, femininity. However, the groom has long hair and her pose suggests breasts beneath her suit. Although they communicate signs of gender difference, they also communicate signs of gender similarity: Their hair and bodies are visibly similar, despite differences in attire and presentation.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891243212449902">Figure 4</xref>, the figure on the left wears a low-cut, white dress, jewelry, and a wrap. Her long hair falls around her shoulders in a soft, feminine way. Her partner wears a suit. Despite her groom’s clothing, the figure on the right is not masculine—she has long hair and shaped eyebrows, and wears a women’s-cut dress shirt. She mixes signs, visibly feminine in some ways but wearing a man’s suit and proudly displaying a garter—associated with bridal vestments—around her upper arm, its nontraditional and unconcealed placement perhaps suggesting it a trophy from her bride—a masculine behavior. The subjects display both gender difference and gender similarity, identifying them as a lesbian couple but with each embodying a distinct gender presentation.</p>
<p>There is no gender ambiguity in the figures in these two images and, for the most part, their gender presentation matches their presumed sex category. However, these images nonetheless challenge symbolic heteronormative gender assumptions, namely in the relationship of gender to sexuality. In marrying, and implying a long-term romantic and sexual relationship, these couples make a public commitment to a lesbian relationship and assert the permanence of same-sex relationships. They cannot be “rescued” from homosexuality, since marriage is intended to be a permanent union. It is important here that both partners are read as women; because of this reading, these images make (nonnormative) sexuality visible. When the masculine figure is read as a woman, the feminine figure can no longer be read as straight. The wedding context of these images forces the viewer to read the figures in relation to each other and subverts the assumption of heterosexuality for women who display normative gender.</p>
<p>As with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891243212449902">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891243212449902">2</xref>, there are limitations to the contestation these images represent when we focus on their enactment of the wedding ritual. Although these two photos depict weddings without oppositionally gendered participants, which may challenge the assumptions a heteronormative viewer would make, we should be cautious about presuming any larger effects of these presentations on the institution of marriage itself. While work by contemporary scholars suggests that some same-sex couples consciously remake the gendered meaning of marriage as they participate in the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212449902">Hull 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891243212449902">Nicol and Smith 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891243212449902">Smart 2008</xref>), research also shows that the participation of same-sex couples in marriage has little impact on different-sex marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212449902">Badgett 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Being Seen in Relation to One Another: The Visible Lesbian and the Rendered-Visible Lesbian</title>
<p>Taking a step back from these couples to consider the subjects as individuals, the four images may pose broader challenges to normative readings of women’s (and men’s) bodies that can be extended to the photographs that are not wedding normative (i.e., two brides or two grooms). Outside of a wedding setting, the symbolic consequences of these eight women’s gender performances are different. Of the two members of each of these couples, one is marked as a lesbian through her “mannish” appearance and the other is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212449902">Calhoun 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891243212449902">Walker 1993</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891243212449902">Rich (1986)</xref> argued, the butch is the only socially visible lesbian.</p>
<p>The photographs under consideration, however, are of <italic>couples</italic>, each member of which must be read in relation to the other. By citing the standard conventions of wedding photographs, these images mark their subjects as intimately related to each other; the presentation of the couples as married precludes possible misinterpretation of them as just “friends.” Regardless of how each would be read on her own, together, in images signaling weddings, both subjects signal lesbian sexuality. The ritual of the wedding explicitly couples the gender-normative woman with the non-gender-normative woman and makes visible her nonnormative sexuality: We have the visible lesbian and the <italic>rendered visible</italic> lesbian. Although outside of the couple, a femme’s gender and sex presentation may cause her to be read as heterosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891243212449902">Carolin and Bewley 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212449902">Halberstam 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0891243212449902">Whatling 1998</xref>)—indeed, the femme has been described as exceeding the categories of visibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891243212449902">Walker 1993</xref>)—the context of her marrying a woman marks her gender-normative body as lesbian. The combination of her nonnormative sexuality with her normative gender display disrupts heteronormative assumptions and complicates discursive assumptions about the readability of appearance and the obviousness of “difference.”</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier, the consequences of the ritual of the wedding for lesbian visibility are not limited to couples who display gender difference. Bride/bride pairs who may individually pass as straight would similarly be rendered visible in the context of a wedding. In marriage, it seems the butch is no longer the only visible lesbian. Moreover, this analysis could be extended to include gay men who present in gender-normative ways. Couples containing two grooms are identifiable as nonheterosexual, even if the members of that couple might otherwise be presumed straight.</p>
<p>Scholars have argued that the confusion over the proper category for the feminine lesbian is potent because it reveals the fluidity of boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891243212449902">Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891243212449902">Walker 1993</xref>). It is not just that presumed sexuality does not evenly line up with gender displays, but that these bodies occupy liminal spaces that exceed categorization, sometimes categorized by the viewer one way and sometimes another way. The signs of sex, gender, and sexuality become context-specific, upending belief in their immutability. If a viewer’s perceptions of sex, gender, and sexuality can change based on the subject’s context, they can no longer be taken as the expression of some foundational truth of the subject.</p>
<p>With (at least) two distinct gender presentations for lesbians, the women in these four images complicate assumptions about the causal relationship between sex and gender. The subjects are understood as sexually similar, but nonetheless present gender difference. Since sex is assumed to determine gender, the multiplicity of performed genders by members of a single sex undermines assumptions not only about how gender is expressed, but also about the “truth” of sex. Both the butch and the femme represent alternatives to normative womanliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212449902">Case 1988</xref>). Because lesbian women in these photographs are shown to perform more than one gender, this variation in gender performance can challenge the common assumption of a one-to-one relationship between sex and gender that is frequently read through sexuality. That is, while a heterosexual woman is assumed to have a certain sex (female) and sexuality (directed toward “sexual difference”), the observed dual combinations of characteristics for lesbian women—butch as masculine females who desire women, and femme as feminine females who desire women—immediately expand the field of possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212449902">Case 1988</xref>). The diversity of lesbian gender identification disrupts the heteronormative chain (female-feminine-desires masculine men) and exposes the arbitrary relations among sex, gender, and sexuality.</p>
<p>An additional consequence of the context of these photos is their implication of the permanence of this border-crossing, “mismatched” state of a gender-normative, woman-desiring woman. In commemorating a wedding, these images depict lesbian couples placing themselves permanently outside of normative gender and sexuality. Married couples make a commitment to each other that is intended for life. By marrying, lesbians refuse the possibility that this is a transitory stage. They will not be returned to a feminine gender and reeducated as to the proper (hetero)sexual object choice. The two figures are symbolically tied to each other, neither available to be reappropriated as heterosexual or into normative gender displays.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In contrast to the potent heteronormative wedding narrative of one woman bride and one man groom, in the images from the 2004 San Francisco same-sex weddings men grooms marry other men grooms, women brides marry other women brides, women grooms marry other women grooms, and women brides marry women grooms. The subjects of these photographs illustrate disconnects in the presumed symbolic linkage between sex, gender, and sexuality that undergirds heteronormativity: Some appear masculine but are “really” women; some would be presumed heterosexual but are “revealed” as lesbian. Whether they are read as “straight,” save for the fact that they’ve married a woman, or as “men,” the signs do not signal the assumed signifieds; there is no automatic, perfect linearity between sex, gender, and sexuality as social convention contends. These wedding photographs show that bodies can mix and match sex, gender, and sexuality categories. In contemporary society, the more visible nonnormative sexuality and the more varied gender displays, the less stable heteronormativity and social assumptions about essentialized sex, gender, and sexuality. Although some of the bodies in the photos (of both women and men) may signal heterosexuality when alone, when framed in the ritual of the wedding, and thus in relation to a partner of the same sex, the gender signs are exposed as failing to signify heterosexuality.</p>
<p>When we focus on the symbolic, images such as these have the potential to expose the arbitrary quality of normative presumptions of stable, a priori gender on a large scale. As drag performers have long shown, one body can perform more than one gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891243212449902">Butler 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891243212449902">Halberstam 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891243212449902">Rupp and Taylor 2003</xref>). Drag performances, however, remain marginalized. The San Francisco weddings, in contrast, blanketed the global media, bringing the diversity of gender performances by same-sex couples into the mainstream.</p>
<p>The consequences of this symbolic challenge to the heteronormative wedding script, however, are likely only modest when we think about the enactment of heteronormativity. These performed identities remain constrained by normative expectations of what—and who—constitutes a wedding. In order to signal their participation in marriage, even as they signal nonnormative sexualities, many of the subjects in the <italic>Chronicle</italic>’s online album participated at least partially in the discursive expectations of weddings. All of the men who dressed formally were grooms and most of the formally dressed women were brides. There was remarkably little deviation from the conventional bride and groom performances: Most men grooms wore dark suits and most women brides wore white dresses. This consistency with different-sex weddings suggests the persistence of enacted heteronormative gender standards in same-sex weddings.</p>
<p>In distinguishing the symbolic from the enacted, it is important to remember that this analysis does not include the perspectives of the subjects themselves. A fuller analysis of the gendered constraints participants felt would better flesh out the persistence of normativity. Among the many readings of these patterns, the subjects’ gender presentations could be understood as further evidence that it is easier for women to cross gender lines. Similarly, contextualizing these performances in light of the wedding division of labor that freights the bride’s identity with primary responsibility for the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212449902">Geller 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891243212449902">Howard 2006</xref>), we might see the absence of male brides as evidence that the labor of the bride role is undesirable. Another possible explanation for these patterns is that participants were concerned about projecting a “positive” image of the gay community and did not want to play into stereotypes of gay men as drag queens. Each of these speculations points to ways the enactment of same-sex marriage in practice may undo the marginalization of some gays and lesbians (i.e., “good gays”) while preserving or even exacerbating the marginalized status of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243212449902">Butler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212449902">Duggan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891243212449902">Walters 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The photographs thus present an odd puzzle. In depicting wedding normativity and wedding-normative gender presentations, they may challenge the symbolic heteronormative assumptions about the linkages between sex, gender, and sexuality. But they simultaneously can serve to reenact the heteronormative wedding narrative of a bride and a groom, or of women as brides and men as grooms. The relationship between challenges to the symbolic operation of heteronormativity and changes in the enactment of heteronormativity is unclear and merits future study. What is clear is that we cannot simply argue that same-sex marriage always challenges or never challenges heteronormativity. Instead, I have sought to unpack some of the ways in which, by their very citing of marital conventions, these images disrupt the symbolic work of normative assumptions about bodies and identity. I have aimed to provide a complement to work that has insisted on the nondisruptive consequences of gay marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212449902">Duggan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891243212449902">Valverde 2006</xref>). The visibility of gay and lesbian sexual identity via these photographs marks an important, if partial, challenge to heteronormativity as symbolically constructed.</p>

<p>Because of the unique circumstances of the San Francisco weddings wherein all elements of the wedding, from waiting in line for a license to the ceremony itself, occurred on the same day, I consider the photos from the line (as well as formally staged professional photographs) to be wedding portraits.</p>
