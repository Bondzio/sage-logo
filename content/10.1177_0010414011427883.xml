<abstract>
<p>This article explores how international sanctions affect authoritarian rulers’ decisions concerning repression and public spending composition. Rulers whose budgets are not severely constrained by sanctions will tend to increase spending in those categories that most benefit their core support groups. When budget constraints are severe, dictators are more likely to increase repression. Using data on regime types, public expenditures and spending composition (1970–2000) as well as on repression levels (1976–2001), I show that the empirical patterns conform well to the theoretical expectations. Single-party regimes, when targeted by sanctions, increase spending on subsidies and transfers which largely benefit their key constituencies. Likewise, military regimes increase their expenditures on goods and services, which include military equipment and soldiers’ and officers’ wages. Conversely, personalist regimes targeted by sanctions reduce spending in all categories and thus increase repression more than other autocracies.</p>

<p>Many studies have looked at why international sanctions seem more often to fail than to succeed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011427883">1</xref></sup> In this literature, governments are generally treated as actors interacting with foreign governments (or international organizations) that calculate the costs of sanction episodes and on this basis decide whether to make concessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414011427883">Drezner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414011427883">Lacy &amp; Niou, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414011427883">Tsebelis, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet governments targeted by sanctions also need to respond domestically to such episodes of pressure because this pressure may destabilize their rule by creating political costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011427883">Allen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011427883">Kaempfer, Lowenberg, &amp; Mertens, 2004</xref>). Hence, to fully understand the success or failure of sanctions, we need to explore whether target governments are able to react to foreign pressure and understand the political costs sanctions might inflict. This requires a close examination of the policy instruments of authoritarian rulers that help them cope with increased dissent and the likelihood of defections from their support coalition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011427883">Gershenson &amp; Grossman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, this article focuses on how dictators’ response to sanctions varies across authoritarian regime types. Repression is just one of potentially many policy options available to dictators to maintain regime stability. This article considers a range of policy options available to dictators by analyzing public spending and its composition as well as repression. Concretely, we argue that the relationship between sanctions and strategic responses is mediated by the regime type prevailing in the target country. We use data on regime types, public expenditures (1970–2000), and repression levels (1976–2001) to test the theoretical expectations. In short, the analysis finds that personalist rulers are the most likely to respond to sanctions with increased repression because of their inability to augment government spending. In contrast, single-party and military regimes are able to increase transfers to support groups and responding with not so much repression.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article proceeds as follows. The second section briefly reviews the literature on the survival of authoritarian regimes. The third section discusses the differences between regime types. The fourth section develops a simple framework to help explain the options available to dictators when they are targeted by sanctions and the possible scenarios these coercive episodes generate concerning public revenues. The fifth section describes the variables, data, and method employed in this study. In the sixth section we present and discuss the results of the empirical analyses. The final section summarizes the main findings.</p>

<title>Authoritarian Regimes and Survival</title>
<p>Dictatorships are often viewed as political regimes where repression is the main means of retaining power. Yet recent contributions to the study of political survival under authoritarian rule have stressed that two strategies actually coexist in equilibrium: repression and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011427883">Ames, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011427883">Dallin &amp; Breslauer, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011427883">Desai, Olofsgård, &amp; Yousef, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011427883">Gandhi &amp; Przeworski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011427883">Gershenson &amp; Grossman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011427883">Wintrobe, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011427883">2</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011427883">Wintrobe (1998)</xref>, “The dictator who wishes to remain in office therefore faces a trade-off between these two alternatives” (p. 46). The building of a support coalition and the co-optation of potential challengers are thus as important as the use of coercion. “Dictatorial regimes are therefore said to rely on an ‘authoritarian bargain’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011427883">Desai et al., 2009</xref>, p. 93).</p>
<p>Such a bargain is based on the delivery of different types of goods to elites and citizens depending on the need for loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011427883">Bueno de Mesquita, Morrow, Siverson, &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>) as well as on the granting of policy concessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414011427883">Gibson &amp; Hoffman, 2002</xref>). In other words, “the executive tries to determine the mix of budgetary trade-offs that will maximize support” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011427883">Ames, 1987</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>The size of the support coalition depends on the availability of rents and the strength of the initial opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011427883">Gandhi &amp; Przeworski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414011427883">Smith, 2005</xref>). As the size of the power coalition varies, so does the nature of the benefits distributed, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011427883">Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003)</xref>. Specifically, these authors distinguish between private and public goods to account for leaders’ political survival. Private goods (such as access to graft, targeted transfers, and patronage) are allocated to members of the elite when it is relatively small, whereas public goods (public policies) are delivered to all citizens or to a broad cross section of them as the coalition expands. As the size of the coalition expands, the per unit cost of providing a public, nonexcludable good falls relative to the cost of providing an excludable, private good.</p>
<p>A rent-delivery strategy is more easily pursued when resources that do not require costly extraction or citizens’ cooperation (e.g., income taxes) abound. Accordingly, there is evidence that natural resource endowments and other windfalls lengthen the duration of authoritarian regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011427883">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414011427883">Ulfelder, 2007</xref>). When such windfalls are not available, dictators are more likely to use seemingly democratic institutions to co-opt and then mobilize support of opposition groups by offering them limited political influence and representation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011427883">Gandhi and Przeworski (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414011427883">2007)</xref> argue that providing credible policy concessions requires a formal institutional setting. The availability of rents thus reduces the likelihood of standing up to formal political institutions such as legislatures and allowing opposition parties. Furthermore, they show that the number of parties within a legislature increases the longevity of dictators’ tenure in power.</p>

<title>Regimes, Elites, and Support Groups</title>
<p>In this article I use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011427883">Geddes’s (1999)</xref> classification of authoritarian regimes, which distinguishes personalist, single-party, and military regimes. In her own words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Different kinds of authoritarianism differ from each other as much as they differ from democracy. Their leaders emerge from different groups and via different selection processes. They rely on different segments of society for support. They have different procedures for making decisions, and different interest groups influence policies. Intra-elite factionalism and competition take different forms in different kinds of dictatorship, and consequently succession occurs in different ways. They deal with ordinary citizens and opposition in different ways. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011427883">Geddes, 2004</xref>, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Personalist regimes include well-known cases like Mobutu’s rule in former Zaire, Trujillo’s regime in the Dominican Republic, Etienne Eyadema’s regime in Togo, and Hastings Banda’s regime in Malawi. Single-party regimes include, for example, the PRI regime in Mexico, East European socialist systems, Guinea under the Democratic Party of Guinea, Kenya under the KANU, and Tunisia under the Socialist Destourian Party (now called the Constitutional Democratic Rally). Finally, examples of military regime include Argentina’s repressive juntas in the late 1960s and 1970s, Brazil’s governments in the 1960s and 1970s, and Park Chung-Hee’s regime in South Korea.</p>
<p>Military regimes stand apart from other autocracies “because most officers value the unity and capacity of the military institution more than they value holding office, they cling less tightly to power than do office holders in other forms of authoritarianism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011427883">Geddes, 2004</xref>, p. 26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414011427883">3</xref></sup> Geddes codes military regimes using questions concerning whether the military hierarchy has been maintained, how policy is made, and rules for leadership succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414011427883">Geddes, 2003</xref>). A military ruler, according to this definition, is more than an effective head of state who was once a member of the military.</p>
<p>Conversely, in single-party regimes all factions within the regime have incentives to cooperate with the aim of remaining in office. Furthermore, party organizations, as noted above, provide party members with a durable framework in which to resolve differences, bargain, and advance their influence. As a result, dominant party systems generate and maintain a cohesive leadership cadre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011427883">Brownlee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414011427883">Smith, 2005</xref>). Under personalist regimes, rival factions will remain loyal only if the payoff from supporting the ruler exceeds the expected benefits of risky opposition, since “in contrast to single-party regimes, the leader’s faction in a personalist regime may actually increase benefits to itself by excluding the rival faction from participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011427883">Geddes, 2004</xref>, p. 14).</p>
<p>The reliance on different coalitions for support is likely to shape the public spending priorities of each type of regime. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011427883">Ames (1987)</xref> emphasizes, “Political survival must be actively pursued by manipulating public policy to construct support coalitions. Public expenditures are central to survival coalitions” (p. 7). Military regimes care principally about the cohesiveness and status of the armed forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011427883">Geddes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414011427883">Nordlinger, 1977</xref>). Holding the coalition together involves, in this case, serving the corporate interests of the army by, fundamentally, keeping the military budget high, paying decent wages to officers, and getting good state-of-the-art military equipment, in other words, devoting a significant amount of public resources to goods and services or military expenditures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011427883">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Single-party regimes have larger winning coalitions and are hence more prone the deliver public goods to their key constituencies. The party organization claims to represent the will of the people or of some broad section of the society. “This claim renders single-party regimes vulnerable to contentious collective action because virtually any mass mobilization can be construed as a blow to the legitimacy of the regime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011427883">Ulfelder, 2005</xref>, p. 317). The emergence of such regimes, often endorsing socialism, usually means the expansion of public services and redistributive transfers, which tend to favor the urban classes. Indeed, single-party systems is the regime type that devotes the highest percentage of its expenditures to subsidies and transfers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011427883">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under personalism, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414011427883">Jackson and Rosberg (1984)</xref>, “the system favours the ruler and his allies and clients: its essential activity involves gaining access to a personal regime’s patronage or displacing the ruler and perhaps his regime and installing another” (p. 424). The support group in this case composes a reduced set of individuals with family, ethnic, or clan ties to the leader. A combination of rent distribution and rotation characterizes the maintenance of a steady degree of loyalty from within the elites aimed at thwarting putsches and plots. This logic of buying support through patronage renders rulers dependent on the capture of windfalls and the fungibility of foreign aid so that they can be used to fund government consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414011427883">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Responses to Economic Coercion</title>
<p>Economic sanctions consist of the imposition of coercive measures with the aim of bringing about a policy or institutional change in the target country or of destabilizing the incumbent regime. Most of the targets of such measures have been authoritarian governments. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011427883">Kaempfer et al. (2004)</xref> find that in 2001, 85% of U.S. unilateral sanction targets were countries rated by Freedom House as “not free” or “partly free.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011427883">Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg’s (2007)</xref> data, in the postwar period, almost half of the target countries were autocracies, 47.8%, and 25.5% were coded as anocracies.</p>
<p>Much of the literature on the effectiveness of sanctions finds the costs to the target to be one of the main determinants of the success of sanction episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011427883">Dashti-Gibson, Davis, &amp; Radcliff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011427883">Drury, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011427883">Hufbauer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414011427883">Nooruddin, 2002</xref>). Theoretical contributions from the public choice approach have added relevant insights to this general finding by paying closer attention to cost allocation and the political economy of political support. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011427883">Kaempfer and Lowenberg (1988)</xref> argue that “the sanctions which are most likely to precipitate the desired political change in the target country are those which concentrate income losses on groups benefiting from the target government’s policy” (p. 792). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011427883">Kirshner (1997)</xref> claims that for sanctions to be effective they should target either the central government or the core groups whose support is essential for the regime to remain in power. In this article, we explore some of the conditions under which these two latter claims might be true. The first question to be answered, then, is the following: Which leaders or regimes are the most sensitive to external revenue losses? And second, how do they react given such constraints?</p>
<p>Concerning the consequences of sanctions under nondemocracy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011427883">Kaempfer et al. (2004)</xref>, departing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011427883">Wintrobe’s (1998)</xref> well-known model, assume that sanctions make the dictator’s budget expand (as he or she is able to capture the rents associated with trade restrictions) and hence focus on the effect of sanctions on the level of opposition to the regime. According to Kaempfer and coauthors, if sanctions increase the capacity of the opposition, they may reduce the budget of the dictator and increase the price of repression. Increasing the price of repression means that it is more costly for the dictator to pursue repression against the opposition as a means of increasing his or her power. If in addition the price of loyalty rises, the power of the dictator will be reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414011427883">7</xref></sup> However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011427883">Kaempfer et al. (2004)</xref> do not take into account the proactive response that dictator may give in reaction to the alteration in the prices of loyalty and repression. In a much simpler setting that considers the effect of foreign pressure on the elite’s probability of remaining in power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011427883">Gershenson and Grossman (2001)</xref> do so and claim that an increase in such pressure would (ideally) lead the ruling elite to raise the levels of both repression and co-optation as an optimal response. In this article I explore the extent to which different regime types adjust to this “ideal” response.</p>
<p>We assume that dictators are rational and self-interested actors who want to maximize their probability of remaining in power. The optimal response, then, to sanctions will largely vary according to the regimes’ capacity to vary the levels of loyalty (transfers and concessions) and repression in reaction to variation in their respective prices and subject to budgetary constraints. The amount of goods and repression delivered will initially depend on the level of support the government perceives it enjoys. Sanctions may diminish such support, so without a response from the regime the new situation would involve a decrease in the leaders’ security or stability levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011427883">Marinov, 2005</xref>). There exist two key reasons that explain the rise in the prices of loyalty and repression because of economic coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011427883">Wood, 2008</xref>). First, sanctions may increase the likelihood of defection of members of the support coalition. Furthermore, sanctions may boost public dissent and strengthen internal opposition groups.</p>
<p>With regard to members of the support coalition, sanctions may make their loyalty more expensive, meaning autocrats must deliver more goods to get a similar amount of support than before sanctions were imposed. The reasons behind this process are various. First, economic coercion may induce a change in the preferences of key actors and the distribution of power within the regime, provoking, as a result, defections from the ruling coalition and the realignment of other supporting groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414011427883">Gleditsch &amp; Ward, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414011427883">Olson, 1979</xref>). According to this logic, economic hardship caused by sanctions may harm the economic interests of some coalition members. To compensate, transfers must be increased to elite coalition members to make them desist from backing a potential challenger. Second, sanctions may reduce the expected long-run benefits of political support for the incumbent regime. Doubts are likely to emerge concerning the regime’s institutional stability and its future capacity to deliver rents and perks. Increased uncertainty about regime stability and future benefits reduces the expected utility of supporting the incumbent ruler, especially in those regimes with weak institutions that cannot credibly commit to future concessions. For example, coffee exports were essential for Idi Amin’s survival in power because they were the main source of foreign exchange used to pay his support coalition and the army. Those exports were controlled by the government-owned Coffee Marketing Board, providing it with foreign exchange. The trade ban signed by President Carter in October 1978 weakened Amin’s regime as it cut the flow of rents accruing to the regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011427883">Nurnberger, 2003</xref>). Restrictions to sugar exports applied in the early 1960s weakened Trujillo’s regime in the Dominican Republic and fostered elite divisions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011427883">Kirshner, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, some “dictators are often dependent on foreign patrons, who supply critical military aid and material resources that can help fuel their domestic patronage networks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414011427883">Snyder, 1998</xref>, p. 58). Dependence on foreign economic and military support renders some regimes particularly vulnerable once this aid is cut, as the cases of Malawi and Zaire under Hastings Banda and Mobutu Sese Seko, respectively, suggest.</p>
<p>Some important studies take for granted the possibility that scarcity and changes in the terms of trade resulting from sanctions can generate rents that dictators are able to capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011427883">Kaempfer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011427883">Lektzian &amp; Souva, 2007</xref>). If that is the case, sanctions could potentially improve all autocratic rulers’ capacity to buy off political support and so increase expenditures. Again, though, homogeneity across regime types is generally assumed. However, this general assumption may rely too much on the Iraqi case during the 1990s, when, according to the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) into the UN Oil-for-Food Programme (OFFP), Hussein’s regime managed to earn more than $11 billion from illicit oil sales during 1990–2003. An estimated $1.8 billion was earned from kickbacks and surcharges on OFFP contracts and sales. Yet this case appears to be exceptional. Both financial sanctions and trade restrictions affect some of the principal sources of revenue and windfalls of authoritarian regimes, namely, foreign aid, taxes on international trade, and nontax revenues, which commonly serve to fund some rulers’ patronage networks. Personalist regimes are extremely dependent on a few revenue streams for which there is no easy substitute in the short term (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427883">Figure 1</xref> below). This reliance on external revenue is generally associated with reduced state capacity and reduced tax efforts, which stem from the lack of an “institution-building stimulus provided by the revenue imperative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011427883">Bräutigam, 2008</xref>, p. 1). The absence of an effective and broad administration may prevent personalist governments from benefiting from sanctions through rent capture. In the empirical section, we first examine whether personalist regimes are more constrained by economic coercion than other autocracies.</p>

</fig>
<p>In sum, the optimal response to foreign pressure will be conditioned by how constraining sanctions are. If sanctions do not cause important revenue losses, the optimal response should be to increase patronage or transfers to the regime’s key constituencies (Hypothesis 1), following the patterns outlined in the previous section. In contrast, if sanction episodes translate into a sharp decrease in revenues, as is expected to happen under personalist regimes, then the amount of transfers that the ruler can provide his or her supporters through the use of public expenditures will substantially shrink.</p>
<p>Sanctions may also embolden opposition groups and the general public and spur popular dissent. First, sanctions can be interpreted as a signal that foreign countries back the opposition’s demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414011427883">Kaempfer &amp; Lowenberg, 1992</xref>). In turn, the withdraw of foreign backing from a dictator can increase public support for the opposition and strengthen opposition groups’ resolve to continue organizing and challenging the incumbent regime as well as increase their power relative to the regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011427883">Wood, 2008</xref>). Second, it is less likely, but still possible, that opposition groups may benefit from sanctions through cross-border smuggling and black markets. Yet the main mechanism for fostering opposition to the regime and social dissent is generally thought to be economic deprivation. It is well known that some sanction episodes have had important humanitarian impacts on the target countries’ populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011427883">Weiss, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414011427883">Weiss, Cortright, Lopez, &amp; Minear, 1997</xref>). Economic scarcity caused by foreign coercion creates grievances, which may spur collective action and political contestation against the incumbent regime because of increased poverty, inflation, and inequality, especially as dictators try to shift the economic costs of sanctions away from their core supporting elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011427883">Allen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011427883">Brooks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414011427883">Niblock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414011427883">Rowe, 2001</xref>). For example, in Haiti inflation increased by 138% under sanctions, and employment in the manufacturing sector severely decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011427883">Gibbons, 1999</xref>). In Nepal, sanctions were imposed by India in the late 1980s in response to King Birendra’s arms purchases from China. The embargo hurt the population, and riots rapidly spread. Eventually, the mobilization of prodemocratic forces lead the king to legalize political parties, and a new transitional government was appointed.</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011427883">Allen (2008)</xref> shows that sanctions boost antigovernment activity in the target countries, especially under more democratic settings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414011427883">8</xref></sup> Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011427883">Peksen (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011427883">Wood (2008)</xref> find that sanctions lead governments to commit more human rights violations and to increase repression to suppress those threats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414011427883">9</xref></sup> However, although Peksen does not consider any possible variation across political regimes (democracy vs. dictatorship), in Wood’s contribution the interaction between regime types and the sanctions dummy adds little information, as levels of repression are found to increase only slightly—and not significantly—more under dictatorships. However, this research does not distinguish between authoritarian regime types.</p>
<p>Faced with increased public dissent and opposition activity, authoritarian governments are likely to employ more repression since “repression is variable in the short as well as the long-run” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011427883">Wintrobe, 1998</xref>, p. 47), whereas loyalty is fixed in the short term. However, the possible increase in repression will be conditioned by the availability of rents because of the trade-off relationship existing between loyalty and repression, as stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011427883">Wintrobe (1998)</xref>. More repression will be delivered when the autocrats’ ability to distribute resources to coalition members is negatively affected by sanctions than in those regimes for which sanctions do not constrain revenue sources. In sum, a decrease in public expenditures will be accompanied by a substantial rise in repression levels (Hypothesis 2). We expect this latter pattern to be found in personalist regimes targeted by sanctions.</p>

<title>Revenue Losses: Aid and Trade</title>
<p>Sanction episodes translate into the disruption of financial and commercial flows between the sanctioning countries and the target country. In this section we explore whether these costs differ across regime types.</p>
<p>The conditional nature of our hypotheses requires interactions between sanctions and authoritarian regime type. We use a dichotomous indicator of sanctions. The variable is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011427883">Marinov’s (2005)</xref> update of the data developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011427883">Hufbauer et al. (2007)</xref> and can have two values: 1 if a country has been targeted by economic sanctions in a given year, 0 if not. The sanctions variable is lagged by 1 year to ensure that the sanction is causally prior to the dependent variable. For dictatorial regimes, we use the typology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011427883">Geddes (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011427883">2004)</xref>, which has been recently extended and updated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011427883">Wright (2008)</xref>. We grouped the different regimes into three basic categories. First, we grouped monarchic and personalist regimes into a sole category named “personalist.” The second category is “single party” and comprises pure single-party types, single-party and personalist hybrids, single-party and military hybrids, and “triple threat” regimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414011427883">10</xref></sup> Finally, the third category comprises military and military–personalist regimes.</p>
<p>Our dependent variables are the two main sources of external revenue normally affected by sanctions: foreign aid and trade. Aid is measured in dollars per capita and is taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period 1960–2000. Trade, which is measured as the sum of imports and exports as a percentage of GDP, covers the period 1960–2000 and is also taken from the WDI. Both variables have been logged.</p>
<p>Control variables include the dependent variable lagged one year; oil and gas rents from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414011427883">Ross (2008)</xref>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414011427883">11</xref></sup> GDP per capita (logged) and total population (logged) from WDI and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414011427883">Maddison (2006)</xref>, respectively; a cold war period dummy; the share of countries with capitol cities within 2,000 km of the target country that are democracies (average Polity index), and a war dummy indicating the presence of conflict as coded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011427883">Strand et al. (2005)</xref> at the International Peace Research Institute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414011427883">12</xref></sup> For the aid models, we have also included one extra control: a measure of how often the recipient country votes with the United States in the UN General Assembly (US_agree), taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011427883">Lebovic and Voeten (2009)</xref>. Coefficients are estimated using fixed-effects panel data models including a 1-year lag of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>The top panel in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011427883">Table 1</xref> reports the coefficients for the sanction variable and the linear combination of the coefficients for sanction and its interaction with each regime type dummy. For example, the coefficient of sanctions in single-party regimes is actually β<sub>SANCTION</sub>+β<sub>SANCTION×SINGLE-PARTY</sub>.The coefficient for personalist is simply the coefficient β<sub>SANCTION</sub>,which represents the marginal effect of sanctions on per capita aid and trade for the excluded category: personalist regimes. The coefficients reported in the top panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011427883">Table 1</xref> can therefore be interpreted as the marginal effect of sanctions in each regime type. The bottom panel reports the percentage change in aid per capita that sanctions produce in each regime type according to our estimates. Percentage change is calculated using 100×(<italic>e</italic><sup>β</sup>−1), where β is the coefficient for sanction in each regime. As a robustness check, the percentage change is also calculated using an alternative but similar transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414011427883">13</xref></sup> The full results of the regression are reported in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414011427883">appendix</xref>.</p>

<p>The results clearly show that the impact of sanctions is concentrated principally in personalist regimes and to some extent in military regimes. According to the estimates, the largest decreases in aid and trade are concentrated among personalist regimes, as their reliance on a few primary commodity exports and external funds makes them particularly vulnerable. Aid falls by 19% to 20% in targeted countries with personalist regimes, whereas sanctions reduce trade by almost 5%. Military regimes also suffer trade decreases (by 5% too) when targeted by sanctions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427883">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this point by showing the average of the main components of public revenues as a percentage of GDP when the country is and is not under economic coercion for each regime type.</p>
<p>Sanctions translate into much sharper budget constraints when targeting personalist regimes because they affect their three main revenue streams (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011427883">Figure 1a</xref>): aid, nontax revenues, and taxes on international trade. In contrast, single-party and military regimes are better able to shift fiscal pressure from one stream to another, so minimizing or canceling out the impact of the cuts in some resource flows caused by sanctions. In particular, this descriptive evidence suggests that the two regime types increase their nontax revenues and taxes on goods and services. In light of this evidence, we might expect sanctions to be associated with significant decreases in public spending in personalist regimes (and to a lesser extent in military regimes). At the same time, sanctions should increase repression more in personalist regimes than in the other two types.</p>

<sec id="section6-0010414011427883">
<title>Dictatorial Responses: Expenditures and Repression</title>
<p>We test our set of hypotheses concerning authoritarian responses using a data set that contains information on sanctions, public expenditure composition, and repression. The data on spending cover about 70 countries for the period 1970–2000, whereas the data on repression cover almost 90 countries for the period 1976–2001. The unit of analysis is the country-year in both cases.</p>
<p>In our analyses of buying off loyalty and co-optation policy, we use data on public spending composition from the World Bank’s WDI. Concretely, the three categories of spending (all as percentages of GDP) are (a) capital expenditures, which include capital grants and spending to acquire fixed capital assets, land, intangible assets, government stocks, and nonmilitary, nonfinancial assets; (b) subsidies and transfers, which include transfer payments to individuals (such as pensions and welfare) and subsidies to private and public enterprises; and (c) expenditures on goods and services, which include all government payments in exchange for goods and services including wages and salaries to employees. We also use a measure of total government expenditures as a percentage of the GDP.</p>
<p>Data on repression come from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011427883">Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui (2007)</xref>, who combine information from different existing political terror scales originally collected by Gibney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011427883">Gibney &amp; Dalton, 1996</xref>). The scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum level of state violations of physical integrity rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414011427883">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our main independent variables are those detailed above: sanctions, regime types, and their interaction. The control variables for the models on public expenditures are as follows. To capture the social structure of the country and the demands of the domestic population, we include the percentage of the total population living in urban areas and the age dependency ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414011427883">15</xref></sup> Log GDP per capita captures development and state capacity. Windfall availability and the potential presence of rentier economies are captured by the yearly amount of per capita oil rents using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414011427883">Ross’s (2008)</xref> measure. Current revenue as a percentage of GDP controls for fiscal constraints and scale effects. Finally, we include trade openness (sum of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP) and foreign aid per capita.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414011427883">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the repression models, the control variables follow the specifications found in previous articles containing multivariate analyses of human rights violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011427883">Davenport, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414011427883">Poe &amp; Tate, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011427883">Poe, Tate, &amp; Keith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011427883">Wood, 2008</xref>): log of total population size, the percentage of urban population, the log of GDP per capita, and the rate of economic growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0010414011427883">17</xref></sup> Growth and development may represent a source of loyalty toward the regime; if so, higher GDP should be associated with lower levels of repression. To proxy for the social factors, we include an index of ethno-linguistic fractionalization and the percentage of Muslims living in the country. A dummy for the cold war period (coded 1 for all years prior to 1991) controls for the cold war policy of tolerance toward many repressive regimes because of strategic concerns and alignments. The new emphasis of the United States and other Western countries after the end of the cold war on human rights protection and democratization may have changed the incentives of authoritarian rulers to repress dissent. Yet, as some argue, it is precisely this international environment that may have led most dictatorial regimes to increase repression as foreign pressure for liberalization has abruptly increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0010414011427883">18</xref></sup> We also include a dummy variable coded 1 for every year for countries that became independent after 1945, 0 otherwise. Again, external dependence is captured by foreign aid per capita and trade openness, so they in a way help to control for the prior financial and commercial linkages with other countries. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011427883">Wood (2008)</xref>, we use a 2-year lag of these two variables to avoid autocorrelation with the lagged sanctions measure. Finally, we control for the presence of internationalized internal, just internal, or interstate conflict using the International Peace Research Institute’s conflict data set (Version 3-2005).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0010414011427883">19</xref></sup> Wars constitute an important threat to regime stability, so it is likely that the regime responds with further repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011427883">Poe et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The methodology adopted for the models on spending consists of a fixed-effects panel data estimator to control for unobserved heterogeneity. To address serial correlation we have run error correction models (ECMs), which can better deal with the dynamic structure of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011427883">De Boef &amp; Keele, 2008</xref>). A common and concise way to report the results from ECMs is to calculate the total effect distributed over all time periods using the Bewley transformation, which allows estimating the long-run multiplier and its standard error. The model thus estimated has the following structure:</p>

<p>The coefficient of the sanctions dummy indicates the effect of sanctions under personalist regimes (the reference category). Regarding the other two regime types, in the bottom rows of the table we report the marginal effect of sanctions and its level of statistical significance, if any. That is, we report the coefficient for the linear combination of Sanction + Regime Type<italic><sub>r</sub></italic> × Sanction, where <italic>r</italic> = (Single Party; Military). This gives us a coefficient estimate of the marginal effect of the sanctions dummy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0010414011427883">20</xref></sup> Note that for personalist regimes, the marginal effect equals the coefficient of the sanctions dummy.</p>
<p>The results are consistent with the proposed hypotheses. In short, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011427883">Table 2</xref> calls forth the following stylized patterns. First, most of the cuts induced by sanctions are concentrated in the capital expenditures category, especially under personalist regimes. When survival is at stake, developmental concerns are left aside in the event of binding budget constraints. This pattern has also been observed when other types of constraint are binding in less developed countries, such as economic crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414011427883">Van de Walle, 2001</xref>) or increasing debt burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414011427883">Mahdavi, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0010414011427883">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, economic sanctions are related to a severe retrenchment of the public sector in personalist regimes, and a small—though not significant—one in military regimes. Personalist regimes targeted by sanctions decrease their public expenditures by more than 4 percentage points, mainly as a result of the severe cuts in their main sources of revenue that sanctions bring about, as shown above.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0010414011427883">22</xref></sup> This translates into important cuts in all spending categories (Models 1–3) that harm the capacity of these regimes to deliver goods to their key constituencies. In contrast, single-party and military regimes tend to significantly increase public expenditures on some specific categories, thereby benefiting their main support groups and thus negating the destabilizing effect of an increase in the price of loyalty brought on by sanctions. As noted above, single-party systems are the most likely to break down in the wake of contentious collective action (particularly strikes and antiregime demonstrations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011427883">Ulfelder, 2005</xref>). It makes sense, then, that single-party regimes, fearing that sanctions may unleash waves of mass dissent, choose to increase redistribution and spending that favor a substantial segment of the public. As the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011427883">Table 2</xref> shows, sanctions indeed lead to a substantial increase in the resources single-party regimes devote to subsidies and transfers.</p>
<p>Spending can help leaders buy support from the military as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011427883">Collier &amp; Hoeffler, 2007</xref>). Under military regimes, spending on goods and services significantly increases when the country is targeted by sanctions. To further explore this pattern, we test two models using spending on wages and salaries, and military expenditures as dependent variables (both as percentages of GDP).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0010414011427883">23</xref></sup> The method employed is again an IV-GMM model using the Bewley transformation. Unfortunately, for military expenditures the series starts in 1988, so one should be cautious when interpreting the results given the limited number of observations. For the wages model, we use the same pool of control variables as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011427883">Table 2</xref>. For military expenditures, we log the variable to minimize the effect of outliers. We include logged population as a control. To control for the possibility that war increased military expenditures, we include a measure of the intensity of any conflict in which the country may be involved. This is an ordinal variable from N. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011427883">Gleditsch, Wallensteen, Eriksson, Sollenberg, and Strand (2002)</xref> that delineates three levels of conflict intensity: minor conflict (&lt; 25 deaths/year), intermediate conflict (&lt; 1,000 deaths/year), and war (&gt; 1,000 deaths/year). As in the other models, we also control for foreign aid, trade openness, GDP per capita, and the amount of oil rents accruing to the regime.</p>
<p>The results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011427883">Table 3</xref>. The patterns previously identified hold for both variables despite the variation in the number of observations and different sets of controls. Again, the bottom rows report the net effect of sanctions for each regime and its level of significance. The effect of economic sanctions on wages and salaries and on military expenditures under military regimes is positive and significant.</p>

<p>Our hypothesis concerning the link between sanctions and repression argues that those regimes whose capacity to deliver goods and co-opt is most hurt by economic sanctions because of decreased revenues will increase repression the most (Hypothesis 2).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414011427883">Table 4</xref> reports the results of the ordered logit estimates of repression models. Model 1 excludes the interaction between the sanctions dummy and the regime type.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0010414011427883">24</xref></sup> Model 2 incorporates this interaction. In the third model, we include a 1-year lag instead of the 2-year lag for the variables measuring aid and trade. The first model indicates that sanctions have a strong and positive effect on repression levels. Once the interaction terms are added, we can see that there exist significant differences between regimes. Again, in the bottom panel we report the coefficients for the sanction variable and the linear combination of the coefficients for sanction and its interaction with each regime type dummy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0010414011427883">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>As predicted, the highest increases in repression are found in personalist regimes. The effect of sanctions more than doubles under personal rule compared to single-party rule and is 3 (Model 3) to 4 (Model 2) times larger than under military systems. According to the results in Model 2, sanctions are associated with a sharp increase in the probability of repression levels under personalist rule. For example, the probability of repression being at Level 3 increases from .60 to .62 when sanctions are imposed, that of being at Level 4 from .09 to .23, and that of being at the maximum Level 5 from .007 to .02, whereas the likelihood of repression being at its lowest two levels (1 and 2) decreases. Thus, when the sanctions dummy changes from 0 to 1, the likelihood of the repression level being 2 shrinks from .28 to just .11.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0010414011427883">26</xref></sup> An example from Togo, governed from 1967 to 2005 by Eyadema’s personalist regimes, illustrates this impact. With the aim of improving the human rights situation and fostering regime liberalization in Togo, the European Community, France, Germany, and the United States suspended aid to the country in the early 1990s. The annual average cost of these sanctions amounted to about $57 million, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011427883">Hufbauer et al. (2007)</xref>. Aid as a percentage of Togo’s gross national income quickly shrank from more than 13% in 1992 to about 8% in 1993. Tax revenues, being extremely dependent on taxes on international trade, sharply decreased too, so the regime found it more and more difficult to buy off the support of core groups. Consequently, in 1993 repression levels increased rapidly (from 2 to 4). Repression declined after France decided to resume aid to Togo in 1994 but doubled again after aid levels fell again in 1997–1998. In contrast, the imposition of sanctions did not cause a dramatic increase in repression levels in Chile under Pinochet’s rule or in Burma under Saw Maung and Than Shwe.</p>
<p>The increases in repression under the other two types of regime are much more moderate and still statistically significant for single-party regimes. The estimates on Model 2 suggest that the likelihood of Level 3 repression increases from .58 to .63 and that of Level 4 repression rises from .08 to .11. Average repression levels are already substantially higher under military regimes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0010414011427883">27</xref></sup> so sanctions do not produce a considerable push in this case (the joint effect is not statistically significant; see the bottom row).</p>
<p>The inclusion of the 1-year lags of aid and trade instead of the 2-year lags does not affect the results. In this specification, apart from the significant and negative effect of trade on repression—which echoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414011427883">Hafner-Burton’s (2005)</xref> previous findings—we also observe that the effect of sanctions under single-party and military regimes is slightly stronger than in Model 2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0010414011427883">28</xref></sup> The coefficients for the other control variables are similar to those reported in other comparative studies of repression and human rights violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011427883">Davenport, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011427883">Davenport &amp; Armstrong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011427883">Poe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414011427883">Poe &amp; Tate, 1994</xref>). Wars increase repression, particularly those that begin as internal conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0010414011427883">29</xref></sup> The size of the country’s population is also an important determinant of political terror. Regime type is also found to matter; on average, military regimes rely more on terror than the other two forms of authoritarianism, and single-party regimes are less repressive than other dictatorships, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011427883">Davenport’s (2007)</xref> findings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0010414011427883">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, the results offered so far conform well to our proposed hypotheses. Thus, the highest increases in repression levels are found in those regimes whose capacity to buy support is most harmed by the imposition of sanctions: personalist regimes. Such a “brutal” response might thus best be understood as a last resort for personalist leaders targeted by sanctions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that any difference observed between broader regime categories (i.e., democracies vs. dictatorships) in repression levels as a response to sanctions is mainly driven by the strong effect of sanctions in personalist regimes and to a lesser extent in single-party regimes.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Sanctions are probably the most widely known form of foreign pressure. Sanction-sending countries seek to generate a policy or institutional change in the targeted countries by imposing economic costs on them. However, authoritarian rulers may modify their levels of expenditures and of repression when targeted to retain power. These reactions depend on the type of regime and the extent to which sanctions hurt revenue streams in targeted countries.</p>
<p>Using data on public spending, spending composition, and repression, this article finds that there are significant differences across regimes in the strategies adopted in response to the economic constraints and political challenges posed by economic sanctions. I find that sanctions are related to sharp reductions in the amount of public spending under personalist regimes, which are precisely those regimes whose revenue sources (aid and trade) are most damaged by external coercive measures. Unable to continue bribing and rewarding his or her key supporters, the only option left for this type of dictator is to substantially increase repression levels to contain threats both from within and from outside the supporting coalition.</p>
<p>Targeted single-party regimes increase the amount of goods delivered to their support groups. This means that these regimes, which typically rely on support from broad sectors of the society, increase the share of public resources devoted to subsidies and transfers. At the same time, sanctions increase repression, but to a smaller extent than under personalist regimes. Finally, targeted military regimes show a different pattern: They increase expenditures on goods and services, which in turn translate to higher wages and salaries and higher military spending. Yet these regimes increase repression levels only slightly (and not significantly).</p>
<p>Are these responses useful? Previous research has already pointed that sanctions are less effective when targeting dictatorships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011427883">Lektzian &amp; Souva, 2007</xref>). According to the evidence reported here though, policy makers should think about how sanctions affect survival strategies in different types of authoritarian regimes. Governments and international authorities should pay attention to whether target regimes have room to maneuver. The findings in the present study suggest that sanctions would be more effective in destabilizing and bringing about policy change in personalist regimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011427883">Escribà-Folch and Wright (2010)</xref> find that in fact sanctions are associated with greater ruler instability only in personalist regimes, whereas they are largely ineffective for destabilizing leaders in single-party and military regimes. This reveals that the costs imposed by sanctions on the patronage resources available to personalist rulers affect their prospects of retaining power because relying principally on repression to secure survival may be risky.</p>
<p>One issue for future research that is missing from the present analysis is leaders’ perceptions. Any response to sanctions is necessarily preceded by the targeted rulers’ perception that the new situation is potentially threatening; otherwise there may be no response or simply a mild one. Pushing this question further, we need to better understand the conditions under which authoritarian rulers are able to effectively mobilize a rally effect. Sanction-sending governments and international organizations should have a better understanding of the domestic and international factors that determine when sanctions are likely to actually hurt, rather than benefit, the targeted dictator.</p>

<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011427883">Collier and Hoeffler (2007)</xref> find that a high risk of a coup d’état results in more military spending used to buy off the military.</p>

<p>Indeed, average government consumption of goods and services as a percentage of GDP is higher under personalist regimes than under the other two regime types. Concretely, it is 15.73% for personalist regimes, 12.60% for single-party systems, and 12.0% for military regimes.</p>

<p>Both authors use the Polity IV index to capture countries’ democracy levels.

<p>The political terror measure (see Note 14) was also included in the aid models to test whether donors tend to punish human rights violators, but it was not significant and reduced the number of observations.

<p>The scale includes “murder, torture, or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; prolonged detention without charges; disappearance or clandestine detention; and other flagrant violations of the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414011427883">Hafner-Burton, 2005</xref>, p. 615). Thus, it measures levels of political violence and terror that a country experiences in a particular year based on a five-level terror scale. Level 1 is the lowest level of terror and applies to those “countries under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their views, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are extremely rare.” Level 5 indicates that “terror has expanded to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.” See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/">http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/</ext-link> for further details.</p>

<p>Given that both the sanctions and the regime type variables are dichotomous, the marginal effect of sanctions for single-party regimes (hence, when this dummy equals 1) is β<sub><italic>sanction</italic></sub> + β<sub><italic>sanction</italic>×SIN<italic>gle–party</italic></sub>, that is, for example, in Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011427883">Table 2</xref>, −1.48 + 3.76 = 2.27.

<p>One then may wonder why cuts are not much more severe, allowing the regime to reallocate most of those resources to other categories. Yet it is worth recalling that public investment is also used to buy support from specific groups or constituencies by delivering targeted public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011427883">Bates, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>We also ran models with further controls, such as oil rents, as it is often argued that oil revenues allow for a better and bigger repressive apparatus. Our measure of oil rents was not significant in any specification, so it was ruled out to increase sample size.</p>

<p>Using the change (first difference) and not levels of the aid and trade variables does not affect the main results. When included, both variables are not significant, although they show the expected signs: A short-run increase in aid or trade tends to reduce repression, as both imply a potential increase in revenues and, hence, in rent availability.</p>
