<p>New research has found that there is no such thing as a safe tan. According to Researchers at GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences, UV-induced melanin formation (tanning), traditionally thought to protect against skin cancer, has now been shown to be directly involved in melanoma formation in mammals.

<p>According to a new study we should cut the amount of time we sit down for if we want to live longer. Researchers found that sitting for less than three hours a day could add an extra two years to your life. Furthermore cutting down TV viewing to less than two hours every day could extend a person’s life by almost 1.4 years. All rise!</p>

<p>A new study has found a vaccine that could potentially promote weight loss. Currently only tested on mice, researchers found that after giving mice, which were fed a high fat diet for six weeks, the jab a 10% drop in body weight after four days was noticed. The vaccinations were administered twice; at the start of the study and then a booster vaccination on day 22. A quick fix?</p>
