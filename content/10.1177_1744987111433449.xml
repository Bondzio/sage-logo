<p>This strong Norwegian paper by Kari Glavin spells out the central roles of nurses in the prevention, diagnosis and management of perinatal depression, and gives the necessary management structures for this public health intervention to be sustained. That the study replicates earlier findings from other regions of the world (Pakistan, Chile, Sweden and UK), and the work I carried out with Jenifer Holden over 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111433449">Holden et al., 1989</xref>), is not surprising but should encourage and enable policy makers in Norway, with their enviable resources, to fund further studies of the cost-effectiveness of this service, and of the ethics and practicalities of universal national screening with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Furthermore to determine the optimal care pathways to the specialist perinatal mental health services, without which this municipality study would not have been feasible, or ethical. Other contributions to this literature have come from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111433449">Elliott et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111433449">Gerrard et al. (1993)</xref>.</p>
<p>Yet several unanswered questions remain. Where precisely <italic>are</italic> the specialist perinatal psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in this care pathway? If they became disinterested in Norway, would this service flounder? How do the Norwegians manage without designated specialist mother and baby in-patient units for women with severe Puerperal Psychoses? Answers to these questions would keep the Marcé Society Biennial Scientific committee buzzing for many years to come!</p>
<p>The Oslo paper also appropriately coincides with the first 25 years of the EPDS. Scandinavian researchers were amongst the inspirational pioneers at the forefront of infant and perinatal research: Bengt Jansson, for example, first welcomed me warmly to Gothenburg on my return from Uganda in 1974, and more recent community work in Sweden by Birgitta Wickberg and her colleagues has continued that Swedish tradition. Moreover, when I was visiting Tromsö in Norway, above the Arctic Circle, in 2007 with my wife, we unexpectedly met, at a local fish restaurant, off-duty psychiatric nurses who, after introductions, told us they were using the EPDS in Tromsö! I was lost for words: there was at that time no Sami translation to add to the 34 other languages.</p>
<p>Culture and context (language and beliefs) are thus crucial to perinatal mental health services. Kari Glavin and her colleagues (including Malin Eberhard-Gran) will be fully aware of this, but for an international/global readership it is of particular interest. What happened for example to the Norwegians in the study who did not speak Norwegian? (We are told that 7% were immigrants, a high proportion perhaps?) Inclusivity in our research is the core value linked closely to the well-articulated account, by Kari Glavin, of the principles of person-centred counselling. Jenifer Holden taught me a lot about this, previously taken for granted, skill. Also – where are the fathers in these Norwegian Municipalities? Is the stereotype incorrect that many are at home looking after the infant? How many separations/divorces occurred as a result of the Parenting Stress encountered? Did these families live happily ever after or not? If this research underpins implementation of a national service led by public health nurses to reduce the effects of perinatal depression across Norway, it can be hoped that more families may stay intact, and more infants may grow up emotionally secure. These workers will be delivering a universal service, which is both preventative, as well as therapeutic.</p>
<p>Whilst beyond the scope of this particular paper, it is important that these additional key epidemiological public health questions are addressed. I also think that to determine how many of the mothers had their baby baptised, or had another naming ceremony, is of public health interest. We are, it seems, living in a rapidly changing culture of family support. The socio-cultural context of parenting stress, and the content of what is heard during the listening visits, may therefore be different at the time of any 50th EPDS anniversary. The cut-off score used in Kari Glavin’s interesting studies of 10+ may also have to be revised for use in a different family context of parenting, and with possible new norms and idioms of emotional expression in 25 years’ time.</p>
<p>My guess though is that the availability of a secure attachment figure (whether professional or familial) will remain central to the well-being of parents and of their born and unborn children. Cultural competence and religious sensitivity then, as now, are likely to remain essential values for all mental health workers.</p>
