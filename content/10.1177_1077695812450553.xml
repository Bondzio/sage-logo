<p>Journalism and mass communication higher education in Iraq is well established but largely isolated from global developments since the 1970s. In the post–Iraq war period, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) implemented a multiyear project to work with the leadership of Iraqi higher education to help update the curriculum in journalism and mass communication in that country. This project adapted the UNESCO Model Curricula for Journalism Education to the evolving higher education environment in Iraq. The authors were funded by UNESCO to help facilitate the adoption and adaptation of the model curriculum to the unique situation in Iraq.</p>

<body>
<p>In Iraq, recent generations of journalism educators and students have suffered under first repressive and then chaotic work and study conditions. Dictatorial government control was replaced by the terrors of sectarian violence. The result was much self-censorship as a survival tactic. Yet journalism and mass communication (JMC) higher education in Iraq is well established. Several colleges and universities offer two-year and four-year degrees in journalism and mass communication, including Baghdad University and in the Kurdish region (KRG) of northern Iraq (e.g., Salahaddin University and the Technical Institute in the KRG capital city Erbil). These schools offer undergraduate as well as graduate-level study, including masters and doctoral programs. But these programs had been largely isolated since the 1970s under the Saddam Hussein regime. Faculty members were heavily restricted in their ability to travel or communicate with the West and had to refrain from teaching students to criticize the regime. Today, in the relative postconflict environment of Iraq, its JMC programs are in dire need of curricular reform.</p>
<p>In the postwar period since 2010, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has sponsored the implementation of a multiyear project to work with the leadership of Iraq higher education to help update the curriculum in journalism and mass communication at both Baghdad University and at Universities in Kurdistan in northern Iraq. This project involved the application of the UNESCO Model Curricula for Journalism Education to the situation in Iraq.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695812450553">1</xref></sup> The UNESCO Model Curricula for Journalism Education were created by a UNESCO working group in 2007 as a “guide suitable for use in developing countries and emerging democracies.” Since specific needs differ throughout the world, it is of value to adapt and amend this framework to fit specific needs in various regions. The Iraq project was created to assess the unique concerns of post-Hussein and postwar Iraqi journalism education and develop addenda to the model curricula to address those factors. Among participants in this project were faculty members and deans from the schools of journalism and mass communication at Baghdad University and in Kurdistan as well as senior administrators from the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).</p>
<p>Technological developments are particularly problematic for Iraq educators and students. In some cases, such as at the Technical Institute in Erbil, up-to-date equipment is available to students, but instructors skilled in its use are scarce and teacher training is needed. A lack of computer equipment and other state-of-the-art journalism tools is a technological crisis at Baghdad University. The problem is exacerbated by a shortage of broadband Internet connectivity and even adequate electricity to power computers—were they and the Internet even available. The situation in Baghdad is particularly problematic, where the war has decimated the infrastructure and equipment needs are significant. A representative of the UNESCO JMC curriculum project visited Baghdad University, for example, to assess equipment needs and reported that that there is very little media technology of any kind. UNESCO expects to provide the journalism school with an equipment grant that will include broadcasting material—what radio and TV facilities do exist are completely out of date. The only Internet connections available to students are those they pay for themselves, an unaffordable option for most of the Baghdad University population.</p>
<p>The situation in Kurdistan is in stark contrast, where universities and colleges such as the Erbil Technical Institute have advanced digital technology in place for JMC programs, broadband wireless Internet, and other advanced infrastructure for teaching and learning. Although Iraq’s infrastructure is unreliable, mobile telephony is advanced and widespread. Country statistics for 2009 ranked Iraq fortieth in the world for cell phone usage, with 47 percent of Iraqis using mobile phones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695812450553">2</xref></sup> In addition, most major Iraqi cities (including the KRG) offer both voice and 3G service to its mobile phone users.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695812450553">3</xref></sup> The Iraqi delegation to this project commented on the ubiquity of mobile phones among students at their universities.</p>
<p>Exacerbating these harsh problems is the MoHE policy to assign students, regardless of their interest or particular aptitude, to majors, including JMC. This has been a source of much frustration to both students and faculty, as expressed during the UNESCO curriculum development workshops. Iraqi JMC faculty have requested MoHE change its policy to allow students to choose their majors, or at least indicate preferences for majors, and that MoHE policy accommodate student preferences. Faculty members believe that this would result in a stronger student body within JMC schools and departments at the undergraduate level. This policy would parallel common practice in the West.</p>
<p>The authors of this essay were part of an international team of consultants hired by UNESCO to help facilitate the adoption and adaptation of the UNESCO JMC model curriculum to the unique situation in Iraq. This essay describes the project through its initial stage of completion.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695812450553">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The UNESCO JMC curriculum project follows the examples of previous research and fieldwork regarding curriculum change. Oliva encourages the use of curriculum development models as efficient and productive ways to approach curriculum reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695812450553">4</xref></sup> Within the curriculum development research, three models are widely identified, utilized, or incorporated into other models: Eisner’s systemic-aesthetic model, Weinstein and Fantini’s humanistic model, and Taba’s instructional strategies model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695812450553">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>By its nature, most curriculum reform—no matter the scope—is an inductive process in that it begins by examining curriculum materials, which then leads to generalizations. In addition, by their very nature, models are nonlinear; planners can effectively enter the process at any point in the model and even skip components all together, if needed.</p>
<p>As its name implies, Eisner’s systemic-aesthetic model focuses on changing or adapting the processes of the educational institution or system to improve long-term learning. Although some may argue that with Iraq at a crossroads, Eisner’s approach may be the best way to reform education within Iraqi universities, this macro approach may take too long when considering the goal—reforming only the journalism curriculum within the Iraqi universities.</p>
<p>Weinstein and Fantini’s humanistic approach places its main focus on the needs of the learners. In this model, the learners identify their needs and a curriculum is designed around those needs in a way that is flexible enough to accommodate future needs. Although at first glance this may seem appropriate, the reason for curriculum reform in Iraq has less to do with what the learners think they want and more to do with identifying what the learners need to become effective twenty-first-century journalists in a newly democratic Iraq.</p>
<p>Taba’s instructional strategies model allows for a much more innovative approach to curriculum development, as it allows the curriculum planners to identify specific learning objectives and content, it allows learning experiences to be designed based on identified criteria and takes into account the use of various teaching strategies and technologies in information delivery. Since the model allows for plenty of flexibility, it also allows for an array of evaluative techniques. Lunenburg outlines key external factors that impact the internal process of curriculum reform:
<disp-quote>
<p>Such factors include (a) the nature of the community in which the school is located – its pressures, values, and resources; (b) the policies of the school district; (c) the nature of a particular school – its goals, resources, and administrative strategies; (d) the personal style and characteristics of the teachers involved; and (e) the nature of the student population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695812450553">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Iraqi educators involved with the UNESCO project identified the need for curriculum reform in their journalism programs. The participants indicated the need for (1) updating class content in courses like media law; (2) refocusing writing courses; (3) weaving technology more fully into the classroom experience, including the use of distance learning (aka e-learning) technology; (4) revamping their internship systems; and (5) transitioning from a theoretical approach to a more practical, “hands-on” approach to curriculum assignments. The Iraqi curriculum reform project required the use of a model more similar to Taba’s instructional strategies model than the other models discussed. The UNESCO Model Journalism Curriculum was chosen in part because it possesses the same characteristics and highly adaptive nature as the Taba model.</p>
<p>The Iraqi educators are not the first to utilize the UNESCO Model Curricula on Journalism Education. In a 2009 UNESCO presentation, Du Toit’s case study mentions forty-two journalism schools in thirty-four countries had either fully or partially adapted the model curricula.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695812450553">7</xref></sup> According to panel proceeding notes, by the time the World Journalism Education Conference convened in South Africa in July 2010, “54 journalism training institutions from 44 countries had expressed an interest in examining the curricula to see if it fit their needs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695812450553">8</xref></sup> The interested institutions were in countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Arab states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695812450553">9</xref></sup> The model curricula were also utilized as a guide or a reference point in China and Brazil, and consultations had been carried out or planned to investigate the adaptation of the curricula in South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, the Caribbean, Arab States (GCC and Maghreb), Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, Central America, and Francophone Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695812450553">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Critics of UNESCO’s model curricula say that obstacles—some insurmountable—exist in the implementation of the model. Reasons often cited include organizational, human resource, infrastructure and societal factors that inhibit an effective adoption of what they see as a Western-centric model (see Claussen, Singer, and Freedman and Shafer).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695812450553">11</xref></sup> Freedman and Shafer offer an excellent history of the development of the UNESCO curricula model and offer a detailed, albeit gloomy, critique of the model.</p>
<p>Despite its detractors, journalism educators are adapting or localizing the UNESCO model curricula to fit their regional, national, and institutional aims. For some countries, such as Iraq, it is in preparation for a new and evolving media landscape; for others, it is a way to address the editorial and technological changes that exist today.</p>
<p>With the growth of news media outlets in developing countries and emerging democracies, there has been a complementary growth in the need for well-trained journalists. “As the lead UN agency in promoting freedom of expression and access to information and knowledge, UNESCO has taken various initiatives to improve the quality of journalism education worldwide. In December 2005, in response to numerous requests from Member States for help in the design of journalism education curricula, UNESCO convened an experts’ consultative meeting in Paris. Major outputs of the consultation were the identification of courses, which should be included in a journalism curriculum.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695812450553">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The model curriculum developed focuses around three axes:</p>
<list id="list1-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>an axis comprising the norms, values, tools, standards, and practices of journalism;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an axis emphasizing the social, cultural, political, economic, legal and ethical aspects of journalism practice both within and outside the national borders; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an axis comprising knowledge of the world and journalism’s intellectual challenges.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The UNESCO model curriculum was adapted to the situation in Iraq in a series of stages involving both international journalism and mass communication advisors retained by UNESCO as well as faculty and ministers of higher education from Iraq. Among the team of international team of advisors retained by UNESCO for the Iraq project was then–Rhodes University journalism professor Guy Berger, who has written widely on journalism and its role in the emerging democratic process and now serves as a media development specialist at UNESCO’s Paris headquarters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695812450553">13</xref></sup> As a member of the original team of consultants, Berger played a critical role in shaping the early contours of the Iraq initiative. Berger’s notions are particularly central to the role of journalism as a fundamental provider of information in the democratic process. A growing amount of research suggests that in the twenty-first century, online news and information, particularly that involving networked individuals as well as professionally trained journalists, is key to the democratic process, including in emerging democracies. Research by Professor William Dutton of the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) provides compelling data in this regard and helped provide a foundation for the UNESCO Iraqi curricular reform initiative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695812450553">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Project: An Overview</title>
<p>To facilitate the adaptation of the UNESCO model curriculum to the unique situation in Iraq, two workshops were held in Amman, Jordan, the first in June 2010 and the second in June 2011 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695812450553">Table 1</xref>). The curriculum workshops were held in Jordan because the continuing instability in Iraq precluded expectations for a level of security consistent with UNESCO requirements for the project. Participants traveled from Baghdad University and from Salahaddin University and the Technical Institute in Erbil to meet with curriculum consultants from the United States and Lebanon. They convened in a windowless Amman hotel room day after day, fueled by strong coffee and sweet candy, first negotiating the differences in points of view that they brought to the round table and then moving on to developing amendments that tailor the model curriculum to their specific needs. The UNESCO project international consultants participated in both Jordan workshops and were represented at the study field trips at Rutgers University and the University of Oregon. Educators from Baghdad University and Iraqi Kurdistan higher education institutions participated in all the meetings, as did representatives from the Iraq MoHE and UNESCO project leaders.</p>

<p>During the first workshop in the summer of 2010, the participants transcended ethnic and linguistic differences between the Kurdistan region of Iraq and Baghdad to find needs and goals common for all Iraqi journalism students. The challenges of creating a twenty-first-century curriculum brought the divergent groups together as they focused on acknowledging the desperate circumstances of their schools’ infrastructures and the antiquated nature of their lesson plans. Representatives from Baghdad University described classrooms with no air-conditioning and no reliable electricity despite stifling temperatures (as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit) while their colleagues in the KRG told of state-of-the-art technology provided to them by international donors even though instructors did not know how to operate the equipment and the donors provided no trainers. Working with the consultants, the Iraqis prioritized needs while expressing understandable pride in their existing curricula. Theirs is, of course, a rich culture with a heritage tracing to civilization’s beginnings. Delicate negotiations and discussions led to them acknowledging that the combination of the years of dictatorship, invasion, occupation, and ongoing civil unrest left their journalism schools operating a level below international standards. By the close of the first workshop week, the Iraqi delegation worked with the consultants to differentiate courses being taught in Iraq that were no longer needed, those that needed to be updated, and new courses that were appropriate to add to students’ study.</p>
<p>Evenings, when the Jordan summer heat abated, the participants wandered the Amman streets together in search of dinner. These informal restaurant mealtimes were of integral importance to the success of the workshops; the social intercourse helped participants find common cause.</p>
<p>When the group reconvened a year later in Amman, it included new academic members from the KRG and Baghdad, along with representatives from the MoHE. Any curriculum change in Iraq requires MoHE approval. MoHE inclusion in the workshop was designed to facilitate such approval. The workshop continued to develop specific changes in the context of the UNESCO Model Curriculum for Journalism. The goal of the second round of meetings was to generate agreement among faculty and MoHE to adopt the UNESCO model curriculum as a guide, with addenda appropriate for the unique regional needs of Iraq.</p>
<p>The result was a document agreed to unanimously by the delegation, the consultants, and the MoHE representatives. They agreed that the UNESCO model will help the MoHE enhance the Iraqi journalism curriculum and help Iraqi colleges and universities keep up with developments in worldwide journalism education. The group looked to the future, anticipating that its preliminary work will result in new courses of study along with systems to implement the new courses and assess their viability.</p>
<p>As an outcome of the second Amman workshop, all participants signed the agreement in three languages: Arabic, Kurdish, and English. This signed agreement indicated not only consensus regarding the UNESCO model journalism curriculum as adapted to the situation in Iraq but a high level of collaboration between the participants from Baghdad and those from KRG, providing hope and opening the door for more collaboration in the future. Copies of the signed documents in their multiple languages are available online.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695812450553">15</xref></sup> Translating the agreement into all three represented languages was important not only to ensure mutual understanding but also to strengthen bonds of trust as the diverse community of Iraqi higher education moves forward.</p>
<p>As the second Amman workshop concluded, the group listened quietly to a poignant speech from Baghdad University journalism school dean Dr. Hashim Hasan, who described with a vivid example the complexity and struggle of teaching journalism in contemporary Iraq. His classrooms are not equipped with computers. But even if they were, there is no broadband Internet connectivity at his department. And even were there computers and broadband, the university lacks reliable electrical service to power what so much of the rest of the world takes for granted as if it were a guaranteed utility.</p>
<p>Dr. Hashim closed his remarks and the workshop with a reminder of his and his colleagues’ optimism and stoicism via a poem he wrote and softly recited:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>“We are the butterflies of the media</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>The lovers of pens</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>The makers of the photo and the movie</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>We fly in the world of dreams</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>Render truth accurately</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>Seek love and peace</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>We are the butterflies of the media</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>Our dream is the transparency of the truth</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>The happiness of human beings</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>We are the butterflies of the media.”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The applause in the hotel conference room was unanimous and deafening.</p>
<p>As an integral element of the UNESCO JMC curriculum project, six Iraqi journalism educators from Baghdad and the KRG traveled to Rutgers University and the University of Oregon (UO) early in 2011 on a study tour designed to augment the curriculum development work being conducted in the Amman workshops.</p>
<p>Participants in the tour met with American journalists at the <italic>New York Times</italic> and several other news gathering companies—both print and broadcast—including the local newspapers serving the Rutgers and UO communities, the <italic>Bergen Record</italic> and the <italic>Register-Guard</italic>. These site visits helped the Iraqi delegates learn what skill sets journalism job seekers in America must bring with them to the workplace. Knowledge of this reality helped reinforce in the minds of the Iraqi delegates the need for curriculum reform.</p>
<p>Meetings took place at both universities with faculty members who were engaged in recent curriculum assessment and reform at both institutions. The Iraqi visitors gained insight into the processes successfully used for such change, giving them confidence that similar evolution at their universities and technical schools is a practical goal. Strong bonds were established between the U.S. institutions and their Iraq counterparts; initial plans for further exchanges were discussed. Students and faculty in New Jersey and Oregon enjoyed the opportunity to meet in both formal and informal settings with the Iraqi educators and learn from them about the challenges they face teaching journalism in a postconflict environment with no recent history of a free and independent media.</p>
<p>Following the workshops and the study tour seminars, consultants on the UNESCO model curriculum project—in concert with their Iraqi colleagues—provided a critical examination of the existing mass communication curriculum at Baghdad University and elsewhere in Iraq, including in the KRG. The result of that analysis is eleven recommendations from the consultants specifying areas in which Iraqi JMC curricular updates are most needed. These recommendations were presented to the MoHE for consideration for adoption to reform Iraqi JMC higher education, recommendations that add to both the UNESCO model curricula and the existing programs in effect in Iraq universities and technical institutes. Although these recommendations were developed for the specific conditions existing in contemporary Iraq, they are broadly applicable throughout the developing world. These recommendations fall into two broad areas, strategic and professional/technology-related.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077695812450553">
<title>Strategic Recommendations</title>
<list id="list2-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Elective courses should be offered in both Iraq and the KRG to provide students with the opportunity of choice; that is, students in Baghdad should have as a choice the opportunity to study Kurdish history and culture, while students in Sulaimaniya should have the choice of studying the history of Iraq as an elective; this would help lessen the gap between the regions by promoting cultural understanding and acceptance and, ultimately, reconciliation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The dearth of media equipment for instruction needs to be addressed by the MoHE. Up-to-date statistics are required to determine the urgent needs for equipment, thus enabling the proper support and assistance from the different stakeholders including but not limited to international and local NGOs and foundations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The MoHE should reconsider its stance on the use of distance education technology and implement elements of online course instruction throughout Iraqi higher education as this will allow for education for all, especially in remote areas, and will help resolve space and logistical constraints while placing Iraq and KRG in the modern educational sphere.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The curriculum department in the MoHE needs to launch a professional development program that will enable its members to identify and define needs, propose change and development, and collaborate with the global academic communities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The electives as well as the core courses must be in harmony with international standards and UNESCO’S guidelines in terms of gender equity, nondiscrimination, and other key issues.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695812450553">
<title>Professionally/Technology-Related Recommendations</title>
<list id="list3-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Media professionals—both inside and outside Iraq—should be called upon to provide industry insight to students as guest speakers and expert mentors, thus enhancing communication skills and exchange of knowledge and experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Student internships should be encouraged and supported more fully by university administrators. Public-private sector partnerships must be developed to promote internships, guest speaker activities, job shadowing, interview, and project-based learning (PBL). Learning opportunities outside the classrooms must be organized and planned as current practices have demonstrated the importance of this type of learning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A practical “capstone” or senior project for every last-year journalism student should be encouraged by faculty and supported by university administrators.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Measurable rubrics for assessing student learning should be created and implemented within the country’s journalism programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practical or professional courses should play a larger role in the new curriculum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Classroom technology should be utilized in more journalism courses. Technology integration should be one of the pillars of Baghdad and KRG’s JMC curriculum.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on the faculty and MoHE description of the situation in Iraq, the international consultants recommended two unique opportunities for advancing JMC education in Iraq on limited resources. The Iraqi faculty and MoHE welcomed these recommendations, although not without certain reservations. The most pressing revolves around the fact that distance learning developed a bad reputation in Iraq in the years immediately following the Saddam Hussein government. In the freewheeling atmosphere of that period, storefront “degree mills” offered worthless diplomas for a fee.</p>
<p>The unique opportunities identified were (1) the implementation of e-learning via mobile media and (2) the creation of a virtual correspondent internship.</p>
<p>To operate in Iraq’s burgeoning free press system, Iraq needs newly trained journalists with the skill sets to investigate the world around them. As mentioned earlier, the journalism curriculum offered in Iraqi universities needed updating, and the technology to deliver course content was nearly nonexistent. The journalism training offered must be consistent with worldwide best practices and should adhere to academic standards set by globally recognized accreditation organizations. With a dearth of Iraqi media experts and universities separated by large distances and poor infrastructure, it became evident that the Iraqi situation needed both to revise its journalism curriculum and devise a way to deliver the content electronically. So while the curriculum is being reformed, research must begin to find a state-of-the-art course management system that would allow simple course management processes and sophisticated distance learning capabilities. The system must operate using limited bandwidth and allow scalability to start modestly and expand as demand grows.</p>
<p>Implementing this type of course management system in Iraqi journalism schools presents geographical, technological, and philosophical challenges. Large geographic distances and poor technological infrastructure hamper communication between university professors within the country and with colleagues abroad. The poor infrastructure contributes to unreliable, thus limited, Internet connectivity. This not only threatens the ability of professors to consistently deliver information to students using the Internet, it also calls into question the reliability of online course materials to be stored, maintained, and accessed. Last, Iraq’s MoHE is wary of e-learning programs due to the aforementioned prevalence of “diploma mills,” which some Iraqi citizens have used to fraudulently build their academic credentials. Consequently and not surprisingly, the MoHE does not allow credits earned via online programs to be accepted by Iraqi schools. If a viable e-learning curriculum is to be adopted by Iraqi universities, the online system needs to be securely hosted and well maintained, and the course content must be rigorous and in line with pedagogical best practices.</p>
<p>Moodle and Sakai are considered open source products, meaning users can download them for free. Since they are open source, the community of users improves the products over time and shares updates with the rest of the user community. Users can hire a company to host the product and help customize it for a particular campus or on-campus organizations—such as an IT department—and can learn to work with the tool.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695812450553">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The delivery method is also a key consideration. There are two ways to deliver course information—either via asynchronous or synchronous methods. Asynchronous refers to material that can be stored and accessed later by the student. Synchronous methods involve live, real-time information delivery. The two open source products mentioned above have limited synchronous technologies provided within their system. A chat feature and a white board feature are offered, but live audio and video—which provide the backbone for a true synchronous experience—are not included and require the user to purchase add-ons for this capability. Examples of add-ons include Wimba and Adobe Connect. Most companies have the capability to integrate with these products (especially Moodle).</p>
<p>There are many inexpensive ways to deliver an audio-only, synchronous, distance education experience to students. Solutions can be as simple as using popular voice and text delivery systems. Examples of these include Skype, Live Meeting, Adobe Connect, WebEx, and GoToMeeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695812450553">17</xref></sup> Although these solutions deliver Voice Over Internet with text options, they are limited in their ability to broadcast to a large number of people, archive the recording sessions and provide other supporting technology that an educational course requires (i.e., test-taking programs, grade books, etc.).</p>
<p>Other class capture products provide both synchronous and asynchronous course support. Wimba, Elluminate, Tegrity, and Camtasia can capture classes, but they lack the versatility, scalability, expandability, or technical support that the Iraqi educational system requires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695812450553">18</xref></sup> iTunes University offers both public and private environments to deliver course content and allows for the creation of asynchronous consumption of both audio and video podcasts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695812450553">19</xref></sup> iTunes University allows for students to access podcasts via their smart phones as well.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned manufacturers deliver elements of a course management system, but they lack a framework to provide everything the Iraqi universities need to fully deliver a reformed curriculum to its students either traditionally or via a distance learning platform. To meet the MoHE’s need to develop and maintain a credible, world-class distance education system, an industry-proven educational course management system is needed. In our assessment, that system is the Blackboard Learn system.</p>
<p>A few years ago, there were several course management systems—most notably ECollege, Desire2Learn, Angel, WebCT, and Blackboard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695812450553">20</xref></sup> Recently, Blackboard purchased WebCT and Angel and is now the dominant distance education course management system provider. Blackboard has also begun acquiring several of the above-mentioned software manufacturers. With this in mind, Blackboard now provides a compatible framework for the other applications to work within its system. Thus, any supporting software the institution wishes to utilize will likely work with the Blackboard portal.</p>
<p>Most distance education solutions require a reliable electronic delivery system in which to disseminate the course content and facilitate communication between students and faculty. Although using traditional copper wire connections (standard landline telephony) in Iraq are currently problematic as a connectivity solution, the use of cellular technology may be a more viable answer. With the right hardware and software package, cell phone technology can reliably deliver educational information to students. A fairly reliable commercial, mobile telecommunication system exists in Iraq, and many Iraqis, including Kurds, possess cell phones, making this a possible option for course delivery to all adults, including college-aged students.</p>
<p>Blackboard’s latest iteration—Blackboard Learn 9—allows access to course material via mobile smart phones. In fact, Blackboard Learn 9 satisfies all the requirements the Iraqi educational system needs. It allows</p>
<list id="list4-1077695812450553" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the use of moderate amounts of bandwidth;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>remote hosting and maintenance of course content from anywhere in the world;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>limited numbers of IT technicians at each university delivery/receiving point;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>with training, easy course content creation by the educator and interactivity by students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>both synchronous (i.e., live chat) and asynchronous (stored content) delivery systems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>real-time and delayed audio, video, and text delivery;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>access to course content via mobile smart phone devices (iPhone, Droid, BlackBerry);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>online testing, archival storage of course grades and semester-by-semester course content;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>content accessibility from anywhere in the world;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>customization to the needs of the institution and the MoHE; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>translation of course content into other languages—most notably Arabic.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To address the distance education credibility issue that exists among education professionals in Iraq (and in other countries of the world), there are established e-learning course standards that can be used when developing courses within a curriculum.</p>
<p>The Quality Matters Program has established rubrics to evaluate the design of all online and hybrid (a combination of online and face-to-face) courses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695812450553">21</xref></sup> When a course satisfies the Quality Matters standards, they issue the company’s stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Blackboard has a similar system in place. Its Blackboard Exemplary Courses program reviews online and hybrid course designs and recognizes those that meet or exceed the program’s established standards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695812450553">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Applying a globally recognized distance education online course rubric to the Iraqi distance education curriculum will help ensure each online course maintains the rigor and veracity of traditional face-to-face courses delivered at Iraqi institutions. In addition, developing courses that meet or exceed professional accreditation institutions’ criteria add to the credibility of each online course that would be taught within the new Iraqi journalism curriculum. The consultants provided the Iraqi delegation with examples of five e-learning public relations courses as examples of how online courses differ from traditional courses and as a proposed five-course sample public relations curriculum.</p>
<p>The lack of equipment at Baghdad University to teach the practical application of multimedia journalism was identified early on as an impediment to the proper training of tomorrow’s journalists in Iraq. For decades, theory-only lectures served as a poor substitute for traditionally hands-on practice in camera operation, lighting, and audio-video editing. To address Baghdad University’s equipment shortfall, the UNESCO consultant from Salisbury University received approval from his administrators to donate several redundant television cameras and accessories to Baghdad University. In all, Salisbury University donated three JVC GY-DV500 Mini DV camcorders, two tripods, two PortaBrace carrying cases, seven rechargeable NiCad battery packs, a battery charging station, an Ocean Systems P4/3G dual-drive computer workstation with the Avid DVExpress nonlinear editing software installed, an Avid Custom Keyboard, a Dell 15” display monitor, and a few fire wire cables that allow footage from the cameras to be transferred to the computer for editing. UNESCO generously covered the cost of shipping the equipment to Baghdad University. In brief, Salisbury University’s equipment donation allowed Baghdad University to create its first student media lab for educating its journalism students on the practice of visual storytelling. Part of the ongoing work of the consultants to the UNESCO Iraqi JMC curriculum project is to publicize the value equipment considered obsolete by some institutions can have to Iraqi colleagues.</p>
<p>Internships are a vital part of the Iraqi JMC curriculum, including the 2011 updated UNESCO criteria for JMC education. Proposed in the model curriculum is an innovative internship opportunity that would utilize Internet and other new technologies to bring together students in Iraq or the KRG with professional editors and reporters in the United States and elsewhere around the world to give those students experience as virtual foreign correspondents. A virtual foreign correspondent internship program would have the added benefit of giving foreign news organizations, most of which have closed their Iraqi bureaus, an opportunity to increase their local coverage in Baghdad or other parts of Iraq (i.e., KRG).</p>
<p>It was common by 2011 for most news organizations to utilize online correspondents to gather and report news and to file stories both in text and multimedia formats. It would not be difficult to employ digital technologies, including digital cameras, audio recorders, laptops, Wi-Fi or other Internet resources for students to gather news, cover local events, interview local sources, file stories, and communicate with reporters and editors remotely in the United States or elsewhere, and essentially operate in a professional internship setting as if they were physically located on-site as in a traditional newsroom or other media internship setting.</p>
<p>Proposed in the amended model curriculum for Iraq is a virtual foreign correspondent internship program for students in Iraq. This pioneering virtual foreign correspondent program would be among the first of its kind in the world for an emerging democracy and would be an opportunity for students and news-gathering organizations to transcend the travel difficulties into and out of Iraq with valuable learning experiences that could produce valuable news coverage. The Iraqi students would serve as interns with out-of-Iraq news media, but from inside Iraq. Such virtual internship opportunities could be developed for other mass communication programs such as public relations, although they would not be in the form of virtual foreign correspondent. They might help with local creative or media services, for example.</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that we discuss the internship program in particular in this essay for several reasons. First, the internship program is one of the fresh ideas and unique adaptations of the UNESCO model curriculum developed in this initiative and accepted by the Iraqi faculty and MoHE. Second, professional education is one of the biggest deficits in Iraqi journalism and media education, and the virtual internship program specifically addressed this deficit in a cost-effective and practical manner. Third, the virtual internship program is one that both the Iraqis and UNESCO leadership valued.</p>
<p>Outcome-Based Learning Objectives for the virtual internship program include the following points:</p>
<list id="list5-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Students will identify stories and sources for those stories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will gather material for stories, including conducting interviews and collecting materials from documents.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will organize materials collected and synthesize them for presentation in a story.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will present a story by writing the facts, beginning with a lead and followed by the body of the story, including quotations attributed to sources.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will check facts for accuracy.</p></list-item>

<title>Internship Procedures</title>
<list id="list6-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Students will communicate regularly with an editor or reporter for the outside-of-Iraq news organization to which they are attached about stories assigned.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will file via Internet through email or other agreed-upon electronic means text or multimedia news reports for possible publication with possible byline.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students will communicate regularly with an on-campus supervisor updates on internship activities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Students will receive university credit for completing the virtual foreign correspondent internship.</p>
<p>The primary prerequisites for the internship would be completion of at least one course in news reporting and writing, and in basic Internet skills, including email, word processing, and web search skills.</p>
<p>Suggested readings would include something comparable to Phillip Knightley’s <italic>The First Casualty</italic> and the brief biography of Seymour Topping, a retired foreign correspondent, foreign editor, managing editor, and regional editorial director for the <italic>New York Times</italic> and former administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695812450553">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A question to consider is how e-learning and the virtual correspondent internship can be integrated into the curricular reform in a manner that will satisfy the understandable concerns of the MoHE, faculty, and professional stakeholders in the wake of recent “diploma mill” abuses. The best course of action likely is a process of gradual stages of implementation that can ensure the success of these two platforms for the long term as their incremental adoption is proved legitimate.</p>
<p>In light of the comments and reservations expressed by the Iraqi delegations, both of these sets of recommendations can be adopted, but their introduction will require diplomacy and patience. In the case of the virtual foreign correspondent internship program, one concern is language. A relative small percentage of Iraqi students possess the language skills used by out-of-area news-gathering organizations. These students primarily speak, read, and write in Arabic or Kurdish and, as such, would need to work as interns with foreign news organizations whose languages correspond to their writing capabilities—or with media outlets that would engage translators.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Iraq, as the world well knows, is a nation in transition. The challenges are many on the road to a well-functioning democracy. An essential building block for Iraq’s future is a reformed system of higher education in JMC education. This system must be one that will prepare students to become professionals for careers as journalists or other media practitioners who can practice their craft at the highest level and in an ethical fashion consistent with a contemporary set of global standards. In the interim, while security issues continue to plague Iraq, it is among the most dangerous places in the world for journalists to work. It is critical for journalism students to learn professional survival skills as an element of their formal training. A professional safety and security program should also be made available to professionals already in the field, thus reinforcing the partnership between the education and professional sector while providing the professional community with value-added services.</p>
<p>The model curriculum adopted unanimously in Amman, Jordan, in June 2011 lays a foundation for such a reformed system of JMC education and practice. It provides an educational framework for all students in an Iraqi JMC major to graduate with a mastery of</p>
<list id="list7-1077695812450553" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the internationally accepted professional norms, values, tools, standards, and practices of journalism,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the social, cultural, political, economic, legal, and ethical aspects of journalism practice both within and outside the national borders of Iraq; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>general knowledge of the broader world and of journalism’s intellectual challenges.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The next steps in implementing the curricular reform and assessing the outcomes of this reformed curriculum are critical in ensuring its success. Current funding for the ongoing project from UNESCO sources has been exhausted, and this ongoing project is an appropriate candidate for further UNESCO and other financial support.</p>
<p>Based on the relationships already established between the UNESCO consultants and the Iraqi JMC faculty and MoHE, several future collaborative projects linking Iraqi faculty with Western universities and faculty have already been planned. Among these collaborations are research projects examining mobile technology use in Iraq, joint doctoral dissertation committee supervision, and possible memoranda of understanding between universities for student and faculty exchanges, classroom work linked via Skype, and other such Internet protocols, along with less formal exchanges of teaching techniques and experiences.</p>
<p>Empowered by a reformed curriculum, Iraqi JMC education can help build the foundation for a healthy and robust democratic future in Iraq. In addition, such advances will provide Iraqi journalism educators and their students the opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences directly with their peers throughout the world. These two overarching results of reforming Iraqi journalism education make programs such as the UNESCO initiative of crucial value for journalism educators, journalists, and the public worldwide.</p>
<p>The latest Amman workshop ended not just with a signed agreement but also with exchanges of personal addresses, token gifts, and heartfelt hugs—all indications that, in addition to whatever benefits Iraqi JMC education gleans from the UNESCO project, the people-to-people exchanges that the program wrought fostered the kind of personal relationships that lead to peace and understanding. That alone convinced the authors and their Iraqi colleagues that their efforts were worthwhile.</p>
<p>On May 3, 2012, World Press Freedom Day, the Iraqi Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Dr. Ali al-Adeeb, officially launched the UNESCO-commissioned journalism curriculum, saying he hoped it would “further develop the media in Iraq.”</p>
