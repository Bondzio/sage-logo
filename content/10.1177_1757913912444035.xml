<title>Evidence based practice</title>
<p>We are in interesting times with regard to public health and no doubt face significant challenges but also opportunities. The Government has an ambitious programme to improve public health – move investment upstream – through strengthening local action but more importantly supporting the development of the specialist and wider public health workforce. As we all know the focus and lens is on outcomes to increase healthy life expectancy and reduce health inequalities – where very clear roles have been identified for third sector organizations such as the Royal Society for Public Health (RPSH).</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>Perspectives in Public Health</italic> is timely and salient when considering the policy debate of input versus outcome and payment by results. Valuing health effects is a complex understanding and different economic end points are preferred by different audiences. For example transportation planners prefer Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) while health professionals prefer years of life lost or health care costs. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) use a cost utility approach, the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) which is derived from years of life spent in ill health, multiplied by a weight measuring the relative undesirability of the illness state. Using cost utility analysis, public health activity turns out to be very good value for money and in some cases, cost saving.<sup>1</sup> Notwithstanding, evaluating health promotion is problematic, Dunne <italic>et al.</italic> on page 109, correctly identify that lack of universal agreement of what counts as evidence in health promotion, lack of guidance on what constitutes rigorous evaluation and the use of inappropriate methodology have lead to much confusion. Assessing evidence and effectiveness is a complex task and often contaminated by not considering the process as a dynamic evolving system. Programme evaluations need to appreciate the relationship between intervention and effect, which also involves the context of operation.</p>
<p>Local authorities now have power and responsibility for areas hitherto unknown to them. RSPH on their website provide information and guidance in an easily digestible form and is recommended reading (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rsph.org.uk">www.rsph.org.uk</ext-link>). In addition, public health briefings have been published, consisting of a menu of cost effective and evidence based actions which local providers can choose to use depending on the local priorities and on the needs of local communities. With the increased emphasis on evidence based practice, guidance to what works, how it can be achieved and how to demonstrate progress will no doubt be welcomed. Even so, hopefully, caution will be exercised towards an approach that may suggest ‘one size fits all’.</p>
<p>Thank you to Angela Scriven for coordinating the submissions in this issue and for her Guest Editorial. A tantalising debate is presented and the current situation outlined, we are grateful for her contribution.</p>

<title>Drinking water target met</title>
<p>The world has met the Millennium Development Goal target of halving the proportion of people who do not have sustainable access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p>The target has been met well in advance of the 2015 target originally set. According to a report by UNICEF and World Health Organisation between 1990 and 2010 over two billion people were able to access improved drinking water.</p>
<p>The report goes on to suggest that if progress continues to be made at the same rate, by 2015 92% of the global population will have access to improved drinking water. However the report highlights that the target for sanitation is unlikely to be met by 2015, with only 63% with improved sanitation access and the figure is only expected to increase by 3% by 2015.</p>
<p>UNICEF Executive Director, Anthony Lake said: “Everyday more than 3,000 children die from diarrhoeal diseases. Achieving this goal will go a long way to saving children’s lives.”</p>
