<abstract>
<p>This article discusses some of the more important implications of a long-term research project into the archaeology of the modern city in Australia. It discusses how we can explore domesticity, community, family life, and issues of residence and mobility through urban archaeology, as well as providing evidence of larger issues about how and what people produce and consume in cities. In the five projects that followed the original research at Melboune’s “Little Lon” district, we developed new strategies to increase both temporal and spatial scales as we sought to focus on ways of reconciling differences in the resolving powers of different types of data. During the course of the nineteenth-century patterns of production, consumption, work, and residence changed across the Western world, and it became clear that comparisons between sites in Melbourne and Sydney (and later in London) were required to get a better understanding of the genesis and development of urban communities (and, at a more pragmatic level, to see whether it was possible to generalize about the composition of “working class” or indeed “middle class” assemblages). This article presents what is, in effect, a progress report on that broad comparative agenda.</p>

<body>
<p>More than fifteen years ago, Alan Mayne and I became interested in finding a way in which we could tell the stories that were locked up in the thousands of boxes of artifacts derived from the excavations of urban sites in Melbourne, Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479308">1</xref></sup> Following the work of archaeologists at “The Rocks” in Sydney<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479308">2</xref></sup> (as well as parallel work in New York City<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479308">3</xref></sup> and San Francisco<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479308">4</xref></sup>), we believed that the best way forward was to work toward models integrating archaeological and other historical data in ways that did not sacrifice the integrity of either. It has proved to be a lot more challenging than either of us thought.</p>
<p>Our first project was “Little Lon”, a site in the centre of Melbourne that was part of a city block generally known as the Commonwealth Block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144213479308">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144213479308">3</xref>). Two bedrock goals for research were set here: first, to develop an integrated analytical framework—bridging history and historical archaeology—of urban society and its embedded material culture in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Australia; and second, to analyze within this framework material culture recovered from the site. We believed that because neither goal had yet been achieved in Australian historical archaeology, a trend had developed that served to dissolve “the city” as a coherent unit of study, or to use the artifacts simply to “illustrate” narratives that were primarily derived from the analysis of written documents. The “Little Lon” project set out to “read” the cityscape as a cultural landscape.</p>

<p>Mayne and I understood that this very specific historical research required historians to approach the archives in a different way: not necessarily to support some highly abstract approach to space and culture but to help answer practical puzzles and problems. We were well aware that this reflexive approach, which is inductive and data driven, occurs against a complex background of historical discourse. The crucial point for us was that neither this background of deductive strategies, perspectives, and assumptions nor the conventional narratives of the history of the modern city should dominate. Instead, they should be responsive to an active engagement with material culture and archaeological contexts. Of equal importance was an understanding that the job of the historian should not stop with the development of a research design but had to continue though all phases of research (before, during, and after excavation), sometimes dealing with specific issues raised by the archaeologists, and at other times developing interpretive and explanatory options that would propel analysis.</p>
<p>Improving regimes of analysis is obviously one way to promote the difficult business of meaningfully integrating quite disparate data sets, thus using archaeological data to engage seriously with (and possibly revise) conventional readings of social processes or sociocultural categories over the past two hundred years. Another way is to expand our interpretive repertoire, and seek ways to engage with conceptions of the city that move the field of urban historical archaeology into new areas, extending our engagement with history, sociology, and geography beyond the revisionist history of the slum that has been so liberating in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479308">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We very soon discovered that significant tensions and oppositions lurked just below that pretty superficial understanding. The initial results from the work at “Little Lon” have been widely published, and there is no need to discuss them again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479308">6</xref></sup> But work there is far from complete. Important tensions and issues that remain unresolved comprise</p>
<list id="list1-0096144213479308" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the role of the particular and the general, the small- and large-scale, and the national and the transnational in problem definition, analysis, and integration;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>serious problems related to the archiving of urban archaeological collections;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the building of databases that foster assemblage-based analyses of sites;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>and the pressing need to look, much longer and harder, at research design in urban historical archaeology.</p></list-item></list>
<p>As I will show, a core methodological element of this continuing research now occurs under the rubric of “e-research” or “digital humanities,” but the issues are more than methodological given that they go to the heart of more abstract inquiries into what we wish to know about the historical archaeology of the modern city. There are also fascinating and vexing matters related to comprehending the formation processes of urban archaeological records and linking such perceptions to strategies that can help us assess the usefulness or otherwise of the questions we routinely ask, setting the tolerance limits of interpretations, and describing the kinds of integrations between archaeological and historical data that might occur.</p>
<p>Mayne and I reflected on the disjunction between the great precision of historical documentation at “Little Lon” and the much less precise archaeological data from the houses in the Casselden Place section of the original “Little Lon” site. This we now understand to be a common enough occurrence in urban historical archaeology. Of course it is important to establish how we can pursue our conventional desire to explore domesticity, community, family life, issues of residence and mobility, and still larger issues of how and what people produce and consume in cites, but it is equally important for us to try to understand how data and questions can give rise to different agendas. The different resolving powers of different kinds of data remain a significant issue for research in this field. In this case, the richness of documentary data can create an illusion of archaeological riches, where we find that finer scales of chronological resolution (down to the single year) can lead to a loss of resolution in archaeological information that does not occur so obviously at chronologically coarser scales of analysis. In essence, the integration of what we now understand to be quite disparate data sets has become a focus of research in itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479308">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>My response, which has underwritten the five projects that followed, was the idea that increasing both temporal and spatial scale could bring new patterns into focus, that might overcome the disparity in the resolving powers of different types of archaeological and historical data that Mayne and I had noted in the material from the cottages in Casselden Place (the core of our original analysis at “Little Lon”). During the course of the nineteenth-century patterns of production, consumption, work, and residence changed across the Western world, and I recognized the necessity of comparison between sites in Melbourne and Sydney (and later in London) to gain a clearer understanding of the genesis and development of urban communities and, at a more pragmatic level, to see whether it was possible to generalize about the composition of “working class” or indeed “middle class” assemblages. The structure of these comparisons, which occur in local, national, and international settings, is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144213479308">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>These subsequent projects (all funded by the Australian Research Council) have focused on major sites in Sydney including the Hyde Park Barracks, First Government House, and the Cumberland and Gloucester Streets Site in “The Rocks,” as well as on further archaeological work at the Commonwealth Block in Melbourne.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479308">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Penny Crook’s doctoral dissertation, which compared these Sydney sites with contemporaneous sites in London, has taken this research still further in search of a clearer archaeological understanding of consumption. New research projects into the archaeology of the middle class in Melbourne have built on this still further. The comparative agenda continues to expand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479308">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our research in Sydney has followed both global and local concerns, but we have also been working up our data at the very local level. But first you need quality data sets, and it is the creation and manipulation of these that is providing a firmer foundation for our work in urban archaeology in Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>Our <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> was created especially for this project and is a concrete contribution to our core themes of integration and of creating and exploring patterns in the historical and archaeological data. One brief example, drawn from 124 Cumberland Street in “The Rocks” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144213479308">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0096144213479308">7</xref>), will demonstrate its potential, as well as identifying some of the issues that arise when we seek to integrate documentary and archaeological information. But first, some background.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479308">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>People + Place</title>
<p>The <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> is a customized relational database, created in MS Access, and designed to store, display, search, and analyze historical data about Individuals and Buildings or Places. While its primary intention is to link archaeological assemblages with the houses, shops, and pubs from which they were excavated and the people who lived and worked there, the <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> can also serve the needs of historians or heritage managers undertaking site-specific or neighborhood research.</p>
<p>The <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> has three major features:</p>
<list id="list2-0096144213479308" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>it has the capacity to hold data from many different types of historical sources, encompassing birth certificates, council rates records, newspaper articles, and manuscripts that mention particular buildings, occupants, or landlords;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it records both these “raw” data and summarized biographies about people and places, enabling users to verify the information presented to them;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it tracks filial and other relationships between individuals linked to the study area, including marriages, parents and siblings, business partnerships, and friendships.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The two key organizing principles of the database are People and Place, or Individuals and Structures. The Buildings Register, shown here for 124 Cumberland Street, presents basic information about the place and its occupation history while acting as a switchboard permitting access to much more specific information about occupants and artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0096144213479308">Figure 8</xref>). By allocating specific historical data to unique identifiers for individuals and structures, the <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> allows us to weave these elaborate chains of evidence into a holistic account of individuals and the places to which they were connected.</p>
<fig id="fig8-0096144213479308" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0096144213479308-fig8.tif"/></fig>
<p>The database is the product of detailed research about the people who lived and worked in “The Rocks” during the nineteenth century. The focus of research for the Sydney project has been on the three residential sites in “The Rocks,” where people can be directly connected to the houses they lived in and/or owned, and to the material culture they left behind. The documentary resources that form the basis of the <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> are individual- and structure-specific. They include electoral rolls, post office, and trade directories and family history studies in order to discover, for example, the occupations or the birth, death, and marriage details of persons who lived on the sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0096144213479308">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> can be used as a tool to explore how people related to the spaces they lived in: where they might have gone to the pub, where they might have purchased their meat and milk, who their neighbors were, and if they were related to them by marriage. And, being a database constructed on the unique identification of space over time, it can be plugged into GIS applications to show the pub and the butcher and the proximity of the in-laws.</p>
<p>We have established the links at the smaller end of the scale, by linking all artifacts to their unique building number, and consequently to the individuals known to have occupied each place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0096144213479308">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0096144213479308">11</xref>).</p>

<p>We have developed screens in the database to tally all artifacts recovered from each building (by Function groupings) and, in those rare cases, to connect individuals to artifacts found at a particular address. The <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> also allows us to interrogate broader patterns of occupation: how long people lived at a particular address, and whether they moved around the area or out of it (i.e., were they long-term tenants or transients?), were they owner-occupiers, and did they live close to family members? The database can reveal trends in the relationships between landlords and tenants, or between individuals within households or across family groups. But the precision we can gain from our People + Places and Artifacts databases once again highlights the ongoing problems with data quality that we have been experiencing.</p>
<p>People + Place became the foundation of our work at the Hyde Park Barracks (an assemblage of global significance) and on the Commonwealth Block in Melbourne. It is now being used by Heritage Victoria as its database of choice and has been adopted by increasing numbers of independent consultants. But People + Place has significant limitations, not the least of which is the fact that it is built in Access and is delivered via DVD or downloadable from the web.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479308">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have sought to improve matters by obtaining funds from the Australian National Data Service “seeding the commons” project to transform People + Place into an online platform to allow for</p>
<list id="list3-0096144213479308" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>multivariable searching of artifact catalogue, stratigraphic and historical occupancy data, and images;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>online data entry and editing of these data (if possible);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improvements to the current system to allow for a more flexible approach to lexicon development in different states.</p></list-item></list>
<p>We are also in the process of developing new partnerships to incorporate data not available when we first went into development. Our existing databases were created in Access over a three-year period and include a range of specialized functions. If it is not feasible to redevelop the data-entry platform in a new online system, we understand it would be possible to use the existing front end (or a revised version of it), connected to an online server.</p>
<p>Our chief goal with the input of new data is to access large data sets that have hitherto existed outside People + Place. In essence, this is the goal of a current research partnership with Museum Victoria where we are putting all of the records from the six different excavations into the <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic> and then reconciling this with the Museum’s own EMU database. This has been a very time-consuming task, but it has allowed us, for the first time since excavations began at “Little Lon” in 1987, to analyze the assemblages from the Commonwealth Block as a single unit. When we have achieved this, the total assemblage will have a global significance of the highest order, being one of the largest and most comprehensive nineteenth-century urban archaeological assemblages anywhere in the world. Its value as a resource for ourselves, and for others both in Australia and overseas (particularly in North America), will be unparalleled. Its impact will be all the greater when we integrate the documentary research already undertaken on the site by Mayne and others, and expand this by beginning a new round of research into the historical records of the Commonwealth Block.</p>
<p>As the People + Place project continues, we have become much more engaged in the sweep of digital humanities research and have sought to create a platform for a national database of historical archaeological collections, excavated sites, and the people connected to those objects and places. This will be called the Australian Historical Archaeology Database.</p>
<p>Each year archaeologists (both academic and private consultants) excavate tens of thousands of artifacts from historical archaeological sites across Australia. While some states (for example Victoria) require catalogues to be prepared in a standard format, the majority of Australian catalogue data is stored in small, stand-alone spreadsheets or custom-built databases, and few are freely available. There is no central register of these individual data sets, and many significant collections are simply unknown to archaeological researchers.</p>
<p>Our original <italic>People</italic> + <italic>Place database</italic>, while extensive in its content, has proved too structurally limited for our larger purpose. Our new database, drawn from collections across Australia, will enable researchers to access a vast data set that is currently unavailable to them, and provide the platform for future data sets to be made freely available in a standardized and timely fashion.</p>

<sec id="section2-0096144213479308">
<title>Transnational Comparisons</title>
<p>The transnational comparative agenda that was modeled in 2001 began to bear fruit in 2004 with the establishment of a collaborative research project with the Museum of London’s London Archaeological Archive and Resource Centre (LAARC). While comparisons between the sites in Melbourne and Sydney continued, Penny Crook conducted analyses of archaeological material in London, to compare mid-nineteenth-century patterns of consumption between Sydney and London. The results of Crook’s approach to the archaeological vectors of quality, cost, and value first appeared in 2005, but were significantly expanded in her doctoral dissertation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479308">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The core of Crook’s dissertation was the comparison of a group of four domestic assemblages from three archaeological sites in Lambeth, London (all held in the LAARC), with three sites from “The Rocks” in Sydney. Crook chose to focus on detailed comparisons between sites and artifact classes in order to develop strategies to deal more effectively with methodological limitations she had identified in the course of research in Sydney and Melbourne. A key innovation here was Crook’s recognition that manufacturing quality has an important role to play in assemblage analysis, whether the assemblages are from London or Sydney. This was particularly evident in creating accounts of the composition of what have been considered to be working-class assemblages. Crook understood that explicit comparative methodologies were vital to establishing an approach that would make it possible to undertake the mechanics of large-scale assemblage analysis, while at the same time making it possible to explore the assumptions that underlie the concepts and categories (such as working class and middle class) that archaeologists and historians routinely deploy. In this sense, it is entirely possible that (for archaeologists at least) such categories might be mutually defining, but different across the modern world. Characteristically there has been research on archaeologies of the middle class, especially in the United States, but the point at issue is whether the broad patterns of assemblage composition that could be taken as indicative of middle class consumption would translate to Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479308">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, apart from the foundational work of a historian of material culture, Linda Young, little detailed archaeological research along these lines had been attempted, although many of the same definitional concerns have been discussed by historians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479308">14</xref></sup> Crook’s argument that in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of working-class assemblages in Australia we should also seek to define middle-class assemblages was a call to action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0096144213479308">
<title>Suburban Archaeology</title>
<p>Crook’s approach to understanding the nexus between the quality, cost, and value of any class of nineteenth-century material culture has improved our capacity to “read” consumption from an archaeological perspective. One of the primary reasons for this is the clear potential for a more sophisticated integration of written documentary evidence with assemblages of material culture recovered by archaeologists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479308">15</xref></sup> Our most recent project has sought to extend these insights by applying them to a key issue in Australian urban history, the emergence of the suburban middle class.</p>
<p>This project builds on our previous work and aims to propel archaeological approaches to middle-class and aspirational middle-class culture into the broader academic discourse about the consumption of mass-produced goods. It integrates large assemblages of fragmentary domestic material culture found in archaeological contexts, entire specimens of comparative material in museum collections, and the corpus of historical research on colonial production, import, retailing, and public services. This integration has never been attempted in Australia, although the archaeology of the middle class has made significant contributions to the history of cities such as New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>We have focused our approach on developing an archaeology of the genesis of the middle class in Melbourne by exploring two types of sites. The first of these are located on the Commonwealth Block site, where documentary records (rate books, land titles, and probate inventories) have allowed us to identify houselots occupied by people whose job status and income levels can be defined as middle class.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479308">16</xref></sup> Importantly, many of these people began their residence on or quite close to the Commonwealth Block as working-class migrants to Melbourne. The transformation of their social circumstances (marked by the accumulation of capital and property) was frequently marked by their moving from “slums” such as “Little Lon” in central Melbourne to the new suburbs being created outside the core of the city after the 1850s. However, many of this aspirational group remained in the city until the late nineteenth century. Our goal is to compare assemblages from sites within the Commonwealth Block, deriving from locations clearly definable as working class, with those from locations occupied by people who would no longer have defined themselves as such (or whose job status or financial circumstances meet our definition of middle class).</p>
<p>This “autocthonous” middle class is contrasted with a second group made up of middle-class migrants from Britain arriving during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. These new arrivals most frequently settled in the new suburbs. These suburban dwellings provide the second site type for the project. Our goal is to excavate assemblages that might sensibly be compared to those already identified at the Commonwealth Block. Ultimately, we hope to provide archaeological information that would support social histories of the middle class in Australia that explore at least two of the pathways of such a significant social transformation.</p>
<p>Although the project is in its infancy, it holds out the prospect of an increasing sophistication of analysis and interpretation of properly integrated archaeological and historical data sets. Thus, our original goal of seeking ways to tell stories about the literally millions of artifacts locked away in museum basements all over Australia provided the impetus for more than fifteen years of excavation and analysis, and led to both methodological and theoretical developments in Australian historical archaeology. That journey has also involved a change of focus: from deploying the evidence of archaeology to further explore the content of concepts such as “the slum,” to considering how historical archaeologists might engage more broadly with social histories of the city.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The analysis of assemblages derived from earlier research at “Little Lon” and the more recent work on the Cumberland and Gloucester Streets sites (which has been partially reported here) and on other sites in Sydney and Melbourne, has allowed us to establish whether there were similar patterns of residence, occupancy, ethnicity, and community life in two different cities on the edge of the modern world. However, in doing this we have come to understand the complex and ambiguous nature of urban archaeological deposits from the mid- to late-nineteenth century, and more fully to appreciate that comparison between sites, cities, and continents is neither straightforward nor innocent. Although it is not yet possible to draw definitive conclusions about “life at the social and geographical margins,” we have greatly expanded our understanding of the historical archaeology of specific sites within those cities, and contributed to the construction of new stories about people and places. At a more general level, we have also clearly identified some of the major questions that will continue to drive our research in Australia and in London, and further characterize comparisons between contemporaneous sites in Australia, England, and North America. Here are just a few of many examples.</p>
<p>First, the question of how to understand domestic assemblages. This implies a great many subsidiary questions such as, What are the vectors of assemblage formation in nineteenth-century cities? How did people acquire goods, what did they cost, and what was the nature of consumer demand? Was social emulation a dominant force in the creation of demand? Is there such a thing as a typical poor, working-class, middle-class, or artisan domestic assemblage?</p>
<p>Second, the question of what roles cities have played in the movement of goods from center to periphery and vice versa, and in the distribution of those goods to other population centers. In this reading, center and periphery exist at regional, national, and global scales. The operation of Sydney, Melbourne, or indeed London in terms of their hinterlands is one matter, but the interaction of cities within countries and between cities on a global scale is really only now appearing on the agenda of urban historical archaeology.</p>
<p>Third, the question of what roles cities have played in the movements of people, either from the metropolitan core to the periphery, or from the countryside into cites. This last question has itself become the inspiration for new archaeological research into the consequences of immigration, both in Australia and in source countries such as England and Ireland. This is not only about exploring conventional issues of how colonies become nations and English people (for example) become Australians, but also about considering the consequences of immigration for sundered families and sundered communities, through an investigation of memory through written and oral sources and, of course, material culture at both ends of the immigration process.</p>
<p>To develop the kinds of methodologies necessary to exploit this broader comparative agenda, we must acknowledge and respond to the complexity of the landscape we are trying to interpret. The integration of history and archaeology occurs at many levels, and in some cases, such as at 124 Cumberland Street in “The Rocks,” rigorous analytical comparison is best teamed with individual stories—speculative though they may be—to explore fully the archaeology of the modern city. Conversely, analyses of historical data (such as the mean value of building stock in a given area) and individual artifacts (such as the appearance of “high quality” wares) may be a more appropriate level at which to integrate archaeologically derived information, be it at the household, excavation site, or other scale. We must employ all the armory of archaeological enquiry—both deductive and inductive reasoning, attention to the detail of both documentary and archaeological datasets, and a commitment to their effective integration—to make a significant contribution to the histories of modern cities. It is that capacity to capture simultaneously complexity and simplicity that provides us with an interpretive landscape where we can pursue the tangled web of local and transnational variables that create both the specificity of place and their generalization through comparison and contrast. A new world beckons.</p>
