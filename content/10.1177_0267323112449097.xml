<abstract>
<p>This study analyzes the role of media type, political institutions and type of news on the use of episodic, thematic, economic consequences, human interest and conflict frames when reporting economic news during seven elections in Bulgaria for the period 1990–2009. Analyzing 543 news stories from six newspapers, the authors find that thematic and economic consequences framing are determined both by the type of economic policy that is reported and by the type of newspaper that is publishing the story. The frequency of human interest framing is also affected by the kind of economic news that is the focus of the news story as well as partially by the broader political environment; such framing is also used more frequently in stories reporting highly contentious economic issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The existence of independent media is a vital component of any democratic society, contributing to higher levels of political and civil liberties. Free media are also instrumental for economic development, as shown by the positive correlations between media penetration in society and national wealth measured in gross domestic product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112449097">World Bank, 2002</xref>). While there is no doubt among scholars and policy-makers that free and independent media are important for both political and economic development, the question of how media portray policies related to economic and political development has not been studied extensively. A large body of research on how media frame economic issues such as poverty, unemployment, or currency adoption has been conducted in western countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112449097">de Vreese et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">Iyengar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323112449097">Iyengar and Kinder, 1987</xref>), yet framing studies in the post-communist countries are virtually non-existent. The question of how the media frame economic policies is especially relevant in the post-communist world where newly established democracies underwent rapid and socially painful reforms, despite widespread public opinion opposing such changes, and despite cases of electoral victories by political parties nominally opposing the establishment of capitalist economies. Another unique contribution of this research is the inclusion of organizational characteristics such as media specialization and market constraints, alongside institutional factors such as type of government and electoral systems, to offer a richer frame-building analysis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323112449097">Vliegenthart and Van Zoonen (2011)</xref> have recently pointed out, such multi-level analysis remains rare.</p>
<p>Against this background, the goal of the present study is to (1) investigate how economic issues are framed by the news media in post-communist Bulgaria and (2) empirically test what factors affect economic news framing in Bulgarian print media. In contrast to much of the previous framing research that simply focuses on micro-level factors, this study considers the influence of both meso- and macro-level determinants. Overall, we analyze 543 news stories from six national newspapers, including general news, political and economic newspapers, over a 20-year period: 1990–2009. We start in the next section by briefly summarizing the economic policy issues that were salient during each of the seven post-communist elections in Bulgaria. The following section develops the analytical framework for the study, highlighting a set of media and institutional factors that affect news framing. The research design section is followed by a multivariate analysis on the determinants of news framing. The concluding section discusses the implications of our findings and places this research in the context of framing studies conducted in other countries and regions.</p>

<title>Elections and types of economic policies in Bulgaria since 1990</title>
<p>During the communist rule, which lasted for 45 years, Bulgaria had one of the most closed and controlled economies in the Soviet bloc. Its Communist Party did not undertake any substantive changes in the national economic system until the policies of <italic>perestroika</italic> promoted in the mid-1980s by the Soviet leader Gorbachev. Thus, the tasks of economic transformation after 1989 were substantial, and further aggravated by the loss of Bulgaria’s largest export market, the Soviet Union, and by the instability in neighboring Yugoslavia, which cut off Bulgaria’s export routes to Western Europe. These obstacles, combined with a volatile political system, led to delayed and somewhat sporadic policies of economic transformation, which could be grouped in three categories.</p>
<p><italic>Price liberalization</italic>, or the removal of government control over prices, dominated much of the early years of transformation and the first three election campaigns, in 1990, 1991 and 1994. The process of removing state control of prices started shortly before the 1991 elections, through a Polish-style shock therapy program, but it was reversed after the 1994 elections when a socialist-led government introduced price controls and reduced subsidized prices. The liberalization process continued after the 1997 elections and prices were liberalized fully shortly thereafter. Price liberalization issues were largely absent from subsequent election campaigns, with the exception of those for fuel, electricity and transportation, which although free from government intervention remained under monopoly control.</p>
<p>Issues of <italic>privatization</italic> were among the most contentious economic reforms in Bulgarian politics and included the sale of state assets in large and small business ventures as well as the restitution of property and land nationalized by the Communist Party in the 1940s. Similar to price liberalization, privatization also began between the first two free elections and also experienced a reversal between 1994 and 1997. Yet, serious efforts to find buyers for the major state assets did not begin until after the 1997 elections, thus privatization news was present during all election campaigns covered in this study. Most state assets, including banks, were privatized by 2001, and thus the last two election campaigns included in this study, in 2005 and 2009, respectively, covered issues regarding the sale of the last few remaining state ventures, such as the national airline, electrical grid company and train network. After 2001, governments remained involved in privatization indirectly by supervising the implementation of legislation that was already adopted. The only exception was the update of the privatization law during the 2005–2009 period in preparation for accession to the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>The set economic policies concerning <italic>institutional reforms</italic> include a wide range of activities such as competition and bankruptcy laws, restructuring of the banking system, establishing a stock exchange and adapting legislation in line with EU requirements. While such reforms were part of the discussion regarding the role of the state in economic policy, efforts towards institutional reform were sporadic prior to 1997. In the earlier years of transition, particularly during the 1991 elections, institutional reforms were limited to introducing a value added tax (VAT) and passing the bankruptcy law and the civil code legislation. Additional efforts were made after the 1994 elections, with the establishment of the stock exchange, the Securities Commission and passing the law on securities. The most significant aspects of institutional reforms related to implementing a currency board, and later preparing the legislation related to the economic and monetary aspects of EU membership, were dominant during the 1997, 2001 and 2005 election campaigns.</p>

<sec id="section3-0267323112449097">
<title>Media framing</title>
<p>Since the primary focus here is on how the media in Bulgaria portrayed economic policy reforms, media framing presents the most appropriate theoretical framework for this study. Broadly, news frames refer to the organization of news stories and their emphasis on certain salient elements in the media text at the exclusion of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323112449097">Entman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">Iyengar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112449097">Scheufele, 1999</xref>). According to one of the most popular definitions of framing, frames have several functions: they can define problems or issues, offer a causal interpretation of the problem/issue and suggest a certain moral evaluation or treatment recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323112449097">Entman, 1993</xref>: 52). Thus, frames are consequential and influence people’s understanding, opinions and attitudes toward issues and events.</p>
<p>The rich literature on framing theory makes a distinction between two types of frames: media frames, which are located in the media text, and audience frames, which are cognitive patterns or schemata that individuals hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112449097">Scheufele, 1999</xref>). There is an important connection between the two, as has been shown in prior research on frame-setting and frame-building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323112449097">Scheufele and Scheufele, 2010</xref>). One of the key propositions in framing research is that media framing significantly influences audience framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112449097">Cappella and Jamieson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323112449097">Iyengar, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323112449097">Nelson and Kinder, 1996</xref>). As Cappella and Jamieson state, even ‘subtle changes in the way news stories are framed can affect consumers’ responses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323112449097">1996</xref>: 71). Framing effects, however, may differ among individuals depending on personal knowledge, characteristics and experience with the issue at hand. Often it is the interaction between media frames and previous experiences that shapes people’s attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112449097">D’Angelo and Kuypers, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>From a social constructivist perspective, the media provide frames of reference for the audience, which then suggest certain interpretations of events or imply certain connections between issues. Framing theory has been applied to the media coverage of many different types of issues or events – for example, unemployment, elections, wars, EU policies such as enlargement and adoption of the euro, or social issues such as crime or protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112449097">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112449097">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112449097">Cappella and Jamieson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323112449097">de Vreese and Semetko, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">Iyengar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323112449097">Semetko and Valkenburg, 2000</xref>). Yet the vast majority of this research has been conducted in the United States or Western Europe, while framing research in Central and Eastern Europe is extremely rare (exceptions are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323112449097">Dimitrova and Postelnicu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112449097">Dobek-Ostrowska and Lódzki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323112449097">Raycheva and Dimitrova, 2008</xref>). Another reason for studying media framing in post-communist Bulgaria is the fact that it offers a unique opportunity for scholars to observe how the newly found press freedom coupled with the opening up of the political and economic systems affected media coverage. The Bulgarian press quickly transitioned from a mouthpiece of the government to a pluralistic and often critical coverage of official policies, a process that was certainly influenced by the simultaneous opening of political, economic and media systems in the country. Finally, this research project may inform studies of media framing in other Central and Eastern European countries, all of which underwent the same processes of political, economic and media liberalization. In particular, Bulgaria compares well with Romania in terms of the strictness and isolation of its past communist regime, with Poland, in terms of the instability of its party system, and with the Baltic countries, which also had currency boards established in the 1990s. Thus, the findings of this study, though limited to one country for linguistic reasons, would be generalizable to other post-communist countries with similar historical background.</p>
<p>Another area where framing research needs development is in providing empirical evidence to support the theoretical link between frame determinants and media frames. Previous studies, although rarely testing for effects, have identified a range of factors that can impact framing. Scheufele, for example, argued that there are at least five broad factors that impact media framing, namely ‘social norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, pressures of interest groups, and ideological or political orientation of journalists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112449097">1999</xref>: 109). The interaction between these broad factors significantly impacts the frame-building process. Others have argued that the main determinants of media frames are the characteristics of the political and media system in which the news media operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323112449097">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323112449097">Strömbäck and Dimitrova, 2006</xref>). Thus, antecedents of media frames fall into three categories: <italic>individual-level factors</italic> such as the personal characteristics of journalists; <italic>organizational factors</italic>, including organizational constraints, journalistic norms and values, news reporting conventions and media routines; and <italic>system-level factors</italic> such as the media system, including the dominant press model, and the political system, and the type of electoral system and government composition, which together influence how the media frame issues or events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112449097">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323112449097">Shoemaker and Reese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323112449097">Tuchman, 1978</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323112449097">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Typically, the impact of system-level factors such as dominant media model and type of electoral system would be most evident when comparing media framing across countries with different system-level characteristics, since those two factors would often remain the same within a particular country. This is not the case for Bulgaria, however, as well as other post-communist countries, where both the political and media systems underwent major transformations in the period following the end of the Cold War. Additionally, Bulgaria used three different electoral systems during the 20-year period we studied. Thus, the Bulgarian media present us with the opportunity to see how system-level factors influence news framing.</p>
<p>The development of post-communist media could best be described as having transitioned from a strict communist press model to a libertarian, market-driven press model. The transition from a non-profit media to a strictly commercial media system led to a new reporting style, a shift from an in-depth and generally abstract reporting to more sensational, superficial, conversational and easily digestible stories. All commercial media that were established after the end of communism followed this trend. As a result, newspapers as well as television were often criticized for not providing enough background information on stories, especially those dealing with economic policies, and only ‘scratching the surface’. These general changes of the dominant media model may be likely lead, in Iyengar’s terminology, to a transition from thematic media framing to predominantly episodic coverage of economic policies, that is, coverage devoid of context and background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">Iyengar, 1991</xref>). Thematic framing, which offers more in-depth coverage, provides more context around issues and links them to broader societal processes, would be less frequently used. However, framing studies typically examine the use of thematic or episodic framing in television news (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323112449097">Iyengar 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112449097">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323112449097">Iyengar and Kinder, 1987</xref>). Additionally, there are no previous framing studies of communist media to form expectations of how framing will be applied to a different media model and whether the use of different frames will change over time, once the political and media systems complete the transition process. Therefore, we begin with a general research question about the relative dominance of episodic versus thematic framing in the media coverage of economic news:</p>
<list id="list1-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>RQ1</italic>: How frequently did Bulgarian print media rely on thematic and episodic framing respectively in their coverage of economic news?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As stated in the literature review, the characteristics of the media organization significantly influence how the news is framed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112449097">Scheufele, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323112449097">Shoemaker and Reese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323112449097">Tuchman, 1978</xref>). Therefore, it is also important to examine the impact of organizational factors, or how differences between news organizations in terms of their news focus (general news versus specialized news outlets) and audience size (low versus high circulation) affect media framing. We posit that both of these organizational factors will influence the framing of economic policies in Bulgarian media. The differences between general interest media and specialized media, while widely acknowledged, have generally been overlooked as antecedents of media framing. Clearly, general interest newspapers have a different mission and focus compared with special interest newspapers such as those specializing in business and economic news. Due to their different organizational focus, one might expect specialized economic newspapers to offer a deeper level of analysis and more thematic coverage of economic reforms compared with other newspapers. In addition to differences in the use of contextual framing, it is expected that general interest and specialized media will employ the economic consequences frame to a different extent. More specialized newspapers would be more likely to provide an analysis of the long-term economic consequences of economic policies and reforms than general news dailies.</p>
<list id="list2-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H1</italic>: Specialization of the media outlet will be associated with more frequent use of thematic framing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: Specialization of the media outlet will be associated with more frequent use of economic consequences framing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another difference between general news media and specialized media is their target audience, which leads to different organizational pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112449097">Scheufele, 1999</xref>). A newspaper with a specialized focus would appeal to a smaller target audience and would thus frame issues in a different way compared with a newspaper that has to appeal to a general national audience in a competitive media market. One way in which the media have been known to increase their appeal to general audiences is making the coverage personally relevant by engaging the reader directly with first-person accounts of events or by emphasizing human interest aspects of stories. In an effort to reach a broad audience, the general news dailies with the highest circulation will thus be more likely to provide personalization of news stories and employ a human interest frame in economic news coverage.</p>
<list id="list3-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H3</italic>: Higher newspaper circulation will be associated with more frequent use of human interest framing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Similarly, the type of economic policy that is reported in a news story is likely to affect the type of framing that is used in the story. Price liberalization and privatization have a pronounced, immediate and adverse impact on citizens while the effects of institutional reforms are long-term, and generally not immediately observable. Thus, in their search for relevance and audience, the media will be more likely to use the human interest frame when topics of price liberalization and privatization are discussed. Similarly, the privatization of state assets in Bulgaria, especially land, was a very contentious issue, leading to significant wealth redistribution and societal conflict. Therefore, stories regarding privatization issues would be more likely to utilize a conflict frame.</p>
<list id="list4-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H4</italic>: A higher number of stories on price liberalization and privatization will be associated with more frequent use of human interest framing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H5</italic>: A higher number of stories on privatization will be associated with more frequent use of conflict framing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another group of factors that impacts media framing is related to the nature of the democratic political system. One basic yet fundamental distinction between democracies reflects the extent of representation captured in a country’s political institutions. In one version of democracy, the majoritarian type, government is limited to representing only the majority of people, while a consensus democracy aims at including as many people as possible in the political process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323112449097">Lijphart, 1999</xref>). While the institutional differences between majoritarian and consensus democracies and their impact on policy are widely studied in comparative politics, there is much less written on the impact of different political arrangements on media coverage of public policies. Following the theoretical expectation that in a consensus type democracy there is no clear distinction between political winners and losers, and cooperation among elites is necessary for the functioning of government, we assume that the lower level of societal conflict is also reflected in the way media report on policies, especially contentious policies dealing with a transition from a state-run to capitalist economy.</p>
<p>Of course, most democracies do not neatly fall into one of two categories, majoritarian or consensus, and their institutions to some extent approximate one of the two paradigms. Studying the impact of political institutions within a single country over a specific period of time is also problematic unless the institutional rules governing a political system change over time. Such is the case of Bulgaria, which went from a president elected by the legislature to a directly elected one, and changed its electoral system three times in the last 20 years. Therefore, to capture variations within Bulgaria’s political system, we examine the number of parties in government and the type of electoral system and their influence on the media framing of economic policies. These two indicators are among the most commonly used to capture the nuanced differences between and within democracies. Put differently, majoritarian democracies tend to be characterized by the less proportional, winner-takes-all, electoral system, which in turn is associated with fewer legislative and governing parties. Consensus systems, on the other hand, tend to have more proportional electoral systems, often resulting in several parties winning seats in the legislature and participating in coalition governments. Policy-making in such systems by necessity requires compromise and consensus building. We expect that media coverage of events and economic news would reflect the degree of consensus that is prevalent at the level of political institutions.</p>
<list id="list5-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H6</italic>: Higher proportionality of the electoral system will be associated with less frequent use of conflict framing in the media.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H7</italic>: An increase in the effective number of parties in government will be associated with less frequent use of conflict framing in the media.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although we formulated some expectations about the influence of the number of parties in government on conflict framing, the relationship between a more consensus-driven political environment and human interest framing is less clear. Therefore, we pose the following research question:</p>
<list id="list6-0267323112449097" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>RQ2</italic>: Is there an association between the effective number of parties in government and the use of human interest framing in economic news coverage?</p></list-item>

<title>Data description</title>
<p>For this analysis we code 543 news articles focused on reporting economic news collected from six Bulgarian newspapers (<italic>24 Chassa, Dneven Trud, Democratsia, Duma, Pari</italic> and <italic>Kapital</italic>) two weeks prior to each of the seven democratic elections since 1990. The newspapers <italic>24 Chassa</italic> and <italic>Dneven Trud</italic> were selected since they represent the two national dailies with the widest circulation. <italic>Democratsia</italic> and <italic>Duma</italic> were chosen as the newspapers of the two leading political parties, the Union of Democratic Forces and the Bulgarian Socialist Party, respectively. Finally, <italic>Pari</italic> and <italic>Kapital</italic> are the most reputable and widely read economic newspapers. As not all of the news outlets analyzed here were published for the entire 1990–2009 period, there are a total of 35 newspaper/years in the dataset. Although economic news is covered throughout the year, there are two reasons why focusing on election periods is justified in this study. Economic restructuring and the associated human and political costs were by far the most salient electoral issues in the post-communist countries. With almost universal support for democracy, human rights, as well as for accession to the EU in the region, political parties in Central and Eastern Europe were most distinct on their positions on economic issues. Moreover, those distinctions became most pronounced during election campaigns, when parties formulated and articulated their positions on the three aspects of economic policy discussed above. Subsequently, media coverage of economic news during these periods provides the most appropriate venue for investigating how economic news is framed.</p>
<p>An average of 13 economic news stories were published per newspaper and election year, ranging from two stories in 2005 in <italic>Dneven Trud</italic> to 100 stories in 2009 also in <italic>Dneven Trud</italic>. The peak of pre-election coverage of economic news was in 1997, one of the most dramatic years in Bulgaria’s economic transformation. An average of 20 economic news stories were published in 1997, with the then-opposition party daily (<italic>Democratsia</italic>) printing 30 stories over the two-week pre-election period. Newspapers also vary with respect to the average number of economic news stories printed, ranging from eight in <italic>Duma</italic> to 29 stories in <italic>Dneven Trud</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323112449097">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>As dependent variables we use the percentage of stories in each newspaper and for each election year that adopt thematic/episodic, economic consequences, human interest or conflict frames. These generic media frames were selected for several reasons. First, they offer greater internal validity as they are based on a large body of previous framing research. Second, using widely accepted generic frames allows replication of our study in different contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112449097">de Vreese, 1995</xref>, for more details).</p>
<p>Individual articles including news, interviews and opinion pieces are the unit of analysis and the four frames are coded as nominal variables on a presence/absence basis per article. We are interested in the impact of organizational and system-level factors on how the print media cover economic news, rather than on how news is reflected in each individual news story. Thus, for the purposes of the analysis we aggregate the news story level data into newspaper/years. Intercoder reliability testing was completed by two coders, both native speakers of Bulgarian, on 5% of the articles. For all framing variables of interest in this content analysis, percentage agreement ranged between 82 and 93%. Cohen’s kappa, one of the more stringent methods for assessing intercoder reliability, was then used to assess reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323112449097">Riffe et al., 1998</xref>). Coefficients ranged between .63 and .71 for the same variables.</p>

<sec id="section7-0267323112449097">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>As explanatory factors, we use the type of print media, its circulation size, the economic policy that is the primary focus of each news story, and the nature of political institutions in post-communist Bulgaria for each pre-election cycle for the period 1990–2009. For the purpose of the statistical analysis, newspapers with wide circulation (<italic>24 Chassa</italic> and <italic>Dneven Trud</italic>) are coded as 1, the rest as 0. Similarly, the specialized economic news outlets (<italic>Pari</italic> and <italic>Kapital</italic>) are coded as 1, the other newspapers as 0. As the source for the effective number of parties (ENP) we use the Electoral Indices dataset compiled by Michael Gallagher,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323112449097">3</xref></sup> which utilizes the widely used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323112449097">Laasko and Taagepera (1979)</xref> formula to calculate ENP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267323112449097">4</xref></sup> During the 1990 and 2009 elections, Bulgaria had a mixed electoral system, combining the results from plurality single member districts with those from separately created and larger districts under proportional representation (PR) rules. For these years, the electoral system variable is coded as 0. For the rest of the elections, a PR system was used and these years are coded as 1. Finally, as another proxy measure for the type of political environment, we use the ENP measure discussed above. To capture the impact of type of economic policy on frame use, we also calculate the percentage of stories for each newspaper/year that report only on price liberalization and privatization, and only on privatization, respectively.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112449097">Table 1</xref> shows the variation in the use of different frames by newspaper and election year. As expected episodic framing is more frequently used than thematic framing – in fact, it was dominant in 67% of the overall coverage. Economic consequences framing is the second most frequently used type of frame, with the two specialized weeklies, <italic>Kapital</italic> and <italic>Pari</italic>, employing it more often than the other newspapers, in 75% and 88% of their stories, respectively. Somewhat surprisingly, only 4% of the stories use human interest framing, with no noticeable variation among newspapers. The use of conflict framing is also low, 14% of all cases, with <italic>Democratsia</italic> printing the highest percentage of stories using a conflict frame, 27%. What is also interesting to note is that there is no significant variation in the use of thematic or episodic frames over time, indicating that the print media in Bulgaria used a consistent approach to economic news reporting for 20 years. The use of the conflict frame, however, spiked in the first years of transition and as negotiations for accession to the EU intensified, two highly contentious periods in Bulgarian politics. Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112449097">Table 1</xref> shows that the use of economic consequences framing steadily increased over time as the economic news became more complex.</p>

<title>Prevalence of episodic framing</title>
<p>The first research question asks whether episodic framing will be more prevalent than thematic framing in Bulgarian print media. To answer this question, we conduct paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests to evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences between the percentage of episodic framing and thematic framing within each media outlet. The one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests estimated with Stata 11.1 indicate not just the difference between the means of the two groups but also the direction of the difference, with results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323112449097">Table 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267323112449097">5</xref></sup> For three of the newspapers, <italic>24 Chassa, Democratsia</italic> and <italic>Dneven Trud</italic>, as well as for the overall sample, the <italic>t</italic>-statistics show that episodic framing is more frequently used than thematic framing. For the other three newspapers, the two specialized weekly publications, <italic>Kapital</italic> and <italic>Pari</italic>, as well as the daily publication of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, <italic>Duma</italic>, there is no statistical difference between the two types of framing.

The use of human interest framing is expected to be affected by the circulation of the media outlet (H3) and the type of issues that are covered (price liberalization and privatization) (H4).

<p>The first hypothesis states that specialized media will be more likely to rely on thematic framing than general interest dailies. Similarly, the second hypothesis states that economic consequences framing will be more common for specialized newspapers compared with general interest media. To test the significance of media type, in the analysis we distinguish between specialized or general, and wide or limited circulation newspapers. The regression results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323112449097">Table 3</xref> confirm these two expectations, showing support for both H1 and H2. The results indicate that both thematic (H1) and economic consequences framing (H2) is significantly higher for specialized newspapers than for general news dailies. The next hypothesis predicts that human interest framing will be used more frequently by wide circulation newspapers than in specialized (i.e. low circulation) newspapers. However, the regression results show that newspaper circulation does not matter for determining the frequency of human interest framing. Thus, hypothesis 3 is not supported.</p>
<p>In evaluating how the kind of economic news that is reported shapes the framing of a news story, we distinguish between two sets of articles. First, we group together news stories that focus on price liberalization and privatization and confirm the expectation that as reporting on such issues intensifies, the use of human interest framing also increases, as predicted by hypothesis 4. We also distinguish between news reports regarding privatization and all others, and show that a higher percentage of stories on privatization results in a greater use of conflict framing, confirming hypothesis 5. The multivariate analysis confirms that the use of both economic consequences framing and conflict framing is determined at least partially by the kind of economic policy that is reported on.</p>
<p>Of the two political system variables capturing level of consensus, the type of electoral system does not significantly affect the use of conflict framing (H6). The other more direct indicator of a consensus type political environment, the effective number of parties in government, does not play a role in the frequency of conflict framing (H7) either. Thus, hypotheses 6 and 7 are not supported.</p>
<p>To evaluate research question 2, regarding the linkages between the effective number of parties in government and the frequency of human interest framing, we calculate the correlations, by newspaper, between the two variables. For two newspapers <italic>24 Chassa</italic> and <italic>Kapital</italic>, there is a very strong positive and statistically significant correlation between the two factors, .92 and .94, respectively. No such relationship exists for the other four newspapers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study tested the influence of system-level and organizational-level factors on media framing of economic news in the Bulgarian press. In particular, we investigated how the dominant media model, type of media, circulation size, type of economic reform and political system characteristics impacted the framing. The study included all economic news articles published before each of Bulgaria’s free and democratic elections since 1990 (a 20-year period) in leading national newspapers as well as the main political and economic newspapers. Our results show that, as expected for print media in a new democracy, episodic framing of economic news stories is more prevalent than thematic framing. This is reflective of the dominant reporting style of news coverage that emerged in the post-communist transition from a communist to libertarian, market-driven press model. Thus, our findings support the linkage between dominant press model and media framing. They also suggest that the average Bulgarian reader was exposed to economic news coverage that lacked in-depth analysis and context. Additionally, while there is some variation in the use of different frames among newspapers, we do not observe significant changes over time in how economic news is covered, thus implying that the print media in Bulgaria have not undergone significant development over the past 20 years and continue to use reporting that focuses primarily on an easily processed, episodic style of framing, at least in the case of economic news. It will be important to examine in future research whether this pattern of coverage holds true for other types of news.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding that sheds light on the framing of economic news in post-communist Bulgaria is the influence of type of newspaper on the coverage of economic reform. The analysis confirms the expectation that the specialized print media utilize thematic and economic consequences framing more frequently than news media aimed at more general audiences. This finding supports claims that organizational factors such as the primary focus of the media organization (e.g. economic news versus general news) significantly impact how the same issue is framed by the news media. The economic press was more likely to provide thematic framing and, by extension, give its readers a better understanding of the complexities of economic reform during the post-communist transition. This finding is related to traditional journalism conventions of what specialized media are supposed to do. In this respect, by filling the in-depth coverage void left by the wide circulation media, the specialized print media in Bulgaria are functioning in a similar way to elite national newspapers in more established democracies.</p>
<p>While the study confirmed the impact of dominant press model and organizational focus, it failed to show substantial support regarding the impact of political institutions on media framing. The extent to which political institutions reflect a higher level of consensus democracy matters only in the case of human interest framing and only in two of the newspapers. The other measure of consensus democracy, however, i.e. type of electoral system, does not seem to play a role in explaining the use of the conflict frame. While surprising, this finding may be related to the fact that the content analysis focused only on economic news; examining the influence of political institutions on the coverage of politics, which we leave for future research, might provide some different patterns of influence.</p>
<p>Finally, the type of economic reform also emerged as a significant predictor of media framing. In particular, an increase in the share of stories about those economic policies that have immediate and significant impact on voters and readers is associated with an increase in the use of human interest framing. Our study also found that the use of conflict framing increases as reporting about highly contentious policies (such as privatization) increases. The impact of type of economic news on frame use implies that media are sensitive to the perception that news coverage might leave in their readers, thus tailoring the framing of the story to their audience, i.e. use of human interest framing when the news would resonate with readers and use of conflict framing when reporting on divisive issues. It leads us to conclude that certain types of stories lend themselves more to human interest and conflict framing. It may be debatable whether this is a positive to negative trend: for instance, focusing on conflict may steer the audience away from other aspects of the news report, but it also may make it more memorable and accessible. Since cognitive accessibility is one of the main mechanisms through which media frames become effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323112449097">Scheufele and Scheufele, 2010</xref>) this type of framing may be more consequential from a media effects perspective.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, this study provides much needed empirical evidence of how system-level and organizational factors affect which frames are promoted by the news media. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323112449097">Vliegenthart and Van Zoonen (2011)</xref>, such multi-level framing analysis remains rare, despite the proliferation of framing research. The inclusion of media specialization and market constraints alongside political system factors in the present study allows scholars to determine higher level influences on the news and thus makes a unique contribution to the literature on frame-building processes. Our analysis, among the first to focus on news framing in a post-communist country, showed that the type of media organization, its dominant focus and type of economic reform are among the strongest determinants of media framing. Such insights are particularly relevant for future studies of media coverage within a country and caution against making broad generalizations about media coverage based only on one or two national dailies. Indeed, the organizational focus of each media outlet may inadvertently influence its framing of economic policy and beyond.</p>
<p>While scholarly analysis on framing is well established in western media, very few such studies have been conducted in the newer post-communist democracies. These countries, which went from state-controlled to capitalist markets virtually overnight, provide an ideal laboratory for the study of how the media frame news stories in rapidly changing political, social and economic environments. Thus, one of the major contributions of the present study is its application of media framing theory to economic news coverage in post-communist Bulgaria. As the communist control of media and the subsequent economic and political transformations were very similar across Central and Eastern Europe, and as Bulgaria shares a number of similarities with other new democracies, this analysis provides insights for the development of post-communist media that go beyond the single country we focus on. A logical next step in this research is to evaluate how membership in the EU has impacted the reporting of economic news in the new democracies.</p>

<p>While the Laasko and Taagepera measure of effective number of parties was initially designed to characterize an entire party system, there is nothing inherent in the formula to prevent one from calculating the effective number of parties in an electoral district, a legislature, or government. In fact the indices that we use are designed to capture variation in the ENP at several levels in the political system thus allowing for a more fine-tuned understanding of its competitiveness.</p>

<p>Although there are several ways to conduct difference of means tests for two or more groups of observations (e.g. ANOVA, <italic>z</italic>-test and <italic>t</italic>-test) considering that in this analysis we are only interested in the difference in two groups (episodic or thematic framing) and the small number of observations (35 overall), the <italic>t</italic>-test procedure is the most appropriate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112449097">Bohrnstedt and Knoke, 1994</xref>).</p>
