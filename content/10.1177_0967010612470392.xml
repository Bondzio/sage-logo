<abstract>
<p>Even though its focus on emancipation purposefully intends to build upon the intellectual legacy of the Frankfurt School, critical security studies has thus far only interpreted the Frankfurt tradition in a circumscribed manner. That is to say, it selectively drew on some concepts from critical theory that are most associated with Jürgen Habermas and Axel Honneth. However, as a result of this emphasis, Booth and Wyn Jones – the original proponents of critical security studies – give too little attention to thinkers such as Theodor W. Adorno. This article demonstrates that a re-engagement with Adorno’s work not only provides a more complete appraisal of the Frankfurt School’s thought, but also might reinvigorate critical security studies as a ‘critical’ approach to security. It proposes that such a result can be achieved by employing Adorno’s <italic>ethics of resistance</italic> and through the development of the philosophical construct of a <italic>constellation</italic> of security.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the study of security has been subject to several significant changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612470392">Floyd, 2007</xref>: 327; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612470392">Wæver, 2004</xref>), and especially in Europe new security theories have been particularly ‘progressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612470392">Floyd, 2007</xref>: 328). An important text entitled <italic>Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory</italic> was published in 1999 and introduced security studies scholars to the critical social theory of the Frankfurt School. In this seminal work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Richard Wyn Jones (1999)</xref> argues that the writings of critical theorists such as Jürgen Habermas and Alex Honneth provide the discipline of international relations with an alternative conceptual framework to that of the traditional study of security in which the state is the primary referent object. In collaboration with Ken Booth and under the designation of ‘critical security studies’ or the ‘Welsh School’ (hereafter referred to as critical security studies), the work of Habermas and Honneth offered the critical approach to security a number of advanced concepts that promised to develop a new paradigm for the theory and practice of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: ix). Most influential has been the concept of emancipation, which critical security studies argues ‘is at the heart of a critical theory of world security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">Booth, 2007</xref>: 100).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612470392">1</xref></sup> Not only does emancipation seek to secure ‘people from those oppressions that stop them from carrying out what they would freely choose to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">Booth, 2007</xref>: 112), but, when considered in a wider sense, it is primarily an approach to international politics.</p>
<p>However, amid the enthusiastic adoption of an ‘emancipation-orientated paradigm’ in the ‘light of Frankfurt School critical theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: ix), those working within critical security studies have only engaged selectively with key works of the Frankfurt School. Such a claim can be substantiated through reference to two key points: First, Wyn Jones provides only a partial treatment of Theodor Adorno – in fact, only using him in conjunction with Max Horkheimer – which leads to a premature dismissal of the author. This is problematic as it makes critical security studies theoretically vulnerable to the scrutiny of social theorists, undermining its own critical theory foundations. Second, a consequence of this is Booth’s overemphasis on emancipation. Although, as Booth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 41) himself concedes, his work adopts Frankfurt School thought for convenience and as a practical orientation, the selective application of critical theory leads to the theoretical dead-end of an overfocus on, or reification of, emancipation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612470392">2</xref></sup> However, this does not have to be the case. As this article will show, Booth and Adorno share key premises, so that Booth’s research can enter into fruitful dialogue with Adornian thought and avoid the pitfalls of emancipation.</p>
<p>This dialogue offers scope for exploration of the limits of Wyn Jones’s and Booth’s interpretation. Moreover, it might provide avenues through which critical security studies can engage with pressing questions in the current study of security, in ways that might not be possible if emancipation is seen as the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of its research agenda. For example, there are questions about reified security knowledge and the role of security professionals (including academics), about the relation between security and liberty, and about the disciplinary boundaries of security studies itself. The investigation of the problem of emancipation will lead the article to raise substantial doubts about the way in which the Frankfurt School tradition has been appropriated by critical security studies. With regard to the first point above, Wyn Jones dismisses the use of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer on the basis of a reading of their <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612470392">Adorno and Horkheimer, 1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470392">Horkeimer’s (2002)</xref> ‘Traditional and Critical Theory’. However, this article contends that an engagement with other works on and by Adorno leads to different conclusions, which actually strengthen the theoretical foundations of critical security studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612470392">3</xref></sup> In this way and in respect to the second point described earlier, the article will show that a more sustained application of Adorno’s thought can overcome the problem presented by the conceptual dominance of emancipation.</p>
<p>With these arguments in mind, the article will briefly outline why the partial treatment of Adorno by Wyn Jones and Booth is problematic. Then – in two steps – it will propose that critical security studies engages with Adorno’s thought. First, by arguing that despite prevalent criticisms that claim that Adorno’s work leads to aporia, negativism and irrationalism, it is possible to bridge the gap between Adorno’s philosophy and the possibility of the good life – or, in this context, security. This can be achieved by employing Adorno’s <italic>ethics of resistance</italic> (developed in the writings of James Finlayson) as an alternative to the all-consuming concept of emancipation. Second, in line with a core principle of Adorno’s work – non-identity thinking – his ethics of resistance is used to derive the philosophical construct of a <italic>constellation</italic> of security, as opposed to a concept of security. Not only is this more attuned to critical social theory, but it also brings out and strengthens the central claims made by critical security studies. Furthermore, this proposed Adornian approach opens up a new – and timely – research agenda for critical security studies.</p>

<sec id="section2-0967010612470392">
<title>Questioning technological determinism</title>
<p>The problem at hand is not Wyn Jones’s reading of Adorno as such, but the choice of Frankfurt School texts with which <italic>Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory</italic> engages. As others have argued before, the prevalent interpretation of the <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic> is to reduce Adorno and Horkheimer’s argument to ‘the selection of key quotations [which] risks serious damage’ and to ignore that it is actually an incomplete work, initially published under the title <italic>Philosophical Fragments</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612470392">Peoples, 2009</xref>: 11–14). The understanding and argumentation of technological determinism is a case in point and central to Wyn Jones’s misreading of the <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic>, allowing him to charge Adorno and Horkheimer with a ‘paralysing relativism in relation to politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 40). In addition to the use of decontextualized quotes that simplify the ideas of Adorno and Horkheimer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612470392">4</xref></sup> this also renders the authors into mere technological determinists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612470392">5</xref></sup> This is mainly due to the equation of Adorno and Horkheimer’s notion of instrumental reason with Andrew Feenberg’s conception of Heideggerian technical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 87; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470392">Thomson, 2000</xref>). The latter is already problematic in itself. Critics have claimed that Feenberg ‘exaggerates Heidegger’s “fatalism” about technology’ owing to his idea of a technological essentialism in Heidegger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612470392">Thomson, 2000</xref>: 203). By contrast, what Heidegger is criticizing is the instrumental treatment of nature that leads to the technological thinking of human beings and the externalization of, and domination over, nature. Contrary to Feenberg’s claim, Heidegger’s analysis of technology is not restricted to what we might conventionally call technology; instead, his notion of ‘technological enframing’ refers to a way of approaching/looking at the world, a ‘mode of revealing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612470392">Lovitt, 1995</xref>: 225). Wyn Jones uses Feenberg’s line of reasoning – opposing instrumental with substantive approaches to technology – a reading that he finds in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612470392">Horkheimer’s (2002)</xref> earlier writings on technology in ‘Traditional and Critical Theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 85). This reading is predicated on the notion that ‘technologies are tools’ that enable their users to meet certain ends more effectively (Horkheimer quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 86). Thus, tools are taken to be neutral in themselves and subservient to societies’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 85–8). However, this is problematic, as Horkheimer drastically revised his view on technology once he had started working with Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 29–30). In distinguishing between an instrumental and a substantive approach to technology and wanting to arrive at a ‘dialectical understanding’ of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 85–8), reading Adorno and Horkheimer through Feenberg’s technological fatalism in this way is to disregard the <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic>’s wider sociocritical claims. Instrumental reason/rationality is a much wider notion and not restricted to technology. Indeed, the latter is only a secondary dimension of (wo)man’s separation from nature, which drives humankind’s self-domination and ever-greater enslavement.</p>
<p>Instrumental reason is primarily concerned with general domination over nature. In Adorno and Horkheimer’s understanding, human beings (not only in their labour but also in their thinking processes, emotions, ‘inner nature’) are caught in the dialectic between being <italic>of</italic> nature and being <italic>external to</italic> it. This is an important point, not only in making the distinction between instrumental reason and technological determinism, but because instrumental reason leads to humanity enslaving itself (inner nature) and not just the domination of outer nature, as argued by Wyn Jones and Feenberg. Although Wyn Jones mentions the distinction between inner and outer nature, he does not discuss their relation to the notion of instrumental reason and how this differs from technological determinism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612470392">6</xref></sup> The latter rests on the premises that technology possesses a certain degree of autonomy from the source that created it and is presented as an independent force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612470392">7</xref></sup> However, the stance that Adorno and Horkheimer are taking is that technology is just the materialized form of instrumental reason and thus cannot possess a logic of its own. Therefore, to claim that Adorno and Horkheimer are deterministic is misleading, ignoring their actual critique of the inner rational self.</p>
<p>Yet, the critique of the rational self is of vital importance to critical security studies, as it cuts to the core of what the referent object is and what it might be threatened by. The critique of rationality questions whether the individual is endangered by the technology that surrounds it or whether the danger does not actually stem from the referent object’s instrumental rationality itself. That is to say, the individual is its own source of insecurity. Arguably, it is only at the latter individual level that it is possible to conceive of security threats that are not framed in terms of national security and interest. Accordingly, the subsequent deepened and broadened security agenda as developed in <italic>Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory</italic>, and by critical security studies more generally,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0967010612470392">8</xref></sup> which seeks to establish the individual as ‘primary referent object’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0967010612470392">9</xref></sup> has no theoretical foundation in a philosophy based in conceptions of external nature. Therefore, threats that emerge on the individual level, precisely the level of Booth’s ultimate referent object, remain unaccounted for. In fact, by adopting Max Horkheimer’s initial arguments about emancipation, Wyn Jones implicitly undermines his own call to incorporate inner nature into security studies via the concept of emancipation.</p>
<p>More precisely, to recognize that what it means to be human is a central aspect of the constitution of security and political communities, and that existing oppressive structures need to be questioned, stands in stark contrast to Wyn Jones’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">1999</xref>: 23) idea that emancipation is ‘the more rational and purposeful utilization of already existing forces of production in order to bring nature under rational human control’. Such a conception perpetuates the dichotomized thinking that humans are external to nature and in the position to dominate. This, however, only gives rise to the oppressive structures that Wyn Jones and Booth wish to emancipate individuals from in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0967010612470392">10</xref></sup> Arguably, to leave such a contradiction unaddressed, diverting attention by stating that none of Adorno’s arguments have been satisfying enough for critical security studies’ critical theory ‘grounding’, seems quite a harsh dismissal on the part of works that engage with Adorno in such a partial way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0967010612470392">11</xref></sup> Addressing inner and outer nature through Adorno’s notion of instrumental reason supports the mounting criticism that critical security studies rests on a shaky theoretical mix of varying Frankfurt School thinkers and fails to ‘flesh out the full implications of linking the study of security to the Frankfurt School tradition’, as indicated by Peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">2011</xref>: 1115). Indeed, when we take a closer look, the inherent contradictions of the theoretical make-up of critical security studies become apparent, among which emancipation is the one that is debated the most by critical security studies interpreters and critics respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0967010612470392">
<title>The problem of emancipation</title>
<p>The overconcentration within critical security studies on emancipation as the prime motivation for transformative change in world politics has attracted justified criticism from both within and outside critical security studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0967010612470392">12</xref></sup> Perhaps the biggest problem arising from critical security studies’ appropriation of emancipation is the latter’s conceptual dominance due to its equation with security. The argument holds that emancipation is problematic because it makes it impossible to conceive any social transformation or progress independently of security reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470392">Aradau, 2004</xref>: 397). In practice, this always turns the struggle for emancipation into a struggle for security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">Peoples, 2011</xref>: 1120; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470392">Aradau, 2004</xref>: 398). Such a circular definition deprives emancipation of its true potential and puts it outside a vision of freedom, instead developing emancipatory conduct around a particular notion of order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612470392">Neocleous, 2008</xref>: 4–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470392">Aradau, 2004</xref>: 397–8). Some have gone as far as to claim that ‘security and <italic>oppression</italic> are two sides of the same coin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612470392">Neocleous, 2008</xref>: 4–5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0967010612470392">13</xref></sup> This criticism of critical security studies’ use of emancipation has been outlined in greater detail by Columba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">Peoples (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612470392">Claudia Aradau (2004)</xref>, Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612470392">Neocleous (2008)</xref> and Hayward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612470392">Alker (2001)</xref>. The salient point that can be retained from this critique is that critical security studies needs to engage with critical theory seriously and to take this engagement beyond a narrow focus on emancipation.</p>
<p>This has certainly already been attempted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">Peoples (2011)</xref>, who, drawing on Herbert Marcuse’s reflections on violence and resistance, analysed and questioned the connections between emancipation and security. Peoples investigates the apparent paradox of the possibility of insecure, painful and dangerous emancipatory processes. With the help of Marcuse, this leads him to question the equivalence of emancipation and security, and his analysis provides an indispensable and helpful critique by a critical theory proponent. However, Peoples’ account is problematic because it fails to address the analytical difficulty of terrorism. More precisely, Peoples’ Marcusian reconceptualization of emancipation – meaning that at times emancipation from violence is violent – can be used easily as a blueprint for legitimizing various forms of terrorism that is nonetheless perfectly coherent with the overall critical security studies tenor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0967010612470392">14</xref></sup> Through acceptance of the possibility of Marcuse’s ‘violence of liberation’ in order to get away from ‘the idea of emancipation as <italic>security</italic>’, acts of terrorism become legitimate, given that forms of terrorism can be seen as violent efforts ‘against the system in order to quash the system’s inherent violence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0967010612470392">15</xref></sup> Thus, Peoples addresses the crucial yet problematic relation between forms of terrorism, social movements and violence, as well as liberation, but seems unable to revise critical security studies and its current use of emancipation. Instead, his approach contributes to Jeroen Gunning’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612470392">2009</xref>: 161) research agenda of ‘broadening terrorism research: putting the context back into violence’. Pointing this out does not deny the perceived emancipatory goal of some terrorist activities, but evoking the idea of violent emancipation is a crucial and controversial move by Peoples (at least in terms of the academic opposition it generates) that needs to be addressed more specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0967010612470392">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, what becomes even more apparent through Peoples’ article is that critical security studies’ use of emancipation, specifically Booth’s ‘emancipatory realism’, filters the Marxian origins of the Frankfurt School notion of emancipation through Kantian idealism, where the focus lies on ‘gradual reforms’ as ‘the only means of approaching the supreme political good’ (Immanuel Kant in <italic>The Metaphysics of Morals</italic>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">Booth, 2007</xref>: 87). It can be argued that this is quite a reductionist view, as it conceives of emancipation as a final goal and <italic>sine qua non</italic> of critical security studies, which stands at odds with Wyn Jones’s statement that emancipation is a ‘process’ rather than ‘endpoint’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0967010612470392">17</xref></sup> As a consequence, there is a serious danger that critical security studies can itself become a ‘prisoner to emancipation, or at least to the equivalence of emancipation with security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">Peoples, 2011</xref>: 1133). This is not remedied by Booth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 113) claim that there exists ‘false emancipation’, as the problem is the theoretical hegemony of the concept of emancipation itself. Therefore, critical security studies needs to be revised in a way that does not run the risk of either an overconcentration on emancipation or the equation of emancipation with security. Peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">2011</xref>: 1134) suggests turning to Michel Foucault and his work on resistance, as this is ‘the appropriate vocabulary’ in critical security studies. Indeed, resistance seems a viable alternative. Yet, the subsequent section of this article will show that this vocabulary can be found in Adorno, which renders it unnecessary to deprive critical security studies of its Frankfurt School foundations. An Adornesque approach makes it possible to translate emancipation into various components, and thereby preserves the initial premises of critical security studies while significantly enhancing and strengthening it at the same time. Ultimately, using Adorno’s work, in particular in reference to <italic>practices of resistance</italic> – a prime concern in Booth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 112) formulation of security – enables the conception of security as <italic>constellation</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0967010612470392">
<title>Engaging Adorno</title>
<p>This section of the article will argue that Adorno’s ethics of resistance allows us to think security anew. In particular, it allows us to develop an approach to security that does not merely avoid harm, but returns to the Aristotelian question of politics, and explores how practices and theories of security might be oriented towards ‘the good life’ without falling prey to the perils of instrumental reason. This is in opposition to the prevailing interpretation of Adorno in critical security studies, which suggests that Adorno has nothing to offer to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 52).</p>
<sec id="section5-0967010612470392">
<title>Problematizing the good</title>
<p>Wyn Jones and Booth argue that Adorno’s supposed philosophical negativism stands most at odds with critical security studies’ emancipatory project because his work rules out any conceptualization of progress and emancipation after Auschwitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>: 49–52). Indeed, Adorno’s negative theology entails an extreme difficulty in accessing the good. Central components of Adorno’s work, such as identity thinking, suggest that it is impossible to conceptualize the good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0967010612470392">18</xref></sup> In other words, it is impossible to have a positive conception of universals like ‘the good’, ‘freedom’ or ‘security’, because to conceptualize is to submit to the logic of identity thinking, subsuming particular instances under a general concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470392">Rose, 1978</xref>: 45). Thus, ‘rationality must treat unlike (unequal) things as like (equal)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612470392">Bernstein, 1991</xref>: 6) so that various particular instances – infinitely substitutable for one another – can be captured by one general concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470392">Rose, 1978</xref>: 44–5). In this way, meanings are fixed and stabilized (especially in the social sciences) in order to make it possible to predict and control certain phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0967010612470392">19</xref></sup> As a result, any concept, including those of security and emancipation, is an instrument of mastery and domination. Peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612470392">2011</xref>: 8) implicitly voices similar criticism, suggesting that emancipation has become equally totalitarian.</p>
<p>Consequently, to advance any conception of the good life (or notions such as security) is to falsify/identify it. More precisely, it is to misconstrue and standardize it by conceptualizing what a good life is and thereby to lose the particularity of the individual everyday life. Further, this mere process of identity thinking is conceptual domination and <italic>evil</italic> according to Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470392">1973a</xref>: 23–4). This has led many critics and defenders of Adorno to label him deterministic, void of any normativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0967010612470392">20</xref></sup> Most pertinently to critical security studies, Booth and Wyn Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">1999</xref>: 53–4) have lamented that Adorno’s philosophy does not provide any practical orientation – that is to say, that it is completely politically withdrawn.</p>
<p>However, one must not use Adorno’s claim that the social world is fundamentally evil<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0967010612470392">21</xref></sup> and his negation of a positive conception of the good as evidence for arguing that there is no room for progress and morality in his work. Even though his thesis that ‘there is no way of living a false life correctly’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0967010612470392">22</xref></sup> was used to picture Adorno as determinist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612470392">Seel, 2011</xref>), it also provides for an alternative, opposite interpretation.</p>

<title>On social unfreedom and insecurity: An ethics of resistance</title>
<p>By evil, Adorno refers to forms of institutionalized unfreedoms. Arguably, this is precisely Booth’s understanding of insecurity: oppressive structures that stop people from ‘carrying out what they would freely choose to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">Booth, 2007</xref>: 112). False life and the evil (administered) social world can be understood in two ways. First, there is no certainty that we can know and do the morally or politically right thing. It is beyond humans’ reach to know that their benign activities generate positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612470392">Bernstein, 2001</xref>: 40–74). In an echo of the <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic>, Finlayson and Bernstein suggest that processes that were emancipatory at first can always turn out to produce even greater domination and ‘enslavement’. For example, outcomes of security practices are far from certain. Second, and crucial to understandings of security, Adorno’s thesis means ‘das Leben lebt nicht’ [life does not live]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0967010612470392">23</xref></sup> – there is no real <italic>living</italic> in a false life and the administered world. Owing to the commodification and administration of the social world, people are unfree subjects because they adjust and accept socially given norms and pursue socially constituted ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>). This leads Adorno to argue that one is not living but only surviving in the late-capitalist world. Worthwhile and valuable ends have been systematically removed and replaced by the means of self-preservation. In this context, it means that security – that is, the good life – has been replaced by seeking the absence of insecurity – obeying and surviving. Indeed, this is echoed by Booth, who suggests that in the contemporary world ‘means are confused with ends’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612470392">Booth 1991</xref>: 319; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">Wyn Jones, 1999</xref>, 114–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612470392">Bernstein, 1991</xref>: 5). More precisely, Booth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612470392">1991</xref>: 319) argues that human individuals’ security should come before the state’s security, but that in the neorealist conception of security people are merely treated as means and that the state has become the end.</p>
<p>According to Adorno, this can be overcome. Specifically, his ethics of resistance suggests dismantling social mechanisms of unfreedom, which had previously been identified as aspects of insecurity. However, in order to access his ethics, it is imperative to outline how it is possible to think about security, approximating the good life, in Adorno’s work. If we start from his criticism of the institutionalization of social unfreedom, what drives unfreedom or insecurity in this context is identity thinking, which amounts to conceptual dominance. Adorno suggests that our thoughts and actions need to be arranged in a way that enables self-conscious non-cooperation with institutionalized unfreedom. Commenting on this reconstruction, Finlayson argues that three ‘virtues’ that allow for moral progress can be found in Adorno’s work: the first prerequisite is ‘autonomy’ (<italic>Mündigkeit</italic>), which refers to the ‘capacity to take a critical stance and to act on it’; the second is ‘humility’ (<italic>Bescheidenheit</italic>), which is the ‘consciousness of one’s own fallibility’; and the third is ‘affection’ or the ‘capacity to be moved by … the fate of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 6–8; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612470392">Freyenhagen, 2011</xref>: 2). Transferred, this means that through the cultivation of these three prerequisites for a good life, security – materialized as the intention to abstract oneself from social control and heteronomy – can be thought and practised. These virtues resonate in the ‘biological materialism’ discussed by Linklater, which refers to the ‘utopian potential’ in the ‘organization of the libidinal and emotional dimensions and collective selves’ (McCarthy and Linklater quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470392">Linklater, 2007</xref>: 188). Being of ‘a normative moral status’, these characteristics make it possible to overcome social unfreedom, oppression and insecurity because they go against the grain of identity thinking, which Adorno saw in norm conformism, obedience and indifference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 7–8). Furthermore, it is crucial that these are personal characteristics, as they directly respond to critical security studies’s ultimate referent object, the individual.</p>
<p>Only as an autonomous (<italic>mündig</italic>) citizen and through ‘the concrete denunciation of the inhuman’ can one criticize and resist the administered world, the institutionalized bad, the ‘countless forms of morality imposed from outside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470392">Adorno, 2010</xref>: 260). Here, Adorno follows Plato to the extent that untruth is an aspect of the bad and this untruth is embodied in the social world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0967010612470392">24</xref></sup> In contrast to the prevalent conception of Adorno, it is possible to make such criticisms within a negative-dialectical framework. Even though Adorno’s work provides a positive conception neither of humanity nor of ‘absolute goods’ and ‘absolute norms’, we nonetheless can and do know intuitively what inhumanity or insecurity is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 8; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612470392">Adorno, 2010</xref>: 260–2). In this vein, Andrew Linklater argues that human beings ‘“may not know” what counts as the “absolute good”, but they have reached some shared understandings about “inhuman” behaviour and about conceptions of the “bad life” that should be resisted and opposed’ (Linklater, paraphrasing Adorno, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470392">Linklater, 2007</xref>: 185). This quite strongly resonates in Booth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 101) <italic>Theory of World Security</italic> when he argues a fundamental point that we can ‘understand what security is by knowing how insecurity feels’. Despite the fact that Booth uses the same derivative method as Linklater, the knowledge that the social world is false or insecure does not presuppose knowledge of what a good and secure world would be like, ‘in much the same way that our immediate knowledge that pain or suffering is bad presupposes no antecedent knowledge of what is pleasurable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0967010612470392">25</xref></sup> Yet, in a similar fashion to how Linklater uses ‘Adorno’s stress on human vulnerabilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470392">Linklater, 2007</xref>: 23), the ‘injurable animal’ and a ‘new categorical imperative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612470392">Linklater, 2007</xref>: 185) as a starting point upon which to ground inquiry into distant suffering and cosmopolitan responsibility, as well as a sociology of global morals, Adorno’s pledge can be used to revise critical security studies.</p>
<p>So far, what is troubling about the ‘negative strategy’ of security that has been described here is that for ‘the good life’ it is not enough to merely prevent the worst, ‘barbarism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0967010612470392">26</xref></sup> Up to this point, Adorno opens the possibility of the good life – here security – by drawing out what should be from the ‘traces of its reflection in the existing untruth’/insecurity of what should not be (paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 10, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470392">Adorno, 2003a</xref>: 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470392">1973a</xref>: 370). This inverted Hegelian dialectic to ensure the moral minimum of ‘never again Auschwitz’ is sufficient in terms of our argument that we need to reconsider the application of Adorno within critical security studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 21). It is not enough, however, to move towards a revised version of critical security studies and security. Indeed, Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470392">1973b</xref>: 45) himself came to find the inverted Hegelian optimism ‘oddly inconsistent’ and insufficient, as this simply prescribes that not wrong or not bad (not insecure) does not equal right or good (secure). Thus, in <italic>Negative Dialectics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470392">Adorno, 1973a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470392">b</xref>) he presents an alternative way of making the good accessible for his normative ethics of resistance. This work is primarily concerned with thinking the <italic>ineffable</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0967010612470392">27</xref></sup> For Adorno, philosophy in general is first and foremost concerned with the ineffable because, in order to avoid being conceptually dominating and thought controlling, it needs a non-discursive or non-conceptual way of accessing the good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470392">Schaap, 2000</xref>: 135–6). The argument goes that the hidden good life – which Adorno referred to as redemption, reconciliation, emancipation, utopia – is located in the ineffable, in what cannot be captured by concepts. Crucially, this means that the good/secure life that is free from oppression cannot be captured by a concept of security either.</p>

<title>Security and the ineffable</title>
<p>Given the above, instead of trying to conceptualize what security is, what being secure means and what the good life is, the philosophy of security can only seek to provide an understanding of these questions through the attempt to think the ineffable. Despite the paradoxical nature of such an attempt, philosophy can access a ‘kind of goodness’ in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 11). An Adornian approach to security accepts that finite categories or concepts cannot capture the infinite nature of security. Arguably, it is the attempt to articulate security without being conceptual that challenges rational thought. More importantly for critical security studies, the process reveals the limits of the knowledge we can have of security.</p>
<p>The advantage of treating security in terms of ineffable insight is that the latter can only be gained or experienced individually. This corresponds with critical security studies’ level of analysis and referent object – that is to say, because ineffable knowledge cannot be said and communicated, it only resides in the individual instances of experiencing security or insecurity. This goes back to Booth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 101) initial claim that we only know of security through our experience of insecurity. Arguably, Adorno and Booth are getting at the same point, which is that ineffable knowledge of security does not depend on saying, representing, defining, conceptualizing security, but rather on experiencing security or insecurity. Adorno explicitly and Booth implicitly acknowledge that there is a danger in giving in to the temptation to think that if the good life or security exists, this would mean that one could say what it consists in. However, that would be identitarian thinking. Instead, Adorno proposes that by gaining ineffable insight into security, individuals relate self-consciously to what actually cannot be said, presented or conceptualized (security).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0967010612470392">28</xref></sup> This is a valuable experience not because it eventually leads to a conception of the good, secure life, but because a self-conscious receptive relation to a particular situation is a valuable experience <italic>in itself</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 16). This is because gaining ineffable knowledge may lead to practices of resistance, given that knowledge is used to initiate purposeful action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612470392">Moore, 1997</xref>: 185). The core principles of critical security studies, as articulated by Booth, logically derive from such a statement. First, ineffable knowledge can form the ‘philosophical anchorage’ that Booth is referring to. Second, such knowledge is a basis for ‘a theory of progress’. Third, it enables ‘practices of resistance’ that are ‘attempting to actualise both nearer-term and longer-term emancipatory goals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">Booth, 2007</xref>: 112). Hence, what Booth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 105) terms the instrumental value of security goes back to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470392">Adorno (2003a)</xref> describes as the instrumental value of ineffable knowledge.</p>
<p>Ultimately, individual ineffable experience is crucial, since it is the only conceivable way in which individuals can think security for themselves. In choosing a type of emancipation and strategies of resistance for themselves, individuals can secure themselves rather than being rendered secure. Thinking of security in terms of the ineffable is of vital importance not only because it avoids conceptual dominance, but also because it identifies the individual as the security actor – not merely as the ultimate referent object – and restores individual human agency. Arguably, any security move that does not emerge out of individual insight and personal decisions about resistance cannot be considered an actual increase in security, but is rather a form of control and governing – remembering Booth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612470392">2007</xref>: 113) ‘false emancipation can come in many guises’.</p>
<p>Therefore, individual practice leads to individual insight and understanding, but the value lies in experience – becoming self-consciously receptive to situations of security/insecurity that cannot be represented in, or by, instrumental reason. Accordingly, there is some intrinsic moral value in the experience of gaining ineffable knowledge because it is a way of being autonomous (<italic>mündig</italic>), self-consciously receptive and able to say no, rather than passively accepting and conforming. The practical manifestation of this experience is in the form of acts of emancipatory resistance. It is at this point that critical security studies can adopt and contribute most fruitfully to Adorno’s ethics – that is, the project of enhancing active resistance to institutionalized forms of oppression. Arguably, Gramscian wars of position led by organic intellectuals as proposed by Wyn Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">1999</xref>: 153–8) are precisely forms of resistance that emerge out of ineffable insight. Thinking about security in this way circumvents the apotheosis of emancipation as security, placing emphasis on various elements that shape experiences and thus form the ineffable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0967010612470392">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0967010612470392">
<title>Towards a security constellation</title>
<p>Crucially, approaching security through the ineffable is not an instance of identity thinking, as it does not reduce security to categorical understandings but maintains the tension between the universal and the particular, between ‘human vulnerabilities’ and individual ineffable insight into instances of insecurity. This correlates with Adorno’s idea of the ‘constellation’, which he understands to be a dynamic interdependence between concepts (<italic>Begriffe</italic>) that in their conjunction illustrate an idea that is not a concept itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0967010612470392">30</xref></sup> More precisely, through reciprocal assignation and alternating critique, concepts are brought into contextual motion, thereby losing their identitarian, fixed meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470392">Adorno, 1973a</xref>: 55–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470392">Schaap, 2000</xref>: 136). The argument, then, is that security is better thought of not as a concept, value or good, but rather as a constellation. As such, it signifies a ‘cluster of changing elements that resist reduction to a common denominator, essential core, or generative first principle’, such as emancipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612470392">Jay, 1984</xref>: 14–15).</p>
<p>More importantly, the ceaseless contextual movement between the constitutive elements demands self-reflexivity of the individual parts. Situating this within critical security theory/practice is not an easy task, however, given that the constellation is a continuous attempt to say what cannot be said. What is at stake in the constellation of security is to approximate the ‘content of the thing’, which is still and always will be concealed, ineffable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470392">Schaap, 2000</xref>: 136). To never reach this ‘thing’ is precisely the point, because philosophy cannot simply replace one conceptual identity with a new one. That is to say, even though the security constellation emerges through the juxtaposition of various ideas related to security, this will not yield a positive conception of what security is. Hence, a security constellation can be seen as a ‘therapeutic process’ in which a concept – such as emancipation or resistance, for example – is constantly working against itself. Significantly, the concept never ceases to be important for the constellation as such, because ‘therapy’ cannot happen without concepts, for ‘only concepts can achieve what a concept prevents’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0967010612470392">31</xref></sup> It is the ‘immanent cohesion’ between the constitutive elements, such as individual understanding, resistance and emancipation, that characterizes the constellation. Importantly, since a security constellation is a reciprocal, reflexive process, the individual elements do not refer to definite fundamental terms that present units to create a whole. A constellation is not a deductive construction/building. Hence, it is not a security <italic>system</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Constellation is not system. Not everything conciliates, not everything works out even in it, but one sheds light on the other, and the figures, which built the individual moments, are a clear symbol and legible script. (Adorno quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470392">Schaap, 2000</xref>: 136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, the security constellation is driven by an ‘anti-systemic impulse’, because ineffable insight, resistance and emancipation cannot be derived from one another, but rather activate and render each other more precise. Furthermore, a security constellation is not fixed, but new elements such as freedom and liberty can enter. Thus, critical security studies revised in the light of Adorno’s philosophy works with the constellation of security, which can be described as a dialectical interplay of various components such as experience, ineffable insight and practices of resistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, grounded in the particularity of experience, security as constellation does not and cannot assume that security is either good or bad. It is the experience of gaining ineffable insight that is valuable in itself and gives rise to a ‘dream of existence without shame’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470392">Adorno, 2003a</xref>: 97) – and by shame Adorno refers to domination, mastery and restraining governance. This implies that the notion of a constellation does not take a teleological approach to security. Even though the changing elements, especially resistance, are ways of not cooperating with the false social world, these practices may well lead to frustration, alienation, isolation and despair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0967010612470392">32</xref></sup> Despite the unique experience of the ineffable, efforts that emerge out of the security constellation may remain unsuccessful or even have the opposite effect of insecurity. For example, there is always a possibility that violent or peaceful resistance might change existing social structures in such a way that individuals end up being more restrained than they were before. This nonetheless leaves core principles of critical security studies untouched – such as the possibility of moral progress or that the increase of one individual’s security can decrease someone else’s.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the practical manifestation of ineffable insight and constellation is Adorno’s ethics of resistance. Moreover, this is a normative ethics, as claimed by Finlayson.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0967010612470392">33</xref></sup> Instead of merely stating what not to do, it entails what should be done. However, as the problem of unsuccessful resistance just highlighted, this ethics does not imply certainty. Instead, it maintains multiple strategies to self-consciously resist institutionalized patterns of social unfreedom and heteronomous behaviour, guided by virtues of <italic>Mündigkeit</italic>, humility and affection:<disp-quote>
<p>The only thing that can perhaps be said is, that the good life today would consist in the shape of resistance against the forms of a false life, which has been seen through and critically dissected by the most progressive minds. (Adorno quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The intrinsic moral value in this ethics lies in the experience of the ineffable. Despite this moral footing, Adorno’s ethic differs from the common use of ethics in a Kantian sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0967010612470392">34</xref></sup> The latter would not be compatible with Adorno’s critique of instrumental reason, since Finlayson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">2002</xref>: 19) remarks that Kantian ethics makes ‘the mistake of trying to stand morality on the sure footing of pure reason’. The value of the ineffable is derived not from the philosophical exercise that leads to the insight in the first place, but through the experience of the unpresentable. In other words, the value is not transferred from the practice of reasoning, which is only the means. In the end, it is in the ineffable that Adorno finds the promise of progress, in the realm of the possible that exceeds the real and the conceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612470392">Adorno, 2003a</xref>: 253).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It was the aim of this article to open up new ways of thinking about security by overcoming the conceptual limits associated with emancipation. In particular, it was the intention to rework and strengthen critical security studies’ theoretical framework, using different aspects of Frankfurt School critical theory. The challenge for critical security studies, it seems, is to approach security and the study of it in a way that acknowledges the infinite nature of security, but is still able to maintain its analytical value, without producing specialist knowledge or identitarian concepts of security. This article proposed an avenue that could lead to such a new approach to security. First, it was argued that critical security studies should be revised in the light of Adorno’s work, in order to show how to overcome the impasse created by an overemphasis on emancipation. The focus was shifted to practices of resistance that emerge out of ineffable knowledge. This theoretical move retains critical theory principles of progress, normativity and resistance, but avoids identity thinking by rejecting the concept of security. Second, it was argued that security should be seen as a constellation, rather than a concept, with the key aim being to maintain the particularity of individuals and their experience and understanding of security. While this article views ineffable experience as particularly important – not only because it pays attention to the individual as referent object, but also because it provides a framework within which the role of individual and collective agency can be developed – the ineffable points to a considerable gap in current critical security studies debates.</p>
<p>Revising critical security studies along Adornian lines provides it with the philosophical foundations necessary for asking questions that have so far only been put forward by proponents of the Paris School in security studies. The interdisciplinary and poststructural approach taken by this school of thought allows for the analysis of issues related to the categorization and ‘fragmented interpretation of social reality’ through academic disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612470392">Bigo and Tsoukala, 2008</xref>: 1). For example, there are questions about the disciplinary boundaries of security studies, international relations’ monopoly of the meaning of the term security, the reification of security as a body of knowledge, the fetishization and bureaucratization of security by security professionals, the subject–object problem in the study of security, and the categorization and numerical treatment of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0967010612470392">35</xref></sup> Fundamentally, these concerns can be found in the Frankfurt tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0967010612470392">36</xref></sup> Yet, they are inaccessible to critical security studies in its current configuration and without its full engagement with Adorno’s work. Therefore, an Adornian approach can not only revise and strengthen critical security studies’ theoretical grounding, but also open up a new research agenda.</p>

<p>Such as ‘nothing complicitous in this world can have any truth’ or ‘no universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megaton bomb’, to mention just two examples in Wyn Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612470392">1999</xref>: 36).

<p>In addressing this problem, it is not sufficient to merely mention that Marcuse shifts from a phenomenology of resistance – the identification of points of resistance and liberation movements within society – to metaphysics of resistance – the valorization of the principle of resistance itself.

<p>‘“Identarian” thinking says what something comes under, what it exemplifies or represents, and what, accordingly, it is not itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612470392">Fagan, 2005</xref>). Adorno criticizes identity thinking as systematically and necessarily misrepresenting reality by subsuming specific phenomena under general, more abstract classificatory categories through which the phenomenal world is cognitively understood. Further, Adorno claims that this way of representing reality provides for the manipulation of the material environment (‘outer nature’) as well as ‘inner nature’ (i.e the mind, free will, etc.). Thereby, the specificity of any given phenomenal entity is lost; everything becomes a mere standardized exemplar. This also leads to the elimination of qualities or properties that are inherent in any given object but that are conceptually excluded from view. In consequence, identity thinking misrepresents its object. Adorno’s understanding and use of identity thinking provides a genuine grounding for his philosophy and underlies most of his writing.

<p>Adorno does not shy away from using expressive language such as ‘absolute evil’ and ‘the bad’ – the element of exaggeration is not only a rhetorical means, but inherent in Adorno’s thought; see Djassemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612470392">2002</xref>: 87).</p>

<p>This he derives from Hegel, whose idea of untruth ‘aims at bad actuality’; see Theunissen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612470392">1983</xref>: 42).</p>

<p>At this point, is has to be mentioned that Adorno wrote in a period that he viewed as a situation of moral emergency or of ongoing moral catastrophe. Thus, the ideal of ‘never again Auschwitz’ is a kind of absolute moral minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612470392">Finlayson, 2002</xref>: 8). See, for example, Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612470392">2003b</xref>: 19–36) on ‘Education after Auschwitz’.</p>

<p>Ineffable insight is not an instance of identity thinking because it is not a <italic>conception</italic> of something and avoids the ‘cunning of reason’; see Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612470392">1973a</xref>: 22); Rose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612470392">1978</xref>: 101).</p>

<p>Adorno quoted in Schaap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612470392">2000</xref>: 136–7).

<p>However, they cannot lead to nihilism, for every act of resistance bears the potential that things might be different; what remains is a ‘perverse, dislocated bit of hope’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612470392">Adorno, 1973b</xref>: 369).</p>
