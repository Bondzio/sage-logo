<abstract>
<p>Severe fatigue and low quality of life are reported by a majority of adult patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. In children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A, the prevalence and impact of fatigue have not been studied yet. In this questionnaire survey, 55 Dutch children (response rate 77%) with genetically confirmed hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A participated (mean age 15 years [standard deviation 2.1]). Prevalence of severe fatigue (based on a cut-off score of the Checklist Individual Strength) was 24%, in contrast to 14% in a Dutch school-based population (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Almost all quality-of-life scores (measured with the Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form 87) were significantly worse than population norms (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Fatigue severity was associated significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) with all quality-of-life scores (–0.4 &lt; <italic>r</italic> &lt; –0.7). In conclusion, severe fatigue and diminished quality of life are more frequent among children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A compared to healthy peers. The strong association between fatigue severity and quality of life suggests a negative impact of fatigue on quality of life in these children.</p>

<body>
<p>Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812447681">1</xref></sup> with a prevalence reported as high as 40 per 100 000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447681">2</xref></sup> Symptoms of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A, like progressive weakness of the distal limb musculature, sensory loss, and variable foot deformity, usually first appear during childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812447681">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Severe fatigue is reported by 60% of adult patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup> This high prevalence rate of fatigue corresponds with studies in other neuromuscular diseases, like post-poliomyelitis syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812447681">4</xref></sup> myasthenia gravis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812447681">5</xref></sup> Guillain-Barré syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447681">6</xref></sup> facioscapulohumeral dystrophy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup> and myotonic dystrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup> These findings support the recent description of fatigue as part of the burden of neuromuscular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447681">7</xref></sup> However, the impact of fatigue on quality of life in patients with neuromuscular diseases received little attention so far.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447681">8</xref></sup> One study in adult patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A showed that severe fatigue is associated with serious impairment in daily life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although clinical observations also suggest a high prevalence of fatigue in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A, this has not been studied yet. In addition, there are no studies on fatigue in children with other neuromuscular diseases.</p>
<p>In healthy children, however, severe fatigue is a common phenomenon. In a recent Dutch survey of a healthy school-based population, 21% of girls and 7% of the boys experienced severe fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> Fatigue during childhood has a negative impact on education and career plans, particularly through high rates of school absenteeism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447681">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, children with persistent fatigue have a profoundly reduced quality of life as compared to healthy peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812447681">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A, recent studies showed a significantly reduced quality of life compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447681">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812447681">13</xref></sup> However, these studies only evaluated parent-reported quality of life, which in general differs from ratings by children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812447681">14</xref></sup> Whereas parents as a rule overestimate their healthy child's quality of life, parents of chronically ill children tend to rate their health-related quality of life lower than the children do themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812447681">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812447681">16</xref></sup> This has also been shown for children with neurologic diseases like cerebral palsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812447681">17</xref></sup> and epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812447681">18</xref></sup> For this reason, self-reporting is generally preferable to proxy assessments.</p>
<p>Till now, it is not known whether severe fatigue is already present early in the course of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A and what the impact is of fatigue on quality of life in these children. Moreover, the self-reported quality of life in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A has not been studied so far.</p>
<p>Knowledge of fatigue severity and quality of life will be of value to understand the burden and course of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. Furthermore, improving quality of life is regarded as a key goal in the management of pediatric hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447681">12</xref></sup> The importance of fatigue on quality of life would underscore the need for more effective methods to be developed to manage this symptom in children, and not only in adults with neuromuscular diseases.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aims of this study in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A are to determine the prevalence of severe fatigue, to assess the self-reported quality of life in comparison to their healthy peers, and to explore the impact of severe fatigue on quality of life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812447681" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed in the Netherlands in the period June 2009 to April 2010.</p>
<sec id="section2-0883073812447681">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were all children, aged 12 to 18 years, with the genetically confirmed diagnosis of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A as registered in the database of the neurogenetic laboratory of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam. This laboratory performs all genetic testing and registration of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A in the Netherlands. Children unable to complete the questionnaires independently were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073812447681">
<title>Study Procedure</title>
<p>Postal questionnaires were administered to the attending physicians of the registered children. Subsequently, these physicians sent the questionnaires to the children. Physicians from all 8 university hospitals and 23 general hospitals in the Netherlands participated in this study. None of the physicians refused participation. Questionnaires were accompanied by written study information. During school holidays, no questionnaires were administered to reduce a confounding effect on fatigue severity and quality of life. Nonresponders were reminded once.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0883073812447681">
<title>Fatigue</title>
<p>Self-reported fatigue was measured by the 20-item Checklist Individual Strength (CIS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812447681">19</xref></sup> This multidimensional questionnaire has been used to measure fatigue in various neuromuscular diseases, including hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup> The Checklist Individual Strength has been developed to measure fatigue in adults. However, in a recent study among a healthy Dutch school-based population, the Checklist Individual Strength proved to be reliable to measure fatigue in children aged 12 to 18 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> The Checklist Individual Strength measures 4 separate aspects of fatigue during the previous 2 weeks: fatigue severity (8 items, score range 8-56), concentration problems (5 items, score range 5-35), reduced motivation (4 items, score range 4-28), and reduced activity (3 items, score range 3-21). Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale. High scores indicate high levels of fatigue. A cut-off value of 40 or more on the “fatigue severity” subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength was used to determine severe fatigue, according to a school-based population survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073812447681">
<title>Quality of Life</title>
<p>Self-reported quality of life was measured by the 87-item Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form (CHQ-CF87).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812447681">20</xref></sup> This generic quality-of-life questionnaire is appropriate for use among children of about 10 years and older and has been widely used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812447681">21</xref></sup> We used a cross-cultural adapted and validated Dutch version of the Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812447681">22</xref></sup> which also provided general Dutch population norms (except for the domain “family activities”). The Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form measures both physical and psychosocial domains during the previous 4 weeks. It consists of 87 items with 4, 5, or 6 response options, divided over 10 multi-item scales and 2 single-item questions. Per scale items are summed up (some recoded or recalibrated) and transformed into a 0 (worst possible) to 100 (best possible) score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812447681">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0883073812447681">
<title>Other Measures</title>
<p>Child characteristics regarding age, gender, and school level were collected. Furthermore, children were asked to report about specific fatigue-related comorbidity (diabetes, anemia, and heart and lung diseases) and functional impairments due to hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. To explore the role of life-style characteristics in fatigue, these factors were measured in accordance with the Dutch school-based population survey on fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> To determine time spent on extracurricular activities, children were asked to report how many hours weekly they spent on homework, sports (school and extracurricular), leisure-time activities and hobbies, friends and nightlife, and whether they had an additional job. Furthermore, children were asked to report fatigue-related absenteeism in the past school year. Sleep characteristics were measured by self-reports of bedtimes, time it takes to fall asleep, and rise time during school days and weekends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883073812447681">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows version 16.0. A <italic>P</italic>-value of .05 was used for all tests of significance. All tests were 2-tailed. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize child and lifestyle factors. One-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare Checklist Individual Strength scores with published data of a healthy Dutch school-based population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> and to compare Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form scores with Dutch population norms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812447681">22</xref></sup> A Fisher exact test was used to compare the prevalence rates of severe fatigue between children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A and their healthy peers, for the total group as well as for boys and girls separately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> Independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form scores between severe fatigued (score &gt;40 on subscale “fatigue severity” of the Checklist Individual Strength) and the other children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests for nonparametric data and independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests for parametric data were used to assess gender differences in Checklist Individual Strength, Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form scores, and lifestyle factors. Pearson correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) were calculated to investigate the relationship between the Checklist Individual Strength fatigue-severity subscale and Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form scores, and child and lifestyle characteristics.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 55 children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A participated in this study. Of the 84 children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A registered in the database of the national neurogenetic laboratory, 7 children were untraceable, 1 child was deceased, and 1 child was hospitalized because of severe psychiatric disease. Therefore, 75 postal questionnaires were sent. Fifty-eight children returned the questionnaires (response rate 77%). Three questionnaires were excluded because these were completed by parents instead of their children. There were no missing values on the Checklist Individual Strength and Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form.</p>
<p>The 55 participants consisted of 30 girls and 25 boys with a mean age of 15.0 years (standard deviation 2.1) and different school types (N = 9 primary education; N = 41 secondary education; N = 5 first stage of tertiary education). Relevant comorbidity was reported by 3 children; 2 suffered from asthmatic disease and 1 from aortic valve insufficiency. Functional impairments were reported by many children; 20% occasionally used a wheelchair, mostly for long distances. A majority of children (66%) were unable to walk unaided on their heels, and 7% were not able to walk on their toes. Seventy-one percent of the children made use of one or more orthopedic devices, such as splints (12%), insoles (65%), and orthopedic footwear (25%). Total nocturnal sleep in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A during schooldays (mean 8 hours 25 minutes) and in weekends (mean 9 hours 45 minutes) did not significantly differ from mean values of a Dutch healthy school-based population, with values of, respectively, 8 hours 26 minutes and 9 hours 45 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section9-0883073812447681">
<title>Fatigue</title>
<p>Children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A scored 9.3 (standard deviation 5.4) on the subscale physical activity of the Checklist Individual Strength, which is significantly worse compared to the mean score of 5.4 in a healthy Dutch school-based population (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> Both groups did not significantly differ on the subscales concentration and motivation of the Checklist Individual Strength. Likewise, mean scores on the Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue severity did not significantly differ between the children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A and the healthy school-based population. However, the proportion of severe fatigued children (score &gt;40 on Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue severity) in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A was significantly higher than the proportion in their healthy peers (respectively 24% vs 14%, <italic>P</italic> = .04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812447681">Figure 1</xref>). There was no significant gender difference among severe fatigued children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812447681">Figure 1</xref>). This is in contrast to their healthy peers, in which girls report higher levels of fatigue than boys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref></sup> The prevalence of severe fatigue in boys with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A was significantly higher than in their healthy peers (respectively 20% vs 7%, <italic>P </italic>= .02), whereas the prevalence of severe fatigue in girls with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A did not significantly differ between both groups (respectively 27% vs 20%). Twenty-seven percent of the children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A reported fatigue-related school absenteeism. Within this group sixty percent experienced severe fatigue.</p>

<title>Association Among Fatigue Severity, Quality of Life, and Child and Lifestyle Characteristics</title>
<p>Strong significant negative correlations (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01) were found between the Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue severity and all Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form domains. Correlation coefficients between fatigue severity and the physical Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form domains were –0.52 (role social-physical), –0.67 (physical functioning), –0.55 (general health perceptions), and –0.68 (bodily pain); and between the psychosocial Child Health Questionnaire–Child Form domains, –0.55 (role social-emotional), –0.48 (role social-behavioral), –0.65 (general behavior), –0.64 (mental health), –0.70 (self-esteem), –0.65 (family activities), and –0.34 (family cohesion).

No other child characteristics, such as comorbidity, functional impairments, or use of orthopedic devices, were significantly correlated with fatigue severity. In addition, no other lifestyle characteristics, like time spent on homework, sports (school and extracurricular), leisure time activities and hobbies, friends, nightlife, and additional jobs were significantly correlated with fatigue severity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As far as we know, this is the first study on fatigue in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.

Furthermore, it shows that severe fatigue is associated with lower quality of life in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.</p>
<p>The high proportion (24%) of severe fatigued children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A is in agreement with observations from parents and clinicians.

<p>In healthy children and children with chronic fatigue syndrome, girls generally experience more fatigue than boys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447681">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812447681">23</xref></sup> The lack of a gender difference in our study is an important finding. It may suggest that the impact of the disease hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A itself on fatigue is stronger than the impact of gender.</p>
<p>The finding of diminished quality of life is in accordance with recent literature on children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447681">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812447681">13</xref></sup> However, these studies only measured parent-reported quality of life by using the parent-form of the Child Health Questionnaire. Our study strengthens these earlier findings because the children rated the quality of life themselves. Results from our study further support the need to enhance quality of life as a key goal in the pediatric management of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447681">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A had strong reduction of the physical domains of quality of life and also experienced lower physical activity as one of the multidimensional aspects of fatigue. Whether fatigue reduces activity or results from less activity remains an intriguing issue, because several studies reported an inactive physical lifestyle itself to be a predictive factor for persistent fatigue among children in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812447681">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812447681">24</xref></sup> and in adults with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073812447681">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The finding that severe fatigued children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A have a significantly lower quality of life than less fatigued children suggests a great impact of fatigue on quality of life. The impact of fatigue on quality of life is further emphasized by the finding that almost one-third of the children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A report fatigue-related school absenteeism. It is known that persistent fatigue in children has a negative impact on education and career plans, particularly through failure to attend school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447681">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The positive association between fatigue severity and age might suggest that fatigue increases with longer disease duration of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. Consequently, this would result in a higher prevalence rate of severe fatigue in adulthood, which is indeed 60% in adult patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447681">3</xref></sup> However, it also might suggest that older children experience more demands from society and therefore are more severely fatigued. Further research is warranted to evaluate these 2 possible explanations.</p>
<p>Fatigue severity is furthermore significantly negatively associated with total sleep; the less sleep, the more fatigued. Earlier studies in adults with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073812447681">25</xref></sup> and in children with chronic fatigue syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812447681">23</xref></sup> found poor sleep quality to be an important negative predictor for severe fatigue.</p>
<p>Interestingly, besides age and sleep, we found no other child or lifestyle characteristics to be significantly associated with fatigue severity. This supports the current opinion that fatigue in neuromuscular disease must be regarded as an integral feature of the disease itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447681">8</xref></sup> and perhaps is therefore already present early in the course of the disease.</p>
<p>There are various limitations of our study. Fatigue is multidimensional, with a broad range of underlying mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073812447681">26</xref></sup> However, we investigated only experienced fatigue and did not take additional physiological measures of muscle strength or muscle fatigability. Furthermore, we did not collect detailed disease determinants and therefore could not evaluate the association between disease severity and experienced fatigue. Next, we did not consider psychiatric disorders like depression or anxiety. It has been recognized that both mood disorders and anxiety disorders contribute to well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073812447681">27</xref></sup> However, in contrast to the impact on quality of life, in adults with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A psychiatric disorders were found not to be related to fatigue or muscle strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073812447681">28</xref></sup> Finally, our study sample was derived from the national database of genetically confirmed cases of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. In clinical practice, however, often not all family members are genetically tested. Therefore, despite the use of a high-quality database, selection bias cannot be ruled out and may limit generalizability to all children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A.</p>
<p>There is clearly a need for further studies, with the ultimate aim to develop interventions that decrease fatigue and enhance quality of life in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. A first step for further research will be to explore the multidimensional aspect of fatigue in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A, especially physiological fatigue, in addition to recent studies in adults with neuromuscular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073812447681">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, this study shows the clinical importance of fatigue and the possible impact of fatigue on quality of life in children with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A. We therefore encourage clinicians in pediatric hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1A to address fatigue and quality of life in their routine patient care.</p>
