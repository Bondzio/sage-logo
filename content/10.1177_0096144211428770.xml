<abstract>
<p>To date, urban scholars have given little attention to the radical politics of neighborhood autonomy that characterized the utopianist vanguard of the broader 1970s neighborhoods movement. Focusing on a constellation of little-known theorists, activists, and institutions—Milton Kotler, Karl Hess, the Alliance for Neighborhood Government, Washington’s Adams-Morgan Organization, and others—this article explores the cultural and intellectual impulses undergirding this fractured movement. It begins by identifying the movement’s New Left origins, then investigates the tensions and fissures that defined this network, as leftists, libertarians, counterculturalists, civil rights organizers, and alternative technology proponents forged provisional alliances. In the end, the article suggests, elements of the burgeoning New Right found partial success in appropriating these ideals of urban community self-reliance, harnessing them to a free market political project. This trajectory demonstrates, however, that the localist language of neighborhood communalism is a place where traditional distinctions among left, liberal, and right often blur or even crumble.</p>

<p>“Power to the Neighborhoods!” With this slogan, the writer Norman Mailer launched his quixotic 1969 campaign for New York City mayor. Entering the Democratic primary as a self-described “left-conservative,” Mailer, along with his running mate, the pugnacious columnist Jimmy Breslin, proposed an alternative municipal world to voters. The best remembered of Mailer’s eccentric proposals—making New York City the fifty-first state—was actually devised in service of a scheme for radical neighborhood autonomy. In Mailer’s future State of New York City, every neighborhood would be free to become its own independent hamlet, township, village, or city and to “constitute itself upon any principle, whether spiritual, emotional, economical, ideological or idealistic.” The options were limitless. Black Power for Harlem. An Integration City for liberals. Even neighborhoods of ethnic or religious exclusion for determined segregationists willing to pay a hefty fee for the privilege. Lifestyles and modes of social organization would multiply into a cornucopia of diversity, with empowered neighborhoods offering a space for overcoming a rampant “alienation from the self.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211428770">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though the press laughed off the candidacy as the prank of an eccentric egotist, Mailer’s irreverent campaign signaled in flamboyant style the emergence of an energetic movement for neighborhood-level autonomy and self-governance, one that would coalesce over the course of the succeeding decade. By the mid-1970s, with the apparent failure of the Great Society agenda, devastating urban disinvestment, and rampant post-Vietnam and post-Watergate distrust in national government, close-knit city neighborhoods increasingly came to seem not a catalyst for broader urban redemption, but rather the sole redeemable scrap amid the surrounding detritus. In response, burgeoning networks of intellectuals and activists sought to draw political control closer to home, whether via the tepid reformism of “little city halls” or the strident anarchism of projects like Karl Hess’s “Washington Free Community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211428770">2</xref></sup> While some saw such devolution of power as merely a superficial way to reorder municipal bureaucracies, in its more radical guises this movement adopted a utopian vision of the local neighborhood as incubator for authentic relationships and direct democracy in an age fragmented by a stultifying bureaucratic anonymity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211428770">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>These aims made for unlikely bedfellows. United only in their disdain for the centralizing tendencies of postwar liberalism, advocates ranged from New Left theorists to white ethnic activists, radical libertarians to black nationalists, alternative technology evangelists to conservative antimodernists. As the decade progressed, these provisional allies raised powerful questions about the relationship between the day-to-day life of the small-scale neighborhood and grand, abstract matters of American democracy and urban pluralism. Taking inspiration either from Jeffersonian ideals of decentralized political authority or from contemporary theories of participatory democracy and anticolonial struggle, activists and critics reworked received ideas of the neighborhood as merely a sentimental space of warm feelings. In their place, a host of intellectuals, organizers, politicians, propagandists, and institutions that have been all but ignored in urban historical scholarship—Milton Kotler, Karl Hess, Mark Hatfield, the Alliance for Neighborhood Government, and many others—recast the neighborhood as the most basic unit of the nation’s political life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211428770">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such alliances are inherently unstable, however, and the ideals underpinning this movement’s uncompromising thrust for neighborhood-level autonomy would eventually contribute both to the rise of the New Right and to the formation of a dissident, localist urban counterculture. This essay explores that evolution, as viewed particularly through the intersecting stories of two of the movement’s leading proponents: Milton Kotler and Karl Hess. Both figures initially developed their visions of autonomous, empowered neighborhoods while working as fellows at the Institute for Policy Studies, the nation’s leading think tank on the political left. The ideological paths they followed would eventually diverge, however, as the alluring rhetoric of neighborhood empowerment was appropriated and recast by movements spanning the political spectrum. In the end, this historical trajectory suggests that the romantic language of neighborhood communalism is a place where traditional distinctions among left, liberal, and right often blur or even crumble.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144211428770">
<title>The New Left and Neighborhood Government</title>
<p>A key center of gravity for this movement was the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), an important hub for New Left political theory and activism. The think tank had been founded in 1962 by Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet, two disaffected young security officials in the Kennedy administration. Dismayed by the militarization of U.S. foreign policy and President Kennedy’s brand of “technocratic progressivism,” they resigned their jobs to foster alternative policy approaches. Over the next decade, their Washington-based organization assembled a stable of high-profile intellectuals, including Christopher Jencks, Arthur Waskow, Staughton Lynd, Paul Goodman, and Paul Jacobs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211428770">5</xref></sup> Unlike traditional think tanks of the period, which pursued a “value-free” objectivity, the IPS maintained what Raskin later called an “open-door policy toward movements,” and especially toward organizers from the left flank of the civil rights movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211428770">6</xref></sup> Eventually, the IPS’s reputation as a hothouse for antiwar thought and activism would draw the ire of the Johnson and Nixon administrations, which deployed over sixty informers and spies in a six-year FBI operation against the organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211428770">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the IPS’s many intellectuals was a large cadre addressing issues of decentralization, community empowerment, and new vehicles for cooperative life—work that unfolded not just in the realm of scholarship but also in the form of social action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211428770">8</xref></sup> Resident fellows were encouraged, as a 1966 IPS pamphlet explained, to test their theories by “experimenting with ‘social inventions’—that is, practical projects that try to deal with an important social difficulty,” thus allowing “a new understanding of social change.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211428770">9</xref></sup> Among these projects, the institute initiated a range of neighborhood institutions in Washington, including several co-ops, a music center, a mini school, and a radical bookstore, as well as numerous spin-off centers and institutes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211428770">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ideas radiating from the IPS reflected a number of the impulses driving a New Left embrace of the neighborhood scale, as its resident intellectuals crisscrossed the lines dividing theory from practice. The ideological evolutions and “social inventions” of two of its resident fellows, in particular, dramatize a story that played out in scores of locations across the country. Milton Kotler and Karl Hess, two of the decade’s best-known proponents of neighborhood autonomy and self-government, galvanized activists in support of their visions, wrote central texts for the neighborhoods movement, and created structures to test their ideas in real-life urban communities. In doing so, they helped to give shape and intellectual coherence to the neighborhood movement’s radical decentralist wing.</p>
<p>Over the course of the late 1960s, Kotler became one of the most influential theorists and activists of the movement for neighborhood-level autonomy. One of the IPS’s six original resident fellows, he first captured the attention of decentralists with the 1969 publication of <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic>, a manifesto outlining a radical program for local-level sovereignty. Hannah Arendt recommended it to her acolytes, while Karl Hess called it potentially “the most important revolutionary book of the century.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211428770">11</xref></sup> In fact, a revolution was already under way, Kotler’s book insisted, but one that differed from the “earthshaking” national upheavals inhabiting the daydreams of campus radicals. From the recent proliferation of middle-class block clubs to the rise of black urban militias, the neighborhood had “sprung from its quiet niche in the metropolis to surprise us with its claim for liberty.” The New Left, Kotler declared, must now “accept the neighborhood as the source of revolutionary power, and local liberty as its modest cause.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211428770">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This vision came as the culmination of a half decade of ground-level organizing. Raised in Chicago’s Humboldt Park neighborhood, Kotler had formed a close friendship with Marcus Raskin during the early 1950s, when both were undergraduates at the University of Chicago. After Kotler finished his graduate studies in political science, Raskin persuaded him to join the newly founded IPS. This move plunged Kotler, then a centrist liberal, into the world of radical politics and activism. Through the IPS, he attended key conventions of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), organized for the Delta Ministry civil rights project of the National Council of Churches, and spearheaded efforts to establish a college program at California’s San Quentin State Prison. While captivated by the goal of participatory democracy that motivated all these projects, Kotler eventually concluded that, without formal structures for extending the principle into average city communities, it would remain merely a platitude mouthed by middle-class idealists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211428770">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>His first attempt to develop such structures came through his next IPS “social invention”: working alongside the Reverend Leopold Bernhard to found the East Central Citizens Organization (ECCO) in Columbus, Ohio.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211428770">14</xref></sup> Kotler had first met Bernhard in 1965, at Chicago’s Urban Training Center for Christian Mission; two years later, the minister asked Kotler for help in developing an experiment in direct community control by residents in his church’s vicinity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211428770">15</xref></sup> For Bernhard, such a project seemed an extension of his long history battling racial injustice. In the 1930s, as a young Lutheran seminarian in Germany, Bernhard had publicly opposed the Nazi regime before fleeing the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211428770">16</xref></sup> By 1960, Bernhard had taken up the pastorship of Columbus’s First English Lutheran Church, an old wealthy congregation in an economically struggling, mostly African American neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211428770">17</xref></sup> As some longtime members clamored for First English to quit the city, Bernhard instead urged his flock to become “deeply, radically involved in the world’s misery.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211428770">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together, as a means to that end, Kotler and Bernhard launched ECCO as the nation’s first nonprofit neighborhood corporation, a venture that soon won substantial funding from the federal government’s Office of Economic Opportunity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211428770">19</xref></sup> Ivanhoe Donaldson, a veteran field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was hired as executive director. But although ECCO eventually ran programs in health, job training, and housing, its primary purpose was to function as a neighborhood government, controlled by a deliberative assembly run along town meeting lines and open to all. By providing genuine power, Bernhard argued, ECCO would help economically marginalized residents overcome their “alienation from the democratic process.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211428770">20</xref></sup> The project captured national attention in publications ranging from <italic>Playboy</italic> to the <italic>New Republic</italic>, while garnering enthusiastic praise from Senator Robert Kennedy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211428770">21</xref></sup> Meanwhile, Kotler and Bernhard went on to organize similar institutions in Cleveland, Boston, Chicago, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>At its core, this model of organizing assumed that the decade’s rumbling urban discontent was caused not so much by material deprivation but rather by the “insult” of outside rule. Testifying before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 1967, Kotler compared recent uprisings in the black inner cities to the eighteenth-century American colonists’ struggle to overturn British dominion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211428770">22</xref></sup> Both were endeavors to shake off the rule of distant potentates in favor of autonomy and local democracy.</p>
<p>The nuances of this revolt against mainstream liberal thought can be seen by comparing Kotler’s <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic> with another widely noted 1969 work in urban governance: Theodore Lowi’s <italic>The End of Liberalism</italic>, the most prominent political science text arguing against such decentralizing impulses. Here, Lowi warned of a “crisis of public authority” produced by a pernicious new ideology of governance. “Interest-group liberalism,” as Lowi termed it, understood democratic decision making only in terms of claims by organized groups, be they manufacturers on the right or antipoverty advocates on the left. The resultant elevation of process over policy had subverted abstract ideals of justice and the common good. And nowhere was this problem more dire than in the great metropolises, where power was increasingly fragmented among a dizzying multitude of suburban governments, community boards, administrative authorities, and service delivery agencies. Carved into “rigid technocratized domains,” the U.S. city, Lowi lamented, now stood as a congeries of “islands of functional power before which the modern mayor stands impoverished.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211428770">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this view, decentralization of authority—far from being a potential cure for the urban crisis—was a central culprit. Indeed, Lowi suggested eliminating the corporate city entirely, and along with it the “fiction of local citizenship.” But the delegations of power that Lowi derided as “the gift of sovereignty to private satrapies” seemed rather, to Kotler, an avenue for granting every citizen meaningful control over his or her own community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211428770">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic>, Kotler drew in equal measure from Thomas Jefferson’s vision of a nation of self-governing “ward republics” and from recent New Left enthusiasms for participatory democracy and anti-imperial revolt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211428770">25</xref></sup> Here, he cast the city itself as an empire—with the downtown as powerful capital, subordinating the neighborhood provinces to its will. In fact, Kotler argued, many older neighborhoods had once been self-governing towns, suburbs, villages, or hamlets. Though rapacious downtowns had progressively annexed them through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these neighborhoods still retained the ghostly memory of bygone days of local liberty. The task for each neighborhood today, then, was to “free the territory from downtown power,” a process that started with winning control of local public institutions. If successful, these neighborhood “ward republics,” controlled by participatory assemblies, would then gain the power to exercise eminent domain, establish a local economy, control prices and rents, legislate on community welfare, and eventually even decide collectively on national matters of war and peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211428770">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>This neighborhood vision left behind the sentimental language of ethnic tradition or neighborly intimacy, adopting instead a hard-edged definition that took power, colonialism, and struggle as its key terms. Mocking the romantic conception of neighborhoods as mere “units of good feeling in the madness of metropolitan life,” Kotler declared that they were, first and foremost, the basic units of political life—and, thus, an ideal staging ground for overthrowing the “imperial dominion” of downtown rulers. While saving his most vehement scorn for the insipid decentralization schemes of liberal reformers, with their “little city halls” and local advisory boards, he also critiqued the left for its blindness to new imperatives. Radical social change would occur only when struggles for power were built primarily on territorial claims, rather than the solidarities of class or race. The goals of economic equality and small-scale political liberty were in direct conflict with one another, Kotler argued. Thus, the left had to decide between two possible futures: either “social engineering or political freedom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211428770">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite such talk of revolution and radicalism, such ideas found several champions among the Washington political establishment—particularly two Republican moderates, Senators Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Charles Mathias of Maryland. Each had grown alarmed over the growth of the military-industrial complex, the expansion of government, and the unfurling revelations of the Watergate scandal. Already in 1972, Hatfield had canvassed members of the Republican Platform Committee, urging that neighborhood self-government become integral to party policy. “Modern society and big government treat people like numbers,” his plea stated. “Neighborhoods are the only place where you can have a name.” Furthermore, such policies could make “significant inroads into the Democratic coalition”—particularly among students, minorities, and “the alienated voter.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211428770">28</xref></sup> Rebuffed at first, Hatfield the next year introduced a bill, crafted with help from Kotler, called the Neighborhood Government Act of 1973. Among its features, the complex legislation would have allowed taxpayers to divert up to 80 percent of their federal income tax payments to local neighborhood corporations, which would operate in emulation of the “old New England town hall.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211428770">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Already ostracized by some in his party for his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War, Hatfield made little headway, and his breaks with the rightward-drifting GOP on a host of other issues led many fellow Republicans to dismiss him as a crank. To the conservative columnist George Will, for example, such proposals seemed a “ludicrous” outburst of “senatorial silliness,” a set of “exotic and irrelevant cures” for nonexistent problems.<sc>30</sc> But Hatfield was not the only such alarmist. By December 1973, his Senate colleague, Charles Mathias, was responding to the ongoing Watergate disclosures by warning that the United States might soon “become an authoritarian state” if it did not radically devolve power into the hands of its individual neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211428770">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ironically, at just the moment when decentralists were attacking allegedly indifferent city halls and federal agencies, municipal leaders were finding themselves increasingly helpless in the face of suburban flight, job loss, and declining tax revenues. Among mainstream liberal scholars and activists, the rising tide of demands for neighborhood self-determination touched off fierce debates, in large part because such schemes appeared indifferent toward national problems of unequal access to resources. Historian Thomas Bender, for instance, warned of the dangers of “sentimental writing about community control,” while urbanist Sam Bass Warner, Jr. insisted that beleaguered city neighborhoods needed “democratic national and regional planning” rather than increased autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211428770">32</xref></sup> Likewise, in Jack Newfield and Jeff Greenfield’s influential 1972 book, <italic>A Populist Manifesto</italic>, the authors expressed an ambivalence common on the left: while cautiously endorsing the concept, they predicted that, because it “does not alter wealth or re-allocate funds,” such a movement could become merely “a faddish <italic>cul de sac</italic>” for true progressives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211428770">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>“An Ethnic Walden Pond”</title>
<p>Even as figures on the left debated the proposals of intellectuals like Kotler, such devolutionary visions generated a buzz among libertarians and small-government conservatives. After his book received a recommendation in the newsletter <italic>Libertarian Forum</italic>, Kotler was even invited to discuss his ideas with members of Governor Ronald Reagan’s California state cabinet. (The group was taken aback, Kotler later recounted, when they learned of his background in Mississippi civil rights work and his visions for inner-city political empowerment.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211428770">34</xref></sup> But it was among counterculturalists and communitarian anarchists that the idea generated the most visible enthusiasm. Here, what Mailer had envisioned as a “hip coalition of left and right” seemed possible, as the revolt against the postwar liberal consensus expanded on either side of the political spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211428770">35</xref></sup> <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic>, in particular, proved influential to another IPS fellow, Karl Hess, who came to epitomize the crossover between Old Right antistatism and the New Left’s hostility toward existing authorities. Hess’s protean political career gave him a major platform in the national media, and he used this prominence to promote a new vision of the neighborhood’s role in the nation’s political life.</p>
<p>Hess’s twisting ideological evolution from the 1950s to the 1970s explains much about the impulse toward neighborhood control. The son of a wealthy businessman, Hess was born in 1923 and raised in Washington, D.C. When his parents split shortly after his birth, Hess’s mother refused alimony and worked as a switchboard operator, making them “full-time poor people,” as Hess later recounted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211428770">36</xref></sup> A voracious reader, Hess quickly grew bored with formal education and dropped out of school at age fifteen to pursue his own studies. Despite a teenage flirtation with the Socialist Party, which seemed to oppose the cultural elitism that the threadbare young Hess so keenly resented, he eventually gravitated toward the political right, lured by the Republican Party’s rhetoric of individualism and its opposition to the New Deal edifice. For Hess, this loathing of state liberalism would be an enduring leitmotif, taking him first to the far right, then to the New Left, and finally to anarchism and libertarianism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211428770">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, Hess worked as a journalist, editor, Republican speechwriter, and American Enterprise Institute staffer, meanwhile throwing himself with gusto into what he later called “the big hysteria” of cold war anticommunism. In 1964, Hess reached the pinnacle of his power as head speechwriter for Barry Goldwater’s presidential campaign. As Goldwater’s trusty “Shakespeare,” Hess penned the senator’s uncompromising GOP convention speech, borrowing from historian Harry Jaffa the famous lines of rebuke to Republican moderates: “extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice” and “moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211428770">38</xref></sup> But, following Goldwater’s crushing defeat, Hess was denied any sort of patronage position, even jobs operating elevators in congressional office buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211428770">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Goldwater’s loss, Hess began a reassessment of his political orientation. In a 1975 autobiography, <italic>Dear America</italic>, he recounted a series of events that led him on the path from right-wing operative to antiestablishment anarchist. First, he purchased a motorcycle, thoroughly scandalizing his prim suburban neighbors. Then, taking up welding to repair his damaged bikes, he learned from fellow metalworkers that ordinary people could direct their own labor without need for hierarchical modes of organization. Finally, facing an exhaustive IRS audit—payback, he believed, for his support of Lyndon Johnson’s election opponent—Hess grew so enraged that he refused to continue paying taxes. Slapped with a 100 percent lien on future earnings, Hess could no longer own any property beyond basic tools and clothes. As his conventional suburban marriage disintegrated, he moved to a houseboat, owned by a new romantic companion, on Washington’s Anacostia River. By the late 1960s, Hess found himself “racing headlong into hippiedom,” with rock music, motorcycles, and marijuana as his new accoutrements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211428770">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along with these lifestyle changes, Hess underwent a very public political reorientation. After joining SDS and the Industrial Workers of the World, he took on writing tasks for the Black Panthers and was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in the U.S. Senate chamber. But it was also a new set of intellectual companions that helped Hess work out a fresh political philosophy. At the IPS, Raskin and Barnet invited Hess to run a seminar highlighting the radical aspects of Goldwater’s 1964 campaign, and shortly later Hess became an IPS fellow. There, alongside traditional liberals and socialists, he also found intellectuals who preached in opposition to “the very notion of people giving up power to institutions.” Most importantly, from Kotler’s experiments in Columbus and elsewhere, Hess learned of neighborhoods’ importance as the natural home for direct democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211428770">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1969, newspapers were trumpeting Hess’s move from sharp business suits to beard and beads with headlines such as “Goldwater’s Ghost Now Haunts New Left.” But despite reports of a wholesale conversion, Hess adamantly stressed the continuities in his philosophy. There was a strong kinship, he insisted, between the Old Right of isolationism, antistatism, and individualism, and the New Left of antimilitarism, participatory democracy, and personal expression. Seen this way, his newfound anarchism was merely the logical consequence of the impulses that had initially attracted him to Goldwater’s crusade. (“I don’t know anybody who would make a better Weatherman,” he said of the Arizona senator in 1970.) For this reason, Hess saw the faint outlines of a new coalition taking shape, uniting all who resented the bureaucratic tentacles of the state and the large corporation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211428770">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>This anarchist vision soon morphed into a distinctive politics of place. Yearning for a new kind of community life, Hess had moved in 1971 from his Anacostia houseboat to Washington’s Adams-Morgan district, where he had been raised four decades earlier. It was here, Hess later explained, that he finally discovered “the pleasures of neighborhood life, the treasures of cooperative living, and the measure of human meaning.” For Hess, though, this new existence was no Candide-like withdrawal from philosophical warfare to cultivate his garden in peace. The collaborative projects and authentic relationships that were possible in the nation’s intimate neighborhood spaces, he believed, offered the most radical challenge to the soulless world of centralization and bureaucratization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211428770">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Adams-Morgan, Hess joined a squad of like-minded allies who were determined to create models for a new cooperative life. In fact, however, the changes taking place in Adams-Morgan had begun long before Hess arrived. The neighborhood’s population base went from a fifth to more than half African American in the decades between 1940 and 1970.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211428770">44</xref></sup> Through the mid- and late 1960s, the district’s mostly black and Latino residents had witnessed an influx of young white counterculturalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211428770">45</xref></sup> Identifying themselves initially as the Washington Free Community, participants had formed a loose network of communal living spaces, co-ops, and worker-owned businesses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211428770">46</xref></sup> Soon, the presence of several IPS-funded projects accelerated the change. Along with IPS fellow David J. Morris, Hess and his associates set out to reconstruct their neighborhood around principles of local autonomy and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Two innovations stood out. The first was the formation of a neighborhood government, along the lines Kotler had theorized. In 1971, several dozen residents began working out a structure for a local assembly, a federation of the five smaller districts that made up Adams-Morgan. The group’s breakthrough, Hess noted, was simply to declare itself a government rather than pleading with municipal authorities and to govern through participatory town meetings rather than through abstract representative structures. Involvement in the new Adams-Morgan Organization (AMO) eventually swelled to several thousand participants, with the town meetings providing Hess “the most exciting political experiences” of his life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211428770">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second innovation went beyond the principles Kotler had outlined. This agenda involved the establishment of local institutions promoting small-scale alternative technologies, all as part of an effort to make the neighborhood economically self-reliant. To this end, Hess and his local allies in 1973 formed an IPS-sponsored neighborhood workshop called Community Technology—an attempt to “demystify technology” and to use it as a route toward local independence. The group’s work reflected the theories of E. F. Schumacher, the German-born economist who had emerged as a guru in the United States after the success of his 1973 book, <italic>Small Is Beautiful</italic>. In Adams-Morgan, Hess and his colleagues drew on Schumacher’s concept of an “intermediate technology” to develop an accessible kind of science, both created and used within the community. In this way, as the magazine <italic>Science</italic> explained of their mission, “the people themselves, not some functionary in Detroit, can determine its impact on the neighborhood.” Through rooftop vegetable gardens and trout farms in warehouse tanks, local newsletters and weekly open meetings, the Community Technology group sought to educate residents on how to uncouple their neighborhood from the surrounding metropolitan and national economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211428770">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the next year, the IPS’s David J. Morris, along with two cofounders, established the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) in Adams-Morgan. Morris had been inspired by his study of the socialist-led Popular Unity government in Chile. After traveling to Chile under IPS auspices in 1971, he wrote a book expressing enthusiasm that the administration headed by Salvador Allende would offer meaningful decentralization, to allow “the masses a sense of power over their own lives.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211428770">49</xref></sup> Once back in the United States, Morris saw the ILSR as an attempt to foster “politically independent, economically self-sustaining, and ecologically sound urban communities.” Through experiments with hydroponic gardens, waste composting, local food production, and do-it-yourself solar energy, the group aimed to show Adams-Morgan residents that “they don’t have to just sit back and passively accept decision after decision from above,” as Morris told <italic>Mother Earth News</italic> in 1975.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211428770">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each of these innovations was intended as a demonstration project, to spur similar ventures around the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211428770">51</xref></sup> And, soon enough, such efforts acquired admirers even on the right. The archconservative columnist James J. Kilpatrick had once tartly opined that Hess should “tuck his shirt-tail in, climb off the houseboat, and come back to the real world.” But by 1974, after debating Hess at several colleges, Kilpatrick was fondly, if bemusedly, praising his sparring partner as a “Henry Thoreau of Columbia Road,” who had transformed his neighborhood into “an ethnic Walden Pond.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211428770">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>This “ethnic Walden Pond” in Adams-Morgan was the inspiration for 1975’s <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic>, written by Morris and Hess. Along with Kotler’s <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic>, this book became one of the main programmatic statements of the neighborhoods movement’s radical decentralist wing. At the same time a manifesto and a how-to guide, the work probably received its most extensive use as a manual on creating local food co-ops, community newsletters, informal day care centers, and neighborhood mechanisms for handling zoning and governance. Along the way, though, it linked various strands of neighborhood thinking from the past decade—implicitly echoing Jane Jacobs on the organic nature of neighborhood activity, conservative philosopher Robert Nisbet on the pent-up desire for community in an overcentralized society, and Milton Kotler on the democratic assembly as the essence of neighborhood life. While drawing on all these intellectuals, <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic> offered a brief for a localist communitarian anarchism as solution to urban decline and alienation.</p>
<p>The opening chapter summoned up images of the neighborhood of sentiment and childhood memory: a space that represented “human reality” over “political theory.” Contrasted with the ills of present-day urban existence—corruption, alienation, “civic weariness”—was an at-once nostalgic and forward-looking sketch of a life in which “all human activity could be brought back together so that work, play, love, life, politics, science, and art could be a shared experience.” Such a world, Morris and Hess argued, offered challenges both to modern liberals, with their affection for central planning and managerial efficiency, and to modern conservatives, with their defense of sharp class distinctions and corporate perquisites. To build a world grounded in neighborhood spaces, local people first needed to begin thinking of themselves as <italic>citizens</italic> of their neighborhoods, not merely residents, and to act accordingly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211428770">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Morris and Hess closed by sketching a day in the life of a fictional community in the District of Columbia. Their story is set sometime in the future, several years after a major depression and famine have decimated the nation’s cities. However, unlike the mid-1970s crop of apocalyptic survivalism handbooks, this is no fantasy of hyper-individualism, violent conflict over resources, or fearful retreat to the countryside. Rather, as residents go about their daily business, they ruefully recall the bad old days <italic>before</italic> the economic crash—a time of transience, isolation, and selfishness. Postcrisis necessity has been the midwife for cooperative self-reliance. During the famine years, neighbors had dug up nonessential streets and filled them with produce gardens, even as the cowed city administration dithered. Soon, participatory assemblies came to govern the neighborhood entirely unfettered by outside bureaucrats, while residents developed rooftop wind turbines, local greenhouses, and a “global inter-neighborhood TV network” to swap innovations with far-off counterparts. Now, kindness and creativity flourish. Every person has found “a productive place in the community—to feed it, provide its material needs, delight it, decorate it, enrich it in some way.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211428770">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>However utopian the book’s suggestions, it feels strangely quiescent compared with the urban struggles of the preceding decade. As the authors freely admitted, their manual emphasized “reconstruction” over “defense,” collective ownership of new facilities over confrontations with local developers or landlords. Most notably, <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic> is remarkably silent on issues of race in the contemporary city. In one of the few oblique references to urban racial politics, Morris and Hess dismissed the potential for local “isolationism and prejudice,” sanguinely predicting that “as neighborhoods gain a sense of self-confidence and self-awareness, they will become much more outward-oriented. . . . Checkpoint-Charlies on a neighborhood’s borders seem unlikely.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211428770">55</xref></sup> With such sunny sentiments, the book sidelined a set of political claims that would eventually erupt at the movement’s very heart.</p>

<title>A National Coalition for Local Rule</title>
<p>The year of <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic>’s publication also marked the beginning of the end for the Adams-Morgan experiments. Massive real estate speculation more than doubled average sales prices in parts of the area between the early and mid-1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144211428770">56</xref></sup> Escalating costs drove some renters out, and wealthier newcomers typically joined traditional block clubs rather than the AMO. Attendance at AMO meetings dropped sharply after 1975. Though members of the alternative community decried the changes, several observers and AMO leaders noted that, ironically, the white countercultural activists who participated in the organization’s early phases were themselves the opening thrust of gentrification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144211428770">57</xref></sup> But the same year saw the creation of a nationwide coalition promoting many of the same principles of local sovereignty on which the original self-sufficiency projects in Adams-Morgan had been based.</p>
<p>In 1971, Milton Kotler’s Columbus ally, Leopold Bernhard, had taken a new parish job in Washington, and that year the two of them formed the Institute for Neighborhood Studies, a fresh spin-off from the IPS, as a way to promote their self-government ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144211428770">58</xref></sup> By 1975, they had initiated plans to form a national federation of neighborhood organizations along these principles. Along with AMO leaders, Kotler convened the inaugural meeting of the Alliance for Neighborhood Government (ANG), with representatives of forty neighborhood organizations from six eastern cities in attendance. There, neighbors from the Sto-Rox district near Pittsburgh spoke for many in describing the “heart” of their movement as “the essential belief in the right to freedom.” In a keynote address, Senator Hatfield compared the U.S. political landscape to the dystopic world of Franz Kafka’s novel <italic>The Castle</italic>, a realm of suffocating bureaucracy and robotic obedience to authority. Like the colonial-era revolutionists, Hatfield told delegates, Americans must “break the chains that bind us,” returning authority to vehicles such as “the town meeting, the voluntary organizations, the PTA, the neighborhood association.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211428770">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Envisioning empowered neighborhood assemblies as a combination of New England town meeting and New Left consciousness-raising group, ANG activists sought to overturn urban managerial liberalism in favor of neighborhood-level liberty. By the next year, the ANG had developed a “Neighborhood Bill of Responsibilities and Rights.” In a bicentennial-year mirroring of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, delegates from 130 neighborhoods in twenty-seven Northeast and Midwest cities gathered in Philadelphia to endorse the manifesto, which demanded for urbanites the right to “govern themselves democratically and justly” at the neighborhood level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211428770">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early on, though, the vision encapsulated by the very name of the ANG caused uncertainty among participants. At the founding conference, participants had split over whether the slogan “neighborhood power” ought to mean outright self-government or merely enhanced powers to advise central authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211428770">61</xref></sup> Pointing to the AMO experience as example, several speakers claimed that true local government could provide a means for white middle-class newcomers to establish a foothold, dislodge the poor, and undermine heterogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211428770">62</xref></sup> In addition, while many such activists were antisuburban in temperament—deploring, for instance, the exclusionary social models that they saw operating in outlying developments—the urban landscape of quasi-independent neighborhoods that their leaders envisioned could look strikingly similar to the fragmented, patchwork-quilt municipal patterns that predominated in suburban governance. These contentious questions remained unresolved, but by late 1976, the ANG had realized that many neighborhood activists, while ready for aggressive action on issues like redlining and substandard services, were not yet fully inclined to join in more radical calls for local autonomy. That fall, it started the National Association of Neighborhoods (NAN) as its education arm. The latter organization—originally intended to appeal to “neighborhood organizations which may not be prepared, at this point, to identify with neighborhood government”—quickly replaced the ANG altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211428770">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite such qualms over the coalition’s ultimate purpose, the ANG/NAN swiftly grew, expanding from 85 member organizations in 1976 to almost 230 in 1979, with a heavy majority hailing from large and medium-sized cities of the industrial Midwest, New England, and the mid-Atlantic region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211428770">64</xref></sup> Courted by Jimmy Carter during the 1976 election season, the NAN was soon able to enlist high-profile speakers such as Monsignor Geno Baroni, congresswomen Bella Abzug and Shirley Chisholm, and Carter aides Midge Costanza, Marcy Kaptur, and Sarah Weddington.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211428770">65</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the group forged especially close ties with the National Congress of Neighborhood Women (NCNW), a Brooklyn-based vehicle for a working-class, urban-accented brand of feminist activism. The NCNW hosted early NAN conferences, and eventually one of its founders, Sally Martino Fisher, won the NAN presidency as part of her mission to “bridge the gap between the women’s movement and the neighborhood movement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211428770">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Capitol Hill corridors and in cities across the country, the NAN and its local affiliates fought against destructive freeway construction, indifferent city halls, redlining, displacement, and a host of other urban ills. In most of these campaigns, the NAN agenda for neighborhood self-rule came through not in grandiose visions for sweeping political reconfigurations, but instead in pleas for individual neighborhoods simply to be heard on matters of immediate concern. For Kotler and his cadre of coalition leaders, however, two issues proved particularly tricky.</p>
<p>First was the degree to which demands for community control came increasingly to be seen as an agenda of aggrieved blue-collar whites who sought to exclude people of color from their local schools and neighborhoods. In the shadow of sometimes-violent disputes over integration busing, the term <italic>community control</italic> held markedly different valences than it had only a half decade earlier. “One must shudder,” Theodore Lowi had declared in 1971, “at the prospect of neighborhood governments in poor districts succumbing to control by brownshirts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211428770">67</xref></sup> By the mid-1970s, Kotler later recalled, several of his IPS colleagues feared that the NAN itself might become a “fascist grassroots organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211428770">68</xref></sup> Similarly, to mainline civil rights leaders, it seemed suspicious that white urbanites had taken up the banner of local autonomy just as African Americans were beginning to win citywide municipal offices in significant numbers. By 1978, NAACP chief Benjamin Hooks was fretting that the very word <italic>neighborhood</italic> had come to stand exclusively for white urban districts. Thus, when neighborhood advocates eventually convinced the Carter administration to appoint a National Commission on Neighborhoods, even the name given to such a body elicited apprehension. As Hooks explained, “In this period of media-propagated code words, we are concerned that ‘neighborhoods’ not signal ‘white,’ while ‘urban,’ ‘inner-city’ or ‘ghetto’ signal Black—thus effectively excluding the racial minorities from ‘neighborhood’ programs altogether.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211428770">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>To Kotler, such a turn was galling. During the mid-1960s, after all, he had promoted neighborhood self-government as a tool for empowering black inner-city communities, while working to sell the concept to acquaintances in the SNCC and CORE leaderships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211428770">70</xref></sup> In a 1968 interview, he had also predicted that white communities, if allowed some measure of local control, “would become less vicious, less frightened of the black community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211428770">71</xref></sup> Kotler and Bernhard did harbor intermittent concerns over “the potential evil of neighborhood control”; in 1972, they briefly suspended their consulting work with neighborhood organizations after observing busing-related violence in Prince Georges County, Maryland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211428770">72</xref></sup> However, they eventually concluded that it was exclusion from “authentic participation” which held the greater danger. If blocked from exercising political authority even in their own neighborhoods, the two men wrote in 1977, “the masses can generate their own purpose which may be as ugly as Nazism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211428770">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>A resolution offered at the founding ANG conference had stressed that neighborhoods must guard against “oppressive, irresponsible and conservative structures, even if they are based in democratic decisions of indigenous neighborhood people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144211428770">74</xref></sup> Nonetheless, former NAN legislative chair Conrad Weiler recalls that mainline civil rights groups “were extremely suspicious, and at best we only had a truce.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144211428770">75</xref></sup> Kotler, for his part, came to blame activists of the decade’s white ethnic revival for “playing with fire,” through their “reckless” focus on ethnic heritage as the basis for neighborhood solidarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144211428770">76</xref></sup> Meanwhile, closer to the ground, NAN leaders sometimes had to engage in a complex balancing act. In Weiler’s own Philadelphia neighborhood of Queen Village, for instance, the affection of many longtime white residents for the city’s mayor—Frank Rizzo, a populist racial conservative—cut against the NAN’s progressive national agenda. As Weiler remembers, he “agonized” over how to channel local organizing in a direction that would advance the NAN’s more inclusive goals. “We didn’t emphasize all the things we were doing with NAN when we were wearing our local hat,” Weiler explains; “I certainly wasn’t going to get anywhere by reaming out Rizzo.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144211428770">77</xref></sup> The legacy of racial disputes over community control—from Ocean Hill-Brownsville to busing battles in Boston and elsewhere—hung over the topic of neighborhood government, engendering misgivings on all sides.</p>
<p>A second question that perplexed NAN leaders was the degree to which they should cooperate with the broader political goals of the IPS, which had functioned as an early incubator for their organization. These IPS roots led the NAN to develop the beginnings of a transnational neighborhood vision. Indeed, the group’s occasional stabs at neighborhood cooperation across national boundaries distinguished it from its peers. The NAN was particularly enthusiastic about Italy’s 1976 legislation establishing legal standing for neighborhood councils, a move intended to create “schools of democracy” and empower marginalized groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144211428770">78</xref></sup> At one point, the Italian city of Florence invited the NAN to convene a gathering of European neighborhood organizations, and approximately fifty NAN leaders conducted workshops with community activists from across the continent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144211428770">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the early 1970s, the IPS had directed its attentions to the political situation in Chile, where Salvador Allende’s socialist-led Popular Unity coalition had recently taken power. After the right-wing coup led by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the IPS worked closely with Chilean allies of the deposed Allende government, including former minister Orlando Letelier, who was chosen to head the IPS-founded Transnational Institute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144211428770">80</xref></sup> When Letelier and an IPS colleague were assassinated in Washington in 1976—victims of a car bomb planted by agents of the Chilean secret police—it galvanized participants in all the IPS spin-off projects, including those involved in neighborhood-related work. In <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic>, for instance, David Morris bemoaned the fact that U.S. neighborhoods had not tried to assist their Chilean counterparts before the rightist coup.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144211428770">81</xref></sup> Meanwhile, Kotler’s IPS colleagues pressed him to use the NAN as a platform for supporting Chilean dissidents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144211428770">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>At its 1976 national meeting in Brooklyn, the NAN took up the issue, giving a neighborhood inflection to international human rights concerns. There, at Kotler’s invitation, Chilean exiles detailed the Pinochet regime’s repression of local-level urban democratic groups. NAN support for democratic neighborhood groups abroad, Kotler told delegates, would refute the charges of parochialism which were frequently lobbed at the U.S. neighborhoods movement. The NAN’s human rights task force approved resolutions stating that “neighborhood self-government is a fundamental vehicle for human rights” and declaring it the duty of all neighborhoods to “defend democratic neighborhood organizations throughout the world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144211428770">83</xref></sup> But seven months later, at a national meeting in Pittsburgh, the leaders appeared to have overplayed their hand. The plenary session voted down a tougher set of resolutions calling for local affiliates to lobby the U.S. government in support of Chilean exiles and political prisoners. Meanwhile, in perhaps an implicit rebuke to the leadership, several session organizers urged participants not to forget their roots in everyday “rats-and-trash” issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144211428770">84</xref></sup> Reading his organization’s mood, Kotler soon distanced himself from the IPS’s international agenda, and, as he later related, he flatly refused a request from the IPS leadership that the NAN send a goodwill delegation to communist Cuba.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144211428770">85</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the debate highlighted the potential for disconnection between the movement’s leaders and theorists, on one hand, and its volunteer local participants, on the other.</p>

<sec id="section4-0096144211428770">
<title>Fracturing of a Movement</title>
<p>In retrospect, several events of 1979 served as symbolic endpoint for the utopian decentralizing movement that took the city neighborhood as its emblem. Ten years after Hess’s public conversion to the New Left, the release of Kotler’s <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic>, and Mailer’s crusade for “Power to the Neighborhoods,” the movement seemed to have exhausted its energies. In truth, it had always been an unstable coalition, peopled by activists with vastly divergent motivations. The “hip coalition of the left and right” that Norman Mailer had once envisioned eventually splintered in two directions, with the language of neighborhood and local-level control being used for different purposes by different groups. Two stories from that year demonstrate how the movement’s internal tensions and ideological contradictions eventually diffused its energies.</p>
<p>The first concerns the breakup of the cluster of institutions in Adams-Morgan and Hess’s analysis of that collapse. Beneath the surface of Hess’s decentralist vision lived a stubborn disregard for the urban political claims of the Great Society’s civil rights wing. For a decade, he had impatiently dismissed liberal qualms that fully sovereign neighborhoods might seek to exclude racial minorities as merely the quibbles of elitists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144211428770">86</xref></sup> Furthermore, he insisted, true neighborhood sovereignty would finally make black communities “something more than just a niggertown appended to the white establishment’s turf.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144211428770">87</xref></sup> But Hess was forced to confront these urban racial dynamics more fully when his “ethnic Walden Pond” began to disintegrate.</p>
<p>In 1975’s <italic>Dear America</italic>, Hess had narrated the Adams-Morgan story with a sense of exhilaration. Four years later, however, he appended a much different ending. After decamping in 1976 for the West Virginia countryside, Hess looked back on his five-year experiment with bitterness. His old aspirations for the neighborhood, he reflected in a 1979 book, <italic>Community Technology</italic>, “seemed now very romantic and very wrong.” Why, he asked, had neighbors at the assemblies not plunged more eagerly into developing the co-ops, the rooftop gardens, or the warehouse fish farm? Why had they not more enthusiastically adopted his vision for self-sufficiency and self-determination? To explain this lackluster support, he rewrote the Adams-Morgan experience through the lens of the Moynihan Report, charging that an insidious culture of dependency among African Americans had undermined any chance for a new community life.</p>
<p>“Are blacks particularly disabled when it comes to seeking alternatives to welfare programs?” Hess asked. His answer was equivocal at best. In this retelling, enthusiastic young whites had eagerly taken up Community Technology’s “skill- and production-centered activities,” thus demonstrating “solidly middle-class values out of a primarily European culture.” Their black neighbors, in contrast, had refused to assume responsibility for community hardships. Furthermore, even in areas where the AMO did take action, Hess condemned its black majority for seeking “power <italic>in</italic>, not power <italic>to change</italic>, the system.” Instead of pursuing economic self-reliance, for example, the assembly had appealed to philanthropic grant makers. And rather than pooling money to buy up neighborhood properties, it had focused on reining in landlord abuses. Black demands, Hess decided, now consisted only of being “given something rather than seeking the chance to do something.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144211428770">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the chapter’s end, Hess had invoked nearly every distinguishing stereotype of the culture-of-poverty narrative: “parents opiated by a welfare existence”; undisciplined children raised on “TV snacks, beer, and dope”; the community’s “habitual dependence on unearned incomes”; residents’ inability to create “families that would absorb their energies and deserve their loyalties.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144211428770">89</xref></sup> Apparently, liberal largesse mixed with black urban pathology had destroyed any chance for neighborhood self-reliance. However, this portrait of a listless neighborhood, acquiescent to the status quo, erases the extraordinarily active role that the AMO did play during the mid-1970s. To be sure, it had not followed the radical blueprint for self-sufficiency sketched out in <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic>, but it did wage aggressive campaigns against redlining, landlord misconduct, real estate speculation, and displacement. Activists, for example, adopted theatrical tactics to dramatize lending disparities, in one instance symbolically “redlining the rich” by painting crimson stripes around “for sale” signs in wealthy districts. Or, when a savings and loan planned to open a local branch, the AMO successfully demanded that a community board be empowered to review its lending for discriminatory patterns. Tenant groups worked to stop displacement of poorer residents, while some of the most militant AMO activists posted stern warnings that affluent white pioneers were unwelcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144211428770">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hess’s account, then, raises the question of what neighborhood self-government might mean if residents aren’t free to make their own choices—including the decision to combat exploitive landlords rather than buying out their properties, or to lobby for jobs programs rather than raising trout in warehouse tanks. Two apparently irreconcilable approaches butted heads: a utopian vision for total neighborhood self-sufficiency and sovereignty, and the use of civil rights and protest tactics to promote a more equitable division of metropolitan resources. It seemed that no rapprochement was possible. Hess’s reassessment dramatized the unstable relationship of neighborhood self-reliance advocates with the urban consequences of the nation’s painful racial legacy.</p>
<p>This evaluation drew a searing condemnation from Hess’s former collaborator, David Morris, who charged that Hess had narcissistically placed his own backyard tinkering projects at the center of the neighborhood’s story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0096144211428770">91</xref></sup> But even as Hess’s neighborhood vision veered off into a conservative racial critique, the NAN moved in the opposite direction. The diverse strands present in the organization—libertarianism, white ethnic revivalism, left-wing social-justice organizing—had heretofore coexisted relatively peacefully under the banner of neighborhood empowerment. However, these tensions came to a head in 1979. While the organization had once stood self-consciously outside the liberal umbrella, it now stepped inside, moving away from the vision of local self-government in favor of centralist government policies. Ironically, 1979 marked both a high-water point for the NAN, and the beginning of its demise.</p>
<p>That spring, the NAN had launched its most ambitious program, a Neighborhood Platform Campaign, intended to express the united interests of U.S. neighborhoods to the two political parties in advance of the 1980 elections. After a flurry of fund-raising and new staff hires, the federation organized almost fifty regional neighborhood conventions, in every corner of the continental United States, at which local people could express their hopes and demands for their communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0096144211428770">92</xref></sup> At the culminating national meeting, held in Louisville in November 1979, over four hundred delegates debated the regional resolutions, eventually producing an ambitious document billed as “a common interest statement from the neighborhood people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0096144211428770">93</xref></sup> Dick Simpson, the former independent Chicago alderman heading the effort, proclaimed that neighborhood advocates “will support any candidates who support our National Neighborhood Platform.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0096144211428770">94</xref></sup> Intended as a bold proclamation from the grassroots, the NAN’s National Neighborhood Platform promised to serve as a center of gravity for a diverse and increasingly unwieldy organization.</p>
<p>The platform that was eventually adopted, however, shows just how much the NAN had changed over its four years of existence. Neighborhood sovereignty, though still a goal, had receded from its central position, and the document instead incorporated a checklist of traditional left-Democratic policy items, all envisioning a substantially increased role for central government: round-the-clock day care centers, full-employment legislation, a guaranteed annual income, stringent affirmative action guidelines, a federal hotels tax to fund community arts, a ban on nonrecyclable beverage containers, ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, amnesty for undocumented immigrants, complete government-funded access to contraception and abortion, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0096144211428770">95</xref></sup> With its vision of a strong role for central government in reshaping local relationships, this document departed quite notably from the Neighborhood Bill of Responsibilities and Rights that the group had adopted just over three years earlier. At the same time, many of these positions were anathema to the blue-collar Catholic communities that had come to compose a sizable chunk of the NAN membership.</p>
<p>As tensions erupted in Louisville between advocates for a material future and a self-governing one, a national agenda and a local one, the organization’s longtime leadership was challenged by a new, more avowedly left-oriented faction, led by activists from the Chicago reform politics community. At the helm were former SDS member Walter “Slim” Coleman, founder of Chicago’s hard-hitting Heart of Uptown Coalition, and the Rev. Charles Koen, organizer of nationalist-led civil rights struggles in Cairo, Illinois.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0096144211428770">96</xref></sup> Meanwhile, newer constituencies—especially organizers of an insurgent NAN Black Caucus—bristled against the “little circle of academics” that allegedly controlled the NAN.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0096144211428770">97</xref></sup> After Koen narrowly unseated the incumbent president, Sally Martino Fisher, the incoming leadership increasingly downplayed neighborhood self-government in favor of a more recognizably progressive redistributive national program, inspired by their years organizing out of the Alinsky social action tradition and the black nationalist movement. They backed Senator Edward Kennedy’s challenge to President Carter in the 1980 Democratic primaries, a rebuke to the older leadership’s embrace of Carter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0096144211428770">98</xref></sup> Over the next several years, most of the NAN founders, including Kotler, filtered out of the organization, even as a declining grant economy and the inception of the Reagan administration combined to undermine the NAN as an effective national force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0096144211428770">99</xref></sup> (In a strange epilogue, by the 1990s the NAN had transformed yet again—this time into a corporate-friendly pressure group defending electrical and telecom deregulation, subprime mortgage lenders, elimination of the estate tax, and the rollback of environmental legislation.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0096144211428770">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along the way, the coalition had its victories. NAN activists worked with white ethnic lobby groups to convince the Census Bureau to aggregate neighborhood data. During the late 1970s, they carved out a leading role in raising the issues of gentrification and displacement, while contributing to the successful campaign for the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0096144211428770">101</xref></sup> What’s more, by the mid-1980s, many cities had developed mechanisms for neighborhood participation in municipal decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0096144211428770">102</xref></sup> Yet even though such innovations lived on, they did so in forms disconnected from the political seedbed that originally lent them coherence. In their advisory role, municipal neighborhood councils never fulfilled the radical dreams expressed in manifestos such as Kotler’s <italic>Neighborhood Government</italic> or Morris and Hess’s <italic>Neighborhood Power</italic>. Likewise, notes historian Carroll Pursell, the Appropriate Technology movement found itself increasingly marginalized by the mid-1980s, as agribusiness, private utilities, and large construction firms reasserted their power in Washington.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0096144211428770">103</xref></sup> Finally, the burgeoning New Right would eventually attempt to fold the language of neighborhood empowerment and authenticity into its broader antistatist appeal. In 1975, for instance, Ronald Reagan called for an “end to giantism, for a return to the human scale,” and his 1980 presidential campaign would promote federal spending reductions and targeted tax cuts as the most effective avenue for “unleashing neighborhood self-help initiatives under the control of neighborhood residents.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0096144211428770">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three Brookings Institutions scholars have recently dubbed the 1970s efforts to “institutionalize citizen participation” a failure, in part because of unwillingness on the part of elites to create meaningful avenues for participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0096144211428770">105</xref></sup> Already by December 1980, political scientist John Goering could observe that the neighborhoods movement as a whole had become nearly dormant at the national level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0096144211428770">106</xref></sup> Furthermore, as scholar Robert Nelson suggests, the 1970s campaigns for neighborhood autonomy were eventually subsumed into a private neighborhoods movement. While 1970s activists demanded public-sector powers for their neighborhoods, the true success of neighborhood government came, perhaps, with the huge growth of private community associations, a form of private collective ownership directed by developers. From 1970 to 1999, approximately one-third of new U.S. housing units were constructed as part of a private community association. Making their inroads in newly developed areas, particularly across the Sunbelt, such associations offered a partial alternative to the traditional municipal governance patterns of older metropolitan areas. At the same time, they signaled a dramatic privatizing of the dream of neighborhood empowerment which had galvanized so many activists of the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0096144211428770">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>“We lost,” Kotler wrote in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0096144211428770">108</xref></sup> The neighborhood government movement, he felt, had ended as a protector of property values and nothing more.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0096144211428770">109</xref></sup> Mailer’s mayoral campaign, Hatfield’s neighborhoods legislation, Hess’s “ethnic Walden Pond”—none had a terribly realistic chance of succeeding, at least in the near term. But each of these expressed a powerful sense that the block-level city community offered a remaining repository of strength in a post-urban-crisis era. And before it disintegrated, this movement spawned any number of local affiliates that did survive, and which proved more committed to an inclusive approach. In Chicago, NAN veterans helped elect Harold Washington mayor. In Pittsburgh and Baltimore, they monitored large banks for redlining. In Brooklyn, they allied with white ethnic, African American, and Puerto Rican women to run a neighborhood college program. The 1970s dream of a nation of sovereign neighborhoods may have been flawed, but their communities were still worth fighting for.</p>

<p>This article treats the radical movement for neighborhood sovereignty that had its intellectual origins in decentralist wings of the New Left. However, that movement itself emerged amid a political climate in which municipal administrative decentralization had gained momentum. For example, in the wake of New York Mayor John Lindsay’s adoption of “little city halls,” numerous cities—from Boston and Baltimore to Atlanta and Houston—had moved toward decentralization of service provision. See, e.g., Richard L. Cole, “Citizen Participation in Municipal Politics,” <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 19, no. 4 (November 1975): 761-81; Donna E. Shalala, <italic>Neighborhood Governance: Issues and Proposals</italic> (New York: American Jewish Committee, 1971), 8-12; and Douglas Yates, <italic>Neighborhood Democracy: The Politics and Impacts of Decentralization</italic> (Lexington, MA: Lexington Books, 1973). These municipal administrative trends, however, are outside the scope of this article, which instead seeks to examine the utopianist visions promulgated by a more radical, antiestablishment cadre of urban theorists and activists, those with roots in the New Left.</p>

<p>Of course, while emerging most visibly out of the urban challenges and political movements of the 1960s, these communitarian ideals regarding the city neighborhood’s function can also be traced back to Progressive Era thinkers such as Mary Parker Follett, John Dewey, Jane Addams, and others.

<p>Historian Steven Conn has astutely noted the divergence between the “urban progressives” of the New Left and Black Power movements and the “antiurban progressives” of countercultural rural communes and the environmental movement. Conn, “Back to the Garden: Communes, the Environment, and Antiurban Pastoralism at the End of the Sixties,” <italic>Journal of Urban History</italic> 36, no. 6 (November 2010): 831-48. The decentralist wing of the 1970s neighborhoods movement, however, often evaded this dichotomy, fostering many activists who combined a countercultural, environmentally oriented ethos with an unabashedly prourban sensibility.</p>
