<abstract>
<p>The 1997 Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provided states with funding to expand public insurance to children in low-income families. Recent studies suggest CHIP improved family finances, but it is unknown whether CHIP specifically affected the prevalence of material hardships such as food and housing insecurity. This study uses cross-sectional data on low-income children from the National Survey of American Families (1997-2002) to examine the impact of CHIP on material hardships. Using an instrumental variable that exploits variation in income eligibility cutoffs across states and years, I find that households gaining CHIP eligibility did not experience significant changes in material hardship. CHIP significantly reduced the prevalence of postponed care for the subgroup of households close to the poverty line. For low-income families with children, public health insurance may play a larger role in increasing access to care than in supplementing the budget for necessities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The burden of health care spending on low- and middle-income households is a central topic of concern within health policy in the United States. Over the last decade, a growing proportion of American families have reported problems paying medical bills, causing them to delay care or to cut back on essentials such as food and housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712470566">Doty, Collins, Rustgi, &amp; Kriss, 2008</xref>). Spending burden has grown among all households but has been greatest among lower- and middle-income families. The destabilizing effect of medical spending on families has also been documented among individuals filing for bankruptcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712470566">Himmelstein, Thorne, Warren, &amp; Woolhandler, 2009</xref>) and undergoing home foreclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712470566">Pollack &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>). Low-income families are especially susceptible to financial problems from health care because they often live paycheck-to-paycheck and lack savings to withstand unexpected medical costs. Nearly half of all households in the bottom income quintile do not have a bank account, stocks, or pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712470566">Carasso &amp; McKernan, 2008</xref>). Low- and middle-income families have also been hardest hit by the erosion of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712470566">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Partially as a response to the growing financial burden, states and the federal government have expanded public insurance eligibility over time. Low-income children were one of the first targets for expanded coverage. Beginning in the 1980s, the Medicaid program raised its income eligibility for children to above the federal poverty level (FPL) and extended coverage to pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712470566">Hill, Bartlett, &amp; Brostrom, 1993</xref>). Insurance for children was substantially expanded again in 1997 with the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provided almost $40 billion dollars over 10 years to states for health insurance programs to cover children in low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712470566">Peterson, 2006</xref>). In recent years, several states also have extended public insurance coverage to parents of children covered by Medicaid or CHIP and, in limited cases, to childless adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712470566">Sommers, Baicker, &amp; Epstein, 2012</xref>). These efforts pave the way for a substantial expected expansion of coverage under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA offers new funds to state Medicaid programs to cover poor adults, as well as subsidies to nonpoor households purchasing private insurance through insurance exchanges. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states are not required to participate in the Medicaid expansions in order to maintain their existing Medicaid programs. After taking into account that some states may not expand coverage, the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the ACA would cover around 30 million new individuals at a cost of more than one trillion dollars over 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712470566">U.S. Congressional Budget Office, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Expanding coverage should reduce financial burden for low-income families, especially if those taking up coverage were previously uninsured. The size of this effect is likely to vary, however, depending on the financial resources and health status of the population targeted by coverage expansions. Moreover, financial burden can take several different forms ranging from lower savings and less disposable income to more severe forms of hardship such as cutting back on essentials like food and housing. Expanded insurance may affect some, but not all, of these dimensions of financial well-being.</p>
<p>Material hardship—broadly defined as the inability of a household to meet one of its basic resource needs—is a critical, but often overlooked, consequence of health spending burden. Material hardship measures help illuminate how resource constraints affect the consumption and savings opportunities of low-income families and also independently predict child well-being and family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712470566">Gershoff, Aber, Raver, &amp; Lennon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712470566">Mistry, Lowe, Benner, &amp; Chien, 2008</xref>). Incorporating these measures into evaluations of publicly funded coverage expansions thus provide a more nuanced picture of whether such policies increase the financial stability of low-income households.</p>
<p>In this article, I investigate whether expanded eligibility for public insurance under CHIP affected food security and paying for housing among low-income families with children. I also investigate whether CHIP affected the likelihood that a family postponed needed medical care, an outcome that often reflects financial burden. Low-income families with children are an important population to study because families with children are at higher risk for financial insecurity and material deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712470566">Beverly, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712470566">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This is the first study that uses the expansion of coverage under CHIP as a natural experiment to examine the effect of insurance eligibility on material hardship among families with children in the United States. The potential link between CHIP and material hardship is suggested by two recent studies, which look at distinct, but related, outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712470566">Leininger, Levy, and Schanzenbach (2010)</xref> analyzed household consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey spanning the years 1996 to 2002. They found that changes in CHIP eligibility among low-income families with children were associated with decreased out-of-pocket spending on health insurance and an increase in nonhealth consumption, particularly spending on transportation and durable goods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712470566">Gross and Notowidigdo (2011)</xref> examined whether expanded Medicaid eligibility decreased individual bankruptcy rates at the state level, and they found that a 10 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility between 1994 and 2004 decreased household bankruptcy rates in a state by 8.4%. They confirm the robustness of this result by showing that business bankruptcies were not affected by insurance eligibility changes. Both studies identify the effect of eligibility expansions using an instrumental variable that simulates eligibility for a representative pool of children in each state and year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712470566">Currie &amp; Gruber, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Another suggestive piece of evidence comes from a recent evaluation of the Oregon Medicaid program’s coverage expansion to childless adults. Beginning in 2008, low-income childless adults were offered the chance to enter a lottery for limited new enrollment slots in the Oregon Medicaid program. Lottery “winners” who enrolled in Medicaid reported significantly lower levels of financial hardship related to health care expenses than did those who entered the lottery but did not win (the control group). After 1 year in the program, the winners were 20 percentage points less likely than the control group to report any out-of-pocket medical expenses, 18 points less likely to report currently owing money for medical expenses, and 15 points less likely to have recently borrowed money or skipped other payments to pay medical bills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712470566">Finkelstein et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the strong quasi-experimental design, findings from the Oregon study cannot necessarily be generalized to low-income families with children who differ from childless adults in both their health spending needs and their financial resources.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077558712470566">
<title>Background on the Children’s Health Insurance Program</title>
<p>CHIP was authorized as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712470566">Wooldridge et al., 2005</xref>). The program was designed to extend health insurance coverage to low-income children, especially those in families that earned too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but did not have access to private health insurance. CHIP was implemented as a federal grant program, with a structure that allowed states to decide how high to set income eligibility cutoffs and some flexibility in the design of the insurance benefit package. The states’ matching rates were improved relative to Medicaid, with an enhanced federal share and reduced state share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712470566">Kenney &amp; Chang, 2004</xref>). CHIP also provided funding for expanded outreach and streamlined eligibility determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712470566">Kronebusch &amp; Elbel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712470566">Williams &amp; Rosenbach, 2007</xref>). Beginning in 2001, the federal government also gave states permission to enroll parents in CHIP on a demonstration basis.</p>
<p>By 2000, all states and the District of Columbia had created a health insurance program for children with CHIP funds, but the design of the programs and the income eligibility cutoffs varied widely. For example, for children ages 6 to 15 years, eligibility limits ranged from 140% of the FPL in North Dakota to 350% in New Jersey, with 24 states setting their maximums at exactly 200% (TRIM3; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trim3.urban.org">trim3.urban.org</ext-link>). This variation in eligibility provides a useful natural experiment: because income limits were raised to different levels across states and years, it is possible to compare demographically similar children across states, years, and age groups.</p>
<p>Following the CHIP expansions, there were substantial increases in the number of children enrolled in health insurance and decreases in the number of uninsured children. One recent study finds that CHIP led to an increase in public coverage of between 14 and 20 percentage points and that more than half of the newly enrolled children were uninsured prior to implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712470566">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2009</xref>). CHIP also slightly increased the enrollment of parents in public coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712470566">Aizer &amp; Grogger, 2003</xref>), but parental participation in CHIP remained limited to four states during the early implementation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712470566">Ellwood, Merrill, &amp; Conroy, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1077558712470566">
<title>Conceptual Model</title>
<p>CHIP expanded access to public insurance coverage for children in low-income families. The primary target of these expansions was children in working families with incomes above the poverty level who did not meet existing Medicaid eligibility criteria. However, CHIP also affected children below the poverty line who were already eligible under prior Medicaid guidelines, because the program expanded outreach to this population and simplified eligibility requirements in many states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712470566">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712470566">Kronebusch &amp; Elbel, 2004</xref>). For both these populations, enrolling in subsidized coverage would likely reduce the burden of seeking medical care for children, especially for the uninsured. Previous research on CHIP expansions suggests that the program both increased utilization and reduced out-of-pocket spending for newly eligible households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712470566">Kenney, 2007</xref>). This lower spending on medical care represents a financial windfall, freeing up money in the family budget to spend on daily expenses or to put toward savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712470566">Leininger, Levy, &amp; Schanzenbach, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The expected size of the financial benefit for a newly eligible household depends on the amount of money that a household would have spent out-of-pocket on children’s health care in the absence of public coverage. Exposure to out-of-pocket spending depends both on a child’s health status (since children with chronic conditions require more provider visits and medications) and also on the availability of subsidized coverage outside of the public system. A substantial fraction—perhaps as much as two thirds—of children who joined the CHIP program would have otherwise received private health insurance, primarily through employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712470566">Gruber &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>). Although employer coverage shields families from many large expenses, CHIP substantially limited premiums and copayments costs for families who switched coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712470566">Shaefer, Grogan, &amp; Pollack, 2011</xref>). For previously uninsured children, the potential savings might be larger, although many uninsured individuals, particularly children, receive uncompensated care from safety net providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712470566">Hadley &amp; Cunningham, 2004</xref>). As mentioned earlier, CHIP also provided limited opportunities for parents to enroll, which could further limit total family health care spending. Parental enrollment in CHIP has increased over time, but remains a small fraction of overall CHIP enrollment, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712470566">U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, the reduction in out-of-pocket spending and offsetting increase in disposable income should lower the risk of material hardships. However, vulnerability to material hardship varies across households. Those households with the lowest incomes and fewest assets are generally at a higher risk for material hardship than those above the poverty line who have some savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712470566">Sullivan, Turner, &amp; Danziger, 2008</xref>). The poorest households are closer to a “subsistence threshold,” a level of consumption that is low enough to place the family at risk for material hardship. For these households, additional income on the margin could reduce the risk of experiencing a deprivation by providing an income cushion. Households that are uninsured are not only less likely to have disposable income, but they are also more likely to face higher prices for basic necessities than demographically similar households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712470566">Levy &amp; DeLeire, 2008</xref>). Households with higher predicted out-of-pocket spending are particularly vulnerable to health-related hardships. I therefore hypothesized that lower-income households and those with children in worse health would be most likely to experience a reduction in food insecurity and housing instability from CHIP coverage.</p>
<p>In addition to covering ongoing medical expenses, CHIP lowered the effective price of seeing the doctor for many previously uninsured or underinsured families. CHIP may have encouraged families to seek services that they would otherwise have delayed, like well-child visits or specialty care. I therefore hypothesized that expanded coverage would significantly reduce postponed care among households gaining coverage.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1077558712470566">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>I used data from National Survey of American Families (NSAF), a cross-sectional survey that was administered in three rounds: 1997, 1999, and 2002. Each round interviewed roughly 40,000 households, collecting information on more than 100,000 individuals. Details of the complex, multistage sampling design have been published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712470566">Kenney, Scheuren, &amp; Wang, 1997</xref>). In households with children present, up to two children were randomly selected for the survey, and information about the health and well-being of these children was reported by a knowledgeable adult. I refer to this adult as the parent, although in some cases this adult was some other family member. After adjusting for differential sampling, undercoverage of households without telephones, and nonresponse the NSAF can provide estimates that are representative of noninstitutionalized households in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712470566">Brick, Ferraro, Strickler, &amp; Liu, 2003</xref>). The sample was restricted to the 61,622 U.S.-born children residing in households with income below 300% of the FPL, a population that has been the main focus of prior studies on CHIP and a population that was most likely to be directly affected by the policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712470566">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712470566">Gruber &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>). All the analyses were weighted to the household level and standard errors were clustered at the household level to account for the nested sampling structure of the data.</p>
<sec id="section7-1077558712470566">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Two outcomes related to material hardship were examined: food problems and housing problems. Households were classified as having food problems if the adult said that in the last 12 months “the food that we bought just didn’t last, and we didn’t have money to get any more,” or if the respondent replied <italic>often</italic> or <italic>always</italic> to the statement “we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more” in the last 12 months. Housing problems were determined either if the respondent reported that there was a time when he or she was unable to pay the mortgage, rent, or utility bill in full because of lack of money in the last 12 months, or the respondent affirmed that during the last 12 months “you or your children moved in with other people even for a little while because you could not afford to pay your mortgage, rent, or utility bills.” Additionally, households were classified as having postponed care if anyone in the household in the last 12 months “did not get or postponed getting medical care or surgery when they needed it.” These were the main items on material hardship in the NSAF, and were consistently collected for all households in all survey years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712470566">Ouellette, Burstein, Long, &amp; Beecroft, 2004</xref>). These measures are also conceptually relevant, since food, utilities, and housing are among the largest expenditures for low-income households in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712470566">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712470566">
<title>Individual eligibility status</title>
<p>Using available data on household income and child characteristics, I assessed each child’s eligibility status for public insurance (whether or not the child was enrolled). Public insurance was defined as either the CHIP or Medicaid program in the respondent’s state. To predict the eligibility of a particular child, I applied the relevant eligibility determination rules in the state and year for each child. I first constructed the “eligibility income” for each household in the year, defined as the combined pretax income reported in the survey after applying earned income and child care disregards allowed by the state in the survey year. I then divided the eligibility income by the poverty thresholds for the size of the household used by federal programs. Both the income eligibility criteria and the relevant income disregards were obtained from the Transfer Income Model 3 (TRIM3), a publicly available database of state program rules. A similar methodology is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712470566">Dubay and Kenney (2000)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077558712470566">
<title>Other covariates</title>
<p>Several sociodemographic and state-level covariates were included in analyses. I included an indicator for the child’s age category (0-6, 7-12, and 13-17 years of age). Race/ethnicity of the child was classified in three mutually exclusive categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White/other. Several measures of the child’s health status were examined: an indicator for whether the parent reported the child had a disability, an indicator for negative child mental health, an indicator for whether the child’s behavior was aggravating to the parent, and the child’s health status as rated by the parent on a 5-point scale. I also included covariates for characteristics of parents and families: whether the household was headed by a single parent, whether there were more than four individuals in the child’s family (including the child), whether there was at least one working adult in the household, and parental age, educational attainment, and parental health. I also included two state-level covariates: the average monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the state and year of the survey and the highest minimum wage available in the state and year.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-1077558712470566">
<title>Instrumental Variables Regression</title>
<p>Following other studies that have estimated the impact of CHIP on coverage and health services utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712470566">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712470566">Gruber &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712470566">Lo Sasso &amp; Buchmueller, 2004</xref>), I treated expanded eligibility under CHIP as providing exogenous state-level variation in access to subsidized health insurance. Specifically, the causal effect of CHIP was identified through changes in the income eligibility cutoffs for public insurance across age groups of U.S.-born children within states and across years. I used a version of the now-common simulated eligibility instrument constructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712470566">Gruber and Simon (2008)</xref>, and provided by those authors.</p>
<p>The instrument (“Generosity”) was computed by applying the age-specific income eligibility cutoffs for each state to the same nationally representative, random sample of children in the Survey of Income and Program Participation in each year and then deriving a predicted proportion of children in each age interval from the national sample who would be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP insurance in the survey year. Because the eligibility rules were applied to a national sample, the simulated proportion of eligible children in each state should reflect only the generosity of the eligibility cutoffs in that state and not variation in income stemming either from the state’s economic climate or from a strategic response among families who keep their incomes below the state cutoffs to qualify for public coverage.</p>
<p>I began by estimating a reduced-form ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model for each of the study outcomes with the instrumental variable as a regressor:</p>

<p>where <italic>Y</italic> denotes the probability of experiencing any of the study outcomes for child <italic>i</italic>, in family <italic>j</italic>, state <italic>s</italic>, and year <italic>t</italic>. Indicators for <italic>Year</italic> were included to control for concurrent trends in the social and economic environment that may be correlated with material hardship. I also included a vector for child demographics (<italic>Demo</italic>) and family characteristics (<italic>Family</italic>), minimum wage (<italic>Minimum</italic>), unemployment rates (<italic>Unemp</italic>), and state fixed effects (<italic>State</italic>). ϵ<sub><italic>ijst</italic></sub> represents an error term.</p>
<p>Next, I incorporated the instrumental variable into a two-stage regression model. The first stage used OLS to estimate the probability that a child was eligible for public coverage through variation in state and age-specific income thresholds <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1077558712470566">

The first-stage <italic>F</italic> statistics range from 18.8 to 246.7, indicating that the instrument was highly predictive of individual eligibility status (the rule-of-thumb threshold for weak instruments is <italic>F</italic> &lt; 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712470566">Staiger &amp; Stock, 1997</xref>). In the second stage, I regressed each of the outcomes on predicted public insurance eligibility, while controlling for the same set of covariates. That is, I used the instrument to identify variation in individual-level predicted insurance eligibility that was driven by exogenous changes in state eligibility rules. The second stage equation can be expressed as follows:</p>

All regression models were estimated first on the full study sample and then separately for lower-income and higher-income households (income 0% to 150% of the FPL and 151% to 300% of the FPL), and for a subsample of children with disabilities or fair/poor health status. These subgroups were separately examined to examine whether the potential impact of CHIP on material hardship differed between poorer households (that were likely closer to the material hardship threshold) versus those with higher incomes, and those with higher expected out-of-pocket health care spending.</p>

<p>Slightly fewer than half of all children in the sample were eligible for public insurance in 1997, but that proportion had increased to 73% of all such children by 2002. The uninsured rate also declined substantially—from 17% overall in 1997 to 12% in 2002. However, there was no discernible overall trend in any of the study outcomes: overall, around 12% of the households postponed care, around 36% experienced food problems, and one quarter experienced housing problems. When examining income subgroups, the relative increase in public insurance eligibility was greatest for higher-income families and the decrease in the uninsured rate greatest for the poorest families. There were no distinct trends in the prevalence of material hardships within these subgroups. Finally, there was a substantial decline in the uninsured rate among children with health limitations and also a significant decrease in food problems (from 55% in 1997 to 47% in 2002).</p>
<p>Further socioeconomic and demographic descriptive statistics for the full sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712470566">Table 2</xref> for each year. The notable demographic trend over the study period was an increase in the share of low-income children who were Hispanic (increasing from 19% to 24%) and a near doubling in the share of parents who were foreign-born (by restriction, all children in the sample were U.S.-born). Approximately 13% of children in the sample in 1997 had a reported health condition that limited their ability to participate in normal activities. This trended up to 16% by 2002. The proportion of children with fair or poor health and low mental health scores remained roughly constant over time, however.</p>

<p>The top panel presents the estimates for the entire sample. The coefficients for all three outcomes (food insecurity, housing problems, and postponed care) are very close to zero and are not statistically significant. Lower-income households, shown in the second panel, did not experience a significant change in food or housing insecurity, but the effect on postponed care was around 2 percentage points (−.020, <italic>p</italic> = .034). In other words, a one standard deviation increase in state-level generosity of public insurance was associated with a 2 percentage point decline in postponed care for this subgroup. For higher income households (shown in the third panel), in contrast, none of the coefficients were statistically significant. Finally, for the health limited subgroup none of the coefficients attained statistical significance (the estimated effects for postponed care and housing problems were both large, but the sign on the housing problems coefficient was actually in the opposite of the hypothesized direction).</p>

It is important to keep in mind that the instrumental variables estimates represent a local average treatment effect (the effect on the policy on those households that enrolled in CHIP because of changes in state generosity) and do not necessarily generalize to the entire subpopulation. Nevertheless, the instrumental variables estimates illustrate some similar patterns to the reduced-form estimates, although the coefficients are larger and have very wide confidence intervals. Expanded eligibility under CHIP did not significantly change the prevalence of food security or housing problems overall, nor was the effect significant for any of the subgroups. Although the estimated effect of CHIP eligibility on overall postponed care was large, it did not obtain statistical significance for the full sample. The only significant effect was for postponed care for the poorer subgroup, where the estimate was imprecise and very large (−0.311, <italic>p</italic> = .047). The general pattern of instrumental variable results suggests a substantial reduction in postponed care, but these results should be interpreted with considerable caution given the large uncertainty around the estimates.</p>

<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>I undertook several sensitivity analyses. First, I examined whether the estimates changed when I included variables that were initially excluded because of their potentially endogenous relationship with material hardship, such as a measure of household income and indicators for participation in social assistance programs such as food stamps, cash welfare, social security income, and the Women’s, Infants, and Children program. The point estimates and standard errors were generally not affected by inclusion of these variables, however. Second, I examined whether the estimates were sensitive to the inclusion of state and year fixed effects. I found that omitting state fixed effects generally did not change the statistical significance or sign of the estimates, but did change the point estimates (although not in a consistent direction). Because omitting state fixed effects might introduce bias due to unobservable time-invariant variables at the state level, I opted to include state fixed effects in the preferred specifications. Third, as an alternative to the binary measure of food security, I created a food security scale by summing the four items in the NSAF pertaining to food security, assigning higher values for greater deprivation. Using this scale did not yield significant results. Finally, I considered an instrumental variable probit model—an alternative estimator that might be better suited to binary outcome variables. I compared the marginal effect from the OLS models with the probit estimates by calculating the predicted difference at the sample mean for eligible and noneligible children. These estimated differences were remarkably similar to those obtained in the two-stage least squares models. Because the two-stage least squares coefficients are more easily interpreted, I opted to present those coefficients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated whether the expansions of public insurance eligibility under CHIP decreased the probability of two kinds of material hardships—food insecurity and housing problems—as well as the probability of postponed medical care. In reduced-form models, I did not find evidence that expanded CHIP reduced the prevalence of food insecurity, housing problems, or postponed care for the main sample. For the subgroup with incomes less than 150% of the FPL, I found a small but significant reduction in postponed care. Larger, but less precise, estimates were obtained in instrumental variables analysis.</p>
<p>The finding related to postponed care is consistent with other quasi-experimental studies that show that CHIP eligibility led to lower unmet need for families near the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712470566">Kenney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712470566">Shone, Klein, Blumkin, &amp; Szilagyi, 2008</xref>). Another study using the NSAF found that families affected by CHIP greatly increased their rates of doctor visits, and well-child visits specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712470566">Li &amp; Baughman, 2010</xref>). These outcomes provide strong support to the claims made by program advocates that extending public insurance to low-income families helps to ensure access to the health care system for vulnerable children.</p>
<p>In comparison, results related to food insecurity and housing problems suggest that expanded public insurance did not relieve material hardship for families with children. One plausible explanation is low-income families without insurance may defer taking children to the doctor rather than taking on medical debt, skipping rent payments, or sacrificing food. Gaining health insurance coverage may therefore have a larger effect in stimulating new demand for medical care than in subsidizing ongoing treatment. Overall, most children have low medical service use, so the policy would likely have the largest effect for those children with chronic conditions and those who need long-term care. Although I examined the subgroup of children with poor health, who are most likely to have high medical spending burden, I lacked the sample size with the NSAF data to draw definitive conclusions for this subgroup.</p>
<p>Even after taking into account that many newly insured families were likely to postpone care, the lack of a positive finding on material hardship requires further investigation. This appears to contradict studies, reviewed earlier, which found CHIP eligibility significantly reduced bankruptcies and increased consumption for low-income families. Material hardship is clearly related to these outcomes through household budget constraints, but it also differs in ways that may explain the apparent discrepancy.</p>
<p>First, food insecurity and housing problems are conservative measures of financial strain. About one quarter to one third of low-income households in the NSAF reported experiencing at least one of these conditions in the year, but it is likely that even more households were struggling to make ends meet even if they could meet minimal food and housing needs. If public insurance coverage lowers out-of-pocket spending, the impact may be more widely felt on these less severe forms of financial strain. As described, in sensitivity analysis, I assessed whether there might be an impact on less severe forms of food insecurity by constructing a continuous measure of food security, but did not obtain substantially different results. In future work, with more extensive measures of material hardship, it would be worth considering other measures such as the perceived quality of a family’s diet or the ability to purchase adequate clothing or heat for the home.</p>
<p>It is also possible that public insurance may have a more profound impact on long-term savings and purchase of durable goods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712470566">Leininger et al. (2010)</xref> found that CHIP eligibility increased nonhealth consumption overall, and especially consumption of transportation and retirement savings. The authors did not examine specific subgroups, so it is unclear whether benefits mainly accrued to households with higher levels of economic security or were spread across the entire population. Conceivably, CHIP may have had a greater effect on the economic security of households above the poverty level than on the most economically vulnerable households.</p>
<p>Even if public coverage does reduce out-of-pocket spending and improve family financial well-being, as previous studies have suggested, these improvements may not necessarily lower household risk for material hardship. Material hardship describes a point at which resources are not adequate to meet basic needs. Moving families above this point of adequacy may not be possible if the family has a very low income or very complex material needs. For example, the marginal $50 of reduced out-of-pocket spending on medical care could be a large financial benefit for a family and yet it still might not make it possible to provide enough food for the month. Conversely, some moderate-income families may have incomes that place them above the threshold, even if they pay out-of-pocket for health insurance. Gaining coverage would still benefit these families, but not change their risk of material hardship.</p>
<p>Finally, it is it is possible that public insurance is insufficient on its own to provide financial protection from health care expenses, particularly for those households with children in poor health. As has been documented in previous studies, families of children with chronic conditions must contend with a range of nonmedical expenses such as reduced parental work time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712470566">Chen &amp; Newacheck, 2006</xref>) or additional child care expenses that are not covered by public insurance. Providing more generous public insurance addresses one important issue (out-of-pocket health spending risk) but leaves many families vulnerable to expenses stemming from nonmedical services needed for chronically ill children. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712470566">Table 1</xref>, families with children in poor health are at greatest risk for material hardships.</p>
<p>Some additional study limitations should be noted. First, because the study draws on repeated cross-sections, it was not possible to compare changes within the same households over time. Panel data would provide a greater ability to control for endogenous shifts in income and to measure take-up versus continuation of public insurance. Unfortunately, there are no large panel data sets spanning the time period of CHIP implementation that include repeated measures related to material hardship and health insurance. Second, as with all household surveys, specific measures in the NSAF related to income are subject to measurement error. There is likely to be some misclassification of individual-level income eligibility status, which will tend to reduce the likelihood of a positive finding. I attempted to mitigate this issue using both the imputation-adjusted income data in the NSAF and applying eligibility determination disregards that have been shown to affect simulated eligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712470566">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2000</xref>). Finally, since some of the measures of material hardship rely on subjective perceptions, study results could be sensitive to trends in perceived hardship rather than objective financial circumstances. For example, some households may continue to endorse the statement that they “always” or “often” worry about food running after their financial situation changes, or conversely, some households may not have perceived the risk of food shortage during a period of extreme financial deprivation. If perceived hardship lags more objective forms of hardship, then this study may not fully capture the impact of the policy reform.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has important implications for research and policy. First, it suggests a need to better understand the complex interaction between health care spending risk and poverty, especially for families with children. Investments in children’s health insurance programs are often framed as an investment in the long-term health of poor children because public insurance provides access to preventative medical services that poor families might otherwise not be able to (or choose to) consume. In the short term, subsidized insurance could therefore be more effective in reducing postponed medical care than in changing balance sheets of low-income families. The longer-term effects are more uncertain. Some studies suggest that public insurance expansions lowered mortality and improved health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712470566">Currie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712470566">Howell, Decker, Hogan, Yemane, &amp; Foster, 2010</xref>), but it is unknown how much these programs also reduced family poverty. If there are longer-term positive effects of public insurance on economic well-being, then analyses that only focus on the period following implementation (such as this study) might understate the true benefits of the programs. Studying these effects is an important objective for future research.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that children’s health insurance operates as one of several strands in a fragile safety net that support low-income families. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712470566">Janet Currie (2008)</xref> suggests, safety net programs
<disp-quote>
<p>act together, providing a broad-reaching and comprehensive net that especially protects young children in low-income families. . . . Pulling on one thread—say, the funding of one part of one program—is liable to start the unraveling of the whole tenuous system, unless we recognize the reality that these programs create something greater, in much the same way that a net is greater than the sum of its individual ropes. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This observation is particularly salient given the changing context of American in-kind assistance programs. If those families that depend most heavily on public health insurance also depend on other forms of public assistance, then cuts to programs such as food stamps or child care subsidies could both directly strain family budgets and also limit the marginal effectiveness of health insurance coverage in preventing economic hardship.</p>
<p>In the current environment, nonhealth safety net programs are under considerable strain. Pressure is rising in state and federal governments to cut spending, and at the same time, demand is growing for assistance among families experiencing unemployment and other disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712470566">Nichols &amp; Zedlewski, 2011</xref>). Even if the economy improves in the near future, it is quite likely that low-income families will find themselves with fewer programs and services supporting employment, housing, and other needs. Health services, including public programs for children, also are facing some funding cuts, but are still projected to grow both in total spending and in number of individuals covered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712470566">Holahan, Clemans-Cope, Lawton, &amp; Rousseau, 2011</xref>). From the perspective of protecting vulnerable families from material hardships, it is therefore important to consider whether spending limited resources on public insurance is an effective tool for protecting low-income families against poverty relative to investments in other programs, independent of its beneficial impacts on health. The results in this article suggest that, at least for families with children, public insurance may not be sufficient to prevent two of the most common forms of material hardship. Within an environment of strained financial resources, future expansions to public insurance might focus on targeting resources such as child care, food assistance, and social service referrals to families with children who have complex health needs and require services in multiple systems. Adding these services to public insurance benefits for the neediest children could help ensure that the families at greatest risk for material hardships are not only better protected against the uncertainty of medical spending but also provided with the resources to make ends meet under very difficult financial circumstances.</p>
