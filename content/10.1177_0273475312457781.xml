<abstract>
<p>Today’s marketing instructors are faced with the challenge of improving their students’ soft skills to prepare them for today’s business environment. Numerous authors have noted that client-based/-sponsored projects help students improve the soft skills they need to succeed in the business community. This article provides detailed guidelines on how to implement a specific type of client-based project, (i.e., a client-financed project, CFP). The article also discusses the challenges faced by clients, faculty, and students who participate in a CFP. Finally, clients’ and students’ attitudes about the benefits of participating in a CFP are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Client-based/sponsored projects are one of the best ways to provide students with a valuable learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312457781">Bove &amp; Davies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312457781">Parsons &amp; Lepkowska-White, 2009</xref>). Experiential learning is “learning by experience.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312457781">Evans and Lang (2006)</xref> suggested, experiential learning is an action strategy where the student is directly in touch with real things and people or is involved in activities that simulate real activities or people. Students will come into contact with exactly what they are learning.</p>
<p>A client-based/-sponsored project increases students’ motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312457781">Lopez &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>) and challenges students better than the best-written case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312457781">Parsons &amp; Lepkowska-White, 2009</xref>). Projects with a real-world client are more realistic, relevant, and dynamic than the traditional case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312457781">Bove &amp; Davies, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Some experiential-learning activities involve students working for a real organization in a consulting capacity. Projects where student-consulting teams work with a real organization have been labeled as client-based, client-sponsored, or client-financed projects. Although many authors in the literature have not specified whether the client provided financial support for the project, some authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312457781">Peltier, Schibrowsky, and Kleimenhagen (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312457781">Razzouk, Seitz, and Rizkallah (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312457781">Bove and Davies (2009)</xref>, specifically note that the client was required to cover students’ expenses while completing the project.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312457781">Peltier et al. (1995)</xref> describe how marketing faculty and the student marketing club co-developed a research agency. They require the client to cover any expenses incurred by the agency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312457781">Razzouk et al. (2003)</xref> also report that the client pays for all out of pocket expenses and contributes some dollar amount to the Marketing Department’s Faculty Development Fund. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312457781">Bove and Davies (2009)</xref> report that the client’s financial commitments include all costs associated with the survey, prizes for the winning student team’s final report, and the funding of a student lunch. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312457781">Bell, Demick, Ibbotson, Krajan, and Wood (1997)</xref> contend that charging the client for the students’ help ensures a high level of commitment and participation from the client. When clients pay fees for the consulting reports, some of the funds can be used to pay for expenses such as journal subscriptions, travel, research, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas &amp; Wotruba, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312457781">Razzouk et al., 2003</xref>). In the budget for our projects, 10% is placed in the instructor’s professional development account and unspent funds are transferred into the Dean’s discretionary account.</p>
<p>Our projects are similar in structure to client-based projects discussed frequently in the literature. We have found that requiring the client to fund the students’ projects does produce the results noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312457781">Bell et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas and Wotruba (1990)</xref>. We have also concluded that working with a paying client serves to increase the students’ enthusiasm and motivation to produce a quality report. Having a paying client also increases the realism of the project and enhances a student’s resume.</p>
<p>To reflect the client’s financial support for the real-world project format we describe, we refer to our project as a client-financed project (CFP). For the purpose of this article, we define a CFP as a project that involves a real organization who wants to solve real problems, provides funds to cover expenses incurred by the students, meets with the students in the classroom, and willingly shares company information with the students. The client also signs a formal contract with the instructor who supervises the CFP.</p>
<p>The purpose of our article is to provide guidelines for instructors who wish to implement a CFP in a marketing or management course. The major contribution of this article is to describe various innovative activities that empower students, let them take initiative, let them manage their own projects, and make them accountable to peers and the professor. We offer advice on how to find clients, client screening and selection, accounting and legal parameters, course content, and class management based on our experiences over two decades. We also discuss the challenges faced by clients, faculty, and students who participate in a CFP. The guidelines we discuss are neither universally applicable for all business classes nor appropriate at all universities. The reader may need to modify the guidelines to reflect diverse situations for a particular class. We hope our article will encourage instructors to use a CFP in a variety of marketing or management courses.</p>

<title>Managing a Client-Financed Project</title>
<p>At our university, 2,406 students have participated in 117 CFPs from January 1992 through May 2011. A total of 92 different clients have paid in the range of $200 to $8,000 per project to cover the expenses incurred by the student-consulting teams and 18 clients have returned to work with another class in a later semester. Our public university is located in the upper Midwest in the center of a tricounty area with a population of approximately 348,000 residents. The university enrolls slightly more than 10,000 students and class size averages 20 to 35 students. Of the 117 classes who completed a CFP, we analyzed the characteristics of 562 students enrolled in 24 randomly selected classes. In those 24 classes, 55% of the students were females, 37% were enrolled for 7 to 12 credit hours, and 46% carried 13 to 18 credit hours. Only 12% indicated they were not employed while enrolled in the CFP class, 54% worked 16 to 39 hours per week and 26% were working 40 or more hours per week. The students enrolled in our CFPs are all juniors and seniors. We do not recommend that a CFP be conducted with freshmen or sophomores.</p>
<p>Of the 117 CFPs that have been conducted, 16 were done for the authors’ university, 19 were feasibility studies, 30 were for a not-for-profit organization, and 52 were for an existing business. A CFP has been conducted in 14 different business courses. The following courses accounted for 81% of the projects completed: (a) Marketing Principles–37, (b) Executive Strategies and Policies–22, (c) Marketing Research–16, (d) Advertising Strategy–10, and (e) Organization and Administration–10. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312457781">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the process involved when a CFP is the pedagogy used in a particular course.</p>

<title>Finding Clients</title>
<sec id="section3-0273475312457781">
<title>Proactive Methods</title>
<p>Potential clients can be generated by stories in the local newspaper about the projects the students have completed. Since 1992, a total of 26 articles about the students’ CFPs have appeared in local newspapers. Also, 15 articles about the CFPs have appeared in the university’s student-published newspaper.</p>
<p>The authors have also made presentations to organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, the “Percolator Breakfast Club,” Downtown Development Authority Board of Directors, and the Business College’s Advisory Board. These presentations allow the audience to ask questions about how a CFP is conducted, what tasks the students can complete and the general cost to complete a project. During one semester, one marketing research class conducted a survey of area business owners regarding their interest in working with student- consulting teams and two CFPs resulted from the survey.</p>
<p>Every mail survey sent on behalf of a client has contained a cover letter on the university letterhead. The cover letter always contains the instructor’s name and contact information in case a respondent questions the legitimacy of the survey. Several survey recipients have become clients. Additional ideas for finding clients can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312457781">Peltier et al. (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312457781">Elam and Spotts (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas and Wotruba (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312457781">Bove and Davies (2009)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475312457781">
<title>Referrals</title>
<p>Another source of potential clients results from alumni and previous clients talking with friends and business acquaintances about their project with the students. The faculty in the business school has also generated names of potential clients. Former and current students who have participated in a CFP have also told friends and employers to explore the idea of participating in a client-financed project. Four alumni have returned as clients because they had participated in one or more CFPs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0273475312457781">
<title>Screening and Selecting a Client</title>
<sec id="section6-0273475312457781">
<title>Initial Telephone or E-Mail Contact</title>
<p>The initial contact between the instructor and the potential client usually involves a telephone call or an e-mail. In the Fall 2010 semester, for example, one CFP resulted because a university administrator served on the Board of Directors for the client’s organization. The administrator sent an e-mail to the instructor that briefly explained the potential client’s needs. The instructor then called the potential client and discussed how the CFP would be conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0273475312457781">
<title>Face-to-Face Conference</title>
<p>At the face-to-face meeting with the client, the instructor makes the decision to accept or reject the client and the client makes the decision to hire or not hire the student consultants. As part of this decision-making session, the budget for the project is discussed. If a client wants several mail surveys conducted, the largest expense will be the research costs line item. The client is asked to decide how much money will be used to buy food for the students. Additional advice for screening and selecting a client can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312457781">de los Santos and Jensen (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475312457781">McCain and Lincoln (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas and Wotruba (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312457781">Elam and Spotts (2004)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475312457781">
<title>Documents Given to and Received From the Client</title>
<p>After the client and the instructor agree to work together, the client is handed a manual titled: “How a Client-Financed Project Is Conducted.” There are three documents needed from every client before the client meets with the students in the classroom. The client is e-mailed the “Client Background Survey” and asked to return the answered survey to the instructor. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312457781">Table 2</xref> contains a list of the information a client is asked to provide.</p>

<p>The client is required to write a “Letter of Authorization” addressed to the instructor and must include a check made out to the university for part of or all the expenses that will be incurred by the students. After the instructor receives the client’s check and letter of authorization, the instructor mails two copies of the contract to the client. The client is asked to sign the contract and return the signed copy to the instructor and keep a copy of the contract for his or her records. In a later section of this article, we describe how the university establishes an account that allows the students and instructor to be reimbursed for expenses related to completing the CFP.</p>

<title>Legal Issues</title>
<sec id="section10-0273475312457781">
<title>Confidentiality Agreement</title>
<p>For three CFPs, the client has asked the student consultants and the instructor to sign a confidentiality agreement supplied by the client. No client has ever brought any legal action against anyone at the university as the result of any CFP. The reader may contact the lead author to obtain an example of a letter of authorization and a confidentiality statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0273475312457781">
<title>Contract Language</title>
<p>The formal contract currently being used has been refined over the past 20 years. The changes to the contract have been made because of suggestions from clients, students, university administrators, and faculty who have supervised a CFP. We have recently added the following statement to the contract: “The client, instructor, and students all agree that the primary purpose of this course and project is a learning experience, and that any marketing strategies or tactics recommended have no guarantee of being effective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas &amp; Wotruba, 1990</xref>, p. 39). The contract currently being used has been approved by the Dean of the Business College, the Vice President of Academic Affairs, and the University’s Controller. The client is invited to come to class as often as he or she wants to and the contract states that the client can come to class with no advance notice required. A copy of the contract used for a CFP can be obtained by contacting the lead author.</p>

<title>Accounting Issues</title>
<sec id="section13-0273475312457781">
<title>Establishing an Account for the Client-Financed Project</title>
<p>Every university will have its own policies and procedures about how funds from clients will be allocated. Instructors who decide to supervise a CFP will need to establish procedures at their university that will determine how to finance the project, gain access to funds and provide reimbursement. At our university, the Dean’s office in the College of Business administers the accounting aspects of our CFPs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312457781">Peltier et al. (1995)</xref> also discuss legal and accounting issues related to conducting a class project with a real-world client.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0273475312457781">
<title>Reimbursing Students</title>
<p>The students spend their own money at the beginning of the semester to buy the supplies they need to produce two written consulting reports. One copy of the report is given to the client and an identical report is given to the instructor to grade. One student on each consulting team volunteers to be the “Team Treasurer.” Only the team treasurer can submit a “Check Requisition Form” so a student can be reimbursed for spending money on a project-related item. The students are encouraged to use a credit card to buy the supplies they need because students are generally reimbursed before they have to pay their credit card bill.</p>

<title>When the Class Starts</title>
<sec id="section16-0273475312457781">
<title>Meet and Greet</title>
<p>At the first class meeting, the students gather at the front of the classroom and are told to exchange the following information with at least four other students they have never met: (a) full name with a businesslike handshake, (b) their major, (c) hometown, and (d) their favorite movie as a conversation starter. The meet-and-greet exercise has a tendency to relax the students and help them communicate freely with others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0273475312457781">
<title>Q &amp; A Session With the Instructor</title>
<p>Before the client arrives to talk to the students, all students are given a copy of the client’s letter of authorization, the contract and the Client Background Survey. The students are given 30 minutes to read all three documents.</p>
<p>Since students are often reluctant to ask questions on the first day of class with a new instructor, the instructor passes out index cards to the students. The students write any questions, comments or suggestions they have on the index cards and place their cards on the instructor’s desk in front of the classroom. The students do not put their name on any of the cards they submit. When the instructor returns to the classroom, he or she reviews the index cards and answers questions asked or addresses any issues or concerns raised by the students. Soliciting students’ questions anonymously is done throughout the semester.</p>

<p>Sometimes clients do not know specifically what they want the students to do or find out. The instructor provides the client with a list of questions the client may ask. The process of asking and answering the questions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475312457781">Table 3</xref> helps narrow the scope of the CFP.</p>
<p>During the semester, it is important to keep the client engaged with the students to continually refine what the client expects to receive from the students. The instructor requires the client to come to class a minimum of four times over the course of a 16-week semester. The instructor provides the client with a list of the days and times the client should come to class and the agenda for each meeting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0273475312457781">
<title>Client Data Collection Instrument</title>
<p>After the client finishes his or her first presentation to the class, each student is required to write five questions for the client to answer before the client returns for the second meeting with the class. The students’ questions are collected by a subteam of three students who edit the questions and then create the “Client Data Collection Instrument” (Client DCI). The Client DCI team first sorts the questions into categories according to the eight functional areas of a business: (a) Human Resources, (b) Information Systems or Technology, (c) Production, (d) Operations, (e) Finance, (f) Accounting, (g) Research and Development, and (h) Marketing. In the marketing category, questions are placed in four subcategories: (a) Price, (b) Product, (c) Promotion, or (d) Place (Distribution).</p>
<p>For questions that focus on variables that are external to the client’s organization, the questions are categorized as follows: (a) Infrastructure, (b) Government, (c) Environment (e.g., floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), (d) Technology, (e) Media, (f) Intermediaries (e.g., suppliers, vendors, wholesalers, etc.), (g) Science, (h) Society (e.g., labor unions, religious movements, demonstrations, etc.), (i) Foreign Agents, (j) Competition, and (k) Economy.</p>
<p>The Client DCI is e-mailed to the client who is asked to answer each question and e-mail the completed DCI to the instructor. The instructor forwards the client’s answers to all students before the client returns for the second meeting with the students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0273475312457781">
<title>Client Meets With Students Again</title>
<p>The purpose of the second in-class meeting is to further clarify what the client expects to receive from the students. The second meeting allows the client to expand on the answers he or she provided on the Client DCI and the Client Background Survey. The client can also use this second meeting to ask questions he or she has thought of as a result of completing the Client DCI.</p>

<title>Class Organization</title>
<p>When conducting a CFP, each student is assigned to one of the student-consulting teams by the instructor as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312457781">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, each student has the opportunity to earn class participation points (CPPs) by completing one or more CPP assignments (CPPAs). CPPAs will be explained in the section after we describe how the student-consulting teams are formed.</p>

<title>Forming Student-Consulting Teams</title>
<p>All the students in the class are working for the same client. There are usually 4 to 5 student-consulting teams that contain 5 to 7 members per team. Allowing students to select their teammates often results in talent and background imbalances which can result in some very strong and some very poor teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312457781">Razzouk et al., 2003</xref>). Such an imbalance may affect the level of student performance and may result in embarrassment before the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312457781">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>). Having students work in a team of strangers resembles the situation students will face during their first entry-level, career-path position after graduation. Following the practice of many educators, the instructor determines each team’s composition because more balanced teams are formed when the instructor decides who will be on which team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312457781">Kumcu &amp; Kumcu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475312457781">Washburn &amp; Petroshius, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312457781">Elam &amp; Spotts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas &amp; Wotruba, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475312457781">Frear &amp; Metcalf, 1988</xref>). The teams are formed with a mix of majors, males and females, CFP veterans and rookies and at least one student who wants to be the team’s president. After the student consulting teams are formed, the students are given a description of the possible positions to be filled in each team. These teams’ positions are discussed next.</p>

<sec id="section23-0273475312457781">
<title>Positions in a Student-Consulting Team</title>
<list id="list1-0273475312457781" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>President</italic>: The President is responsible for scheduling all outside class meetings, preparing an agenda for team meetings, assigning people to complete tasks, overseeing work of the team, evaluating the written assignments of team members, and writing the Letter of Transmittal. Every consulting team must elect one person to be the team’s President. The election for the team’s President is held during class using a secret-ballot system and is supervised by the instructor who is the only one to see how each team member voted.</p>
<p>The President may not be elected until a team meets at least three times outside of class for a total of four hours. Each team must e-mail the instructor the meeting minutes from the team’s first three out-of-class team meetings. Imposing this condition is done to help keep students from electing a President who is an ATNA (All Talk, No Action) who often views the job of President as one where all they do is tell the team members what to do while doing as little work as possible. On 15 occasions, the instructor has fired an ATNA President and appointed another team member to be the President. The fired President is allowed to remain on the team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Project Director</italic>: The Project Director is responsible for maintaining a record of which team member is responsible for completing specific sections of the consulting report. He or she keeps track of when tasks are assigned and when the assignments are due and makes sure the format, font style and size are consistent throughout the consulting report.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Team Treasurer</italic>: The Team Treasurer buys the supplies needed to complete the consulting report and ensures each team member is reimbursed for any expenses. The team treasurer prepares a report for the client that lists all expenses incurred by each team member.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Recording Secretary</italic>: The Recording Secretary writes the minutes for each out-of-class meeting held by the team and sends the team’s meeting minutes to all team members and the instructor. The secretary helps the President and Project Director keep track of who is doing what to complete the team’s report and sends the agenda for the next team meeting to all team members.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Vice President</italic>: The Vice President helps the Project Director keep track of who does what for the team’s report and leads the discussion of agenda items in team meetings when the President is absent. The Vice President is the “Taskmaster” and keeps the team members focused on the agenda for each meeting and helps the President review and critique the written work submitted by each team member.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Account Executive</italic>: In each consulting team, one student is selected to be the Account Executive (AE) for the team. Only the AE is allowed to communicate with the client. Every time the AE sends an e-mail to or receives an e-mail from the client, the e-mail must be copied or forwarded to the instructor. In most situations, the AE asks the instructor during class time for permission to contact the client. Everyone in the class hears the AE’s purpose for sending the client an e-mail. This practice prevents the client from receiving a nearly identical e-mail from several different students all asking the same general question or asking multiple times for the same information.</p></list-item>

<title>Class Participation Point Assignments</title>
<p>CPPAs are activities students need to participate in to earn CPPs. To complete a CFP, every student is assigned to a consulting team. In addition to working in their consulting team, the students are required to complete a wide range of assignments that will benefit all consulting teams. These assignments get certain activities done so that each consulting team does not have to do the same activity themselves. Several CPPAs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312457781">Figure 1</xref>, are completed by a subteam of students who share the completed CPPA with all other students in the class. For example, a recent client wanted homeowners surveyed for their business. A subteam of five students conducted the survey, wrote the research report, and gave their report to each consulting team. There were five consulting teams in this class and it would not make sense to have each consulting team conduct their own survey of homeowners. CPPAs are used to help the students learn what must be done to organize and manage a CFP. Students earn grade points by completing a CPPA and then sharing the results with every student in the class. Before students are asked if they want to complete a CPPA, the instructor provides a brief description of what is required to complete a particular assignment. A student sometimes works alone and sometimes will team with fellow students to complete a CPPA. For some CPPAs, any student in the class can complete the assignment. For a major CPPA, several students may volunteer to complete the assignment, and they are then randomly selected to work with other students who also volunteered to complete the CPPA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0273475312457781">
<title>Selecting Students for CPPAs</title>
<p>Each student is assigned a “Roster Number” (RN) on the first day of class. Each roster number is written on a note card by the Administrative Assistant (AA). All RNs are written on the whiteboard by a student at the start of each class. The instructor points to each RN written on the board and if the student with that RN wants to complete a particular CPPA, the student sounds off with a “Yes.” The AA gathers the cards that contain the selected RNs and then randomly selects the students chosen to complete the CPPA. Most subteams contain three to five members and the subteam has the right to fire a subteam member. Each student needs to earn 200 CPPs in order to receive an “A” on that component of their total course grade.</p>
<p>There is a penalty for being fired from a CPP subteam. For nearly every CPP subteam, there are more volunteers than there are positions needed to complete a CPPA. The student who is fired has deprived another student of the opportunity to earn the CPPs possible for completing the assignment. Therefore, if a CPPA was worth 40 points, and a student is fired, those 40 points are deducted from the 200 CPPs and the fired student may now earn a maximum of 160 CPPs, no matter how many CPPs the fired student earns for the entire semester.</p>
<sec id="section26-0273475312457781">
<title>One-person CPPAs</title>
<p>(a) Administrative Assistant (AA): A student who wants to be the AA must be interviewed for the position by the instructor. The AA works with the instructor and maintains the Class Participation Points Matrix (CPPM). The CPPM will be explained later. (b) Class Treasurer (CT): Every client has agreed to provide funds for food for the students. It is the CT’s job to pay cash for the food and the CT borrows five dollars from each student who intends to eat food in class at least once during the semester. The CT uses the borrowed funds to pay for the food, submits a check requisition, and at the end of the semester returns the borrowed five dollars to each student who loaned money needed to pay for food. (c) Common Class Appendix Organizer: The Common Class Appendix (CCA) is created by one student and is created to reduce the number of pages in each consulting team’s written report (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0273475312457781">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>For example, one client requested that the class do a mail survey to measure the opinions of five different populations of interest. In this class, there were five consulting teams. Each survey subteam wrote a report that presented the findings from their survey. The five reports totaled 452 pages. Each student-consulting team must prepare two identical reports, one copy is given to the client and the second copy is given to the instructor to grade. If each of the five consulting teams needed two copies of each subteams’ complete research report, a total of 4,520 pages would need to be photocopied by the instructor and given to the teams. Instead of putting each subteams’ complete report in each consulting teams’ report, the five survey subteams’ reports are placed in the CCA and each consulting team puts in its book only the executive summary of each survey subteams’ report. (d) Literature Review Notebook Organizer: For every CFP, each consulting team is required to prepare a chapter titled “Literature Reviews.” The Literature Review chapter summarizes articles that contain information that would benefit the client. In the introduction to each consulting team’s Literature Review chapter, each team notes that if the client wants to read an entire article that has been summarized, the article can be found in the “Literature Review Notebook.”</p>

<list-item><p>2. <italic>Survey teams</italic>: Since 1992, more than 250 different survey teams have prepared a research report for various clients. The vast majority of the surveys have been conducted as a mail survey because in most cases we do not have access to the e-mail addresses of the populations of interest. We have used SurveyMonkey a few times in the past 5 years to survey certain populations of interest. In one recent class with a parochial school system as the client, survey teams were formed to survey (a) teachers, (b) all principals, (c) all staff, (d) all managers, (e) parents with children in elementary school, and (f) parents with children in the high school. The reports from these survey teams were 75 to 142 pages long. On the first day of class, the students are asked to have one student from their consulting team volunteer to be on one of the survey teams to be formed. The students are given a list of the tasks to be completed by a survey team (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0273475312457781">Table 7</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>The instructor writes on the whiteboard the days and times he can meet with each survey team. The students then indicate what times they can meet with the instructor to develop the cover letter and questionnaire to be used to survey the populations of interest. The instructor normally meets with each survey team for 30 to 60 minutes each week until the cover letter and questionnaire are ready to be sent to the populations of interest.</p>
<p>The drafts of the cover letter and DCI are reviewed by all class members during class time. The client is encouraged to come to class on the days when the cover letter and DCI are being revised to make suggestions regarding how the cover letter and DCI should be changed. Oftentimes, the client will also meet outside of class with one or more of the survey teams. Before the cover letter and DCI are sent out, the client e-mails the survey team and the instructor his or her approval to send the cover letter and DCI to the populations of interest.</p>
<p>When a mail survey is conducted, the survey teams may request help from other students in the class if the survey is being sent to a large number of individuals. For example, in one Marketing Research class, the client had the students survey 5,200 past customers. Fellow students were offered the opportunity to earn CPPs by helping the survey teams prepare the mail packets at a “stuffing party.” The students were given 10 to 15 CPPs for every hour they worked at the “stuffing party.” The survey team supervises the preparation of the mail packets.</p>

The AC shares concerns from the class and suggests ways to improve the students’ ability to perform in an ambiguous, dynamic, and challenging environment. The AC, which has one member from each consulting team, meets four to five times in a 16-week semester.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4. <italic>Matrix Teams</italic>: The client’s organization has been compared with competitors’ organizations in the following areas: (a) website content (Website Analysis Matrix), (b) goods and services offered (Competitor Analysis Matrix), (c) prices charged (Price Analysis Matrix), (d) content of newspaper advertisements (Newspaper Analysis Matrix), (e) promotional materials (brochures, trifolds, pamphlets, etc.; Advertising Analysis Matrix), and (f) content of Yellow Page advertisements (Yellow Page Analysis Matrix).</p></list-item>

<title>Website Analysis Matrix (WAM)</title>
<p>The WAM report is completed by a subteam of three to five students. First, the WAM team determines what websites to analyze. For example, one class recently consulted with an economic development organization “City Future Inc.” The WAM team studied 51 websites of similar economic development organizations and created the matrix to show the client the gaps in the client’s website. If a client does not have a website, the client can use the WAM to determine what features to include in a future website.</p>
<p>The second task of the WAM team is to determine what features to use to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the websites analyzed. The WAM team for “City Future Inc.” used 34 evaluation criteria to compare selected websites with the client’s website. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0273475312457781">Table 8</xref> contains a partial example of a WAM.</p>

<p>Completing the WAM report is normally worth 80 CPPs for each student on the subteam. The upper point value is determined by three variables: (a) number of websites studied; (b) number of features identified; and (c) the quality of the written report in terms of syntax, analytical insights demonstrated, and the quality of the recommendations for the client.</p>

<title>Price Analysis Matrix (PAM)</title>
<p>The PAM report is completed by visiting competitors’ stores or using the Internet to collect price information. Once again, the florist shop project provides a good example of a project where a PAM report was done for the client. In the florist shop PAM, the students visited 15 florist shops and recorded prices for 34 different items in each store.</p>

<title>Newspaper Analysis Matrix (NAM)</title>
<p>The NAM team is responsible for purchasing copies of local newspapers every day for 14 days. In one NAM report, a total of 21 ads were analyzed from six retail stores. The NAM report was six pages long and a poster board displayed all 21 ads to provide the client with a visual overview of the style and content of the competitors’ newspaper advertisements.</p>

<sec id="section33-0273475312457781">
<title>Advertising Analysis Matrix (AAM)</title>
<p>The AAM team is responsible for obtaining printed promotional material from the client and the client’s competitors. When the client is a nonprofit organization such as a YMCA, the AAM team requests printed material from other YMCAs that are not in competition with the class’ client. In one AAM report, the students collected 12 brochures or trifolds from eight competitors and identified a total of 17 elements in the printed promotional material.</p>

<title>Preparing a Matrix Report</title>
<p>Several matrix report CPPAs are very similar in format to the WAM described previously on the following dimensions: (a) the report’s contents, (b) the points possible, (c) the grading criterion, and (d) matrix format. A matrix team must complete the matrix within 21 days from the date the CPPA was assigned. Also, the matrix team must e-mail the matrix to all classmates, the client, the instructor, and the AA. The matrix team’s first draft of the report is due 28 days after it is assigned. Not every student in a class has the opportunity to work on a matrix team. However, so that each student understands how a matrix report is created, each matrix team makes three or four oral presentations to the class and explains what they have done to complete their report. Also, when the matrix report is completed it is e-mailed to all students in the class so each student can review the contents and organization of the report.</p>
<p>The students selected to be on a matrix team are given a hard-copy and an electronic copy of a previous matrix report. The instructor reviews only the first draft of the matrix and the matrix report and assigns a percentage grade to the report. The matrix subteam is given the opportunity to raise the first-draft grade by revising their work in response to the instructor’s written comments. Also, each draft of the matrix report is e-mailed to the client and the client is asked for his or her feedback.</p>

<title>Maintaining the Class Participation Point Matrix</title>
<p>Keeping track of who earns CPPs is a major task. For example, in a recent CFP, 32 students had the opportunity to volunteer to complete 79 different CPPAs. When the CPPA is assigned the AA places an “X” in the appropriate box on the CPPM shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0273475312457781">Table 10</xref>. After the first draft of a CPPA is e-mailed to the instructor, the AA replaces the “X” with a “Y” in the appropriate box. Each completed CPPA is e-mailed to the instructor and copied to the AA. The instructor grades the assignment and returns the assignment to the student(s) who completed the CPPA. The graded CPPA is initialed and dated by the student(s) and given to the AA to record the CPPs earned. Once every week, the AA e-mails the CPPM to the instructor and to all students in the class.</p>

<title>Peer Evaluations in a Consulting Team</title>
<p>The instructor stresses how important it is to elect a president who will work harder and devote the most effort to completing the team’s report for the client. Assume there are six team members, each student provides a midterm peer evaluation (PE; 10% of the total course grade) and a final peer evaluation (20% of the total course grade) for each team member. However, the president’s PE is weighted by a factor of 3, which means each student in the six-member team receives eight PE scores and three of the eight scores (37.5%) are from the team’s president. The PE score given by a team’s president is multiplied by a factor of 3 only if the president receives a PE score of 90% or better from the rest of the team’s members. The peer evaluation system currently being used was adopted from the system tested for validity and reliability by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312457781">Clark (1989)</xref>.</p>
<p>Just before the midterm PEs are done by the students, the instructor holds a “president’s reelection” vote. Over the past 20 years, approximately 15 presidents have been voted out and a different team member has been elected to be the new president.</p>

<p>Each team is asked to provide a number or percent for their team for each box in the matrix. For example, for the Appendix items, each team is asked how many of the Appendix Cover Pages are completed, printed off and in the team’s report.</p>
<p>In the course syllabus, there is an example of how a team’s title page is to be formatted and the information to be included. Yet after 3 or 4 weeks, on the Done Matrix, there is usually a zero in the box that indicates if the title page has been completed. The Done Matrix is a wake-up call for the students and also lets each team know how they stand in relation to the other teams in the class. Usually, 2 weeks later, the Done Matrix from the previous class period is shown again so everyone can see the matrix. The numbers from the first Done Matrix session are still on the matrix and each team is then asked to indicate how much they have “done” since the last Done Matrix was displayed. In a 16-week semester, the instructor usually holds a Done Matrix session three to five times during the semester.</p>

<sec id="section39-0273475312457781">
<title>The Show and Tell</title>
<p>Another technique used to monitor the consulting teams’ progress is the “Show-and-Tell” presentation. Approximately 6 weeks into the semester, each team must “Show and Tell” the class the progress their team has made toward the completion of their report. One member from each team stands in front of the class and describes the components of their report that have been completed and placed in their three-ring binder. Show-and-Tell sessions are usually done three to four times over the course of the semester and each time a different team member must report on his or her team’s progress. The students do not know when a Show-and-Tell session will be held so each team member needs to stay abreast regarding the progress of their team’s report. The students are told to discuss only those documents that are completed and physically in their team’s three-ring binder. The presenter is told not to mention documents that are “done, but not yet printed.” The instructor’s rule is “If it is not printed, it is not done.”</p>

<title>Oral Presentation and Final Report</title>
<p>On the last day of the semester, the client comes to class to hear each team’s oral presentation. Each team is allowed 12 to 15 minutes to present information to the client and then the client may ask questions and indicate which items in the report he or she would like to receive in electronic format. After each team finishes their oral presentation, they go to a computer lab and e-mail the client an electronic copy of the documents the client has requested.</p>

<title>Discussion on Challenges and Strategies</title>
<p>When a CFP is implemented in a marketing or management course, many problems or challenges may be encountered by the client, the instructor, and the students. We describe the challenges faced by the participants in a CFP and provide suggestions based on our experiences.</p>
<sec id="section42-0273475312457781">
<title>Challenges Faced by Clients and Strategies to Cope</title>
<p>Many clients initially have only a vague idea of what deliverables they would like to receive from the students. We have worked with existing businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and entrepreneurs. In general, existing businesses want to increase their sales, find out what their customers and/or employees think of their business and be given ideas to better market their products. Entrepreneurs want to know if there is enough demand in the market to make it profitable to introduce their product to the marketplace. The client is shown examples of previous consulting reports that demonstrate how students helped achieve the goals stated by the client.</p>
<p>We have implemented several strategies designed to help us discover what a client hopes to receive from the students. The first step is to hold a personal interview with the client where the instructor takes detailed notes and then e-mails his notes to the client to edit for accuracy. Having the client edit the instructor’s notes is valuable for clarifying any misunderstandings caused by incorrectly recording or misinterpreting the client’s comments. To discover what a client wants from the students, the client is asked to complete the CBS, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312457781">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Another strategy we use requires clients to come to class a minimum of four times during the semester. After the client has the Q &amp; A session with students at the first meeting, a subteam of students creates the Client DCI from questions submitted by all students in the class. The Client DCI is e-mailed to the client who is asked to answer each question and e-mail their responses to the instructor who forwards the client’s answers to all students in the class. After reading the instructor’s notes from his meeting with the client, reviewing the information on the CBS, talking with the client in class, and studying the client’s answers to the questions on the Client DCI, the students and the client have a better idea regarding what information the client hopes to receive from the students.</p>
<p>At the midpoint of the semester, the client is required to come to class and meet with each consulting team to hear a progress report that covers what each team has done to date, what the team is currently working on, and what the team will be working on in the future. The client is asked if each team is on track regarding what the client wants and what can each team do differently to help the client.</p>
<p>After the client hears each team’s progress report in the classroom, one member from each consulting team volunteers to meet off-campus as a group with the client to conduct an in-depth interview with the client. The purpose of the interview is to discover the client’s opinions of the class’ efforts so far and to further narrow the focus of the project. These students are required to write one team report that discusses the results of the interview and then e-mail their report to all classmates, the client, and the instructor. The client is asked to edit the interview team’s report and correct any misperceptions reported by the students.</p>

<title>Challenges Faced by the Instructor and Strategies to Cope</title>
<p>One challenge an instructor may face is obtaining a commitment from the university administration to allow the instructor to conduct a CFP. Our university administration has fully supported any business faculty who wanted to conduct a CFP. We stress that having students participate in a CFP achieves many of the goals stated in the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business guidelines. We have also shown how the objectives in several marketing and management courses can be met by having students participate in a CFP. Finally, helping area businesses may create goodwill within the community and may lead to internships or jobs for the student consultants. In fact, one client asked one of our students to serve on their organization’s Board of Directors. The client was a 501c3 organization and after 3 years, the student is still a board member.</p>
<p>Another challenge faced by the instructor involves convincing the potential client to cover the expenses incurred by the students. The instructor notes that previous clients have given the students anywhere from $200 to $8,000 per project for students to prepare their consulting reports. The instructor mentions that when students know they are being “paid” for their efforts, the students are more motivated to produce a quality report for the client. Many students have reported that they felt obligated to create a quality report because of the client’s monetary investment and felt honored to be working with an actual organization. Making sure that the funds given to the students are properly accounted for is also a challenge for the instructor. Each team treasurer must complete a treasurer’s report, which is placed in their consulting report so the client may review how each team spent the money allocated to that team. At least six times during a 16-week semester the instructor asks each team’s treasurer to show the instructor the team’s budget report. These reports are given to the team treasurers in future classes to help the “rookie” treasurers understand how to perform their jobs. We have been conducting CFPs since 1992 and we have never had a single problem regarding how the students spent the funds allocated to them.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges faced by faculty who do a CFP involves the time and effort the instructor must devote to critiquing and grading the assignments submitted by the students. A major reason for not conducting a real-world project is because these projects require too much time and effort from the instructor and are viewed as not being worth the trouble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312457781">Albanese &amp; Mitchell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475312457781">Gackowski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475312457781">Gaidis &amp; Andrews, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312457781">Goodell &amp; Kraft, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312457781">Haas &amp; Wotruba, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312457781">Higgs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312457781">LeBlanc &amp; Kesten, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312457781">Lizzio &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312457781">Lopez &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In each class, there is the opportunity to earn 1,000 grade points from exams (300), peer evaluations (300), the final report (200), and CPPAs (200). When conducting a CFP, we spend about 25% of the class time relating textbook concepts and theory to the CFP we are working on. Students are responsible for reading the textbook chapters before they come to each class meeting and are given the opportunity to ask the instructor to clarify any material in the chapter they do not understand. To help students do well on the exams we give, the students are given a study guide that lists the topics they will be tested on for each exam. For a 4-hour course, we expect our students to devote 8 to 12 hours per week outside of class to work on completing their team’s consulting report. We also give the students time during several class meetings to work together to complete their report. In an introductory marketing or management course, we typically cover approximately 40% of the chapters in the textbook. We test students only on the material presented in the assigned textbook chapters.</p>
<p>Supervising 30 to 35 students working with a real-world client is tremendously time consuming. Keeping track of who is doing what, what needs to be graded, and actually grading assignments consumes many extra hours per week. The position of AA was created to help the instructor keep track of what has been assigned, what CPPA has been submitted and graded and what CPPAs need to be graded. The AA also records the grade a student receives for a particular CPPA on the CPPM shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0273475312457781">Table 10</xref>, which is updated every week by the AA.</p>
<p>Grading hundreds of pages of CPPAs is very time consuming. In a recent marketing research course, there were 33 students and 75 CPPAs available. To evaluate CPPAs effectively and save time, students are required to submit all CPPAs using a standardized format that includes a header and footer on every page of the assignment. Additionally, all CPPAs must have an introductory paragraph that contains the following information: the purpose of the assignment, when the assignment was assigned and when the assignment is due, the possible CPPs the assignment is worth, and who prepared the CPPA. Every CPPA must use second level headings and numbered bullets under each heading.</p>
<p>Another major challenge that faces the instructor involves assigning a fair grade to each team member based on that team member’s level of contribution to the completion of the team’s final report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475312457781">Washburn &amp; Petroshius, 2004</xref>). We use two methods to help us determine the amount of effort each team member contributes to his or her team. First, all students must prepare what we call their “Hero Sheet” that lists what they have done to help their team complete their consulting report. These “Hero Sheets” must be handed to every member of the student’s team before the midterm and final peer evaluations are completed. Each team is required to discuss each member’s “Hero Sheet” and eliminate items that are irrelevant. Second, the students complete the peer evaluation form to help the instructor determine how much effort each team member has contributed to the completion of the team’s report.</p>
<p>Ensuring that the client receives a quality report that contains useful information is another challenge for the instructor. In our CFPs, the students truly learn what TQM (Total Quality Management) means. Every written document that goes in the students’ reports is critiqued by fellow team members and the instructor. When a student submits a poorly written assignment, that assignment is shown to the class and the instructor explains how the assignment could be improved. The submitter’s name is not revealed to the class to avoid publicly embarrassing the student. Conversely, when a well-written assignment is submitted to the instructor, the assignment is shown to all students and the instructor explains why the assignment is well done.</p>

<sec id="section44-0273475312457781">
<title>Challenges Faced by Students and Strategies to Cope</title>
<p>A major challenge when doing a CFP arises when there are no students in the class who have ever done a CFP. We do CFPs in both the Marketing Principles and the Management Principles classes. As a general rule, none of the students in a principles class have ever done a CFP. The biggest challenge in a principles class is to explain to the CFP “rookies” what is expected from each consulting team. Of the 117 CFPs conducted since 1992, 34 were conducted by students in a Marketing Principles class and 10 were conducted by students in a Management Principles class.</p>
<p>Students participating in a CFP are faced with a number of challenges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312457781">Parsons and Lepkowska-White (2009)</xref> note that students may be overwhelmed because of the ambiguity of the project and the amount of time needed to create a quality report. Students may also be frustrated if their client is not responsive enough or does not provide needed information. Finally, students must solve the problem of determining the contents of a report unlike any previous report they have been required to create. We use a number of tactics adopted over the years to help students deal with the challenges they will face as they prepare their reports. On the first day of class, the instructor provides a handout that lists the chapters that will go in each team’s consulting report. The handout contains the title of each chapter and a three- or four-sentence description of the contents of each chapter. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475312457781">Table 4</xref> shows the contents of a typical student-consulting report.</p>
<p>Next, the students are shown a report prepared in a previous semester. Most reports are 100 to 200 pages long in addition to an appendix section that may contain an additional 50 to 150 pages of supporting documentation. The instructor then tells the students they may check out a report from a prior class from the instructor’s library of previously submitted reports.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, the instructor asks the students to anonymously write on note cards any question, comment, suggestion, compliment, or complaint the student has about the class or the CFP. Then the instructor answers the questions asked and addresses any issues or concerns raised by the students. Allowing students to anonymously ask questions is helpful for uncovering students’ concerns that might not be expressed for fear of being judged by their peers as someone who is not overly bright. This data collection method is valuable because it lets the instructor know what assignments he needs to better explain to the class.</p>
<p>In each consulting report, there is a chapter titled “Advice for Future Students.” This advice chapter is not prepared for the client’s benefit but is prepared for future students who will be participating in a CFP. The instructor encourages all CFP rookies to check out a previous report and read the advice from former students who have completed a CFP.</p>
<p>Another problem we have encountered is the typical college students’ tendency to procrastinate when assigned the task of preparing a major report that is unlike anything they have ever done before. We employ two tactics to motivate students to get the report done. First, after 4 or 5 weeks into a 16-week semester, we present the students in class with the “Done Matrix,” as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0273475312457781">Table 11</xref>. Each consulting team is asked to tell the instructor how many of the items on the Done Matrix have been completed, printed, and put in their team’s report. Without exception, nearly every box on the Done Matrix contains a zero after 5 weeks into the semester. The instructor then tells the class that in 1 week the Done Matrix exercise will be repeated. Seeing all the zeroes in their team’s column usually motivates each team to make a more positive impression the next week when the Done Matrix exercise is repeated.</p>
<p>A second tactic is referred to as the “Show-and-Tell” presentation. Two weeks after the second Done Matrix exercise is completed, each team is required to have two team members stand in front of the class and show fellow students exactly what sections of their report have been completed and placed in their three-ring binders. The Show-and-Tell presentation lets each team gauge their progress against the progress of other teams in the class. The students are told that their report will be compared with other teams’ reports when a grade is assigned to their final consulting report.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The first several projects began with small budgets of $200 to $400. As we gained experience conducting a CFP, the scope of the projects expanded and the size of the budgets increased to $5,000 to $8,000. For projects conducted in the early years, the instructor and the client verbally agreed to work together and the instructor handled all the funds for the project. As the projects evolved, a formal contract was created and the university now handles the funds from the client. The contract currently being used has been refined and has been approved at all management levels in the university.</p>
<p>In early projects, the students learned about a client’s business and goals for the class by listening to a 30-minute oral presentation by the client. In 1995, the first edition of the CBS was used and the students now read about the client’s business and goals. The current CBS has been revised and improved over the past several years.</p>
<p>Another significant change involves the development and administration of the Client DCI. Before the Client DCI was introduced, the students verbally asked the client questions in class after the client’s oral presentation to the class. In 2001, the Client DCI was first used and has proven effective in helping the client and the students narrow the focus of the project.</p>
<p>Another significant change involves keeping track of the CPPs earned by each student. In early projects, the instructor kept track of each student’s CPPs. Now, a student in the class is responsible for tracking the CPPs earned by each student.</p>
<p>Clients’ suggestions have resulted in changes being made regarding how we now conduct a CFP. In early projects, the client was given the students’ reports on the day the students made their oral presentations. Now, the client receives the written reports 1 week before the students orally present their findings to the client. Each consulting team’s report contains a section that lists the recommendations for the client’s organization. In earlier classes, if there were five consulting teams in a class, the client had to look through five different reports to read each team’s recommendations. For our current CFPs, one student is now responsible for collecting each team’s recommendations and putting all recommendations into one three-ring binder for the client. Also, that student bundles the recommendations into one document and e-mails the recommendations as an attachment to the client. The client can then forward all recommendations to any employee within the client’s organization. In early projects, the students developed their recommendations throughout the semester and presented their recommendations to the client at the end of the semester. For our current projects, each team now e-mails their recommendations to the client in the seventh or eighth week of our 16-week semester. The client is asked to review the recommendations and let the students know which recommendations should be further developed in terms of cost and actions necessary to implement a particular recommendation. The client also lets the students know which recommendations do not need to be developed further because the recommendation is judged to be not feasible.</p>
<p>Around the midterm in the semester, we meet with the client in class and each team gives the client a progress report concerning information collected or activities completed by each team. Beginning a few years ago, after the midterm progress reports were given, a subteam of students now meets off campus with the client to obtain answers to the following questions: (a) What does the client think about students’ efforts so far? (b) What new information would the client like the students to collect? and (c) What new activities or tasks would the client like the students to complete?</p>
<p>Our approach to conducting a CFP tries to force students to be accountable. The fact that the client has invested money in the class tends to motivate a majority of the students. Students are more accountable to their teammates because 30% of a student’s course grade is based on the PE scores that teammates give each other. The instructor sets deadlines for when CPPAs are to be submitted and late assignments automatically receive a grade of 50% or less. Students who miss deadlines quickly learn that not being dependable and accountable will adversely affect their course grade.</p>
<p>Fourteen previous clients were personally interviewed to obtain their opinions of the students’ consulting performance. Many clients commented that the quality of the work done by the students was “good,” “very satisfactory,” “above expectations,” and “as good as a professional firm’s report.” A few mentioned that “there are too many reports to read,” “some reports are too long,” and “there are not enough time to review all reports before students’ final oral presentations.” Based on the clients’ positive comments and the fact that 18 clients have asked to participate in a second CFP, we are convinced that students who are juniors or seniors are capable of creating a quality report for their clients. In fact, five clients have asked our students to work with them on three or more occasions.</p>
<p>We also surveyed students who had completed at least one CFP. Some of these students were still enrolled at our university and some respondents had already graduated. In addition to including several statements that used a Likert-type scale response format, we asked these veterans of a CFP the following question; “What are your thoughts about the value of participating in a CFP?”</p>
<p>Below are comments from 3 of the 85 former students who responded to our survey. These three students had already graduated and their comments appear to indicate that students do gain a long-term valuable experience from participating in a CFP.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After graduating I have realized how the projects have benefited me in the success of my job search and they have helped me become a better business professional.</p>
<p>I think that CFPs are a great way for students to learn how to work as a team and be held accountable for their actions within the team. Completing CFPs has definitely made me a better writer and has also given me hands-on experience that I would not have gotten in the other classes.</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know that today I set up and successfully taught team members about goal setting. I am in the process of redefining the scope and role of my position and remembered the lessons you taught us and how valuable the information is. The lessons you taught me along the way have paid off in full.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We have also informally asked our business faculty their thoughts about the value of using a CFP as a pedagogical style. Every business faculty member has expressed overwhelming support for having students participate in a real-world CFP. Given the responses from clients, students and colleagues, we are confident that conducting CFPs with real businesses for real money is a solid and valuable experience for our students and the business community.</p>
