<abstract>
<p>We present a bio-electrospinning technique for preparing cell-containing, oriented tubular scaffold intended for use as a nerve guide conduit (NGC). With a coaxial spinneret, solutions of PC-12 cells and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) were delivered to the core and shell parts of the spinneret, respectively. When electrostatic field was applied, core/shell fiber was electrospun and collected. The electrospun fibers’ morphology was characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. Two structural characteristics were found: (1) the larger, hollow fibers had diameters in tens of micrometers and wall thicknesses around few micrometers, and (2) improved orientation in a preferred direction with the aid of a rotating collection device. Finally, fluorescent PC12 cells were found not only to exist and survive inside these hollow fibers, but also, upon addition of nerve growth factor, to undergo differentiation with neurite extended along the hollow fibers in the desired direction. All of these results demonstrate its potential application for NGC.</p>

<body>
<p>Studies on nerve regeneration, particularly the repair of either damaged peripheral or spinal cord nerves, have drawn tremendous attention in the past few years. This is especially true, as part of the overall concept of regenerative medicine, specifically, for tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517511420756">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517511420756">2</xref></sup> For severe cases of nerve damage, current regeneration strategy calls for nerve grafts, either autografts or artificial nerve guides, which can bridge gaps larger than several centimeters. Considered the gold standard, the autograft suffered from limited resources and loss of mobility from donor sites. The synthetic nerve guide conduit, on the other hand, has had several advantages, such as no immunization concern, adequate mechanical properties, and unlimited supply. It was hence considered a promising candidate for such surgical needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517511420756">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, only limited Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certified commercial nerve guide conduits are available despite the increasing need for such medical devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517511420756">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517511420756">4</xref></sup> They are all simple, single-lumen constructs with diameters ranging from two to 10 millimeters. Material-wise, they are all made of degradable polymers, such as collagen, polylactic acid, and poly( -caprolactone) (PCL). Improvements to the single-lumen, 100 µm in size, conduits were proposed by several research groups along with different approaches. These efforts can be best summarized by the several models proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517511420756">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517511420756">7</xref></sup> Structure-wise, both Lietz et al. and Bellamkonda proposed models based on the structural elements. On the other hand, Hudson et al. proposed models that emphasized the essential functions of the advanced nerve guide. Based on these models, recent advanced NGC studies have focused on several distinctions, namely (1) providing more guiding structure, (2) adding chemical cues (suchas nerve growth factor – NGF, extracellular matrix – ECM), and (3) integrating all of the above factors.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the multi-lumen structure via several processing techniques. Parallel agarose tubes were prepared by freezing the agarose aqueous solution from one side and forcing the alignment ofthe continuous tubes upward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517511420756">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517511420756">9</xref></sup> Without using any toxic chemicals as solvent, the in vitro test demonstrated the fast growth of the neurite in the guiding direction. However, the majority of such approaches called for traditional processes, such as injection molding or simple molding as presented by Moore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517511420756">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, Hodlock et al. injected poly(lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/glacial acetic acid into a mold with several arranged stainless steel wires. After first removing the acid solvent by freeze drying and then the stainless steel wires, a multi-lumen conduit was obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517511420756">11</xref></sup> Bender et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517511420756">12</xref></sup> prepared PCL nerve guide by coating PCL on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) core fibers, and then washing out the PVA to make several lumen channels. Wang and Huang fabricated coaxial stacked nerve conduits through soft lithography and molding processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517511420756">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>With these efforts, the dimensions of these tube units were in the range of several hundred micrometers to a few millimeters. There has been little research demonstrating structural units down to a few micrometers or even in the nanometer range. Li and Shi prepared a nano-scale patterned plate as the mold for poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), rolling up as tubes for NGC and providing four to eight times the surface area for the cell to attach and grow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517511420756">14</xref></sup> Similarly, Papenburg et al. reported a phase separation micromolding process to fabricate porous micropatterned 2-D scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517511420756">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of tissue engineering, the integration of the scaffold, cell and signal, is crucial for an effective regenerative surgery. Most of the above mentioned scaffolds can only introduce cell and/or signal after the completion of the scaffold due to the extreme situation during the fabrication process, such as high or low temperature. The seeding of the cell in the inner part of the scaffold might be difficult, especially for larger objects with finer structural features. It would be very beneficial if cells could be introduced into the scaffold in situ. Finally, the addition of the chemical cues, such as growth factor, could be achieved in a controlled manner by fine tuning the degradation mechanism of biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid.</p>
<p>Electrospinning, which has drawn tremendous amounts of attention for the past decade, is a relatively benign process with easy setup and operational procedures, yet versatile enough to be able to produce nano- to micrometer-scale polymeric fibers in different configurations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517511420756">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517511420756">17</xref></sup> It is our intention, taking the above-mentioned advantages of electrospinning, to prepare tissue engineering scaffold incorporating cell and growth factor in situ. In this preliminary trial, we aimed to conduct a proof of concept study. With bio-electrospinning, we present a novel scaffold approach, especially for an advanced NGC, which not only reduces the dimension of the guiding structural unit for maximum cell attachment and growth, but also effectively integrates all three major components of tissue engineering into one simple, low cost process.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0040517511420756"><title>Solution preparation and fabrication of hollow fibers scaffold by electrospinning</title>
<p>Solutions for electrospinning were (1) 12 wt% PLLA(medical grade, Mw = 140 kDa, kindly donated by BioTechOne Inc., Taiwan) in mixed N,N-dimethylformamide/dichloromethane solution (DMF, HCON(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 99.8%, Tedia, USA/DCM, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, reagent grade, 99.9%, Mallinckrodt, USA), and (2) polyethylene glycol/polyethylene oxide (PEG, Mw = 35 kDa, PEO, Mw = 900 kDa, both from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) 10 wt% aqueous solution. The electrospinning setup consisted of a static charger (SIMCO, CD50-P, Chargermaster, USA), two syringe pumps (KDS-100, USA) and collecting unit: either a metal flat plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517511420756">Figure 1</xref>, or a rotating drum with a diameter of 14 cm. The polymer solutions were delivered to a coaxial spinneret via syringe pumps separately at rates from 0.8 to 1.5 ml/h. The electrospinning processes were carried out with the following parameters: up to 20 kV of applied voltage and 10 to 20 cm of collecting distance, in conjunction with a core/shell spinneret to produce core/shell fibers. For fiber alignment purpose, the collecting drum was rotating at speeds of 100, 200 and 300 rounds per minute (linear speeds of 0.73, 1.47 and 2.2 m/s). After removing the extra solvent in the inner tube by washing and drying, hollow fibers were obtained.

<sec id="sec3-0040517511420756"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>PC12 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC CRL-1721<sup>TM</sup>), a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla, was obtained from Hisn-Chu Food Industrial Research Center, Taiwan. Prior to the electrospinning process, PC12 cells were maintained in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biological Industries, Israel), 50 U/ml penicillin, and50 mg/ml streptomycin (full medium, Biological Industries, Israel). Cells were routinely sub-cultured every 5–6 days. Neuronal differentiation of the PC12 cells was carried out by adding nerve growth factor (7.5s mouse 50 ng/ml, NGF-7S, Sigma, USA) into DMEM with 1% FBS for the required time. Immediately before the electrospinning process, the cells and medium were added into the PEO-PEG solution and mixed for 10 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517511420756"><title>Preparation of fluorescent PC12 cells</title>
<p>PC12 cells were transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N1, Clontech) construct, which expresses a green fluorescent protein. Seventy microliters of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 25 µg of pEGFP-N1 DNA were mixed in 3 ml of reduced serummedia, OPTI-MEM®, and incubated for 20 minwith gentle shaking at room temperature. The Lipofectamine 2000 and DNA mixture were then added to ∼2 × 10<sup>6</sup> PC12 cells with 3 ml of OPTI-MEM® in a T75 cultural flask, which was pre-coated with poly-L-lysine. The media was swirled to ensure even coverage and the cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Six hours later, the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FBS and antibiotics, and these cells were continuously cultured at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24–48 h before being made ready for the next experiments.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040517511420756"><title>Bio-electrospinning</title>
<p>In a clean room, bio-electrospinning was conducted in a similar setup and fashion to the normal electrospinning process mentioned above. After proper sterilization steps were taken, the cells medium solution, with concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, were added to the PEO/PEG 10 wt% aqueous solution and mixed well before being transferred to the syringe pump. The bio-electrospinning processes were carried out with parameters similar to the regular one, i.e. 20 kV, 15 cm, and 1.5 and 1.2 ml/h (outer/inner flow rate). The obtained cell-containing fibers were placed in a cell culture medium, after removal from the collecting unit, for further observation.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040517511420756"><title>Electrospinning of hollow fibers and their morphology</title>
<p>By adjusting solution properties and processing parameters, such as viscosity, conductivity, voltage field strength and relative flow rates of the outer PLLA solution and inner PEO-PEG aqueous solution, the electrospinning processes were conducted and the core/shell fibers were collected either by a rotating device or a flat plate. Among these parameters, the mixed solution of PEO-PEG was formulated based upon the overall viscosity (1301 cP, comparing to 1030 cP of 12 wt% PLLA solution), which is critical for smooth operation. Micrometer-scale hollow fibers were obtained after washing and drying the core/shell fibers. It was found that the relative flow rate played an important role regarding the successful formation of the core/shell fibers. When the solution was pushed out from the spinneret it tended to break easily if the relative flow rate and viscosity were poorly matched. Unless specified otherwise, all the electrospinning operations were carried out with the following parameters: 20 kV, 15 cm, and 1.5/1.2 ml/h for outer/inner flow rates, respectively. Flat fibrous membranes with an interesting bimodal morphology were produced. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a sample membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517511420756">Figure 2</xref>), which was obtained from the following operating conditions: 20 kV, 15 cm and 1.2/1.0 ml/h, clearly demonstrated the overall fibers characteristic of co-existence of significantly larger, 18.2 ± 2.0 µm, hollow fibers with a minor amount of smaller, 0.9 ± 0.29 µm, solid ones. Unlike the larger, oriented hollow fibers, thesmaller ones were distributed randomly among the larger fibers without a preferred direction, even with high speed rotating collections. Fiber diameters were found to decrease with the increase in rotating speed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517511420756">Figure 3</xref>. The cross section view revealed hollow structures with wall thicknesses around a few micrometers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511420756">Figure 4(a)</xref>. We also observed, under certain spinning conditions, an interesting micro-porous structure on the fiber wall, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511420756">Figure 4</xref>(b).

<p>Clearly seen in SEM photographs of fibers collected at different speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517511420756">Figure 5</xref>), the orientation of these fibers was enhanced by the rotating speed of the collecting unit.

<sec id="sec9-0040517511420756"><title>Bio-electrospinning, cells inside the hollow fiber</title>
<p>Bio-electrospinning was conducted in a similar way to that mentioned previously with the following parameters: 20 kV, 15 cm, and 1.5 and 1.2 ml/h for outer and inner flow rates, respectively. The hollow fibers collected via the bio-electrospinning process were cultured in the medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517511420756">Figure 7</xref>(a) and (b), with the aid of an optical microscope, cells were found floating and moving inside the hollow fiber immediately after the formation of these fibers. This finding was confirmed with the fluorescent microscopy of DNA transfected PC12 cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517511420756">Figure 8</xref>(a) to (d). A combined optical and fluorescent micrograph of PC 12 cells cultured in an open PS dish, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517511420756">Figure 8(e)</xref>, was presented here for comparison purposes. Also noted was that not all of the cells were successfully transfected with GFPand observable under fluoresent microscopy. Three days after the addition of the NGF, either immediately before the spinning process or in the culture solution of cell-containing hollow fiber, PC-12 cells attached to the inside of the PLLA hollow fiber and transformed from a round shape to a more elongated one, indicating the cell attachment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517511420756">Figure 9(a)</xref>, five transformed cells, all aligned along the hollow fiber, were clearly visible in a single hollow fiber, within a reasonably short range.

<p>With the major goal of producing smaller hollow fibers in mind, we successfully prepared hollow fibers of 20–60 µm in diameter, a significant reduction compared with those reported from previous works, which were several hundred micrometers to a few millimeters in diameter. With the reduction in diameter, an estimated 5- to 10-fold increase in surface area could be achieved for more cell attachment and, hence, a better neurite connection environment.</p>
<p>Also, an interesting micro-porous structure of the fiber wall was observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511420756">Figure 4</xref>(b), which might be a significant advantage as a source for nutrient permeation and/or metabolic waste disposal, such as glucose, bovine serum albumin as nutrients and urea as waste, as suggested by several researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517511420756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517511420756">19</xref></sup> The formation of this wall structure may well be due to the solvent employed in the electrospinning process. It was observed previously that fast solvent vaporization during the process could generate such a porous wall. We also tried to achieve similar structures via different schemes, e.g. by leaching out the porogen within polymer. With the addition of water soluble particles, such as glucose, we were able to make the fiber walls porous right after the hollow fibers were collected. One major advantage of this approach is the better control of the pore size by selecting different sizes of these porogens.</p>
<p>The observed smaller, randomly distributed fibers were also reported in other research and were believed to have formed by a smaller jet that randomly side-swung from the main jet, and hence collected without preferred direction during the electrospinning process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517511420756">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517511420756">21</xref></sup> We also proved that all of these smaller fibers were PLLA by comparing their dimensions before and after washing with water. No noticeable diameter changes were observed, which would indicate the above mentioned situation of smaller PLLA fiber formation. Structure-wise, in our case, these smaller, random fibers may have served as connection strings for holding together the larger, oriented fibers. The wide angle X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the fibers consisted of mainly PLLA with a trace of PEG. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data also echoed this finding (both data not shown here).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0040517511420756"><title>Fibers orientation</title>
<p>The orientation of the electrospun fibers could be achieved by several collecting mechanisms. In our study, the rotating unit was used to collect and align these fibers. It is probably the easiest way to create a sizeable film with minimum hardware and setup. Orientation of fibers was quantified by an analysis of the corresponding SEM photograph via an image process software package, ImageJ. We observed increase in fiber orientation as rotating speed increased up to 150 m/min. This high degree of orientation was highly desired for guiding neurite growth. To prevent the observed deformation of the hollow fibers at higher collecting speed, we could either reinforce the fibers with inorganic particles to increase the mechanical strength, or slow the collecting speed, with a trade-off in degree of orientation. More related experiments are currently being undertaken in our laboratory to obtain more balanced results.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0040517511420756"><title>Cell in the hollow fiber</title>
<p>PC12 cells were found to be alive inside the hollow fiber for more than a week under appropriate culture conditions. Several conclusions can be made from this observation. First, it was suggested that cells, at least some ofthose, could survive the electrospinning process, both the high voltage application and possible solvent contact. This can be explained, as also demonstrated by other research groups with other cells in similar conditions, as being due to extremely short time exposure to such conditions, as suggested by Jayasinghe and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517511420756">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517511420756">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517511420756">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517511420756">24</xref></sup> However, at this moment, no quantified data could be obtained due to several challenges to the experimental design. For example, the viability of cells inside the hollow fibers could not be easily measured by a traditional assay. The agent needed to dye the dead cell may not be easily delivered within the hollow fibers. The dissolution of the PLLA hollow fibers could be accomplished by adding the appropriate solvent, such as dichloromethane; however, should the cell be affected by this process, it may cause low viability measurements. As for other important components needed in the regenerative process, such as growth factors and the extracellular matrix or substratum proteins with which cells interact, there were reports which discussed the effect of electrospinning on their functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517511420756">23</xref></sup> Koh et al. demonstrated that the laminin still had the capability to aid cell attachment and differentiation even after it was electrospun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517511420756">24</xref></sup> Chew reported similar results on the protein bioactivity upon electrospinning process and that the bioactivity of the NGF was sustained, albeit not completely, after the electrospinning process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517511420756">25</xref></sup> As shown in our results, the observed neurite outgrowth toward the direction of the fiber clearly demonstrates the guiding function of the hollow fiber. With the above results, i.e. larger surface area, higher degree of orientation, porous walls, and biocompatible guiding structures, we demonstrated the possibility of a novel bio-electrospinning process for creating a multi-functional scaffold for nerve guide conduits via selected materials. One aspect that needs to be addressed is that currently the cell seeding via bio-electrospinning appears to be relatively low. This may be caused by either the loss of cells during the electrospinning process, or the cell number was diluted from a two-dimensional plan to a much larger three-dimensional scaffold. Recently unique electrospun PLLA membranes of highly aligned, one-by-one connected hollow fibers have been prepared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517511420756">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517511420756">27</xref></sup> Seeding of cells inside these hollow fibers via bio-electrospinning is currently being carried out in our laboratory. With such flat and thin membranes, the observation and counting of cells will be more accurate.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0040517511420756" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Aligned, cell-containing, micro-scale hollow fibers were prepared via a novel bio-electrospinning process with biodegradable polymers. An advanced nerve guide conduit was then easily prepared by combining all three major elements of tissue engineering. The PC12 cells were introduced in the tubular scaffold simultaneously and showed attachment, proliferation, and finally differentiation, with the addition of the neuron growth factor. The neurite of PC12 cells was observed extending along the direction of the micro-tubular scaffold. These results demonstrated that the viability of PC12 cells and functionality of nerve growth factor were retained, at least partially, after the electrospinning process. These results provide a sound basis to fabricating tissue engineered micro-tubular scaffold for nerve guide conduit, via the proposed electrospinning process.</p>
