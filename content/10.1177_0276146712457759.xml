<p>May 30 – June 2, 2013</p>
<p>In 2013, the Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM) celebrates its 30th Anniversary. To celebrate its jubilee, we invite business, marketing, social science, and humanities scholars from all backgrounds to join us in Copenhagen for a friendly, collegial and interdisciplinary research conference. In celebrating three decades of marketing historical research at CHARM, we call on scholars from around the globe to cast a critical look back into marketing’s past and forward into its future.</p>
<p>Papers on all aspects of marketing history and the history of marketing thought in all geographic areas and all time frames are welcome. In keeping with the conference’s theme, we especially welcome papers that deal with the following aspects of marketing and its history:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>varieties of marketing cultures and histories</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>writing the past: constructing histories in/for marketing</p>

</list-item>
</list>We also encourage submissions that discuss methodological, pedagogical and historiographic questions in marketing.</p>
<p>Doctoral students with a particular interest in research methods in marketing history and marketing theory are invited to attend a two-day workshop which immediately precedes the conference. There will also be a special track for the presentation of doctoral projects at the conference itself. For more information on the doctoral workshop see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.charmassociation.org">www.charmassociation.org</ext-link>.</p>
<p>All paper submissions will be double-blind reviewed and a proceedings volume will be published. Full papers (25 page maximum) or extended abstracts may be submitted. Authors may choose to publish either full papers or extended abstracts in the proceedings. To provide reviewers with sufficient information, extended abstracts should be: 1,200-1,500 words in length and include the research purpose, source material or data, and sample references. Please note: submitting a full paper to the proceedings volume does <italic>not</italic> preclude a submission of your paper to a journal. The copyright of a paper published in the CHARM proceedings remains with its authors, and over the years many CHARM conference papers have made their way into marketing, historical, sociological and other journals.</p>
