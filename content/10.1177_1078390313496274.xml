<body>
<p>In December 2011, the herald of bad tidings came in the form of an e-mail from my sister-in-law informing me that my brother was missing. The initial shock was followed by endless minutes of waiting for news. As time went on those minutes stretched into hours, then weeks and months without a word.</p>
<p>In June 2012, I finally received the call I had feared from a police detective. His voice was calm and controlled and showed a hint of impatience with his unpleasant task of informing me that my brother’s body had been found. He told me the medical examiner had ruled it a suicide. One of the more painful pieces of information he shared with me was that my brother had been seeing a therapist before he disappeared, but clearly did not get the help he needed. The language he used to describe the professional skills of this therapist cannot be printed in a nursing journal.</p>
<p>The timing of this painful loss underscored the significance of activities in my professional life. Since The Joint Commission developed the National Patient Safety Goal for suicide prevention in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313496274">The Joint Commission, 2007</xref>), I have been actively involved with training inpatient psychiatric nurses in suicide risk assessment. In October 2011, I was invited to participate with the National Action Alliance on Suicide Prevention as part of the Task Force for Clinical Preparedness. When my brother disappeared, the task force was evaluating national standards, guidelines, and competencies related to suicide prevention for mental health professionals. The period of waiting for news about my brother’s disappearance coincided with the release of task force findings that there are no standards, guidelines, or competencies for the psychiatric nurse generalist in suicide risk assessment and suicide prevention.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Nurses Association position paper titled, “Competency-based Training for Nurse Generalists: Inpatient Intervention and Prevention of Suicide,” is well stated and timely. I have been a psychiatric nurse for 40 years and a clinical specialist in psychiatric and mental health nursing for 30. The length of my experience allows me to speak firsthand of the dramatic changes that have occurred in the treatment of people with mental illness and how these affect the need for nurses in inpatient psychiatric units to be expert in assessing and reducing suicide risk.</p>
<p>In a 2009 article on goals for inpatient psychiatric hospitals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313496274">Sharfstein (2009)</xref> stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of the psychiatric hospital changed dramatically during the Twentieth Century. Formerly the primary location for psychiatric treatment, the hospital now plays a more circumscribed role within a community-based system of care. Crisis stabilization, safety, and a focus on rapid discharge are the critical components of the acute inpatient stay.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the main criteria justifying inpatient hospitalization is imminent danger of suicide. This often means that all or most of the patients on an inpatient unit are at risk of suicide, and all patients possess some risk factors for suicide. This pervasive level of high suicide risk demands that all licensed professionals working on inpatient services are qualified to provide competent suicide assessments. This includes the psychiatric nurse generalist employed on inpatient units.</p>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313496274">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013)</xref>, the suicide rate in the United States has been on the rise since 2000 despite significant work on increasing public awareness of the problem of suicide and on training for crisis hot-lines providers. The review of literature in the position paper highlights two disturbing issues. First, three international reviews of suicides occurring in inpatient units or shortly after discharge concluded that the professionals on the units provided poor risk assessment and ineffective monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313496274">Bowers, Nijman, &amp; Banda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313496274">Combs &amp; Room, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313496274">Large, Smith, Sharma, Nielssen, &amp; Singh, 2011</xref>). Second, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313496274">Suicide Prevention Resource Center and the American Association of Suicidality (2008)</xref> found there was “a gap in suicide-specific intervention training in educational programs for mental health professionals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313496274">Lyons et al., 2005</xref>). Establishing competencies and guidelines for the inpatient psychiatric nurse is an important component of any effort to reduce suicides in this country.</p>
<p>The consumer perspective in the paper emphasizes the need for professionals to listen to the voice of those who seek our help. The pain and suffering that accompanies our experience in living can be experienced by anyone, and depression, anxiety, and other forms of mental illness that increase suicide risk affect both young and old, rich and poor alike. The work of the psychiatric nurses at all levels is to offer help and guidance to those overwhelmed by the pain of life. We can provide a bridge from a period of psychic pain accompanied by a wish to die to a time when the pain has passed, better coping skills are in place, and a desire to live returns.</p>
<p>The tools of our trade in psychiatric nursing are the ability to use interpersonal skill and knowledge of the therapeutic relationship to help people in psychiatric crisis whose despair has obscured their recognition of the value of their lives, to protect their humanity, and help them feel not alone. In addition to providing empathic support, we must be able to identify factors that increase suicide risk and to implement care that provides safety and reduces long-term risk of self-harm. As the position paper on competency-based training in suicide intervention and prevention clearly establishes, psychiatric nurses deserve clear guidelines for the competencies that make us successful in our work. I believe that the value of this training will be demonstrated by a reduction in the number of families affected by the tragedy of suicide.</p>
