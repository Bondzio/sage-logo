<abstract>
<p>Prior research has revealed important insights about some factors which increase the probability that individuals will commit murder; however, existing studies rely on retrospective data from institutional samples and have not examined homicide offending using data collected <italic>before</italic> the murder was committed. We use prospective longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study to examine homicide using factors from multiple informants and developmental periods. Early risk scores showed whether homicide offenders could be predicted at an early age. The study reveals early-life factors that increase risk for perpetrating lethal violence and yields information on the dose-response relationships between predictors and homicide.</p>

<p>Social scientists have long speculated whether it is possible to predict years in advance who will commit lethal violence. Likewise, scholars and policymakers hypothesize etiological factors which may differentiate those who murder from those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912439398">DeLisi, Hochstetler, Jones-Johnson, Caudill, &amp; Marquart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>). Criminologists have amassed an impressive body of scientific evidence on the dimensions of homicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088767912439398">Rosenfeld, 2009a</xref>). Despite all of the attention paid to the developmental predictors of violent conduct, a surprisingly small body of research has examined the predictors of homicide offending. Perhaps investigators have rarely broached the subject because most offenders never murder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912439398">DeLisi (2001)</xref> reviewed some of the integral data sets in the criminological literature, including the 1945 and 1958 Philadelphia birth cohorts, Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck’s 500 criminal careers cohort, and the National Youth Survey. He documented that even these large sources of data, which at times included entire birth cohorts, contained very few criminals who committed serious violent offenses including murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912439398">DeLisi &amp; Scherer, 2006</xref>). Prevailing criminological theories also implicitly assume that there is little need to develop a conceptual explanation of homicide offending; yet this assumption lacks a strong empirical basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088767912439398">Heide, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912439398">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous individual-level studies on youth homicide, although comparatively small in number, have revealed important insights about the characteristics of homicide offenders relative to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1088767912439398">Smith, 2000</xref>). Still, these studies rarely investigate the predictive causal factors over the developmental life course. Moreover, most studies on youth homicide contain various design limitations that curb their potential contribution with regard to the <italic>causes</italic> of homicide. First, current studies are restricted in scope, relying on small convenience samples of institutionalized offenders while providing more information about prevalence than about causes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912439398">Bailey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912439398">Cornell, Benedek, &amp; Benedek, 1987</xref>). Second, with some exceptions, prior studies have not used control groups and so it is unknown whether factors that define young homicide offenders would apply to other groups such as violent youth or delinquents in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912439398">Bender, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088767912439398">van Soest, Park, Johnson, &amp; McPhail, 2003</xref>). Case-control designs lack adequate longitudinal information about individuals who resembled homicide offenders at a younger age but who did not subsequently commit murder. From these designs, it is not possible to specify the <italic>prospective probability</italic> of becoming a homicide offender for those who do or do not possess a given risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088767912439398">Goodman, Mercy, Layde, &amp; Thacker, 1988</xref>). Third, most descriptive research has relied on retrospective information about putative causes of homicide that is generally derived from official court records or third-party reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912439398">Busch, Zagar, Hughes, Arbit, &amp; Bussell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088767912439398">Hagelstam &amp; Häkkänen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912439398">Lewis et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1088767912439398">Roberts, Zgoba, &amp; Shahidullah, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1088767912439398">Shumaker &amp;McGee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088767912439398">Wolfgang, 1958</xref>). Several methodological problems exist with retrospective life-course studies of homicide offenders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1088767912439398">Zagar, Busch, Grove, &amp; Hughes, 2009</xref>). Court records may provide incomplete or inaccurate archival information about possible risk factors. Moreover, retrospective data reported by “family members are often biased by knowledge that the person has committed an offense, and may be characterized by incomplete or inaccurate recall of critical events and risk factors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>, p. 25). Clinical data on murderers are likely to overstate the role of mental health factors, while obscuring the contribution of behavioral and environmental predictors.</p>
<p>In short, the current body of research on homicide offenders is relatively sparse and most existing studies, although informative, are descriptive rather than predictive and suffer from various methodological limitations. As a result, the literature lacks even fundamental information about the long-term antecedents of lethal violence. A proper accounting of the developmental antecedents of lethal violence is needed to expand scientific knowledge about its complex causes. Building on previous empirical efforts and developmental theories, the current study advances this area of research. We employ prospective data on approximately 1,500 young men from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), composed of a rich body of information derived from multiple informants (e.g., parents, teachers, youths, and official records) dating back nearly two decades, to examine several unresolved questions about the etiology of homicide offending. These design features provide the unique opportunity—likely the first to date in the social scientific literature—to reveal crucial insights into the developmental trajectory of homicide offending. Prior research relies on information collected <italic>after</italic> the homicide has taken place, or with after-the-fact comparisons between groups of offenders and their matched controls (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912439398">Bailey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912439398">Busch et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912439398">Lewis et al., 1988</xref>). However, the current study is distinctive because we analyze repeated data collected on boys for many years <italic>before</italic> any of them became homicide offenders.</p>
<sec id="section1-1088767912439398">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Most prevailing criminological perspectives on the etiology of serious offending do not offer explicit hypotheses about the unique developmental predictors of youth homicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912439398">Farrington, 2003</xref>). Still, from these perspectives it is plausible to derive general propositions about the factors that place youth at risk for committing murder compared with other forms of serious or violent offending (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1088767912439398">Rowley, Ewing, &amp; Singer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1088767912439398">Wright, Pratt, &amp; DeLisi, 2008</xref>). Here, we derive assumptions about the risk factors for homicide from developmental and life-course theories and describe situational perspectives on violent encounters. Of theoretical importance to this study is the determination of whether certain known risk factors can distinguish people who are violent from those who engage in non-violent serious offending.</p>
<p>A class of developmental perspectives would expect that many of the risk factors for general offending are also useful to account for explanatory differences in nonlethal and lethal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088767912439398">Patterson, DeBaryshe, &amp; Ramsey, 1989</xref>). These perspectives would argue, for example, that a latent time-stable trait explains why people harm others or engage in rule breaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767912439398">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>). Homicide would be considered an extreme manifestation of this general tendency to act impulsively and without concern for the well-being of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767912439398">Hardwick &amp; Rowton-Lee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088767912439398">Piquero, MacDonald, Dobrin, Daigle, &amp; Cullen, 2005</xref>). Among the array of predictors which explain general offending several of these also reliably predict violence, such as adverse parenting practices, low self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088767912439398">Piquero et al., 2005</xref>), family poverty, extensive criminal history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912439398">DeLisi &amp; Scherer, 2006</xref>), low academic performance, exposure to risky neighborhood environment, antisocial attitudes, neuropsychological deficits, delinquent peer affiliation, and perinatal risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912439398">Farrington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">Loeber, Farrington, Stouthamer-Loeber, &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088767912439398">Nagin, Pogarsky, &amp; Farrington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088767912439398">Simons, Johnson, Conger, &amp; Elder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1088767912439398">Shumaker &amp; McGee, 2001</xref>). The extent to which these factors have qualitatively different effects on the perpetration of lethal violence is not well understood. Nonetheless, based on this branch of developmental theories, we expect that many of the same factors that predict criminal behavior in general would also help to explain risk for committing lethal violence.</p>
<p>Another strand of developmental theories predicts that nonviolent offenders are unlikely to engage in serious aggression, and therefore the conditions which explain violent behavior are not necessarily derived from those that explain general delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912439398">Deane, Armstrong, &amp; Felson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088767912439398">Moffitt (1993)</xref> proposes a developmental taxonomy in which “life-course persistent” offenders are at significantly greater risk than “adolescent limited” offenders to perpetrate serious violence including homicide. A history of interpersonal violence defines a subgroup of offenders who begin to offend early and are characterized by a particular set of risky personality traits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912439398">Lynam, Piquero, and Moffitt (2004)</xref> found in a New Zealand birth cohort that individuals with a violent offense history were more likely than their nonviolent counterparts to exhibit a history of behavioral and personality problems. Moreover, in support of this perspective, studies find that a majority of homicide offenders have committed violent offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912439398">Broidy, Daday, Crandall, Sklar, &amp; Jost, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912439398">Cook, Ludwig, &amp; Braga, 2005</xref>). Insofar as homicide offenders tend to resemble violent offenders, this suggests that it is possible to predict those who commit murder from the same variables that persistently explain violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767912439398">Hardwick &amp; Rowton-Lee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1088767912439398">Wright et al., 2008</xref>). Few studies explicitly address the notion of whether homicide offenders are similar to other violent offenders who have not committed murder (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912439398">DeLisi &amp; Scherer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088767912439398">Loeber, Lacourse, &amp; Homish, 2005</xref>). All combined, according to the “violence hypothesis,” the developmental predictors of violent behavior should also reliably predict homicide.</p>
<p>Of particular concern to developmental perspectives, irrespective of whether they formulate hypotheses about violence specialization, is the degree to which risk factors exhibited early in life will account for variation in offending across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088767912439398">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>). More specifically, developmental theories predict that childhood risk factors may continue to affect behavioral problems, including serious violence, well into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767912439398">Farrington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber, Farrington, Stouthamer-Loeber, &amp; van Kammen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088767912439398">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Life-course perspectives do place less emphasis on the predictive role of childhood factors than developmental theories, yet life-course perspectives similarly assume that early childhood experiences have causal effects on the trajectory of serious offending into adolescence and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088767912439398">Sampson &amp; Laub, 1993</xref>). All combined, there are good theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that several childhood factors such as ineffective parenting, poor school performance, and conduct problems, which generally predict offending in early adulthood, will similarly increase the probability of committing homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912439398">DeLisi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912439398">Farrington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088767912439398">Loeber, Pardini, et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is not clear whether childhood factors have persistent effects on the likelihood of an individual committing homicide, holding constant risk factors measured in late adolescence. For practical purposes, information about the developmental predictors of homicide would potentially allow for the identification of risk factors that occur from the period of birth into early childhood which may be amenable to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912439398">Christoffel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088767912439398">Olds et al., 1998</xref>). Owing to a shortage of empirical information, it remains an empirical question as to whether childhood risk factors are important determinants of homicide into adolescence and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternative theories propose that psychiatric problems are salient predictors of murder; indeed, psychiatric problems are allegedly important factors distinguishing those who kill from those who do not (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912439398">Cornell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912439398">Lewis et al., 1988</xref>). For instance, Heide (1995) found that a large proportion of adolescents who were institutionalized for murdering their parents displayed psychopathic traits. Still, research on the effects of psychopathic features on homicide is commonly derived from clinical samples of institutionalized murderers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912439398">Bender, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912439398">Cornell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088767912439398">Dolan &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; Meyers et al., 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1088767912439398">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). A community sample, in contrast to a clinical sample, is less likely to yield information about homicides arising from relatively rare cases of serious mental illness. Moreover, some researchers cast doubt on the purportedly strong association between psychopathy and youth homicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912439398">Blumstein, Rivara, &amp; Rosenfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088767912439398">Roth, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from the foregoing perspectives, situational theories represent an alternative perspective on the conditions that increase the probability of committing murder, particularly in the context of violent encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088767912439398">Miethe &amp; Regoeczi, 2004</xref>). Within a situational framework, analytical emphasis is placed on the risk factors that people “bring” to violent encounters which not only make people more likely to kill an adversary but also determine the nature of homicide events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767912439398">Decker, 1996</xref>). For example, insofar as people who carry weapons are prone to use them to achieve desired ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912439398">Felson &amp; Steadman, 1983</xref>), this means that youth who are armed are more likely to become involved in violent encounters and possibly perpetrate murder.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088767912439398">1</xref></sup> Moreover, from the perspective of situational perspectives, participation in the urban illicit economy increases the likelihood that youth will be involved in violent encounters and thereby amplifies their risk of committing murder. Actors involved in the illegal marketplace are reluctant to invoke the police to resolve disputes and often rely on violence as a means of regulation. Owing to these dynamics, participation in property and drug markets is perhaps an important predictor of committing lethal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088767912439398">Rosenfeld, 2009b</xref>).</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Guided by the literature described in the foregoing paragraphs, this study examines several questions within a prospective framework about the etiology of homicide offending: First, which explanatory and behavioral risk factors predict homicide offenders out of a community sample up to 22 years later? Second, to what extent did homicide offenders engage in criminal behaviors earlier in life? Third, to what extent can convicted homicide offenders be predicted based on explanatory, behavioral, and criminal risk factors? With regard to the latter question, an empirical concern of this study is the predictive efficacy of known correlates of homicide. All combined, the answers to these questions will inform the scientific literature about the developmental antecedents of homicide offending based on information gathered in a prospective longitudinal design.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1088767912439398">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The PYS is a longitudinal study consisting of repeated, contiguous assessments of three community cohorts of urban boys (originally in Grades 1, 4, and 7), which began in 1987. Using an enrollment list of all boys enrolled in these grade cohorts in Pittsburgh’s public schools, we randomly selected about 1,100 boys in each grade to be contacted for the study. The participation rates of boys and their parents in each grade cohort was 84.6%, 86.3%, and 83.9%, respectively. A comparison of those who participated and those who did not indicated that there were no significant differences in racial distribution and achievement test results which were the only two variables that could be compared using school records (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To increase the proportion of high-risk males in the sample, we used a screening assessment. On the basis of this screening, which included information from the child, his parent, and his teacher, the 30% of the boys identified as the most antisocial were included in the follow-up cohort, together with another 30% who were randomly selected from the remaining 70% of eligible participants. This strategy resulted in the final cohorts of 503, 508, and 506 boys in Grades 1, 4, and 7, respectively, which together with their parent were to be assessed in the study. Assessments of each of the cohorts were carried out, initially, half-yearly and later yearly and ceased in 2001. The youngest cohort has been assessed a total of 18 consecutive times (ages 7-19) whereas the oldest cohort was assessed a total of 16 consecutive times (ages 13-25). The middle cohort was only assessed seven times at half-year intervals from age 10 to 13, after which time the cohort was no longer interviewed regularly. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1088767912439398">Appendix A</xref> displays sample characteristics regarding wave by age information.</p>

<title>Homicide offending</title>
<p>Information about homicide offenders in the PYS was obtained from searches of state, local, and federal criminal records, interviews with PYS participants and their families, searches of local newspapers, searches of the national Lexis-Nexis media database, and the local coroner’s office. Based on information collected up to May 30, 2009, 37 PYS males were convicted for homicide between ages 15 and 29. Excluding boys who were not at risk (due to natural deaths and emigration), the prevalence of convicted homicide offenders was 2.4% (37 out of 1,512 sample members). Weighting back to the Pittsburgh public school population, this translates into 2.0%. Accurately calculating the PYS homicide rate requires a positive confirmation of both identity and conviction status. As the conviction rate does not necessarily include all actual homicide offenders, the PYS rate is undoubtedly conservative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088767912439398">2</xref></sup> The mean age of conviction was 19.7. As expected based on national data, an overwhelming majority of the offenders were African American (32 out of 37), which amounts to 3.7% of African American boys in the sample committing homicide. The numbers of convicted homicide offenders were similar across the three cohorts, with 11 in the youngest, 13 in the middle, and 13 in the oldest cohort.</p>
<p>Most convicted homicide offenders appeared fairly homogeneous. The offenses often involved firearms, illicit drugs, and young African American males as offenders and victims. Four of the offenders seemed unusual: One was mentally ill, one killed two people in a house fire, one committed domestic murder, and one committed vehicular homicide. For 18- to 24-year-old men, the annual homicide offending rate in the PYS is 353 per 100,000 among African Americans and 65 per 100,000 for Whites. These estimates are comparable with the rates for young African Americans males in Pittsburgh as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912439398">Dalton, Yonas, Warren, &amp; Sturman, 2009</xref>). Guns were used in the majority of homicide cases involving PYS participants or 75% of those known. Most homicide offenses involved African American males who killed other African American males (19 out of 29 known, or 56%). More than one third of the victims (13 out of 38 known) were youths between the ages of 15 and 21, whereas another 9 were aged 22 to 29, and 14 were aged 30 or above.</p>

<title>Multivariate Predictors</title>
<p>For the purposes of our quantitative analysis, we classify risk factors as either explanatory or behavioral. More specifically, explanatory risk factors are those that do not measure antisocial behavior but are related to it, whereas behavioral risk factors could reflect the boy’s antisocial behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">2008</xref>). We investigate the predictive validity of the different risk factors and the extent to which a combination of explanatory and behavioral factors measured up to age 14 improves on the accuracy of the prediction of convicted homicide offenders. It is unclear which specific risk factors within these categories are the strongest predictors when the others are taken into account. As noted previously, there is a dearth of information regarding whether serious behaviors that usually occur later in the developmental sequence leading to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 1998</xref>) are better predictors of homicide offenders than less serious behaviors such as truancy.</p>
<p>All <italic>childhood explanatory risk factors</italic> were measured in the screening phase and first follow-up assessments (1987-1988). The variables were derived from the 40 distinct explanatory factors described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al. (1998</xref>, chapter 5) excluding those not known for all three cohorts, those with a large amount of missing data (e.g., variables referring to the operative father or to the mother–father relationship), and those not strongly related to delinquency in 1987-88 (Odds Ratio [<italic>OR</italic>] &lt; 2.0) based on previous research with the PYS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">2008</xref>). Most variables were based on interviews with mothers, in a few cases supplemented by data from boys. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1088767912439398">Appendix B</xref> provides information on these measures; further detailed information about the explanatory and behavioral risk factors, including their origins and measurement can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088767912439398">Loeber and Farrington (2011)</xref>. The 21 childhood <italic>explanatory risk factors</italic> are noted below; the variables reflect risk factors relating to the child, the parent, child rearing, and socioeconomic status and neighborhood conditions.</p>

<p>Next, we describe the 18 <italic>behavioral risk factors</italic>, all of which were measured in 1987-88 in the screening phase and subsequently in the first assessment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1088767912439398">Appendix B</xref>). The measures were derived from the 25 correlates of delinquency described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al. (1998</xref>, chapter 5), with exclusion rules similar to those used with explanatory variables noted above; the measures have been shown in previous research to be important predictors of violence and serious offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 2008</xref>). All behavioral risk factors are classified under the following categories: <italic>child behavior, child attitude, parental, peer</italic>, and <italic>school</italic>.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>School</italic>: Suspended, truant, low school motivation.</p></list-item></list>
<p>For the present analyses, the explanatory and behavioral risk factors were dichotomized within each cohort into, as far as possible, the “worst” quarter of males (e.g., the quarter with the lowest attainment or poorest supervision) versus the remainder. This dichotomization fostered a “risk-factor” approach and made it easy to study the cumulative effects of several risk factors. It also made all variables directly comparable, by equating sensitivity of measurement, and permitted the use of the odds ratio as a measure of strength of relationship, which has many advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767912439398">Fleiss, 1981</xref>). In the Pittsburgh Youth Study, conclusions about the most important explanatory variables for delinquency were not greatly affected by using dichotomous as opposed to continuous variables or by different dichotomization splits. Dichotomizing the variables within each cohort made all the cohorts comparable and made it possible to combine them. Arguably, the quarter of the youngest cohort with the poorest parental supervision (for example) were comparable to the quarter of the oldest cohort with the poorest parental supervision, even though the absolute levels of parental supervision were different in all three cohorts.</p>
<p>Aside from behavioral and explanatory risk factors, we also analyze the link between specific measures of criminal behavior and homicide offending. As noted previously, it is believed that most homicide offenders were violent earlier in life and also committed many other illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912439398">Cook &amp; Laub, 1998</xref>), which theoretically increases their risk for committing homicide and may reflect a general tendency for rule-breaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912439398">DeLisi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1088767912439398">
<title>Criminal behavior (official records and self-reported offenses)</title>
<p>Three sources of information about prior offending were used: self-reports, convictions, and arrests (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1088767912439398">Appendix C</xref> for further information). Only crimes committed up to age 14 were studied to ensure that all prior crimes occurred before the first homicide conviction, which occurred at age 15. Thus, the criminal history information pertains to the early criminal careers of convicted homicide offenders. The following categories of self-reported crimes were studied:</p>
<list id="list3-1088767912439398" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Violence</italic>: robbery, aggravated assault, gang fighting, weapon carrying;</p></list-item>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088767912439398">Heide (1999)</xref> concluded that young homicide offenders tended to have a prior history of drug and alcohol abuse, and thus we also studied three other categories of substance use, namely, drunk in public, alcohol use, and tobacco use.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first question concerned the explanatory risk factors measured between ages 7 and 13, which predicted convicted homicide offenders in the full population of young males. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912439398">Table 1</xref> summarizes the results. For ease of exposition, retrospective percentages are presented. For example, column A of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912439398">Table 1</xref> shows that 89% of offenders, compared with 62% of controls, came from a broken home (<italic>OR</italic> = 5.0, CI [1.8, 14.3]; confidence intervals are large because of the small number of homicide offenders). In other words, 9 out of 10 convicted homicide offenders had a missing biological parent (usually the father) by the 1st year of the study. Nine of the 21 explanatory factors significantly differentiated convicted homicide offenders. The strongest predictors were broken home (<italic>OR</italic> = 5.0), living in a disadvantaged neighborhood (<italic>OR</italic> = 3.9), family on welfare (<italic>OR</italic> = 3.2), and a young mother (<italic>OR</italic> = 3.1). The results show that the strongest explanatory predictors were environmental factors and that individual factors tended to be somewhat weaker (e.g., old for the grade, <italic>OR</italic> = 2.9; lack of guilt, <italic>OR</italic> = 2.4).</p>

<title>Explanatory Risk Score</title>
<p>A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to investigate which of the 9 significant predictors of homicide offenders were independent predictors. According to column B of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912439398">Table 1</xref>, four variables were significant in a stepwise analysis: disadvantaged neighborhood (likelihood ratio chi-squared or LRCS = 15.05, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;.0001), a young mother (LRCS = 6.92, <italic>p</italic> = .009), low socioeconomic status (LRCS = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> = .050), and an unemployed mother (LRCS = 2.96, <italic>p</italic> = .086). In the final model, the partial odds ratios were 3.2 for disadvantaged neighborhood, 2.5 for a young mother, 2.0 for low socioeconomic status, and 1.9 for an unemployed mother (see column B, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912439398">Table 1</xref>). An explanatory risk score was calculated for each boy based on the number of these four significant risk factors that he possessed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088767912439398">Figure 1</xref> shows that the higher the explanatory risk score, the higher the percentage of homicide offenders. For example, 0.7% of boys with none of these four risk factors were homicide offenders, compared with 8.5% of boys with three risk factors and 10.3% of boys with all four risk factors. Therefore, there was significant predictability but also a high false positive rate. Retrospectively, 15 of the 37 homicide offenders (41%) were among the 12% of boys with three or four of these risk factors. Comparing boys with 0 to 2 risk factors with those with 3 to 4 risk factors produced an <italic>OR</italic> = 5.4 (CI [2.8, 10.7]); comparing boys with 0 to 3 risk factors with those with 4 risk factors produced an <italic>OR</italic> = 4.7 (CI [1.3, 16.1]).</p>

<p>However, the main measure of predictive accuracy used here is the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) (ROC), which in this example was .735 (<italic>SD</italic> = .042). This value is statistically significant, because it is more than 2 standard deviations above the chance value of .50. In general, an AUC value of .70 or greater indicates good predictability. The best-fitting ROC was calculated by maximum likelihood techniques, assuming underlying normal distributions, using the ROCFIT software. The interpretation of the AUC is as follows: If we choose a homicide offender at random, and he happens to have a score of Y, and we choose a control at random, and he happens to have a score of X, the AUC is the probability that Y will be greater than X. Therefore, in 73.5% of cases, the homicide offender would have a higher explanatory risk score than the control.</p>

<p>Next, a behavioral risk score was calculated for each boy based on the number of these four significant explanatory risk factors that he possessed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1088767912439398">Figure 2</xref> shows a dose–response relationship between the behavioral risk score and the probability of becoming a homicide offender: The higher the risk score, the higher the percentage of homicide offenders. For example, 0.7% of boys with none of these four risk factors were homicide offenders, compared with 17.1% of boys with 4 risk factors. Again, there was not only significant predictability but also a high false positive rate. Prospectively, 22 of the 290 worst boys (8%) were convicted homicide offenders. Retrospectively, 22 of the 37 homicide offenders (59%) were among the one fifth of the boys with three or more of these risk factors. Comparing boys with 0 to 2 risk factors with those with 3 to 4 risk factors produced an <italic>OR</italic> = 11.1; comparing boys with 0 to 3 risk factors with those with 4 risk factors produced an <italic>OR</italic> = 6.2. The AUC = .773 (<italic>SD</italic> = .044). The behavioral factors predicted convicted homicide offenders more strongly than did the explanatory factors.</p>

<title>Screening Risk Score to Estimate True Prediction</title>
<p>While the ability of the explanatory and behavioral risk scores to predict convicted homicide offenders is important, it is possible that the predictive efficiency is overestimated in these analyses. This is because the risk score is calculated in light of knowledge about which risk factors were the best predictors of homicide offenders. To derive a more accurate estimate of predictive efficiency, we turned to the screening risk scores for each of the PYS participants. These were based on contacts at ages 7 to 13 with the boy, his parent, and his teacher, before any later outcomes were known.</p>
<p>The screening risk score was based on 21 behaviors derived from the first contact interviews using parent and child scores on the CBC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1088767912439398">4</xref></sup> Each boy was scored according to the number of these 21 behaviors that he had committed. The average score was 2.1 for the youngest cohort (age 7), 3.2 for the middle cohort (age 10), and 4.2 for the oldest cohort (age 13). For the present analyses, each boy was given a <italic>z</italic> score (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) relative to his cohort. Therefore, all the cohort scores were comparable. We divided these <italic>z</italic> scores into 7 categories and show how they predicted convicted homicide offenders. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088767912439398">Figure 3</xref> shows that the higher the <italic>z</italic> score, the higher the probability of becoming a homicide offender (a stepwise function). For example, 8.3% of youth with the highest <italic>z</italic> scores (at least 2 standard deviations above the mean) were convicted, compared with 0.5% of boys with the lowest <italic>z</italic> scores. Retrospectively, 19 of the 37 homicide offenders (51%) were among the one fifth of the boys in the top three categories (<italic>z</italic> score .75 or greater). Comparing boys in these categories with the remainder, <italic>OR</italic> = 4.0. The AUC was .709 (<italic>SD</italic> = .041); hence, in 71% of cases, homicide offenders would have higher risk scores than a randomly selected youth from the control group.</p>

<p>Comparing results from the screening risk score with those from the behavioral risk score, the AUC decreased from .773 to .709, and the comparable <italic>OR</italic> (based on the highest one fifth of boys) decreased from 6.2 to 4.0. Part of this decrease is attributable to the more limited predictor (based on only one variable rather than several different variables) but another part probably reflects the overestimation of predictive efficiency by the behavioral risk score. Nevertheless, homicide offending is still significantly predicted.</p>

<title>Criminal Behavior at a Young Age of Convicted Homicide Offenders</title>
<p>Next, we investigate the extent to which homicide offenders engaged in criminal behavior prior to their murder conviction. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088767912439398">Table 3</xref> shows the extent to which self-reported offenses before age 15 predicted convicted homicide offenders. The strongest predictor was vehicle theft, closely followed by weapon carrying. The surprising finding is that, while the commission of violent and drug crimes did predict later homicide offending, so did the commission of a range of other property crimes and even minor deviance. These results suggest that homicide offenders at a young age were already versatile offenders (i.e., engaging in a large variety of different offense types) prior to committing murder. Contrary to our expectations, several self-reported forms of substance use did not significantly predict later homicide offending.</p>

<p>How do convictions for delinquency in the juvenile court compare with self-reported delinquency as predictors of homicide offending? It may be that homicide offenders are likely to underreport self-reported offenses, which may cause the effects of offending to be understated. Hence, it is important to investigate official arrest data. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1088767912439398">Table 4</xref> shows the extent to which convictions up to age 14 predicted convicted homicide offenders. In total, 21 of the 37 offenders (57%) were convicted up to age 14, compared with 17% of the 1,406 controls (<italic>OR</italic> = 6.4). While all types of violent crimes predicted later homicide offending, so did all types of property crimes, reinforcing the notion that the early offense patterns of homicide offenders are versatile rather than specialized. Also conviction for receiving stolen goods, an indication of participation in the illegal economy, is a strong predictor of homicide offenders (<italic>OR</italic> = 6.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but its self-reported equivalent was not (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.1, <italic>ns</italic>). Combined, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1088767912439398">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088767912439398">5</xref> show that convictions for different forms of violence are stronger predictors of homicide compared with self-reported violent offenses. Next, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088767912439398">Table 5</xref> shows the extent to which arrests up to age 14 (which were more numerous than convictions) predicted convicted homicide offenders. In total, 26 of the 37 offenders (70%) were arrested up to age 14, compared with 28% of the 1,406 controls (<italic>OR</italic> = 6.2). The types of crimes that most strongly predicted later homicide offenses were different forms of violence: aggravated assault, weapons, simple assault, and threats. All of the property arrests were significant predictors of later homicide offenders, although less strongly so than for violent arrests.</p>

<p>Next, logistic regression analyses were carried out to investigate which types of prior offenses up to age 14 independently predicted later convictions for homicide. Separate analyses were carried out for self-reports, convictions, and arrests. All significant offense variables were entered in the regressions. According to the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1088767912439398">Table 6</xref>, self-reported vehicle theft, weapon carrying, and minor fraud (avoid paying) independently predicted later homicide offending.

<p>All of these 8 variables were then entered into a final logistic regression analysis to establish the independent criminal predictors from all of the self-report, conviction, and arrest information up to age 14. The bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1088767912439398">Table 6</xref> shows the results. Five variables were significant independent predictors of homicide. A criminal risk score was then calculated based on the number of these five risk factors that each boy possessed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1088767912439398">Figure 4</xref> shows a dose–response relationship between the criminal risk score and the probability of becoming a homicide offender: the higher that score, the higher the percentage of homicide offenders. A total of 46 boys (3%) possessed 4 or 5 risk factors, and 10 of them were convicted (22%), compared with 2% of the remaining 1,397 males whom were known and only 10 of the 37 offenders (27%) were identified by this cutoff point (<italic>OR</italic> = 14.1). A total of 155 boys (11%) possessed 3, 4, or 5 of the risk factors, and 22 of them were convicted (14%), compared with 1% of the remaining 1,288 boys (<italic>OR</italic> = 14.0). This cutoff point identified 59% of the homicide offenders. Perhaps not surprisingly, the AUC of .837 (<italic>SD</italic> = .035) for criminal risk factors was much higher than for the explanatory or behavioral risk factors (.735 and .773, respectively).</p>

<title>The Use of Arrests in Estimating Overprediction</title>
<p>As before, it might be argued that predictive efficiency is overestimated in this analysis of criminal risk scores because the constituent variables are chosen in light of knowledge about which are the best predictors. To produce a more realistic assessment of predictive efficiency, we looked solely at <italic>the number of arrests</italic> up to age 14 as an unbiased measure of criminal risk. Moreover, this strategy allows us to overcome the validity threats posed by potential participant underreporting of offending. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088767912439398">Figure 5</xref> shows a dose–response relationship between the number of arrests up to age 14 and the probability of becoming a homicide offender: The higher the arrest number, the higher the percentage of homicide offenders. Of 97 boys with 9 or more arrests, 13 (13%) were convicted, compared with 2% of the 1,346 boys with fewer arrests (<italic>OR</italic> = 8.5; CI [4.2, 17.3]). Of 189 boys with 5 or more arrests, 19 (10%) were convicted, compared with 1% of the 1,254 boys with fewer arrests (<italic>OR</italic> = 7.7). This cutoff point identified 19 of the 37 offenders (51%). Comparing results from the number of arrests with those from the self-reported criminal risk score, the AUC decreased from .837 to .794 (<italic>SD</italic> = .046), and the most comparable <italic>OR</italic> decreased from 14.0 to 7.7. Part of this decrease is attributable to the more limited predictor (based on number of arrests only, not on types of offenses or on convictions or self-reports) and another part probably reflects the overestimation of predictive efficiency by the criminal risk score. Moreover, it is reasonable to suggest that an unbiased AUC derived from a criminal risk score might be of the order .81 to .82, that an unbiased <italic>OR</italic> might be of the order of 10, and that 11% to 12% of the most problematic one eighth of the sample would become homicide offenders.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>A considerable amount of policy and scientific attention is devoted to the prevention, explanation, and control of homicide both in the United States and abroad. There is much speculation among academics, the media, and policy analysts regarding the factors that place an individual at risk for perpetrating homicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912439398">DeLisi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>). Yet the bulk of existing research in this domain is found at the macro level and focuses on the spatial variation in the murder rate; existing individual-level studies are either cross-sectional or based on clinical samples of institutionalized youth. Clinical data are very informative, though liable to overstate the role of mental health factors, particularly psychopathic features; furthermore, retrospective studies, in general, are vulnerable to third-party reporting errors which may produce partially biased information about critical life events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912439398">Heide, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Current knowledge about the development context of homicide is generally descriptive and based on empirical information that was collected <italic>after</italic> the murder was committed, rather than <italic>long before</italic>. As a result, there is a shortage of information about the long-term developmental antecedents of homicide offending. We set out to undertake the task of predicting convicted homicide offenders in a prospective sample of young males who were assessed from childhood onward. This task was difficult because we aimed to predict the 2% of the population who had killed someone. To our knowledge <italic>this study is the first</italic> of its kind to prospectively investigate the predictors of homicide from self-report information, from youth, their caretakers and teachers, as well as from official records dating back to childhood.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. More specifically, the data are derived from a sample of males from a single city in the United States, which may limit the generalizeability of the findings. Although biological factors, such as peripheral neurological functioning, head trauma, and brain development have been hypothesized to be important predictors of serious violence and homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1088767912439398">Raine, 1993</xref>) we did not have adequate information on the study participants to pursue these notions. On top of this, the study does not have access to the immediate circumstances and decision-making processes of all homicide offenders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088767912439398">Miethe &amp; Regoeczi, 2004</xref>). By necessity, these dimensions need to be constructed from police accounts or retrospective information from perpetrations; we could not pursue these topics in the current research owing to data restrictions.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we uncovered several important findings with regard to the developmental origins of homicide offending and its prediction. Among the cluster of <italic>explanatory</italic> predictors, the most salient were environmental and socioeconomic rather than individual factors. Moreover, the most important <italic>behavioral risk</italic> factors that predicted convicted homicide offenders were suspension from school, disruptive behavior disorder, and attitudes favoring delinquency—all of which are early manifestations of problematic behavior, which previous studies have found are important determinants of not only general offending across the life span but also interpersonal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767912439398">Farrington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088767912439398">Nagin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088767912439398">Piquero et al., 2005</xref>). It is important to note the rather glaring fact that the overwhelming majority of homicide offenders were African American. Nationwide statistics reveal a similar pattern showing the disproportionate representation of African Americans as offenders and victims in lethal encounters. In this research, race did not predict homicide offending after controlling for explanatory risk factors, suggesting that racial differences in homicide were attributable to racial difference in risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 2011</xref>). Other conceptual perspectives maintain that adversary effects or subcultural processes (e.g., street code) may account for why African American males exhibit high rates of lethal violence relative to other demographic groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912439398">Berg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the study predictors, prior <italic>criminal offenses</italic> up to age 14 were the most important risk factors for convicted homicide offenders. Prior violence (especially assault and weapon carrying) was highly predictive of homicide offending—95% of offenders had records of violence. These observations are consistent with notions from developmental accounts wherein conceptual emphasis is placed on the possibility of behavioral consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912439398">DeLisi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>) and with situational theories that stress the role of weapon carrying in predicting lethal violence. Apart from prior violence, however, property offending as well as drug sales (though, not drug use) were salient determinants of committing homicide; in fact, income-generating offenses contributed significantly to the overall efficacy of the prediction equations. These latter findings are consistent with the notion that engagement in the illicit economy is a precursor to some males becoming a homicide offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088767912439398">Rosenfeld, 2009a</xref>). All combined, the results support the notion that homicide offending is an outcome that is preceded by a history of disruptive, nondelinquent behavior and delinquent acts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912439398">DeLisi &amp; Scherer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767912439398">Farrington, 1991</xref>). The fact that this history includes weapon carrying is significant for practical reasons because the majority of the homicides were committed with a weapon, mostly a gun.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that none of the parental child-rearing factors predicted convicted homicide offenders, which is partially contrary to expectations from developmental accounts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912439398">Farrington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912439398">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>). There could be several reasons for this observation. First, other explanatory factors within the family context appear to bear stronger effects on the probability of homicide, such as having a young mother and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood. Second, prior research on this sample yields the following pattern: the absence of violence (including homicide) is better predicted by the positive side of child-rearing practices (i.e., promotive factors), rather than the risky dimension of child-rearing practices significantly predicting violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the analyses revealed that peer factors (i.e., peer delinquency) did not independently predict homicide offending. This finding agrees with earlier analysis indicating the peer factors probably reflect the same underlying construct as the participants’ delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912439398">Farrington, Loeber, Yin, &amp; Anderson, 2002</xref>). We also discovered that lack of guilt, cruelty to people and callous-unemotional behavior, often thought to be early indicators of psychopathy, did not predict convicted homicide offenders (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912439398">Lewis et al., 1988</xref>; Meyers et al., 1995). Thus, the results uncovered here do not support the notion that early psychopathic features are related to homicide offending at least within a prospective design. The fact that prior empirical research has shown otherwise is perhaps the result of using data from clinical or institutionalized samples of homicide offenders.</p>
<p>Prediction is an important tool of prevention science, and evidence of predictive efficacy is useful for prevention programming tailored to ameliorate the risk factors for serious offending that are evident early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912439398">Christoffel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088767912439398">Olds et al., 1998</xref>). A series of analyses were conducted to assess whether homicide offenders might be identified in childhood using their risk scores from the earliest period of the PYS. Unlike the remaining variables in the study, risk scores are not potentially biased by the researchers’ knowledge of who became convicted homicide offenders. A dose–response relationship was observed: as the risk score increased, the probability of becoming a homicide offender increased from about 0.5% to 8%. It was thus possible to identify a high-risk group of about one fifth of the sample in childhood which included about half of all eventual homicide offenders. Still, false positive rates were rather high (92%). These findings provide additional information that may be useful to treatment and prevention programming, for they suggest that the treatment of risk factors evident as far back as childhood may reduce individuals’ risk of committing homicide at a later phase. Policies should not be designed to specifically target the developmental predictors of homicide because homicide is a rare offense relative to the burden imposed by other forms of violence, and the predictive efficacy of our estimates certainly would not warrant specific homicide-focused interventions. Interventions should be tailored to alleviate deprivation, curb delinquent peer involvement, improve school performance, and promote effective child-rearing practices. Combined, these practices would likely translate not only into lower rates of criminal behavior but also ultimately into fewer homicides (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088767912439398">Olds et al., 1998</xref>). We caution policymakers, however, from interpreting our findings as justification to increase penalties for juvenile offenses for the ultimate purpose of preventing homicides—penalties, which in some U.S. states, are rather extreme (e.g., long-term imprisonment). As of now, it remains a somewhat open empirical question as to whether exposure to periods of incarceration during adolescence or childhood—criminal justice penalties in general—ameliorates or amplifies risk for perpetrating lethal violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912439398">DeLisi &amp; Walters, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1088767912439398">Sorenson &amp; Davis, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>From a conceptual perspective, it is plausible to infer from the current results that in a majority of cases homicide offending is the culmination of individuals’ progress on three developmental pathways from childhood to adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912439398">Loeber et al., 1998</xref>) (a) the Authority Conflict Pathway leading to conflict with authority figures; (b) the Overt pathway of escalating violence starting with lesser forms of problem aggression; and (c) the Covert pathway consistent of an escalation from less serious covert acts to serious forms of property crime. For the majority of the homicide offenders in the PYS, their progress on these three pathways prepared them early in life to become versatile rather than specialized offenders, and in some cases this versatility translated into especially risk income–generating crimes. This conclusion is reaffirmed by the fact that violent and property offenses significantly predicted the pool of convicted homicide offenders. Future research on homicide should evaluate the empirical validity of the current findings using different prospective data from both the United States and abroad to generate a more complete scientific understanding of the etiology of murder.</p>
