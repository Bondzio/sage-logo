<abstract>
<p>Drawing on the human capital theory and the pretext and aspiration theory, this paper aims at disentangling and making explicit or visible the pretension wrapped up in the aspiration of the Nigerian state to build universities for national development. It was found that there was and continues to be an aspiration to build universities for creating a knowledge-based economy (KBE). But, simultaneously, there also was, and continues to be, a pretension in it as indicated in the unwillingness of the state to fund universities. To survive, universities have resorted to commercialize their services. To cope with the increasing demand for access to universities, the state too embarked on the privatization of universities. To realize its aspiration to build the KBE, the state was urged to banish its pretension, partner with the Academic Staff Union of Universities in reforming the university system, and widen its university funding sources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent interest in reforming university education stems partly from the aspiration of nation states to utilize the education system to achieve, create, or produce a knowledge-based economy (KBE). The KBE concept is described variously as the ‘knowledge society’, ‘knowledge economy’ and ‘creative economy’ which is operated by the ‘knowledge worker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909612469604">Peters, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909612469604">Peters and Besley, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909612469604">Peters (2009)</xref>, this is a new form of <italic>educational capitalism</italic>, which encourages teaching for giftedness, creativity, <italic>entrepreneurship</italic>, and prioritization of accelerated and personal life-long learning.</p>
<p>More broadly, it is aimed at building <italic>human capital</italic> through organizational learning, corporate training, and <italic>education at all levels</italic>. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909612469604">Vogel and Keen (2010)</xref> found that higher education is co-integrated with output and incomes and serves as an important gateway to developing and expanding human capital.</p>
<p>In this study I turn scholarly management attention to the university system even when the aspiration is for the entire education system. Universities have been transformed or have morphed from public service organizations into for-profit large-scale private enterprises in the services (skills, knowledge, or technology) industry in recent decades. It is time, therefore, that management scholars incorporate the universities into their research agenda.</p>
<p>Around the contemporary world, nations nurture the aspiration to build a KBE. Few instances are taken to illustrate this global trend. The European Union (EU), as a bloc of nations, nurtures the aspiration to create a KBE that is resilient and rivals the United States (US). This aspiration is enunciated in the Lisbon Agenda of the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909612469604">Guisard et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that the US is operating a KBE which the EU takes as a model. Thus education policy reform in the EU has been designed to encourage life-long learning for <italic>skills formation</italic> and employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909612469604">Nijhof, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In Africa, education reform is being pursued with an aspiration to reposition the African university for contributing to the transformation of African states into emerging countries by 2025. This aspiration was enunciated in a Pan-African high level conference organized by the African Centre for Training and Research in Administration for Development (CAFRAD) from 21 to 23 November 2011 in Rabat, Morocco.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom (UK), the government places premium on <italic>scientific knowledge for creating wealth</italic>, which makes education an important element of the government’s science and innovation strategy (Her Majesty’s [HM] Treasury, 2004 as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909612469604">Lockett et al., 2008</xref>). Nigeria also nurtures a strong aspiration to build a KBE, as expressed in its ‘Vision 20:2020’ statement, which is designed to catapult Nigeria into one of the top 20 industrialized economies of the world by 2020. But Nigeria was ranked among 200 countries of the world in 1999 and found to be trailing behind many countries in critical indices of development. In this assessment, Nigeria ranked 10th in population, with 124 million in a world of 5, 975 million; 54th in gross domestic product (GDP) with US$37 billion compared to the world average of US$29, 232 billion; 179th in per capita GDP with US$319 compared to the world average of US$4,890; and 136th in the human development index with 0.455 as against the world average score of 0.71 (United Nations Development Programme, 2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909612469604">United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 2002</xref>: 156). Even as recently as 2010, the Global Information Technology Report (GITR) 2009–10 (as cited in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612469604">National Planning Commission, Nigeria, 2010</xref>: 229–30) showed that the readiness of Nigeria’s environment for KBE ranked only 97 out of 133 <italic>developing</italic> countries. So, it is a tall order to be one of the 20 top economies of the world by 2020, just eight years from 2012. It is this low ranking, among other factors, that has fired the aspiration of Nigeria to catapult itself to rank among the top 20 economies of the world by 2020.</p>
<p>Yet, and this is also a global phenomenon, there is widespread pretext in developing universities for national development. This shows up in the lack of palpable commitment: in insincere promises made during electioneering campaigns, as education is amenable to being used for political strategizing and winning the hearts of the electorates; in rampant looting of public funds, which could have been invested in university infrastructure; in the privatization, commercialization, and thus profitization of university education under various guises; in neoliberal politics of double movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909612469604">Hart, 2001</xref>); and in the neoliberal hegemonic (economic) <italic>management rationality</italic>. These are different from <italic>incapacity or incapacitation</italic>, which merely compounds the problem.</p>
<p>These elements of pretext have become widely known and angered students to embark on protests in London in the UK, Quebec in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909612469604">British Broadcasting Corporation, 2011</xref>), in Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612469604">Concord, 2005</xref>) and in Chile. The case of Ghana is unique and interesting in that it was the ‘Committee of Principals and Vice Chancellors (CVCPs) (rather than students which) threatened to close down the universities or cut down their admission intake till a solution is found to the chronic under-funding of the universities and other tertiary institutions as a result of starvation of budgetary allocations to the tertiary sector’ (the <italic>Ghanaian Times</italic>, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612469604">Concord, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The same pattern of aspiration and pretension is discernible in the Nigerian university system. Thus a close observation of the country’s university system suggests that the aspiration to build a KBE may be off to a bad start because there appears to be a mismatch between the quality of university education at the present time and the aspiration to attain the position of one of the top 20 economies of the world by 2020 (cf. Jeynes, 2007, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909612469604">Jeynes, 2008</xref> for Japan in the 1970s to 1980s). The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to argue and substantiate that the Nigerian state displays this paradoxical behaviour of wrapping up (or is it juxtaposing?) aspiration with pretension with respect to its attempts to reform the university system for building a KBE.</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, the paper is structured into eight sections as follows. The introduction has defined the problem and set the objective of the study. In the second section I situate the study in the conceptual context of the paper. In particular, I draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner’s (2008)</xref> oxymoron, ‘pretext and aspiration’, which was originally used to describe the pretension in neoliberal economic management discourse for justifying the enthronement of the neoliberal state and profiting from the market opportunity so created. I devote section three to demonstrate the aspiration of the Nigerian state to use the university system for national development and section four to show the pretension of the same state, which is wrapped up in that aspiration. In the fifth section I show the adverse impact of the paradoxical aspiration and pretension on the university system and trace the rot from the feeder-secondary school system. I then go on, in the sixth section, to highlight the commercialization and privatization of universities as coping strategies. Next, in section seven, I examine the current reforms going on in Nigerian universities. The paper concludes in the eighth section in which I summarize the findings of the study and suggest policy measures arising from the findings.</p>

<sec id="section2-0021909612469604">
<title>Theoretical Framework of the Study</title>
<p>I draw on two complementary theories to ground the present study. These are the human capital theory (HCT) and the pretext and aspiration theory (PAT). These are explained in the following sub-sections.</p>
<sec id="section3-0021909612469604">
<title>Human Capital Theory</title>
<p>The human capital theory (HCT) can be used to explain the motive force driving the aspiration to employ education for socio-economic development of nations around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909612469604">Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909612469604">Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002)</xref> suggested that estimates from various countries around the world over the years reaffirm the importance of the human capital theory in explaining socio-economic development of nations.</p>
<p>According to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909612469604">Okuwa, 2004</xref>), the notion of education as a capital good is rooted in the concept of human capital, which is a factor of production in the development process. But what is human capital? In the simplest formulation, long-run economic growth rates are caused by <italic>ideas and inventions</italic>, which in turn are related to the stock of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909612469604">Hanushek and Kimko, 2000</xref>). The usual mode of human capital development involves educating and training humans for shaping their skills, drives, dispositions, attitudes, and behavioural orientations, which increase productivity of labour.</p>
<p>Reinforcing the value of education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909612469604">Fisher and Stanton (2001)</xref> found that education increased <italic>scientific understanding</italic>, opened up business opportunities, and contributed to firm performance. It helps to explain why education is an important element of the UK government’s science and innovation strategy in which scientific knowledge is being used to create wealth (HM Treasury, 2004 as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909612469604">Lockett et al., 2008</xref>). Nations always have recourse to the university system to find solutions to the problems of their societies because it constitutes <italic>society’s engine room of knowledge and skills</italic>.</p>
<p>The human capital theory, which Theodore W. Schultz initiated, has developed into a revolution over the years. The HCT is thought to have the power to resolve three paradoxes relating to ‘development assistance’ to, and break the development impasse of, developing countries. One of these paradoxes, it is claimed, is the failure to develop despite infusion of financial and physical capital into developing countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021909612469604">
<title>Pretext and Aspiration Theory</title>
<p>I draw upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner’s (2008)</xref> ‘pretext and aspiration’ theory, but in the changed order of ‘aspiration and pretext’ to frame the discourse on Nigeria’s embattled university system and show that pretext cohabits with the aspiration to deploy the university system for building human capital for socio-economic development of nation states. In the original application of the theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner (2008</xref>: 24) argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>By promoting the underfunding, marginalization, and vilification of the public sector, the <italic>hegemonic bloc</italic> is able to <italic>acquire control over the provision of vital life needs</italic>, thus replacing free or low-cost public support with private, priced services for sale on the open market. In this way, pretext and aspiration work together to form the pretensions we must learn to question if we are to have a sustainable society. (Emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The PAT has the explanatory power to unravel the inertia, dilemma, or ambivalence of the neoliberal state in its desire to deploy the university system for socio-economic development. The ambivalence arises because two coextensive and opposing dynamics (pretext and aspiration) are set in motion, which pull or push in opposite directions, with equal force, and thus cancel themselves out. The pretext can be shown with the cases of Chile and Canada.</p>
<p>According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909612469604">Long, 2011</xref>), about 40% of education spending in Chile comes from households in the form of tuition fees. Only 16% of higher education spending comes from the state. The country’s education system is one of the most privatized in the world. Consequently, students protested against what they perceived as an <italic>increasingly profit-minded, expensive, and unfair education system</italic> in the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909612469604">Long (2011)</xref> predicts that the protest, which has been described as the ‘Chilean Winter’, is likely to spread in Latin America as many students have been inspired to challenge their education systems.</p>
<p>In Canada, a report from the Corporate-Higher Education Forum suggested that provincial governments should continue their under-funding of public education so that universities continue to seek out corporate partners (Buchbinder and Newson, 1991, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner, 2008</xref>). Around the world, states are renegotiating the traditional social contract (or so it seems), where universities are now told to fend for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909612469604">Kwiek, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>How does aspiration and pretension play out in the Nigerian university system? The two subsequent sections demonstrate how the Nigerian state displays aspiration and pretension with respect to the university system in the country.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021909612469604">
<title>Aspiration of the State for University Education in Nigeria</title>
<p>The aspiration to employ university education for socio-economic development of the Nigerian state can be explained from the HCT discussed earlier: that human capital explains socio-economic development. This aspiration stretches back into colonial times.</p>
<p>The British colonial administration did not have a clear policy on education for Nigeria before 1925. The efforts to provide educational opportunities for Nigerians were a sham and pretext. For example, in 1922, the Phelps-Stokes Commission was set up by the Phelps-Stokes Fund to look into education in the West and Equatorial Africa, including Nigeria. The Commission strongly argued for the development of teaching the <italic>simple industries and agriculture</italic> (Fafunwa, 1974, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909612469604">Nnazor, 2005</xref>). But the transcendent grievance of educated Nigerians was the <italic>unsatisfied aspiration</italic> in the quest for higher education which was fuelled partly by their observation that, ‘the real secret of the white man’s strength and superiority was not his religion but his education’ (as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909612469604">Coleman, 1965</xref>: 116–26).</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this situation, therefore, Nigerians demanded the founding of a university that would be comparable to any in Britain and which would enable them to achieve their emancipation from colonial servitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909612469604">Ajayi, 1975</xref>). In 1945, the colonial administration set up the Elliot Commission on Higher Education in West Africa. The commission identified that the demand for manpower in higher education exceeded its supply and recommended the establishment of a university college. Following this, the University College, Ibadan was founded in 1948 as an affiliate of the University of London.</p>
<p>In 1959 the federal government set up the Sir Eric Ashby Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education to assess the human resources needs of the country as well as the country’s needs for post-secondary education for the next 20 years (1960–80). It stated that education was the tool for achieving national economic development and social emancipation of individuals. It recommended the expansion in the education system – specifically, the establishment of four federal universities in the country. Five universities were established instead of the four that were recommended. These were the University of Ibadan (as upgraded to an autonomous university in 1960); the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (established in 1960); Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (established in 1962); University of Ife, Ile Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University; established in 1962) and the University of Lagos, Lagos (established in 1962).</p>
<p>The <italic>pretext</italic> of the colonial administration to realize the aspiration of Nigerians aggrieved educated Nigerians to take it up as a nationalist cause. At independence, therefore, the aspiration for university education became a national passion in which education was considered as the greatest force that could bring about the much-needed development of the economic, political, sociological, and human resources of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909612469604">Musaazi, 1986</xref>: 106). Consequently, the National Curriculum Conference of 1969 was held to brainstorm on a curriculum for achieving national development, the universal primary education (UPE) was introduced in 1976, and seven new federal universities were established in 1975 in addition to the founding of the University of Benin, Benin City, in 1970. The government white paper on the report of the 1969 curriculum conference constituted the Nigerian National Policy on Education (1977).</p>
<p>This policy document gives evidence of the <italic>grand aspiration</italic> to use education to achieve national development; namely, that:<disp-quote>
<p>(Nigeria’s philosophy of education) has to be geared towards … individual and national efficiency, effective citizenship, national consciousness, national unity, …social, cultural, economic, scientific, and technological progress (Federal Government of Nigeria, 1977 as reproduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909612469604">Musaazi, 1986</xref>: 130, italics are my emphasis; words in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further, the government committed itself to implement the National Policy on Education, recognizing that:<disp-quote>
<p>(1) Education will continue to be <italic>highly rated</italic> in the national development plans, because education is the most important instrument of change as any fundamental change in the intellectual and social outlook of any society has to be preceded by an educational revolution… (3) Educational and training facilities will be multiplied and made more accessible… (Federal Government of Nigeria, 1977 as reproduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909612469604">Musaazi, 1986</xref>: 131, italics are my emphasis; words in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, the government established additional 14 federal universities from 1976 to 2010. In 2011 alone, nine federal universities were established. This brought the total number of federal universities in the country to 36. There are also 37 state universities and 45 private universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909612469604">National Universities Commission, Nigeria, 2012</xref>). The government approved the opening of five additional private universities in February, 2012, bringing the number of private universities in Nigeria to 50. Altogether, there are 123 universities in Nigeria for a population of about 151 million persons with a ratio of 1 university to 1.23 million persons. South Africa has 24 public and 11 private universities totaling 35 universities for a population of about 50 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909612469604">Wikipedia.org, 2012</xref>) with a ratio of 1 university to 2.1 million persons.</p>
<p>This aspiration is kept alive and <italic>on display</italic>. In 1991, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909612469604">the Commission on the Review of Higher Education in Nigeria (the Gray Longe Commission) Report (n.d.</xref>: 5) ‘identified education as the most powerful instrument for social reform which develops in the individual knowledge, skills, and character through training, teaching, study or experience’. In 2011, at the sixth conference of UNESCO in Paris, the Nigerian federal government declared to the international community the country’s ambition and commitment to provide ‘education-for-all by 2015’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909612469604">Abubakar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909612469604">Omokhunu, 2011</xref>). The vision 20: 2020 statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612469604">National Planning Commission, Nigeria, 2010</xref>: 147) is an eloquent recent demonstration of the aspiration:<disp-quote>
<p>The ability to acquire and utilize knowledge and skills effectively is the key to the growth and development that will propel Nigeria to become one of the 20 largest economies by the year 2020 … The primary goals to achieve this include providing access to quality education at all levels, improved learning and teaching infrastructure, according greater importance to science, information technology, technical, vocational education and training.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I now turn to the issue of pretension in the provision of high-quality university education in Nigeria in the next section of this paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0021909612469604">
<title>Pretext of the State in Nigeria’s University System</title>
<p>The aspirations discussed in the previous section are quite admirable. Yet they are tainted with pretext. There is a pretension cohabiting and coextensive with the aspiration, such as the <italic>fictionalized prioritization of education in annual budgetary allocations</italic> while, in fact, the National Assembly gets the priority (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909612469604">Agbo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The pretension showed up in the hype leading to the adoption of the structural adjustment programme (SAP), as the panacea for Nigeria’s economic woes such that Nigerians were urged to and did tighten their belts by adopting fiscal frugality in the hope for a payoff in socio-economic rebound. At heart, it was part of the wider neoliberal agenda for reforming of the world for the sole benefit of circuits of international capital (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909612469604">Lazzarato, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909612469604">Le Heron, 1993</xref>). This was what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner (2008)</xref> identified as ‘pretext and aspiration’ and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909612469604">Hart (2001)</xref> called ‘the double movement of capitalism’.</p>
<p>Consequently, during this period subsidy to the education system was withdrawn. Yet servicing and repayment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, or <italic>reversed capital flow to the developed countries</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909612469604">Morrissey and Baker, 2003</xref>), went on as both of them were given higher priority than funding of education and other social services, incapacitating the universities from engaging in rigorous teaching and researching; they virtually withdrew from these activities with great cost to themselves and the Nigerian nation in terms of needlessly lost development opportunities. As the influential Ithaka Report into Scholarly Publishing in a Digital Age (in South Africa) argues:<disp-quote>
<p>Universities give up too much by withdrawing from publishing. They give up the opportunity to enhance institutional reputation and prestige. They reduce their ability to influence what gets published – and, therefore … who gets hired or promoted. … There is a great need, as well as a great opportunity, to revitalize the university’s role and capabilities in [researching and] publishing. (Brown et al., 2007: 6, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909612469604">Gray and Willmers, 2009</xref>; parenthesis added)</p>

<p>The situation in Nigeria is consistent with the findings of the International Civil Society Network for Participatory Review of Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPRIN). According to the SAPRIN Report (2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909612469604">de la Barra, 2006</xref>), structural adjustment policies are at the root of poverty and the economic crises around the world.</p>
<p>The adoption of the SAP created the tragedy of the education system and <italic>undercut the human capacity</italic> (capital) development in the developing countries which, in turn, created for the World Bank <italic>the growth business of capacity-building in these countries</italic>. As Colgan (2002: 4, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909612469604">Atuahene, 2006</xref>: 48) rightly argued:<disp-quote>
<p>African countries require essential investments in health, education and infrastructure before they can compete internationally. The World Bank and IMF instead required countries to reduce state support and protection for social and economic sectors. They insisted on pushing weak African economies into markets where they were unable to compete with the might of the international private sector. <italic>These policies further undermined the economic development of African countries</italic>. (Italics are my emphasis; words in original)</p>

<p>The influential work of Psacharopoulos (1985, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909612469604">Okuwa, 2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909612469604">Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (n.d.</xref>: 24; updated 2002) provided the intellectual bulwark, in the 1980s, for the design and implementation of the World Bank/IMF policy for the privatization and commercialization (reform) of education around the world. In particular, these scholars suggested that<disp-quote>
<p>Estimates of the returns to schooling are a useful indicator of the productivity of education and incentive for <italic>individuals to invest in their own human capital</italic>. Public policy needs to heed this evidence in the design of policies and crafting of incentives that both promote investment and <italic>ensure that low-income families make those investments</italic>. (Italics are my emphasis; words in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even here, the paradox of aspiration and pretext of the developed countries is discernible, which provided the <italic>cultural and policy script</italic> for the compliant Nigerian neoliberal client state and those in other developing countries. For example, developing countries are told that investing in education will enable developing countries to catch-up with the developed world, since the returns to the investment in education are higher in the developing than those of developed countries. This hope fuelled the aspiration of developing countries to deploy education for socio-economic development. But, simultaneously, the governments of developing countries are told to remain aloof, <italic>abandoning the poor and impoverished low-income families to invest in their education</italic>.</p>
<p>The draconian and impoverishing conditionalities of SAP constituted a bitter pill that had to be forced down the throat, which required a military or military-like civilian regime to implement. Not coincidentally it was adopted during the military administration of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (Rtd). His military government enacted and enforced the dreaded State Security and Detention of Persons Decree (Decree No. 1), which was invoked to put down SAP-related protests. Nigerians endured his decade-long military repression and dictatorship (1985–93) before he was forced to ‘step aside’. The SAP also created the ‘new poverty’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909612469604">Lazzarato, 2009</xref>) and rejuvenated social stratification into mutually antagonistic social classes (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909612469604">Harvey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The pretext is also kept alive and in tandem with the aspiration but concealed by not vocalizing it. One way the pretext is concealed is the claim that education has the lion’s share in the budgets of both the federal and state governments in Nigeria. But the actual recurrent and capital allocations in 2010 to 27 federal universities, for example, amounted to just N118 billion compared to the N225.5 billion that went to 459 federal and state legislators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909612469604">Odunlami, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The pretext of the state is exposed in the running battle the Academic Staff Union of (Nigerian) Universities (ASUU) wages with the Nigerian state. The ASUU has to kick and drag the reluctant and ambivalent state by means of crippling nationwide strikes to get it to fund the universities. The subsisting agreement is the federal government of Nigeria (FGN)/ASUU 2009 Agreement, which was signed in 2009 but is half-heartedly implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909612469604">ASUU Delta State University Branch, 2011</xref>). In one telling case, the pretext of the Delta State government was exposed when on 2 November 2011 the ASUU, Delta State University Branch, in a resolution taken at its emergency congress meeting stated, among others, that:<disp-quote>
<p>The current 9 abandonment in the three campuses of the University is embarrassing, horrifying, portraying Government as incompetent or lacking the political will to maintain the only public University in Delta State and therefore unacceptable. The phenomenon of abandoned project limits the capacity of the University to maximize its potentials to provide admission opportunities for the teeming applicants from Delta State and beyond … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909612469604">ASUU Delta State University Branch, 2011</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet the Delta State Government claims to accord priority to education in the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909612469604">Delta State Ministry of Education, Nigeria, 2011</xref>) and has human capital development on the ‘three-point agenda’ of the ruling People’s Democratic Party in Delta State.</p>
<p>It is clear from the foregoing analysis that Nigerian universities have been incapacitated from playing the developmental role assigned to them – indeed, they are compelled to make bricks without straw.</p>

<title>Impact of Pretext and Aspiration on Education in Nigeria</title>
<p>The withdrawal of subsidy from the Nigerian education system created the rot in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909612469604">Akaeze, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909612469604">Yusuf, 2008</xref>). According to Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics (as cited in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612469604">National Planning Commission, Nigeria, 2010</xref>: 150), students’ enrolment has been on the increase from 6,279,463 in 2004 to 6,625,943 in 2008 but the number of classrooms has stagnated at 98,077 for the same period. For the three years that data are available, the total number of teachers were 154,594 (2004), 144,413 (2005), and 199,163 (2006). The teacher–student ratios were 1:40 (2004), 1:44 (2005), and 1:33 (2006).</p>
<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that, for five straight years, the performance of candidates in the Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations (SSCE) has been so poor as to constitute a national embarrassment. In particular, of 1,051,246 candidates who took the SSCE in 2004, only 91,196 (18.26%) had credit in English language and mathematics; in 2005, it was only 203,941 (18.68%) out of 1,091,763 candidates; in 2006, it was only 110,370 (9.32%) out of 1,184,223 candidates; in 2007, it was only 98,111 (7.69%) out of 1,275,832 candidates; and in 2008, it was only 127,196 (9.29%) out of 1,369,171 candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612469604">National Planning Commission, Nigeria, 2010</xref>: 151). In 2010, 98% of the 234,682 or 229,988 candidates failed to make five passes at the credit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909612469604">Egeonu, 2011</xref>). The Registrar of the National Examinations Council (NECO) blamed the poor performance on the poor teaching and learning environments in the school system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909612469604">Ogaji, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Mathematics is the <italic>language of science and technology</italic> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909612469604">Ajayi, 1997</xref>).

Thus these students are ill-equipped for university education, such that most university students perform poorly in examinations. As such, <italic>lecturers routinely pad up scores to improve performance superficially</italic>.</p>
<p>The learning culture is gone and an increasing number of students resort to malpractice in order to pass examinations. As such, many students are just acquiring certificates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909612469604">Nwabuisi, 2008</xref>) with little education, poor skills, and deviant culture (e.g. cultism).

<p>At the same time, Nigerian universities have experienced a drastic decline in international standing with none among the top 200 universities of the world. By comparison, the University of Cape Town is ranked 103 in the 2011 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and the only African University among the top 200 universities in the world. Four of its alumni have bagged the coveted Nobel prize in various academic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909612469604">Wikipedia.org, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Managing Universities for Survival through Commercialization and Privatization</title>
<p>In the face of the funding constraints and associated challenges discussed earlier, how have Nigerian universities and their academics been forging ahead? The survival strategies consist of the commercialization, reverse-subsidization, and privatization of universities in Nigeria. This paper focuses on the commercialization and privatization of universities. Commercialization of university education in Nigeria is manifested in the imposition of various user fees in undergraduate programmes; the proliferation of revenue-yielding programmes; and the licensing of commercial private universities by the state.</p>
<p>Since 1986, when the SAP was adopted, the state has introduced user fees, and privatized and commercialized feeding and hostel accommodation in Nigerian universities. The experience is the same in all African countries, as demonstrated in the findings of the Association of African Universities (1991, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909612469604">Djangmah et al., n.d</xref>.), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909612469604">Mwira et al. (2006)</xref>. The introduction of user fees has led to students’ protests in many Nigerian universities such as the University of Calabar in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909612469604">Akpaekong, 2011</xref>), the University of Nigeria in 1997; the University of Ibadan in the 1997/1998 session; and the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909612469604">Obasi and Eboh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>I now turn to the issue of actual privatization of universities in Nigeria. The military administrations were not disposed to previous attempts at the privatization of universities. The second coming of private universities occurred during the civilian administration of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo (1999–2007). There has been a widening gap between the number of applicants to and placements in Nigerian universities over the years (see Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board, 2004, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909612469604">Omoike and Aluede, 2007</xref>). The existing public universities were (and are) poorly funded and not anywhere near the UNESCO benchmark minimum of 26% of budgetary allocations. Worse, it has even been on the downward slope and historically low even by African standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909612469604">United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 2002</xref>). For example, the budgetary allocation in 1999 was 11.12%; in 2000 it was 8.36%; in 2001 it was 7.0%; in 2002 it was 5.9%; and in 2003 it was 1.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909612469604">Nwabuisi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As such, there was both the imperative and necessity to allow private investors to invest in university education in the country. Similar funding challenges in Ghana led to the privatization of higher education in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909612469604">Atuahene, 2006</xref>: 205). The cases of privatization of universities in Chile and Canada were cited earlier (Buchbinder and Newson, 1991, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909612469604">Sumner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909612469604">Long, 2011</xref>). But privatization of university education comes with exorbitant fees, limited inaccessibility to the majority of applicants who are poor, and elitism in the process (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909612469604">Atuahene, 2006</xref>); profitability concern and quality dilution (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909612469604">Omoike and Aluede, 2007</xref>); and staffing challenges, which makes them employ professors retired from public universities.</p>
<p>In the face of these challenges, what reforms have been put in place to make Nigerian universities play their developmental roles? This question is answered in the next two sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021909612469604">
<title>Reform Measures of the Nigerian State</title>
<p>The state’s reform of the university system in Nigeria was carried out by the Federal Ministry of Education through the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC). The commission is empowered by the Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions Decree 16 of 1998 to inspect, assess, accredit and maintain academic standards in Nigerian universities. For this purpose, the commission makes periodic, once-in-three years accreditation visits to Nigerian universities.</p>
<p>To ensure maintenance of standards, academic programmes are accredited for a three-year period. Programmes that fail to meet the set standard are denied accreditation and stopped from admitting students. In the University of Abuja, for example, the MBA and the MSc (business administration) programmes have been denied accreditation. The accountancy programme in the Faculty of Management Sciences in Delta State University, Asaba Campus was denied accreditation in 2009. Many other universities also have the same experience in one programme or the other.</p>
<p>As part of the measures to ensure high-quality education in the universities, the NUC has made the PhD degree the minimum academic qualification for purposes of teaching in Nigerian universities. Currently about 60% of academic staff of Nigerian universities do not have a PhD degree. A deadline of three years was set for lecturers without the PhD degree to make it or face termination of their appointments. Critics charge that the universities do not have the infrastructures to produce the PhDs in the stipulated time frame and that the insistence on implementing the policy amounts to <italic>making of PhDs at gunpoint</italic>. Other reform measures include the establishment of <italic>carrying capacity</italic> for all full-time academic programmes, the introduction of <italic>institutional accreditation</italic>, and <italic>funding</italic>. I dwell a little on the last item.</p>
<p>Funding reform has been made through the establishment of the Education Trust Fund (ETF). Money for the fund is generated from imposing a 2% education tax on the assessable profits of all registered companies in Nigeria. It is backed with the Education Tax Act No. 7 of 1993 which was amended in 1998 as the Education Tax Act (Amendment) No. 40. It is aimed at improving the quality of education in Nigeria. Currently the ETF is funding the publication of some 30 journals and sponsoring faculty members and non-academic staff to attend local and international conferences.</p>
<p>Cognizant of funding quagmires, the parliament of Ghana passed the GETFund Act 581 in 2000, which established the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund). It is funded from a 2.5% deduction from the 12% value added tax (VAT) imposed on goods and services to supplement government budgetary allocations to education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909612469604">Atuahene, 2006</xref>). Even with this GETFund, there is a huge funding gap.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the funding of public universities (higher education) comes from the government (50%), student tuition and other fees (25%), and other private incomes (25%). The private sources of income include research contracts, donations, and investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909612469604">Ministry of Education, South Africa, 2004</xref>). This is much like the funding practice in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In Kenya, public funding of universities has not kept pace with the growth in enrolments over the years, creating a chronic funding deficit. From 1991 to 1996, the cumulative deficit was US$18,556,948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909612469604">Mwira et al., 2006</xref>: 67). Beginning in June 1991, therefore, the government of Kenya embarked on cost-sharing programmes as part of the process of implementing the structural adjustment programme as it affects funding public universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909612469604">Mwira et al., 2006</xref>: 66–72).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0021909612469604">
<title>Reform Measures of Nigerian Universities</title>
<p>One of the key areas of reforms is in raising the quality of academics in Nigerian universities. Among others, this is being achieved by implementing the age-old rule for academics to publish or perish. The quality of papers has been raised and number required for promotion has been increased. In the University of Benin, for example, journals recognized for staff promotion are those based in universities, must be local, national, and international. The Delta State University, Abraka insists on indexed foreign journals, in addition. The University of Nigeria, Nsukka, operates an ‘impact factor’ requiring the publication of one paper per named journal. But universities have to contend with plagiarism and short-cuts meant to fool the system. Lecturers have been found to convert works of other researchers by retyping the papers and inserting their names, or altering the published papers to include their names as coauthors (for plagiarism in the Obafemi Awolowo University, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909612469604">Momodu, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Universities also support and reinforce the NUC policy stipulation of making the PhD degree the minimum qualification for academic staff. The Governing Council of the Delta State University is determined to implement the policy to the letter. It has set 2014 as the final deadline for all lecturers without the PhD to obtain it or face the music. This policy decision is conveyed in the University’s Internal Memorandum ref. DELSU/REG/C. 211 dated 26 March 2012. It has also placed a promotion bar against those without PhDs such that they cannot be promoted beyond the rank of lecturer I. With the ‘gun’ at their back, a large number of its lecturers have enrolled for the PhD programme and obtained the PhD degree. It is a sad story with a happy ending.</p>
<p>The ASUU has been at the forefront of the reform of the university system. For example, the ASUU went on strike in 1993 to compel the federal government to implement the recommendations of the Longe Commission on the Review of Higher Education in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909612469604">Okuwa, 2004</xref>). Since then ASUU has been embarking on industrial actions to press home its demands for a reform of the Nigerian university. The demands include adequate funding of universities for <italic>rigorous teaching and researching</italic>, which place nations on the path of development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909612469604">Onokerhoraye, 2007</xref>), raising the retirement age of professors to 70 years, and granting autonomy and academic freedom to universities.</p>
<p><italic>Nigerian universities have begun to diversify their sources of funds</italic> as an adaptive response to the funding cut by the central and state governments and as a response to the call for African universities to diversify their sources of funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909612469604">Djangmah et al., n.d</xref>.). These include running executive MBA programmes, part-time degree programmes, consultancy operations, investment programmes, donations and such. The Delta State University, for example, has the ‘Delta (State University) Investments Limited (DIL)’ which, through the university’s faculty of agriculture, raises funds from fish ponds, piggery, poultry farm, and an oil palm press. The DIL also owns and runs a bookshop and operates other businesses. Among many others, the University of Benin and the University of Ibadan have commercial university printing presses and commercialized university guest houses.</p>
<p>Other reform measures include the <italic>quality assurance</italic> (QA) exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909612469604">Arubayi, 2003</xref>), tackling examination malpractice, and fighting cultism head on.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study made important findings that can inform policy making for reforming and improving quality service delivery in the embattled university system in Nigeria. The main finding is that the Nigerian state largely pays lip service to the provision of high-quality university education being ‘committed’ to removing the adverse conditions of universities and, at the same time, exacerbating these adversities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909612469604">Olaofe, 1997</xref>). It was also found that the adoption of the SAP crippled the university system in Nigeria. In particular, the implementation of <italic>fiscal austerity</italic> measures created the funding crisis in the universities, which led to the adoption of the survival strategies of commercializing and privatizing university education in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The state’s mindset is an obstacle to the reform process to move the universities forward, as the aspiration-pretext logjam petrifies the state in a state of inertia. To overcome this petrification, the state is urged to commence a ‘mental revolution’ or a radical reorientation in thinking in two ways. First, government is urged to think in terms of Nigeria and Nigerian firms facing a sort of Darwinian global hypercompetition in which technology is a decisive factor. Education is fundamental to this competition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909612469604">Jeynes, 2008</xref>). As such, the government is led to see the need to <italic>truly or sincerely</italic> prioritize education by making its investment in education to rank among the top 20 in the world.</p>
<p>Second, the government is urged to reconsider its expenditures in the education and healthcare sub-sectors of the Nigerian economy as investments in human capital development and protection of the rights of its citizens to access education. As such, the government is urged to widen the funding sources to include the revenues from the sale of excess crude oil being accumulated in the sovereign wealth fund (SWF), funds saved from the removal of subsidy on petroleum products, and recovered money looted from the public treasury. These should be incorporated into the policies of the state.</p>
<p>The government is urged to <italic>fight corruption with all its might and determination</italic>, as the bane of Nigeria is corruption. Minimizing corruption alone can boost the funds that can be released to the university system. This is evident in the fact that total public funds, which 16 ex-governors are alleged to have stolen or mismanaged in recent times, amounted to ₦10,251.45 billion or US$68.34 billion at ₦150 to US$1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909612469604">Ayorinde, 2011</xref>). The ₦10,251.45 billion is about 26 times the ₦400 billion (US$2.67 billion for an exchange rate of US$1 to ₦150) in funds the federal government pledged to inject into the universities for the next three years, which persuaded ASUU to suspend its two-month long nationwide strike action.</p>
<p>The government is further urged to partner with ASUU in its bid to reform and accelerate the development of the nation’s university system. Currently, the government sees the ASUU struggle mostly in employer–employee terms, as suggested in the termination of the appointment of 49 lecturers of the University of Ilorin and other acts of blackmail and intimidation of its members. The government is also urged to support the universities’ accreditation system as a way to create and maintain high academic quality. Currently the state does too little in terms of staffing, equipment and materials to enable the system to work successfully and satisfactorily. Lacking these infrastructures, universities try to get accreditation by any means possible, which is not good for the system.</p>
<p>The state should set machinery in motion for arresting the decline in university education. A <italic>technological solution</italic> is to employ the biometric technology in Nigerian universities to tackle the monster of examination malpractice. An <italic>ethical or moral solution</italic> should involve a reform in the university academic programme to include moral education. This can be done by including moral philosophy in the general studies course on <italic>philosophy, logic, and history of human existence</italic> which is taken by all undergraduate students in Nigerian universities. <italic>A psychological solution</italic> should involve means of motivating students to enrol in a course of life-long learning.</p>
<p>Motivating students is difficult to achieve because of the paucity of role models, the increasing rate of unemployment, and the demonstration effect of the affluent lifestyle of members of the political class, many of whom made it big with little or no formal education. Thus a get-rich-quick mentality has built up. How can university students be motivated to take <italic>learning for its sake</italic> in the midst of the hedonistic, particularly, the sinecure and the get-rich-quick culture? Future studies should explore this area.</p>
