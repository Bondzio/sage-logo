<abstract>
<p>We conducted exit interviews with a random sample of 39 predominantly Central American immigrant mothers who had completed a longitudinal randomized controlled trial to prevent perinatal depression. We found that rates and levels of perinatal depression in the intervention and control groups were lower than expected and did not differ between groups at 1 year postpartum. Therefore, we conducted extensive semistructured interviews to (a) understand why these high-risk women had such low rates of major depressive episodes and depressive symptoms, and (b) determine if the mechanisms responsible for reductions in depression differed between the intervention and usual care groups. We discovered that the intervention group learned specific mood-management skills from their participation in the intervention, and that the control group experienced their participation in the study as a “low-dose” intervention. Our experience highlights the importance of conducting qualitative studies to understand quantitative outcomes of intervention studies.</p>

<p>Women in their childbearing years are at an increased risk of developing depression in the perinatal (i.e., pregnancy to first year postpartum) period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313482591">Horowitz &amp; Goodman, 2004</xref>). The most consistent risk factors associated with perinatal depression include a psychiatric history of depression or anxiety, limited or inadequate social support, poor quality of the relationship with a partner, and life and childcare stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313482591">Beck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313482591">Lancaster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313482591">O’Hara &amp; Swain, 1996</xref>). Although these risk factors can be identified, few women actually receive screening and/or treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313482591">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313482591">Liberto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313482591">Price &amp; Proctor, 2009</xref>), suggesting the need to focus on preventing perinatal depression.</p>
<p>Low-income, ethnic minority, immigrant women might be at an even higher risk than majority populations for perinatal depression given their specific socioeconomic and migration circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313482591">Collins, Zimmerman, &amp; Howard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313482591">Gress-Smith, Luecken, Lemery-Chalfant, &amp; Howe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313482591">Horowitz, Murphy, Gregory, &amp; Wojcik, 2010</xref>). Research has shown that women who have recently immigrated to the United States demonstrate a 3- to 5-fold increase in depressive symptoms after giving birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482591">Stewart, Gagnon, Saucier, Wahoush, &amp; Dougherty, 2008</xref>). Moreover, Latina immigrants who have left their children in their home country are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from major depression than those who live with their children in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482591">Miranda, Siddique, Der-Martirosian, &amp; Belin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group and the largest minority group in the United States, comprising more than 16% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313482591">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). The Latina immigrant experience is complicated by many stressors. Among these are poor social support and stressful life events, which can increase the likelihood of developing perinatal depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482591">Teng, Blackmore, &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>). Additionally, Latina immigrant mothers face multiple stressors that are particular to the immigrant experience, including severing ties with family and friends, experiences of discrimination in the new country, language barriers, and a lack of financial and social resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313482591">Hovey &amp; Magana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482591">Miranda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313482591">Paris, 2008</xref>). In particular, some mothers experience significant feelings of guilt and distress associated with leaving their children behind, a phenomenon known as “international mothering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313482591">Benería, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313482591">Hondagneu-Sotelo &amp; Avila, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482591">Horton, 2009</xref>). These factors might also impede their ability to identify and/or seek appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Given the higher prevalence of perinatal depression in low-income communities of color, issues of stigma, and other barriers to seeking treatment, we argue for an increased focus on preventing depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al. (2007)</xref> developed and pilot-tested a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention to prevent postpartum depression in a sample of 41 predominantly Mexican immigrant women at high risk for depression. The intervention, the <italic>Mamás y Bebés/Mothers and Babies Course</italic> (MB Course), was a 12-week culturally and linguistically tailored group intervention conducted during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al., 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313482591">2001b</xref>). There were also four individual booster sessions in the first year postpartum (months 1, 3, 6, and 12) to review the core concepts in the MB Course and to address any concerns that women had postbirth. The researchers found that 14% of women in the intervention condition developed major depressive episodes, compared to 25% in the usual care condition.</p>
<p>Based on the promising findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al. (2007)</xref>, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313482591">Le, Perry, &amp; Stuart, 2011</xref>) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of preventing perinatal depression in a larger sample of 217 predominantly Central American women. Similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al. (2007)</xref> study, participants who met demographic criteria for eligibility and endorsed high risk for depression—defined as scoring 16 or higher on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313482591">Radloff, 1977</xref>) and/or with a self-reported personal or family history of depression—were recruited from prenatal care and randomized into the study.</p>
<p>Because the majority of the participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al. (2007)</xref> study were not able to complete all of the sessions (<italic>M</italic> = 6.7, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.8 sessions in the MB Course; <italic>M</italic> = 1.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.1 booster sessions), we decided to shorten the MB course from 12 to 8 sessions, and the booster sessions were reduced from four to three, to increase the likelihood of full participation. Through focus groups and informant interviews with staff and clients in the Washington, DC area, we retained the core CBT model that integrated parenting and child development concepts while simultaneously adapting the intervention to address the needs of the predominantly Central American women in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313482591">Le, Zmuda, Perry, &amp; Muñoz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample consisted of 217 participants randomized to two groups: 112 were assigned to the intervention (INT) group, and 105 were assigned to the usual care (UC) group. Women in the INT group participated in the 8-week MB group course during pregnancy and received three individual booster sessions during the first year postpartum. The main content covered in the MB Course is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732313482591">Table 1</xref>. Women in the UC group received their usual standard of care from their health care provider and were provided with information on locally available social services on request. Five interviews (two during pregnancy and three in the first year postpartum at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months) were completed at either the community health clinic or in the participant’s home. During each of these interviews, participants completed questionnaires evaluating (a) their current mood (depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes) and anxiety symptoms, (b) risk factors associated with perinatal depression, and (c) the mother–infant relationship.</p>

<p>Research assistants were bilingual and/or bicultural women trained to be culturally sensitive in working with a low-income population. To increase participant engagement, the research assistants conveyed <italic>personalism</italic> (focusing on building a personal relationship with the participant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313482591">Burk, Wieser, &amp; Keegan, 1995</xref>) and respect during phone conversations and face-to-face interactions, without time constraints, regardless of group assignment. We conducted extensive follow-up efforts to retain participants during the study course, including (a) reminder calls for interviews and/or classes, (b) reminder postcards for upcoming intervention classes and interviews, (c) birthday cards for the babies and Mother’s Day cards, (d) obtaining updated contact information at each follow-up interview, (e) small incentives for mothers and babies, and (f) taking pictures and videotapes of mothers and their babies at each interview. At the end of the study, mothers received a photo album of these pictures, and a videotape. Following the conclusion of the study, we invited all participants and their babies to a reunion party as an opportunity for participants to meet one another and their babies.</p>
<p>Intent-to-treat analyses indicate that participants in the INT condition had significantly lower depressive symptoms than participants in the UC condition, and fewer cases of moderate depression immediately after the intervention. Depressive symptoms also decreased significantly from pregnancy to the postpartum period for women in both the INT and UC groups, but there were no differences between the two groups at any of the three postpartum time points. The cumulative incidence of major depressive episodes was 7.8% and 9.6% for the women in the INT and UC groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313482591">Le et al., 2011</xref>). Although these incidence rates were not significantly different between the experimental conditions, they were considerably lower than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482591">Muñoz et al.’s (2007)</xref> study (14% and 25% for women in the INT and UC groups, respectively). They were also significantly lower than what would be expected in high-risk, low-income populations, in which rates of high depressive symptoms can be as high as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313482591">Administration for Children, Youth, and Families, 2006</xref>), and rates of clinical depression can range from 18% to 35% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313482591">Le, Muñoz, Soto, Delucchi, &amp; Ghosh Ippen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As community-based prevention researchers, we found the lack of significant differences between the INT and UC groups to be perplexing and disappointing. We implemented the CBT intervention with good fidelity and believed that the INT group was benefiting from these techniques. Also, given the fact that we had recruited an established high-risk group, the low rates of major depressive episodes and depressive symptoms for women in the control group were particularly surprising. As a result, we undertook an extensive series of exit interviews with participants in both groups. Our goal was to better understand participants’ overall experiences with our research project, and we hoped that these qualitative interviews could shed light on the lack of differences in depression between the women in the INT and UC groups. The primary research question was: Why did these reportedly high-risk women have such low rates of depression and depressive symptoms? Additionally, we wanted to determine if the mechanisms for reductions in depressive symptoms and incidence rates of major depressive episodes were qualitatively different for participants in the INT and UC groups.</p>

<title>Exit Interviews</title>
<p>We conducted semistructured individual interviews with a randomly selected subsample of 39 participants from the larger RCT after they completed their last interviews. We stratified the list of women who completed the interviews at 12 months postpartum (<italic>n</italic> = 150) to ensure an equal number of participants from three groups. Women who were originally randomized into the INT group were divided into two strata: (a) women who attended at least four of the eight MB classes were considered “completers” (MBC), and (b) those who attended less than four MB classes were considered “noncompleters” (MBNC). Women assigned to the UC group formed the third strata. Sixty women (20 per group) were contacted, and 39 women agreed to participate, including 16 women in the MBC group, 8 in the MBNC group, and 15 in the UC group. Participation in the exit interviews was voluntary, and women received $20 for taking part.</p>
<p>A bilingual (Spanish/English) and bicultural interviewer conducted the exit interviews; she had not participated as a member of the research team during the active phase of the RCT. The interviews lasted between 30 and 120 minutes. The interviewer conducted all of the interviews in Spanish, either at the community health clinic, by phone, or at the participant’s home. The Institutional Review Board at the first author’s institution provided approval for the study.</p>
<p>Participants consented for the interviews to be audiotaped. The interview questions were related to the participants’ general experiences with the research project, and we tailored the questions to reflect their intervention group status (i.e., MBC, MBNC, and UC). Examples of questions we posed to all participants included: What do you remember most about the MB project? What did you like least about the MB project? In addition, we asked the women in the MBC group to provide feedback on their experience in participating in the MB course and booster sessions (e.g., What did you like most about the MB classes? What would you recommend that the class leaders do the same and differently in future classes?). Finally, we asked the women in the MBNC group to discuss the barriers and facilitators to attending group sessions (e.g., Why was it difficult for you to complete the classes?

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A team of bilingual research assistants transcribed the interviews verbatim and transferred these transcriptions to a qualitative analysis software package QSR NVivo 8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313482591">Bazeley, 2007</xref>). We used NVivo to sort and label categories and subcategories from which themes emerged. Given our desire to understand why the women in the INT and UC groups had low depression rates and symptoms at the end of the study, we used a basic inductive and comparative analysis strategy to analyze the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313482591">Merriam, 2009</xref>). This strategy allowed us the flexibility to categorize themes that emerged from the data.</p>
<p>A series of steps were taken in data analysis. First, three bilingual and bicultural researchers read all the transcripts several times to gain an awareness of the initial themes that arose from the interviews. Second, two of the three researchers developed a codebook based on these initial themes. We used the same codebook for all interviews regardless of group assignment to allow for between-group comparisons. Third, the three coders participated in weekly consensus meetings to discuss areas of disagreement, recode difficult sections of interviews together, compare the data across participants, and refine coding themes. After the researchers discussed all discrepancies within each interview, they created a final version of each interview to analyze themes across interviews. Ultimately, this led to the development of the model in which we describe how the themes were related to each other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313482591">Figure 1</xref>, as described below).</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>At the time of the exit interviews, the women were relatively young (<italic>M</italic> = 27.82, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.88), had completed less than 9 years of formal education (<italic>M</italic> = 8.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.07), and were mostly married/partnered (61.5%) and had an unplanned index pregnancy (74.4%). Approximately half (53.8%) of the women were immigrants from El Salvador and another third were from Central and South American countries. They had an average of two children (<italic>M</italic> = 1.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.19), and a significant minority of the women (23.1%) had children living in their home country at the time of the exit interview. The mean age of the index child at the time of the exit interview was approximately 19 months (<italic>M</italic> = 18.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.9). More than two thirds of the women (69.4%) had a personal history of depression and more than one fifth of the women (23.1%) were experiencing significant depressive symptoms at baseline (e.g., scored 16 or above on the CES-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313482591">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Overall, there were no statistically significant differences across the three groups in any of the demographic variables. Women in the MBC group participated in an average of seven of the eight class sessions, and most attended all three booster sessions. The women interviewed from the MBNC group attended an average of two sessions. The mean number of months between the last interview (at 12 months postpartum) and the exit interview was 6.6.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results section is divided into two main parts, both aimed at understanding the mechanisms for low rates of depressive symptoms evident in the women in our study. In the first part, we explore the experiences of all of the participants, with a special focus on the specific experiences of women in the UC group (reflected in the upper portions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313482591">Figure 1</xref>). In the second part, we focus on the particular experiences of women in the INT group who participated in the CBT classes and booster sessions. In particular, we highlight the experiences of the women in the MBC group as the participants who attended at least four of the eight classes (represented in the lower portions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313482591">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Overall Experience of Being in the Study</title>
<p>All of the women reported that being a part of the MB research study had a significant impact on them. Across the three groups, the women described their relationships with the research team as a critical aspect of their participation. Participants also spoke about their perceptions of the questionnaires as well as the photos and videos taken during the study period. In the following sections, we highlight the participants’ general experiences of being in the study, with an emphasis on the experience of women in the UC group to determine if their experiences were qualitatively different from women in the INT group.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732313482591">
<title>Experience of All Participants</title>
<sec id="section8-1049732313482591">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>Participants completed many questionnaires measuring a variety of psychosocial constructs (e.g., social support, depressive symptoms, and mood regulation skills) during each interview, and most of these questionnaires were repeated in all five interviews. Women in all three groups reported that the questionnaires provided them with an opportunity to reflect on their mood state. However, for participants in the UC group, the administration of the questionnaires was also an opportunity for the women to gain knowledge of themselves. Some of these women reported that they learned techniques to improve their mood from exposure to related items on the questionnaires:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant (P):</speaker>
<p>The questions asked were very interesting . . . like about people’s mental health . . . and I enjoyed participating because I didn’t have any experience being a mother and I lacked knowledge regarding people’s moods. Sometimes people would ask me about my mood and I would agree or disagree with what they were asking me. I would think, “This must be normal.” So, yes, participating in this project helped me a lot.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer (I):</speaker>
<p>So, looking at your mood helped you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>Yes, when I became aware of my mood and I realized that what I had was not something bad . . . what I really had . . . was low self-esteem. For example . . . through the questions they usually asked us, it is always a good idea to go somewhere or to go shopping; it helps you relax.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732313482591">
<title>Videos and photos</title>
<p>Across groups, participants had a generally positive response to having photos taken and being videotaped throughout the study. Some women (<italic>n</italic> = 11; 5 UC, 6 INT) stated that videotaping made them feel self-conscious or nervous, but the majority of women who were filmed enjoyed the experience. They also liked having documentation of their participation that they could return to at any time. A few women commented on how nice it was to have a recording of their children, as it allowed them to reflect on how much their children had grown since their participation in the MB Project. There were no differences across groups in this theme. When asked why she liked having the video, one woman responded,<disp-quote>
<p>We [as parents] always see our children as little. It is always the same child, always the same, and we get used to him or her. We don’t notice any difference, but when you see the first videotape and the other one later on . . . you can say, “Yes, she grew a lot.” You may not see the change as much yourself, but you do see it in a video.</p>

<sec id="section10-1049732313482591">
<title>The MB Team and Relationships With the MB Team</title>
<p>The experience of being in the study led participants to form important relationships with the MB research team. All participants, regardless of group, reported that team members were very supportive and checked in on them frequently. As a result, they felt special and felt like they had someone who cared about what they were going through. Many participants stated that the team members understood their experiences and listened to their stories. The women described differing levels of intimacy with the research team based on their level of participation in the study. Women in the UC group referred to the team members as people with whom they could openly talk and who would listen to them when they had limited social support:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would talk to her and would tell her all my personal matters. The Mothers and Babies [project] was helpful: being able to talk to someone and listen to the advice they always give me. This is an unfamiliar country for us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Compared to women in the UC group, the MBNC group members seemed to feel closer to the research team, often referring to them as “friends.” Specifically, the MB team provided these women with space to vent and served as a valuable support network. Finally, women in the MBC group appeared to have the most intimate relationships with team members, frequently describing their connections with team members as if they were kin. Participants in the MBC group would reference not having family in the United States and expressed a sense that certain team members seemed to fill this void. For example, a participant in the MBC group reported,<disp-quote>
<p>My daughter’s father didn’t understand me. I have a family but sometimes it feels as if I didn’t have any. At the project, they understood me. . . . I found a family with the people from the project and I liked that a lot. But I couldn’t have done it differently because I felt comfortable with those women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was in contrast to participants in the MBNC group, who significantly valued the relationship but regarded the MB team as separate from family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732313482591">
<title>Awareness of Mood and Self</title>
<p>As a result of being in the study, participants reported developing more awareness of their mood and their parenting ability. Additionally, they reported feeling less isolated in their lives.</p>
<sec id="section12-1049732313482591">
<title>Awareness of postpartum depression</title>
<p>Across groups, the majority of women noted that participating in the study made them more aware of their mood, and this helped to normalize their depressive experience. This was comforting for the participants because it made them feel less isolated in their depression. In addition, all participants reported acquiring knowledge about postpartum depression and its associated symptoms. There were group differences in this theme. Women who participated in the MB classes referenced the CBT tools they had obtained to manage their depressive symptoms. Participants in the UC group also gained an awareness of postpartum depression (PPD) as a result of their participation in the study in contrast to women in the MBC group, the former did not acquire specific tools to improve their depressed mood. One woman in the UC group reported,<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it [PPD] is more common than we think. Yes, because sometimes we think it is laziness but it isn’t. Sometimes we may be going through a depression and we don’t want to get out of bed and take care of the baby, and it is because of this condition. This is something that happens to women. After being involved in this project . . . it became more real to me. . . . It also helped me become aware and pay attention to everything that is going on when we’ve just had a baby.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732313482591">
<title>Increased maternal efficacy</title>
<p>Overall, women reported that their participation in the study helped them better understand the importance of their role as mothers. Across groups, there was a notable shift in these women’s sense of maternal self-efficacy after completing the study. Thus, they not only learned more about parenting but also about the value of being a mother. Although the MBC and MBNC participants more frequently referenced the parenting skills they had acquired on account of their participation in the intervention, participants in the UC group spoke more broadly about becoming increasingly conscious of their role as mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732313482591">
<title>Decreased isolation</title>
<p>One of the main themes that arose from the interviews was that all participants, regardless of group assignment, reported that being a part of the study decreased their sense of isolation. Participating in the project made the women feel cared for and expanded their support networks. For women in the INT group, this meant having a physical space—i.e., a place to go every week during the 8-week course. The weekly attendance provided women in the MBC group with an opportunity to leave their homes and engage with others, which might have led them to feel less alone and less isolated in their communities. Having a physical space to go to also helped decrease their depressive symptoms. A woman in the MBC group reported,<disp-quote>
<p>Before my experience with the project I was desperate, alone. I didn’t know too many people here and I didn’t have any friends. But when I started meeting people here I felt better . . . when attending the prenatal classes. I felt I could relate to them. I felt relieved when I talked to them about what I was thinking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the women in the MBNC group did not attend as many of the classes as the women in the MBC group, some reported enjoying the group experience, whereas others preferred home visits in which booster sessions took place. These participants reported that they, too, were comforted by the knowledge that there was someone they could talk to when they were feeling down. In contrast, participating in the study did not provide the UC group with a physical space to go to (a classroom); however, team members’ consistent presence in their lives made them feel less alone and more important through the many contacts they had with the research team. A woman in the UC group noted,<disp-quote>
<p>Listening to them made us feel important . . . that was important . . . because, like I always say, many people may be in the same situation as me. For example, I don’t have any family in this country. . . . So, I think, here there are probably many women who need someone to listen to them and make them feel important.</p>

<title>The Intervention Group Experiences</title>
<p>Overall, participants in the INT group enjoyed the MB classes. Through the course material, participants learned a great deal about the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and acquired mood management skills. Participants also applied what they learned to their daily lives, resulting in improved relationships. Finally, women commented on how valuable the group experience was: Sharing within the group helped normalize their depressive symptoms and provided them with an opportunity to obtain feedback from women who had similar life experiences. Given that these observations confirmed our hypotheses of the effects of the CBT intervention on reducing depression outcomes, the sections below are purposefully not exhaustive.</p>

<sec id="section17-1049732313482591">
<title>Learn CBT content</title>
<p>Women in the MBC group were quite articulate about the main CBT concepts they learned in the MB classes, including an increased understanding of the connection between mood and (a) thoughts, (b) pleasant activities, and (c) their relationships with others. These constructs make up the three modules of the MB course. One woman, for example, reported being able to put these skills into practice:<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever I feel sad or depressed, I try to think about something nice, something that makes me feel happy. I learned all that there [in the MB classes]. I also learned to do something useful whenever I felt depressed or didn’t feel like doing anything. Taking a bath, looking at life with optimism, thinking positive thoughts, and leaving behind unpleasant thoughts and people whose company doesn’t help us improve our mood.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732313482591">
<title>Learn child development content</title>
<p>Some of the women in the MBC group mentioned the importance of a child’s first 3 years of life, as was first introduced in the initial class through the “My Parents, My Teachers” video. They recognized that this time marks a critical window of development for a child. The facilitators repeated these core messages throughout the 8-week course:<disp-quote>
<p>When they showed us the video about the children, they explained to us that the first 3 years are the most important years for a child because during that time they assimilate, learn, and develop their intelligence, and it is the time when they can be active. I really liked that because I didn’t know about it. We can also give them a bath and talk to them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732313482591">
<title>The group experience</title>
<p>Through the experience of being in the group, women shared personal stories about having children in their home countries, sharing food, being pregnant, and living as an immigrant in Washington, DC. Women felt they had a safe place to talk about their struggles as mothers and immigrants:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember most of the meetings when we spent time together. We were five or seven in the meetings, and we all shared our concerns and experiences because . . . we learned that we were not the only ones who have a problem. Many of them had problems with their parents and others with their spouses. We helped each other a lot. When I listened to my friends’ problems, I understood that I wasn’t the only one who has problems.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732313482591">
<title>Applied MB Techniques</title>
<p>In addition to the specific content knowledge the women gained through the shared group experience, participants in the MBC group were able to describe how they applied this content to their day-to-day lives. Women spoke about specific techniques they used, including cognitive coping strategies (i.e., cognitive restructuring) learned in class to manage their internal and external realities. They also mentioned actively engaging in daily activities (i.e., behavioral activation) and improving communication as a means to strengthen their interpersonal relationships.</p>
<sec id="section21-1049732313482591">
<title>Using specific tools</title>
<p>Participants discussed using various cognitive behavioral tools to manage their mood and stress. For example, women in the MBC group emphasized the usefulness of the mood thermometer, the cartoon vignettes that were presented each week, and the use of relaxation exercises in their daily lives. Some women reported that the mood thermometer provided them with the opportunity to monitor their daily mood and related this to their thoughts or activities; for example:<disp-quote>
<p>[The mood thermometer] was a good tool because it helped us remember what to do when we felt discouraged. When we said we were [feeling] at “four,” we would explain why it was so low. And if we reached “eight,” we would also explain why. Then, we would say things like, “Because I went for a walk to the park with my husband. We went to eat at a restaurant.” . . . If we were at “two,” we would say, “I didn’t get up at all today. I was in bed but then I said to myself, ‘I will get up because I can’t stay in bed. I am going to take a bath.’”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732313482591">
<title>Behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring</title>
<p>Participants in the MBC group reported that they frequently applied the CBT techniques they learned in class to their own personal realities. Several women reported engaging in positive thinking. For example, they expressed feeling optimistic even when faced with adverse and stressful life events. Additionally, women in the MBC group mentioned engaging in pleasant activities to improve their depressed mood. Many endorsed going out, shopping, going to the park, or listening to their favorite music when they experienced depressive symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732313482591">
<title>Improved communication skills</title>
<p>Women in the MBC group described how their communication skills changed as a result of participating in the intervention. Specifically, these women were better able to consider their own feelings and emotions before reacting negatively to a stressful situation. Participants also reported seeking more support from friends and family. As a result, their relationships with others improved because they learned to better communicate and seek support when feeling depressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1049732313482591">
<title>Improved parenting strategies</title>
<p>After watching the “My Parents, My Teachers” video, women recognized how nurturing is critical to their child’s healthy development during the first 3 years of life. Women reported that as a result of this enhanced awareness, they changed their parenting strategies. For example, some women reported engaging in activities to improve their relationship with their baby:<disp-quote>
<p>Many of the things I do with her, I never did with my other child when he was little. For example, talking, singing. There are many things we can do with them. That the first three years are the most important ones! That has really made an impact on me. I know that all ages are important for a child, but the first three years are the most important ones.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At the end of our prevention trial, very few women had high rates of clinical depression or levels of depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313482591">Le et al., 2011</xref>). We utilized a sequential mixed methods approach to elucidate why these reportedly high-risk women demonstrated such low rates of depression and depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313482591">Creswell, Klassen, Plano Clark, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>). Through the use of an inductive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313482591">Merriam, 2009</xref>), we gained insights into the reasons for reductions in depressive symptoms and incidence rates of major depressive episodes and how these differed for women in the INT and UC groups. In essence, our “qualitative data help to explain in more depth the mechanisms underlying the quantitative results” (Creswell et al., p. 8).</p>
<p>In our quantitative study, we had hypothesized that the low rates of major depressive episodes for women in the INT group were because of the high-risk pregnant women learning cognitive behavioral techniques during the 8 weeks of group classes. These skills were reinforced through three booster sessions in the first year postpartum. This hypothesis was confirmed through the qualitative analysis. In particular, the participants in the MBC group clearly articulated the CBT content they had learned, and they described specific ways they had used these approaches to reduce the effects of stress on their mood and thoughts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313482591">Figure 1</xref>). Learning and applying specific cognitive and behavioral tools led to an improvement of relationships with their partners and families; this resulted in a decrease in their overall depressive symptoms and incidence rates of major depressive episodes.</p>
<p>We also found the exit interviews useful in elucidating the mechanisms that led to a comparable reduction in depressive symptoms and episodes in the “usual care” group. These women described their experience of participating in the prevention RCT as highly impactful. The close personal relationships they formed with the research team through their five in-depth interviews reduced their sense of isolation and provided them with an opportunity for connection to another caring person. In addition, the repeated administration of the multiple psychosocial questionnaires had an unintended consequence of imparting new knowledge to the women: They reported gaining insights about their mood, sources of social support, the quality of their relationship with their spouse or partner, and even specific mood-regulation skills. Through their interactions with the bilingual, bicultural, highly sensitive research team, their sense of efficacy as postpartum mothers was reinforced. Thus, the UC group experienced their participation in the study as what could be considered a “low-dose,” home-based, individualized intervention.</p>
<p>Community-based researchers often use qualitative approaches in the formative stages of a project to learn about the culture and context, and to gain insight into the unique strengths and risk factors of populations they seek to serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313482591">Wagner, Swenson, Henggeler, 2000</xref>). Indeed, our team has benefited greatly from the analysis of focus groups and key informant interviews as we have adapted the MB course for different populations of Spanish-speaking pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313482591">Le et al., 2010</xref>); but fewer researchers use qualitative methods to explore the outcomes of randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only one team of researchers has published their exit analyses as a means to understand their outcome data in perinatal depression prevention research. After evaluating the efficacy of an intervention designed to prevent postpartum depression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482591">Wheatley, Brugha, and Shapiro (2003)</xref> conducted exit interviews with a small sample of study participants as a means of explicating their fairly low rates of compliance. This was an RCT with a sample of 9 expectant mothers, 4 of whom were compliant with the intervention and had attended at least three sessions in total, 4 who failed to attend at least three sessions, and 1 who had declined the invitation to participate in the intervention. The authors reported on a number of themes that emerged from the exit interviews, which were central to maintaining engagement.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482591">Wheatley et al.’s (2003)</xref> study, women reported enjoying the experience of sharing with others, respect and appreciation for the course leaders, the utility of the material within the context of one’s everyday life, and a heightened knowledge or awareness that there were other women who struggled with depression following childbirth. Of note, participants shared that the information they received about postpartum depression was not only useful, but also helpful in gaining confidence as future mothers. Furthermore, participants’ responses during the exit interviews highlighted the value of discussing personal experiences within a group setting, as many suggested that even more time be allocated to open discussion, personal revelation, and sharing in the future. These themes were echoed by the findings in our study.</p>
<p>The issues raised in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482591">Wheatley et al. (2003)</xref> interviews are also central to our experience as prevention scientists. To combat the likelihood of high losses to follow-up and attrition in the high-risk, low-income, immigrant sample, we undertook extensive efforts to maintain client engagement for women in the INT and UC groups. We implemented an intentionally relationship-based approach to our retention efforts by assigning the same research assistant to conduct interviews with participants whenever possible. In addition, we sent personalized Mother’s Day and holiday cards. Even the photos and videos that we gave to participants at the conclusion of their participation in the study had the effect of cementing our relationship with these women. Several women told us that these were the only photographs and videos they had of themselves during pregnancy and of their babies. Yet our efforts to reduce attrition had the paradoxical effect of serving as an intervention for the women in the UC group, which led to a failure to detect long-term differences in depression between the treatment and control groups.</p>
<p>The demographic characteristics of the participants in our study might have contributed to their receptivity to the social support provided by our research team. Nearly all of the participants were young, recently immigrated women who spoke primarily Spanish. Most of their pregnancies were unplanned, and many women were considered “international mothers” as a result of leaving their children behind in their home countries in Central and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313482591">Benería, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313482591">Hondagneu-Sotelo &amp; Avila, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482591">Horton, 2009</xref>). Their lack of extended family and general social isolation could have made them more dependent on the caring and concern shown by our research team, especially during the period of pregnancy and the transition to the postpartum period.</p>
<p>These participants were also highly resilient individuals who had overcome great adversity to establish lives for themselves in the United States; some emigrated from countries where there have been civil wars, and many were exposed to childhood trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313482591">Asner-Self &amp; Marotta, 2005</xref>). Because of our recruitment strategy, all of these women were also enrolled in high-quality prenatal care, many during their first trimester. In addition, most were receiving other supportive services from the federally qualified health center and hospital settings where they were obtaining prenatal care. These factors might have contributed to a reduction in their risk for perinatal depression, despite the fact that they either had a personal or family history of depression or screened high on the CES-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313482591">Radloff, 1977</xref>) at baseline.</p>
<p>These findings should be interpreted with some caution. Although we had a relatively large sample for qualitative work, these women might not be representative of other high-risk, low-income, perinatal populations. Indeed, they might not even be representative of the entire sample, because we had a lower rate of participation from women in the MBNC group relative to the other groups. Indeed, the randomly selected sample from the exit interviews differed from the larger sample who participated in the RCT on several variables, including the average number of years living in the United States. The women who consented to the exit interviews had been in the United States for a lesser number of years. In addition, a smaller proportion of these women endorsed high depressive symptoms only, and both high depressive symptoms and/or history of depression than the larger RCT sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732313482591">2</xref></sup> Women who were lost to follow-up were not included in the sampling frame for our exit interviews, and their perceptions of the project’s impact likely differ from those of the women who remained in the study past the first year postpartum.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest that for some high-risk perinatal women, a less intensive intervention could ameliorate the effects of stress on their mental health and well-being. This approach is supported by evidence from a review of in-home preventive interventions for postpartum depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313482591">Leis, Mendelson, Tandon, &amp; Perry, 2009</xref>). These authors reported that “nondirective counseling” or “listening sessions” were effective in reducing rates of depressive symptoms and disorder in women who met criteria for major or minor depression in the postpartum period.</p>
<p>Our experience with this trial underscores the need to better integrate evidence-based preventive interventions into nonstigmatizing settings such as home visiting programs, prenatal care (such as Centering Pregnancy programs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313482591">Carlson &amp; Lowe, 2006</xref>), and Early Head Start programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313482591">Administration on Children, Youth, and Families, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313482591">Tandon, Perry, Mendelson, Kemp, and Leis (2011)</xref> reported promising results from their efforts to integrate a 6-week version of the MB course adapted for low-income, African American perinatal populations. Their findings bolster our conclusion that the women in the INT group benefited directly from the CBT techniques they learned in the classes. Given the high costs of perinatal depression on mothers, children, and their families, combined with barriers to treatment encountered by many high-risk women, promising preventive interventions should be expanded. Our results suggest that a small increase in social support and mental health content can lead to improved outcomes for perinatal women and their families.</p>
