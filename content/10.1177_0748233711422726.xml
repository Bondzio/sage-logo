<abstract>
<p>Female mice were exposed maternally to clothianidin through diet at levels of 0% (control), 0.002%, 0.006%, and 0.018% during gestation and lactation periods. Selected reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters were measured in F<sub>1</sub> generation. There was no adverse effect of clothianidin on litter size, litter weight, or sex ratio at birth. The average body weight of male and female offspring was increased significantly in a dose-related manner during the lactation period. With respect to behavioral developmental parameters, surface righting at postnatal day 7 of female offspring was accelerated significantly in a dose-related manner (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). For movement activity of exploratory behavior at 3 weeks of age, the average speed (cm/s) of male offspring increased significantly in a dose-related manner (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). With regard to spontaneous behavior in the F<sub>1</sub> generation, males showed more activity in some measured variables in the middle-dose group. The dose levels of clothianidin in the present study produced several adverse effects in the neurobehavioral parameters in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clothianidin, (<italic>E</italic>)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine is a neonicotinoid insecticide available as water-soluble powders, wettable powders, granules, and dusts. It is a broad-spectrum systemic insecticide and is effective on insect pest species such as hemipterans, thysanopterans, orthopterans, coleopterans, lepidopterans, dipterans, hymenopterans, and isopterans (Uneme et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711422726">2006</xref>). Clothianidin is registered for agricultural use on various fruits, vegetables, forage, and grain crops. Its permitted residue levels are 0.7 ppm in unpolished rice, 0.02 ppm in other grain crops, 0.1 ppm in soybeans, 0.02 ppm in peanuts, 0.3 ppm in other legumes, 0.3–5 ppm in drupes, 1–2 ppm in citrus fruits, 1 ppm in pome fruits, 0.02–1 ppm in tropical fruits, 0.02–0.7 ppm in berry fruits, 0.02–5 ppm in cruciferous vegetables, 0.02–0.25 ppm in potatoes, 0.02–2 ppm in cucurbitaceous vegetables, 0.02–20 ppm in composite vegetables, 0.02 ppm in fungi, 0.02–5 ppm in dropwort vegetables, 1–3 ppm in solanaceous vegetables, 0.02–15 ppm in liliaceous vegetables, 0.02–2 ppm in other vegetables, 0.01–0.02 ppm in oil seeds, 0.02 ppm in nuts and cocoa beans, 0.04 ppm in coffee beans, 50 ppm in tea leaves, and 0.02 ppm in cattle, goat, hog, horse, sheep, and poultry in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711422726">Food Hygienic Society of Japan, 2008</xref>). Clothianidin is used for expelling termites in housing. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans has been set at 0.097 mg/kg body weight (bw) in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711422726">Japan Food Safety Commission, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In toxicological studies of clothianidin (Sumitomo Chemical Takeda Agro Company, Ltd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422726">2003</xref>), its oral and dermal median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) in rats exceeded 5000 mg/kg bw and 2000 mg/kg bw, respectively. The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in male and female mice was 389 mg/kg bw and 465 mg/kg bw, respectively. In 90-day oral toxicity studies, the nonobserved adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 500 ppm in male and female rats (approximately 27.9 mg/kg bw/day and 34.0 mg/kg bw/day, respectively), and the corresponding value in male and female dogs was 650 ppm (approximately 19.3 mg/kg bw/day and 21.2 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). In a chronic and carcinogenic study in rats, it showed no carcinogenic effects, and NOAELs in male and female rats were 500 ppm (approximately 27.4 mg/kg bw/day) and 150 ppm (approximately 9.7 mg/kg bw/day), respectively. It produced no carcinogenic effects in mice, and NOAEL in male and female mice was 350 ppm (approximately 47.2 mg/kg bw/day and 65.1 mg/kg bw/day, respectively).</p>
<p>With respect to reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (Sumitomo Chemical Takeda Agro Company, Ltd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422726">2003</xref>), clothianidin showed no teratogenicity after administration on days 6–19 of gestation in rats (10–125 mg/kg bw/day) and NOAELs were 10 mg/kg bw/day in maternal effects (decrease in body weight gain and food consumption) and 125 mg/kg bw/day in fetal effects (no effects). It also showed no teratogenicity in administration on days 6–28 of gestation in rabbits (10–100 mg/kg bw/day), and NOAELs were 10 mg/kg bw/day in maternal effects (decrease in defecation, colored urine, or maternal death) and 25 mg/kg bw/day in fetal effects (fetal death, decrease in fetal weight, or ossifying delay in sternebrae). In a two-generation toxicity study in rats, clothianidin produced no adverse effects in reproduction, and its NOAELs in male and female rats were 150 ppm in parental effects (approximately 9.8 mg/kg bw/day and 11.5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively) and 150 ppm in offspring effects (approximately 10.7 mg/kg bw/day and 12.2 mg/kg bw/day, respectively).</p>
<p>In neurotoxicity studies in rats (EPA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711422726">2003</xref>), clothianidin (&gt;100 mg/kg) decreased arousal, motor, and locomotor activities in the acute neurotoxicity study. In a subchronic neurotoxicity study, it had no adverse effects in neurotoxicity, and its NOAELs in male and female rats were 60.0 mg/kg bw/day and 71.0 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. It produced no adverse effects in the developmental neurotoxicity study, and its NOAELs were 42.9 mg/kg bw/day in maternal effects and 12.9 mg/kg bw/day in offspring effects.</p>
<p>The present study was designed to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of maternal clothianidin exposure, including measurement of spontaneous behavior, in mice of different generations.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0748233711422726">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Clothianidin was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd (Tokyo, Japan; Lot No. DPJ8171). The chemical characterization was “clothianidin standard for residual pesticide analysis,” and the purity was &gt;99.0%. The chemical stability of clothianidin is &gt;12 months at 25°C and &gt;6 months at 40°C (Uneme et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711422726">2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748233711422726">
<title>Animals and maintenance</title>
<p>Male and female mice (Crlj: CD1, 4 weeks of age) were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc (Kanagawa, Japan). They were housed individually in polycarbonate solid-floored cages with wood flakes and kept in a temperature-controlled room maintained at 25 ± 1°C at a relative humidity of 50 ± 5% on a 12-h light/dark cycle. They were given control diets and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> from 4 weeks of age to mating in the F<sub>0</sub> generation and after weaning in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Dams were given control or experimental diets and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> during the gestation and lactation periods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711422726">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>Clothianidin was administered through diet to 30 female mice (10 per group) at dietary levels of 0.002%, 0.006%, and 0.018%, during the gestation and lactation periods in the F<sub>0</sub> generation. The control group (10 female mice) was given basal diets (CE-2; Nihon Clea, Tokyo, Japan) for the corresponding time period. Experimental diets were prepared bimonthly (twice) in our laboratory. After mixing clothianidin with the powdered diet, pellets were formed and fed to mice. The stability of clothianidin was not tested in the pellets during the experimental period. The homogeneity of the test compound was ensured by the preparation procedures of the experimental diets in our laboratory when previously measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration and homogeneity of the test compound in the diet were not tested during the experimental period. Individual food intake of mice was measured during the following three periods: gestation (14 days), lactation (from birth to weaning), and F<sub>1</sub> generation (4 weeks to 11 weeks of age). Individual food intake (g/kg bw/day) was calculated as (the difference in feed weight between the previous and present week excepting the fallen lumps weight in cage)/(average body weight between the previous and present week)/days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0748233711422726">
<title>Reproductive procedure</title>
<p>Mice from the F<sub>0</sub> generation were 5 weeks of age at the start of the study. They were weighed individually on experimental days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30, during the preconception period. At 9 weeks of age, each female was paired with one male for 5 days. The females were examined for mating by appearance of the vaginal plug twice a day (morning and evening). The males were separated from females after 5 days. The females were then allowed to carry their litters to term, deliver, and rear all of their offspring. After mating, the dams were assigned to the groups by the stratified randomization method and given control or experimental diets during the gestation and lactation periods. The dams were weighed individually during the gestation (every day on weekdays) and lactation periods (once a week). The dams were examined for delivery at three times a day (morning, early afternoon, and evening).</p>
<p>At birth, live and dead offspring was counted and litter size, litter weight, and sex ratio (male:female) of live offspring were measured on postnatal day (PND) 0. Litter was not culled and all offspring were examined for test procedure. Offspring were individually weighed on PNDs 0, 4, 7, 14, and 21 during the lactation period. The survival indices were calculated as follows: (live offspring at each period)/(live and dead offspring at birth) × 100(%). Offspring were weaned when they were 4 weeks of age. One male and one female were randomly selected to continue treatment from each litter. Mice were weighed every week from 4 weeks to 11 weeks of age after weaning.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section10-0748233711422726">
<title>Cliff avoidance on PND 7</title>
<p>Offspring were placed on a platform elevated 10 cm above a tabletop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711422726">Altman and Sudarshan, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711422726">Fox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711422726">Pantaleoni et al., 1988</xref>). Forelimbs and snout were positioned such that the edge of the platform passed just behind an imaginary line drawn between the eye orbits. The following scoring system was employed: 0 = <italic>no response within 20 s</italic>; 1 = <italic>avoided backwards within 20 s</italic>; and 2 = <italic>avoiding with turn</italic>.</p>

<title>Olfactory orientation on PND 14</title>
<p>Offspring were placed into an arm connecting two compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711422726">Altman and Sudarshan, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711422726">Barlow et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711422726">Meyer and Hansen, 1980</xref>). One compartment was covered with “home” wood flakes (i.e., from their cages) and the other was covered with “fresh” wood flakes. The time required to enter the compartment with the home wood flakes was recorded. Olfactory orientation was scored for time taken (3 = <italic>entered the home wood flakes compartment within 30 s</italic>; 2 = <italic>entered within 60 s</italic>; 1 = <italic>entered within 90 s</italic>; and 0 = <italic>no response within 90 s</italic>) and for route (1 = <italic>entered the home wood flakes compartment via the fresh wood flakes compartment</italic> and 2 = <italic>entered the home wood flakes compartment directly</italic>).</p>
<p>The exploratory behavior of mice was measured in the animal movement analysis system SCANET CV-40 (Melquest Ltd, Toyama, Japan) on distance (DT) mode at 3 weeks and 8 weeks of age in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The system consisted of a rectangular cage (300 × 202 × 205 mm<sup>3</sup>) made from acrylate resins with two crossing sensor frames of 72 units of detectors of near-infrared photosensors for measuring spontaneous motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422726">Mikami et al., 2002</xref>). The behavioral parameters were recorded for 10 min on one male and one female mouse selected randomly from each litter at 3 weeks of age and on all mice at 8 weeks of age in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The measurement parameters on DT mode were as follows: total distance (cm), number of horizontal activities, movement time (s), number of rearing, rearing time (s), average time of movement (s), average speed (cm/s), average time of rearing (s), and number of defecations.</p>
<p>Each mouse underwent one trial per day for 3 days in a Biel-type multiple-T water maze adapted for mice at 7 weeks of age in the F<sub>1</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711422726">Biel, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711422726">Kitatani et al., 1988</xref>). Water temperature was maintained at 20 ± 1°C. The time taken and number of errors were measured from the start to finish for a maximum of 120 s. If the time taken was &gt;120 s, it was recorded as 120 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711422726">Kitatani et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The spontaneous behavior of mice was measured in the animal movement analyzing system SCANET CV-40 (Melquest Ltd) on DT mode from 9 weeks to 10 weeks of age in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The behavioral parameters were measured on all mice for 120 min at an interval of 10 min after 10-min latency. The measurement parameters were the same as those for exploratory behavior except for the number of defecations.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Food intake, litter size, litter weight, and body weight were assessed with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test after the analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal–Wallis test. Sex ratio, survival, and behavioral developmental data were assessed with the χ<sup>2</sup> test or the Fisher’s exact test of frequency analysis. Exploratory behavior data were assessed with the Steel–Dwass test of nonparametric methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711422726">Martin and Bateson, 1990</xref>). In spontaneous behavior data, the longitudinal pattern was assessed with the profile analysis in the parallelism hypothesis test, and variables at each point of time were assessed with the Steel–Dwass test within each treatment group. Multiple-T water maze performance data were assessed with the Sign–Wilcoxon test for trials and assessed with the Steel–Dwass test within each treatment group. Dose–response effects were assessed with the Jonckheere test for ordered alternatives or the cumulative χ<sup>2</sup> test (multi) for frequency data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, clothianidin produced some significant effects on reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters. The female offspring outnumbered the male offspring only in the 0.018% group (sex ratio: 0.75). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711422726">Tanaka (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711422726">2005</xref>) reported that the females sometimes outnumbered the males in control mice (sex ratio: &lt;0.75). It seems, therefore, that the effect on sex ratio is not caused by clothianidin treatment. The average body weight of male and female offspring showed a slightly dose-related acceleration during the lactation period in the trend test. Survival indices during the lactation period showed no significant difference between the control and treatment groups, and the average litter size during the lactation period for each group was similar. There was no difference related to the treatment with clothianidin on average food intake of dams during the gestation and lactation periods. The average body weight of dams showed no difference related to the treatment during the gestation and lactation periods. Therefore, these changes in offspring weight may have been caused by clothianidin treatment because offspring consumed similar nourishment in each group.</p>
<p>For the behavioral developmental parameters, surface righting in female offspring showed a significant tendency to be accelerated in treatment groups at PND 7. Therefore, it seems that the dose levels of clothianidin produced influences on surface righting, indicative of development of coordinated movement, in female offspring during the early lactation period. Swimming direction at PND 7 and time taken for olfactory orientation at PND 14 showed a significant acceleration in the middle-dose group. These influences may have been caused by increased body weights in treatment groups because the body weight of female offspring showed a significantly dose-related acceleration during the lactation period. Nevertheless, male offspring showed no influence on behavioral development during the lactation period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711422726">Tanaka (2004</xref>) reported that behavioral developments during the lactation period were not influenced by offspring weight under natural conditions. Therefore, it seems that the dose levels of clothianidin produced influences on these variables of behavioral development in female offspring during the lactation period.</p>
<p>For movement activity, the average speed (cm/s) of male offspring showed a significant tendency to be increased in treatment groups for exploratory behavior in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. In adult females, the average time of rearing (s) showed a significant depression in the middle-dose group for exploratory behavior in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. For spontaneous behavior of the F<sub>1</sub> generation, total distance (cm), number of horizontal activities, movement time (s), average speed (cm/s), average time of movement (s), rearing time (s), and average time of rearing (s) were significantly active at and after 100 min in the middle-dose group in adult males. Nevertheless, there was no difference related to the treatment with clothianidin on any variables in adult females. Therefore, it seems that the middle dose of clothianidin produced more activities for spontaneous behavior in adult male mice of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The effects of clothianidin on the central nervous system may cause these changes on movement activities because clothianidin was observed to be concentrated in the brain after oral and intravenous administration in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711422726">Yokota et al., 2003</xref>). These effects on exploratory and spontaneous behavior after weaning may be caused by the irreversible changes in the central nervous system because clothianidin treatment was stopped at weaning.</p>
<p>In the F<sub>1</sub> generation, a few variables of exploratory behavior for a novel environment showed a slight tendency to be active in treatment groups in male offspring and showed a significant depression in the middle-dose group of adult females. The spontaneous behavior was significantly active in the middle-dose group in adult male mice of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Therefore, it seems that sensitivity for clothianidin is dependent on sex in mice. The dose levels of clothianidin in the present study produced several adverse effects on neurobehavioral parameters in mice. The middle dose of clothianidin produced significant adverse effects on exploratory and spontaneous behavior in F<sub>1</sub> generation mice. The middle-dose level (equivalent to 9–33 mg/kg bw/day) was based on the current ADI of clothianidin (0.097 mg/kg bw). The estimated daily intake of clothianidin is presumed to be much lower, approximately 3.91 μg/kg bw/day in the national average, 6.65 μg/kg bw/day in infants (1–6 years of age), 3.38 μg/kg bw/day in pregnant women, and 4.05 μg/kg bw/day in senior citizens (&gt;65 years of age), in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711422726">Japan Food Safety Commission, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it would appear that the levels of the dietary intake of clothianidin are unlikely to produce adverse effects in humans.</p>
