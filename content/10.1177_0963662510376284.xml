<abstract>
<p>In this article I examine myths in the gene science debate, and their use as a tool in analysis of popular perceptions and public opinion of genetic science and gene technology. In daily language myth means something untrue, though theories of myth present them as carriers of knowledge and truth. I understand myth as a narrative, a cultural construct that aims to describe the world, its origin, and its constituent elements. I compare scholars’ usage of myths, considering their implications. I conclude that i) As an analytical tool the concept of myth is too loosely defined, or understood through theories which leave out context, social relations and interaction. This provides limited insight about myths and myth-making in present day society. ii) An updated understanding of myths, including location/context and interaction/process would enrich analysis.</p>

<title>1. Point of departure</title>
<p>During the Human Genome Project (HGP), debates over genetic research grew in strength and controversy, more or less fading out at the closure of the project. Myths and metaphors have been used both as a way to illuminate and put forward this dispute, and as a tool to understand common or popular attitudes. My point of departure is: which advantages and/or problems do the different references to myth and metaphor imply? What is the common ground for those who shared a critical approach to modern gene- and biotechnology? What was at stake in this debate? My aim is to analyse the discussants’ understanding of myths and myth-theories. In conclusion I will make some suggestions on the value of an adequate use of such theories and analysis. The main material consists of the American analysis of public opinion done by Dorothy Nelkin and M. Susan Lindee, the Eurobarometer survey on gene technology and genetic science, and the key figures of the trans-Atlantic debate, as well as Ullika Segerstråle’s analysis of this debate.</p>

<title>2. Theories of myth</title>
<sec id="section3-0963662510376284">
<title>Defining <bold>myth</bold></title>
<p>In antiquity myth was defined as synonymous with religion, and in contrast to logos. Or myth was defined as other people’s religion, in contrast to one’s own true religion. In both cases, myths were defined as a particular narrative genre, containing stories of gods and heroes. In the academic traditions of the 19th and most of the 20th century, myths have been understood as a key to culture and religion: you know a people when you know their religion/myths.</p>
<p>During the 19th and first half of the 20th century Europe was characterized by fundamental changes: the newly invented modern democratic nation state; new livelihood and social structures; new understandings of development, class, gender, race; and secularization of society (separation of the private and public spheres, gradually transferring religion to the private sphere). The material that I am to discuss in this article represents understandings of myth that explicitly, or by their content, refer back to theories and thinkers from this modernistic phase (Bronislaw Malinowski, Ernst Cassirer, Mircea Eliade, Claude Lévi-Strauss).</p>
<p>The latter half of the 20th century became an era of conceptual and theoretical deconstruction, leaving essentialist understanding behind. Analysis was to be carried out in relation to context, change/process and interaction/communication. And theories of myths have been criticized and reconceptualized to reflect these insights. In short, today, myths have to be related to concrete time and space (context), to concrete interaction (between people, groups, institutions etc.) and to processes (change).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662510376284">
<title>Classical theories – myth as a carrier of knowledge or truth</title>
<p>Usually myth is defined as one of several oral folk stories together with legend, ballad, and fairytale. To define myth in this way implies using a genre analytical understanding of myth. This definition of myth includes stories about creation, how the world came to be, and how humans became part of creation; stories that explain premises for existence, which elements and basic substances reality is built upon, which inhabitants (including gods) it contains, how the different creatures that exist are related to each other and to different qualities that uphold life; stories of the main plots and dramas that have been played out as well as those we expect will happen in the future; and stories about the final goal and meaning of present human life. As a category of narratives, myth is understood as the one category where cosmology (reality as a whole) and cosmogony (the coming into being of the universe) are presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510376284">Dundes, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the first phase of academic analysis and theories of myth agreed on a genre analytical definition, the theoretical approach diverged severely, and each of the different cultural analytical disciplines developed its own approach to myths. The anthropologist and functionalist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510376284">Malinowski (1926)</xref> understood myths as fulfilling existential psychological needs; the philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510376284">Cassirer (1955)</xref> understood myths as a mode of thinking that characterized a particular phase in the history of human development; the phenomenologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510376284">Eliade (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510376284">1958)</xref> approached myth as a religious phenomenon transcending the holy and creating structure and cosmos in an otherwise chaotic reality (Eliade’s thinking is parallel to Durkheim’s understanding of reality as organized in two spheres); the anthropologist and structuralist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510376284">Lévi-Strauss (1967)</xref> understood myth as a mediator of existential and opposite phenomena such as life and death, or different livelihoods etc., mediating opposites that constitute existential conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510376284">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>These classical academic theories of myth all understand myth as a particular genre of narrative with a fundamental value to humans and human society. Critique of these theories came during the second half of the 20th century, and can be summed up as a critique of implied ethnocentrism and gender blindness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510376284">2</xref></sup> The answer has been to include self-reflexive elements in the theoretical understanding of myth. In particular it has meant including discussions of context, that form and content of myth are understood as dynamic and in constant change (not a constant or an essence), that the way myth operates is related to human interaction (not an essence), and that people and contexts represent dynamic forces as partakers in interpretation and negotiation in the process of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510376284">Lessa and Vogt, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510376284">Dundes, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510376284">Samuel and Thompson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510376284">Paden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510376284">Sundqvist and Svalastog, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510376284">Svalastog, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510376284">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510376284">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510376284">Bowie, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Barthes – history replacing knowledge and truth</title>
<p>As a theorist of myths in modern society, Roland Barthes deserves presentation. References to Barthes are not usually included in the presentation of theories of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510376284">Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510376284">Pals, 1996</xref>) or theories of myths in religious studies, folklore, or in books on anthropology and religion, but are restricted to the fields of literature, media and aesthetics. See for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510376284">Paden (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510376284">Dundes (1984)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510376284">Lessa and Vogt (1979)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510376284">Strenski (1987)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510376284">Leach (1967)</xref>.</p>
<p>Though Barthes is a modernist, his understanding of myths diverges from former theories because he does not limit his definition to stories about gods and heroes. Barthes says that myth is a linguistic element that on one hand is a conceptual end product in a linguistic chain of meaning production, but at the same time myth, as a conceptual end product, is also the first concept in an enlarged system constructed by the myth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510376284">Barthes, 1969</xref>: 211f.). Barthes’ thinking identifies myth as a linguistic position with a specific function, a model developed in elaboration of the work of Saussure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510376284">3</xref></sup> Everything or anything can gain this linguistic position.</p>
<p>When Barthes transports the concept myth into linguistic terminology he also redefines myth in a fundamental way. Myth is no longer a genre-analytical-concept, but a position and a function. Everything can gain a conceptual character and a meaning-creating position that reflects the past. And when something (a picture or something written) gets this specific position and function, it has become a myth. From this definition, Barthes can include new types of narratives in his presentation of modern myths. In consequence, destructive concepts from the Second World War became part of Barthes’ analysis of modern myths. In this new understanding of myth, myth loses formerly assumed internal morality and/or knowledge. As a product of history, myth cannot be defined by morality.</p>
<p>Analytical tools need to be in line with, and not in opposition to, the material they are to help organize and understand. For the material I discuss, Barthes’ theory hides more than it illuminates. Because when the relation between myth and knowledge is cut off, references to and usage of myth can no longer be analysed and discussed in terms of ontology, only in terms of history. As we shall see, it is ontology that is at stake in the material I analyse.</p>

<title>My theoretical stance</title>
<p>Lévi-Strauss used Saussure’s approach to linguistics to gain what he defined as a scientific frame for cultural analysis. I have discussed this elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510376284">Anna Lydia Svalastog 1998</xref>:60, 85, 254; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510376284">Anna Lydia Svalastog 1997</xref>:37) and will not go into it at length here; I will merely state that I also embrace an understanding of language as key to the construction of meaning and culture, although I have chosen (late) Wittgenstein’s understanding of language as my stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510376284">Wittgenstein, 1953</xref>). In contrast to Saussure’s understanding of language as a system where the content of a word is defined by its position and relation to other words of that language, Wittgenstein understands context and social interaction/communication – non-linguistic aspects – as inseparable from the meaning of a word.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510376284">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>My location for interpretation is hermeneutical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510376284">Svalastog, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510376284">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510376284">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510376284">2009</xref>). In hermeneutics, it is claimed that interpretation is fundamental to meaning: meaning is constructed or construed through interpretation. The process of interpretation can be understood as exegesis, explanation or translation, and this varies in and between the fields of humanistic research and natural science. I understand hermeneutics as interpretation, not translation, deriving my thinking from philosophy and not theology – although I am aware of the overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510376284">Schüssler Fiorenza, 2002</xref>). Wittgenstein’s emphasis on usage of language (context), and on language as a game (interaction), implies that contexts and interaction are to be understood as part of the meaning of that which is spoken – or in my case, written.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510376284">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>How I define myth</title>
<p>In this article I do not interpret myth as phenomenologically pre-existent. I understand myth as a narrative, a cultural construct that aims to describe the world, its origin, and its constituent elements. In consequence, myths are expected to carry knowledge, history, and past and present truths. A myth contains several possible interpretative outcomes in a community, each interpretation intending to grasp what has been, what is, and what can, or will, become. A myth gains mythic functions when it is part of a reading process meant to generate meaning that entails socially structuring functions for individuals as well as for the group that embraces the reading. I understand myths to be a carrier of both constructive and destructive norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510376284">Svalastog, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510376284">1998</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510376284">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Religious heritages are often put forward through the use of metaphors, images, and symbols that presuppose a further religious narrative context. The relation to a further narrative context gives the metaphors, images and symbols a thought structuring function when we read, interpret and use them. The further narrative context might contain a metaphysical dimension, or at least an implicit assumption about how different aspects of reality are interrelated in a whole. If a narrative implies a cosmological process or drama, I define it as a myth. Religious symbols, metaphors and images in the material I have analysed, refer back to myth or narratives in a distinct way. Thus, in this text, I treat symbols and metaphors the way my material does, as a subcategory to myth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510376284">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>My definition presupposes an understanding of myth as something other than a symbolic construction outside the real world. It implies an understanding of myth as a narrative founded in, and attempting to describe the world or aspects of the world. Defined in this way, myth is understood as productive to constructions of meaning, and to action. Images and metaphors have originated in given contexts. They gain meaning from the contexts from which they are drawn. Despite the potential or broader meaning of an image or a metaphor, the fixed meaning is constituted contextually, in situations of use and interpretation.</p>

<title>The DNA Mystique</title>
<p>In the book <italic>The DNA Mystique: The Gene as a Cultural Icon</italic>, Dorothy Nelkin and M. Susan Lindee analyse public perceptions of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>). In their description of the gene as a cultural phenomenon they use the terms myth, metaphor, image, symbol, and perception as theoretical concepts to give perspective and depth to their analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510376284">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee (1995)</xref> describe popular perceptions of DNA as a text with a specific function:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Both the germplasm and the gene have been used to address questions about the origins of social problems, the essence of the human condition, and the “nature of the very soul” (p. 21)</p>
<p>Eugenics was a civic religion (p. 31)</p>
<p>DNA has also been called on to answer questions about … distant human past … For us the Genome Diversity Project is another example of the common construction of DNA as an immortal text (p. 52)</p>
<p>… the range and ambition of the questions proposed suggests geneticists’ faith in the molecular text as the “Bible” or “Book of Man” (p. 53)</p>
<p>Like the sacred text of revealed religion, DNA explains our place in the world: our history, our social relationships, our behavior, our morality, and our fate (p. 57)</p>
<p>Popular perceptions of genetics – the assumptions of genetic essentialism – are played out with practical consequences in many contemporary institutional settings. They serve as a basis for important decisions about family relationships, influence legal interpretations of criminal culpability … (p. 151)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>DNA is described as a narrative that carries content and functions that overlap with presented theories of myth, in particular as presented by Mircea Eliade. Nelkin and Lindee refer directly to Eliade themselves:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Mircea Eliade describes how sacred realities become manifest “in objects that are an integral part of our natural ‘profane’ world” … The modern cultural concept of genetic essentialism draws much of its power from such theological roots … The gene has become a way to talk about the boundaries of personhood … in ways that parallel theological narratives. … The similarity … we suggest, is more than linguistic or metaphorical. DNA has taken on the social and cultural functions of the soul. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 41–2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nelkin and Lindee conclude that DNA is a natural part of the profane world that has become sacred, and that a specific narrative has transported this sacredness on to the gene; a sacred reality (the soul) has become manifest in an object (the gene) that used to be an integral part of our natural and profane world. To identify a narrative as structuring social life, and making itself manifest in an object integral to the profane world, is to identify what Eliade described as a myth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 38–57). Nelkin and Lindee state that the similarity between the powers of DNA (in popular images of the gene) and those of the Christian soul is more than linguistic and metaphorical, resonating with Eliade’s understanding of the sacred as a constant outside history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0963662510376284">
<title>Concept transporting old news</title>
<p>Nelkin and Lindee criticize popular perceptions of genes arguing that a) actual genes, their interaction and expression, are much more complicated than the popular image of genes, and b) the popular image of genes constitutes and strengthens traditional power-relations such as women–men, white–black, rich–poor etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 196–9). Nelkin and Lindee maintain a reductionist understanding of popular perceptions of genes that corresponds to their use of a phenomenological definition of myth. Emphasis is on essence, on function as a mechanical reflection of the myth, and on myth as a narrative outside history that structures past and present life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 38f.). When interpreting DNA as a cultural phenomenon generated directly and solely from the Christian concept of soul, contextual aspects of the Christian myth, and of DNA as a modern mythic narrative, disappear. The loss of context is in contrast to Nelkin and Lindee’s ambition; to understand people’s use and interpretations of genes in daily life as well as in social and political offices and institutions. Further, by using Eliade’s understanding of myth as determining patterns for behaviour, they cannot discuss process, agency and dynamics. Questions are ignored, such as: which actors, myths or actions, are this myth related to or does it operate together with?</p>
<p>Eliade understood myth as a carrier of eternal truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510376284">Eliade, 1958</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510376284">1957</xref>). However, Nelkin and Lindee approach the phenomenon under discussion as a social construct. As such, the text of DNA carries neither truth nor knowledge, but is reduced to a fantasy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 196). When the social/cultural construct is disconnected from reality, analytical possibilities are reduced, and content becomes under-theorized; for example analysing modern perceptions of public opinion would be limited to the question, why do people believe an untrue narrative? If myths are considered to be carriers of knowledge or truth, the question can extend to: which truth or what knowledge is transmitted through the myth? Nelkin and Lindee lose the opportunity to discuss the relation between myth and knowledge, to my mind a key theme if one wants to understand popular and scholarly perceptions of genetic science and gene technology. Despite the complex interpretative situation of genetic science, if DNA is understood as part of scientific knowledge and powerful gene technologies (plant science and pharmaceutics), the understanding of DNA as a cultural icon becomes less absurd, and myths may represent epistemological and ontological questions.</p>
<p>In Nelkin and Lindee’s analysis scientific knowledge about the phenomenon under discussion decreases to the status they have given myth – as power tools in the social and economic world but with no real relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: 198f.). Most of their book is a warning against the eugenics of the past. But, owing to their concept of myth, their conclusions only bring limited understanding of why and how myths work socially, how they are related to knowledge, and how this is related to how peoples think and act. I agree with Nelkin and Lindee that DNA is used for purposes that might entail social and political implications unacceptable to a modern democracy. The social and economic implication is real enough. But they overlook the realities and opportunities of scientific knowledge and biological engineering.</p>
<p>Classical theorists of myths all understood rites (action) as a secondary product to myths (narrative). Vibrant discussions of rites during the 1990s stated that ritual action was no longer reducible to a strict repetition of the mythic text/narrative. Rites/actions were to be understood on their own terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510376284">Barthes, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510376284">Connerton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510376284">Samuel and Thompson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510376284">Bell, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510376284">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510376284">Stausberg, Sundqvist and Svalastog eds., 2002</xref>). I believe that Nelkin and Lindee’s project would have benefitted from critical elaboration of Eliade and of phenomenology. Thus the position can shift from one where the popular image of DNA is understood as reducible to performances that carry a presupposed narrative (and content), to one where performance can be understood to produce meaning, tightly related to particular contexts of action. This changes the frame for further analysis. New questions that reflect their initial interests can be asked and elaborated.</p>

<p>When the HGP started of, genetic science and gene technology was described as productive activities, potentially producing consequences affecting the whole of mankind and the nature s/he depended on. This vision was in sharp contrast to western academic thinking and conceptualization at the time. Academic thinking was in the midst of a post-modern state, deconstructing main analytical and theoretical concepts, with special focus on deconstructing the very idea of essentialism and totalities. In colonial 18th and 19th century, History, Religion and Culture, were approached as if they could and should be described as coherent and comprehensive phenomenon, usually defined in prolongation of, or in opposition to, evolutionary theory. The intellectual critical aim was to modify former theories by including context, interaction and change. The critiques put forward how location, the position from which an understanding is made, matters, and that critical thinking is something more profound than a matter of adding new histories to former descriptions. In the public debate about genetic science and gene technology, the appearance of myth and theories of myth, correspond to an implied assumption about genetic science and gene technology as a coherent and comprehensive phenomenon with devastating consequences for mankind and nature. Seen from this angle, usage of myth and older comprehensive theories of myth makes sense. The focus on myths made it possible to approach fundamental realities, relations, consequences and options. In the following pages I will focus on the use of references to metaphors and Christian heritage in the trans-Atlantic gene science debate. The trans-Atlantic debate is a backdrop for my elaboration of the academic use of the concept of myth in the analysis of public opinion.</p>

<title>R. C. Lewontin – naming biological processes</title>
<p>Richard C. Lewontin is an evolutionary biologist and traditional positivist scientist, who has argued that science can gain objective and true knowledge about biology. His epistemological stance differs from that of Nelkin and Lindee, though his claims are more or less the same as theirs; that the interaction between nucleus and organism is biologically complicated and complex, and that it is scientifically wrong when genetic science is used as an argument for reducing people into a product of gene function. He claims that biological determinism is scientifically problematic, and politically and socially dangerous. Lewontin pinpoints the descriptive concepts that scientists use, and criticises them when they are in conflict with scientific knowledge. In <italic>Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA</italic> he makes the reader aware of imprecise use of concepts in presentations of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>). Misuse of concepts is the reason why interpreters of the genes draw wrong reductionist conclusions about humans. For example, he points to when the distinction between genetics and environment is mixed up with the concepts <italic>fixed</italic> and <italic>changeable</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>: 30), or when <italic>inherited</italic> and <italic>unchangeable</italic> are mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>: 32). To Lewontin, a misused concept represents a scientific failure, a failure in describing biological processes implies a wrong understanding of what is actually going on in the cell and its environment. Lewontin widens the problem by discussing how science is used in society to understand diversity among people, focusing on the distinction between <italic>correlation</italic> and <italic>identity</italic> (1991: 34, 48). The political implications are obvious.</p>
<p>In contrast to a language based on <italic>blueprint, self-replicating, information for determining</italic>, Lewontin suggests a hermeneutic approach with linguistics as the main source for descriptive concepts. This is not what it might appear to be, a change from biological analyses towards discourse analysis. Lewontin’s main argument is that what happens in the cell is not self-replication. The change of language is better understood as a change from a mechanical to an organic vocabulary, using scientific knowledge, to better describe the gene in an accurate way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>: 66f.). Lewontin does not primarily focus on metaphors or myth in this book, but he touches upon them. His emphasis is on the necessity to remember that metaphors can say that something is <italic>like</italic> a clock, but that this does not mean that what the metaphor is meant to describe actually <italic>is</italic> a clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>: 14). But Lewontin also understands metaphors as part of a further narrative. For example, the clock metaphor is not relevant, but the language metaphor is, and the relevance is not limited to whether the image is a good model or not, it also has to do with further assumptions that go along with the image:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The problem is to construct a third view, one that sees the entire world neither as an indissoluble whole nor with the equally incorrect, but currently dominant, view that at every level the world is made up of bits and pieces that can be isolated and that have properties that can be studied in isolation. Both ideologies, one that mirrors the premodern feudal social world, and the other that mirrors the modern competitive individualist entrepreneurial one, prevent us from seeing the full richness of interaction in nature. In the end, they prevent a rich understanding of nature and prevent us from solving the problems to which science is supposed to apply itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>: 14f.)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Lewontin it is important that the scientist chooses a metaphor that entails a true narrative.</p>

<title>Evelyn Fox Keller – productive metaphors and genetic science</title>
<p>Evelyn Fox Keller uses discourse-terminology and theory, an epistemological stance different from both Nelkin and Lindee, and Lewontin. In <italic>Refiguring Life</italic>, Keller analyses images used in explanations of microbiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>). During the 19th and 20th centuries new images of the gene were picked from new technologies:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Thus the notion of genetical information that Watson and Crick invoked was not literal but metaphorical. But it was extremely powerful. Although it permitted no quantitative measure, it authorized the expectation – anticipated in the notion of gene action – that biological information does not increase in the course of development: it is already fully contained in the genome. This move and, even more, the collapsing of <italic>information</italic> with <italic>program</italic> and <italic>instruction</italic> vastly fortified the concept of gene action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 18f., italic in original)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Keller’s analysis, an image is chosen if it works as a frame for scientific action. Keller points out two distinct fields of microbiology, gene science and embryology, the latter subsequently renamed to developmental biology. From a genetic science point of view the gene has been understood as the locus of control. In developmental biology, the cytoplasm might, just as likely as the genome, be the factor to be cast as the locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 25). The information metaphor has been powerful in the former field, and limiting scientific investigation in the latter. The information metaphor operates in two ways. First of all, it is a powerful tool when used in interpretations that give answers which can lead to action, that again give possibilities to action, such as gene technology. The linear understanding of action in combination with the functional understanding of the gene is fundamental for today’s gene technology simply because it works. On the other hand, the power of the information metaphor becomes a hindrance when it comes to understanding other aspects of the gene, especially aspects in the developmental process. The use of a metaphor cannot be explained by the metaphor’s theoretical reliability, but refers to whether or not it creates perspectives that make action possible. How metaphors create and limit possibilities is illuminated by how changes in metaphor change scientific thinking.</p>

<disp-quote><p>In the mid twentieth century, a new technology, the computer arrived to displace the telegraph.

The central feature of the computer related notion of information was that it was built on an understanding of a system where function, co-ordination, interdependence, and purpose were connected to a notion of circular feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 91). Keller writes that the latest development in the metaphors used in microbiology is related to cyberspace. This new field, with rapid cloning of an arbitrary piece of DNA, recognizes no boundary at all between information processing and molecular biology. Those who are more sophisticated in cyberspace see the fundamental building blocks as networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 114).</p>

<title>Productiveness and risk</title>
<p>Keller discusses metaphors as isolated linguistic phrases, although their potency is drawn from the wider narrative that they have been picked from. One could say that she uses metaphor as a mytheme (see Note 8), but without further discussions of complications presented or embedded in the wider narrative. In consequence, her attitude towards the new biology is rather unclear.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Well, we’ve come a long way from the wind-up clock, even from the great nineteenth-century developments of the electric motor, the steam engine, and the telegraph. Electricity has given way to electronics and matter and energy to information. In the late twentieth century, it is the computer that dominates our imagination, and it has liberated us from that odd locution “man has a body.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 118)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It seems as if Keller has no vocabulary for analysing danger. But if the computer metaphor is productive in creating a new biological discourse, and (potentially) a new biological reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: 115f.), then computer language should also be a key for discussing implicit risks and failures. The quantity of interrelation, the free flow of information, the decrease in friction and accelerated spread of information makes the system as a whole extremely vulnerable. Widespread system knowledge increases risks, risks of loss of information and memory, risks of misuse, manipulation and theft – even from officially protected secret institutions. There is also the risk of rapid spread of viruses.</p>

<title>What is at stake in controversies over genetic science? Lewontin and Wilson</title>
<p>In the so-called science wars debate, the dividing line has been between scientists and non-scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>). However, the crucial question in the debate about microbiology is not reducible to the science wars or to the epistemological question of whether knowledge is socially constructed or based on objective facts. In Ullika Segerstråle’s book <italic>Defenders of the Truth: The Sociobiology Debate</italic> (2000), she focuses on the disagreement between Lewontin and Edward O. Wilson, both outstanding evolutionary biologists. In his book <italic>The Genetic Basis of Evolutionary Change</italic>, Lewontin criticizes older genetics for lack of consideration of the complex interaction between individual genes. Wilson’s book <italic>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</italic>, combines gene knowledge with social concerns. Lewontin did not accept Wilson’s social concerns, and stated that Wilson’s scientific skills were old and scientifically problematic. Wilson, on the other hand, was aware of the complexity of gene function and had discussed these aspects of gene science at length in his book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>: 36f.). Segerstråle describes the conflict as a trans-Atlantic conflict representing two different attitudes towards the relationship between scientific and moral truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>: 35). Lewontin criticized Wilson for the presence of ideology and absence of good science, for having old-fashioned views of genes and being unaware of the current (correct) problems of adaptation. But, according to Segerstråle: “[T]his was a serious misinterpretation of Wilson, since he in fact discussed these matters at length in his book” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>: 47). Segerstråle writes that Lewontin criticized Wilson for using models that reduced the complexity of biological factuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>: 44).</p>
<p>Both scientists read each other’s scientific works, both discussed the new complexity in gene science, but still ended up in a debate where they appeared to represent totally different, even colliding fields of competence. This illusion has to do with how the controversy appeared in public: Wilson representing, and Lewontin fighting against biological determinism. In Segerstråle’s thorough analysis of the debate she states that making Wilson a target for a critique of biological determinism was not altogether fair.</p>

<title>Allies or enemies – epistemology is not at stake</title>
<p>Despite different fields of research, Nelkin and Lindee, Lewontin, and Keller overlap when it comes to conclusions. Nelkin and Lindee describe their research as cultural analysis, or a study of cultural construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510376284">Nelkin and Lindee, 1995</xref>: vii, ix). Lewontin on the other hand does not analyse cultural construction; he evaluates the scientific knowledge in concepts and metaphors in use. Keller does not analyse symbols as arbitrary in relation to biology, she analyses the symbol and its productiveness for microbiological action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>: xi). The diverging epistemologies, even different ontologies, in combination with overlap of conclusions, are not as surprising as it might seem. All of them have an analytical approach where scientific knowledge about microbiology is situated in a broader context. This context contains biological processes and functions that are not determined by the gene; it contains time and space, and it contains notions of interaction and reciprocal processes. Whether this broader context is understood as scientifically true (Lewontin), or the best interpretation available at the moment (Nelkin and Lindee), is less important. The scientific controversy that Segerstråle analyzed was about genes and gene functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510376284">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>: 33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510376284">Lewontin, 1991</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510376284">Keller, 1995</xref>). It had to do with two topics: a) whether the scientist contained the older “nature” and “nurture” dichotomy in their analysis, or whether they had an understanding of gene–environment interaction; and b) whether the scientist treated race as “types” or as populations with wide genetic variations among their individual members. The historical background of this discussion was more relevant for Lewontin and other critics of Wilson’s book than whether Wilson actually was a biological determinist and unaware of gene complexity:</p>

<title>5. The Eurobarometer – public attitudes towards genetic science and gene technology</title>
<p>The <italic>Eurobarometer</italic>, a comparative sociological study of European norms and values, was carried out in 1979, and with a revised set of questions in 1991, 1993 and 1996. Professor Torben Hviid Nielsen has analysed the answers to the questions about biotechnology in the latest three surveys. His analysis covered part of the survey called “Biotechnology and genetic engineering,” from the 1991 and 1993 surveys and from the 1996 survey “Eurobarometer 46.1. Biotechnology and the European Public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510376284">Nielsen, Jelsøe and Ôhman, 2002</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1996</xref>: part 3, p. 3). When analysing the European material, one of the analytical challenges was how to understand the relation between knowledge and people’s attitudes. The conclusion was that; “Increased knowledge does primarily lead to more people taking a stand [on biotechnology] – but this stand is ‘optimistic’ as well as ‘pessimistic’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Nielsen states that researchers, (and includes himself) first understood support for biotechnology as related to knowledge. But after analysing the three surveys he concludes that; a) knowledge about biotechnology is not related to attitude in a direct way; b) the percentage of people without knowledge about biotechnology decreases more than the increase of positive and optimistic attitudes towards biotechnology; c) all nations in the survey have a significant number of sceptics with large knowledge about biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>: 10). The typical person with a positive attitude to biotechnology in the survey is a young man with higher education, living in a city, with a good knowledge of biotechnology and feeling few risks from it. The sceptics are not as uniform, and Nielsen divides them into two groups, one traditional “blue” and one modern “green” group. The traditional “blue” is characterized by higher age, lower education, and politically right-wing preferences, religious affiliation and materialism. The modern “green” group is characterized by younger age, higher education, no religious affiliation and politically left-wing preferences and modern post-materialism. The “blue” and “green” arguments are described as “distinct as the social groups that tend to express them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510376284">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>: 182ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>: 20). In his 1996 paper he also adds that the young positive male “considers his influence strong” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1996</xref>: part 3, p. 4). Nielsen also observes a slight majority of women in the group of sceptics.</p>
<sec id="section19-0963662510376284">
<title>Faust and Frankenstein</title>
<p>In further analysis Nielsen, as a cultural explanation of the “blue” and “green” groups, uses the concepts of archetypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>: 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510376284">Nielsen et al., 2000</xref>: 251) and classical tropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510376284">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>: 192). He relates the “blue” critique to <italic>Faust</italic> as an archetypical critique of technology where biotechnology is understood as a modern variant of an alliance with Mephistopheles who pawns the human soul. The “green” critique is related to <italic>Frankenstein</italic> where experiments with life have unintended consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510376284">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>: 189ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510376284">Nielsen, 1997</xref>: 22). Initially Nielsen implies that knowledge and the stories of Faust and Frankenstein are in opposition, and that knowledge without these stories is the correct foundation for attitudes, but in his analysis they can hardly be seen as oppositions.</p>
<p>Faust and Frankenstein are the main characters of well known stories, though what kind of story they represent is unclear in Nielsen’s presentation. When Nielsen connects the concept archetype and the stories of Faust and Frankenstein, with no further explanation of either, the reader has to figure out independently what kind of phenomenon they represent. Due to further discussion of the function of these narratives, in combination with Nielsen’s references to the work of Nelkin and Lindee, what comes to mind is an indirect use of the concept of myth, in particular C. G. Jung’s theory of myth, in many respects a parallel theory to Eliade’s (see above). The concept of archetype/classical trope etc. is not explanatory, the references to Faust and Frankenstein cast light upon the Eurobarometer survey, but references to these “modern myths,” never become more than a loose analytical concept. The conceptual uncertainty is comparable to the uncertainty I argue is present in Nelkin and Lindee (ibid). My conviction is that a more direct elaboration of myth would have also brought clarity to Nielsen’s analysis. He wants to describe narratives that have the function of myths, but he had no theoretical playground to elaborate and sharpen his analysis. Theories of myths represent a broad spectrum of different cultural theories, which again would have made it possible to elaborate analysis of the phenomenon (what he calls “categories,” “segments” in the material he analyses); myths carry norms and values, just as Nielsen’s references to Frankenstein and Faust as analytical tools make these aspects of the surveys possible to discuss. Nielsen does not discuss myths as knowledge, or myths as operative, or myths as related to action. What he and his colleagues do, is to point out that attitudes towards genetic science have to do with more than knowledge about genetic science; that is, they are related to norms and values:</p>

<title>Language and biology</title>
<p>Nelkin and Lindee and Lewontin criticize genetic science they find unscientific, in particular tendencies towards biological determinism. Their target is false scientific claims that are or can be turned into unacceptable politics and social action. Implicit premises in Nelkin and Lindee’s and Lewontin’s writing are that language shapes social reality, and that biological science contains knowledge about the real world. Limitation of manipulative action is set by lack of knowledge about biological processes and gene function. Lack of knowledge is their main target for the critique of genetic science, but based on the premise that language and biology are separate. Language might describe reality and affect social life, and by this people’s lives and health. But they do not assume that language can more directly affect microbiological science. The distinction between language and biology, between myth and nature, is clear, and language is understood as describing what is already there. Keller on the other hand focuses on how metaphors are used to <italic>manipulate biology</italic>, how language and biology is a <italic>reciprocal relation</italic> and in constant interaction and intervention. You can expand the borders of biology if you have a productive metaphor.</p>
<p>If one accepts Keller’s description, an important challenge arises; to act without noticing mythic implications of a productive metaphor is, for obvious reasons, naive. To notice mythic implications of a productive metaphor can contribute to Nielsen’s analysis of the Eurobarometer survey and deepen our understanding of how and why laypeople are critical independent of their level of knowledge. And, if one follows Keller’s discussion of which metaphors are in use, the controversy about gene science and gene technology focuses possible biological implications that expand pre-given biological borders. A “mythic” aspect in the debate seems to reflect possible outcomes. Because gene technology is productive – whether or not scientists agree upon how genes function and what status they have in a post-linear and organic biological understanding of life – myths capture the possible productiveness of the process.</p>

<sec id="section21-0963662510376284">
<title>Mae-Wan Ho</title>
<p>The most controversial book in this debate was Mae-Wan Ho’s <italic>Genetic Engineering: Dream or Nightmare?</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510376284">Ho, 2000</xref>). Ho elaborates an organic and dynamic understanding of biological life. She claims that cross-species gene engineering breaks down borders between species, making a larger number of species vulnerable for bacteria and viruses that used to be specific. Her scenario is that new mutations of bacteria and viruses in a cross-species climate will no longer be species-limited. She claims that genetic engineering is changing our reality in a way that will not be reversible and that that undermines plurality and distinction as a guarantee for life continuation.</p>
<p>The cyberspace metaphor Keller describes in the last chapter of her book <italic>Refiguring Life</italic> can be seen as a parallel description to Ho’s. If cyberspace is to be taken seriously as a metaphor that already is productive in gene technology, the complication of modern communication techniques ought to be taken seriously as well. As a description of ontology, approached as a myth, the cyberspace reality is one that gives opportunities at the cost of extreme vulnerability, subversive and destructive actions, intruders, manipulators and terrorists. In many ways Ho is an apocalyptic. Taken together with Keller, one can draw the conclusion that when a metaphor that is used gives scientific and engineering results, then we should give time to some critical reflections. What Ho, on the other hand, does not elaborate, is context and individuality. We should especially try to understand how these metaphors and their consequences have been analysed in earlier contexts. This should not be confused with “guilt by association,” but related to the effectiveness of the metaphor.</p>

<title>Myths, metaphors, religious heritage – used as carriers of knowledge?</title>
<p>The laypeople in the Eurobarometer surveys, and the scholars presented above, represent divided groups in terms of attitudes towards genetic science and gene technology. The researchers have pointed out different scientific approaches to DNA; a more mechanic linear approach, and one which emphasizes dynamics and interaction. These two perspectives correspond to two different knowledge-founded understandings of reality. They can be analysed as representing two different myths, carrying two different ontologies. They both say something about what reality consists of, how different aspects of reality are interrelated, and how these relations proceed in time. In Segerstråle’s last chapter she states more or less the same:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Throughout this book we have seen scientists with great concerns about the true depiction of reality, and I have distinguished between “realists” and “modellers”, or “metaphysicians” and “logicians”. But there is no doubt that the central issue in the sociobiology debate had to do with the true nature of human nature. And here the sociobiology controversy continued an important debate in the wake of the Second World War: the grand opposition between existentialism and essentialism, or between free will and determinism.

</p>
<p>Similar epistemology and understanding of the relation between language and biology does not necessarily generate similar conclusions. The crucial difference between Lewontin and Wilson is an exegetical one, it is a difference in how they contextualize their scientific knowledge, and which myth they use as a foundation for their interpretation.</p>

<p>When the HGP started, genetic science and gene technology were described as activities that made humans appear as producers of fundamental consequences, and the relation between man and nature as a binding, and not an optional, one. The use of references to myths underscores this. The discourse is not religious, but it is theological in one particular sense; it approaches reality as a whole, it turns the reading and use of myths into a hermeneutical exercise. Religiosity and religion are not the issue, but rather myths and interpretations of myth are. My interest in this text is in part compatible with Haydon White’s ambition when he analyses tropes in history books, and states that his own ambition is to be able to get past Foucault and the trope of irony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510376284">White, 1973</xref>). My ambition is to show that myths, in the way the term is used in the material I analyse, are tied to knowledge that reaches into existential levels of reality. To analytically and theoretically elaborate myths as narratives with a cosmological content is, as I have shown, crucial.</p>
<p>In Nelkin and Lindee’s cultural analysis, myth is merely a structuring image that makes certain aspects of life sacred, for no good reason. Myth is not a carrier of truth, but a culturally powerful and formative imaginative story. Keller and Lewontin, on the other hand, treat metaphors and myths as carriers of more or less relevant knowledge about reality. In accordance with Keller and Lewontin, metaphors and myth can be carriers of knowledge, their function can be both productive and limiting, good and bad. Nelkin and Lindee understand myth as a socially structuring story about essence/identities. Keller and Lewontin understand metaphors and myths as a symbolic way of describing reality. To Nielsen, Faust and Frankenstein are archetypes, carriers of norms and values.</p>
<p>Different scholars’ different understandings of genes and the genome are not reducible to diverging epistemological preferences. Epistemological problems are, however, relevant to internal questions about “good” or “bad” science within different academic disciplines. The most crucial difference has to do with a) how different persons choose different metaphors, images or myths, and b) how they interpret differently. It is norms, values and ontology, not epistemology, that represent controversy. In itself, this lack of interest in epistemological problems in the material I have analysed, generates a problem that I have not discussed here; the theoretical complications that arise when positivist scientists deny norms and values in science, or when social constructionists reduce statements on reality to social constructions. This could be an appropriate theme for further analysis. My focus here has been on understanding the references to myths and the usage of the concept of myth as an analytical tool. Taken together, my analysis underscores that a well elaborated and updated understanding of myth, such as the one I have presented above, makes it possible to discuss and analyse these aspects of common ground and conflict. Nelkin and Lindee might have got important new analytical tools simply by incorporating newer theories of myth and myth-making, where themes such as context, interaction/relation and process could be elaborated. Then the content of myth would be understood as reflecting complex interpretative processes, located in social meaning construing relations, representing power, acted upon by people that belong to groups but also represent agency etc. Keller, Lewontin and Nielsen could, by elaborating theories of myth, deepen their analysis of an actual metaphor or narrative that they want to understand when it has been observed as containing relevant and explanatory value. If one finds the logic of Internet language so productive that it opens new realities in gene research and biotechnology, the more speculative sides of it – its further narrative or mythic context – ought to be taken into consideration. I expect the Internet metaphor, as other metaphors before, to be understood as limiting and after a while to be replaced with new metaphors. But this does not mean that analysing and understanding the further narrative context of the metaphor is without relevance as long as a metaphor is in use. It is important not to be too naive and assume that use of metaphors, especially with mythic connotations and original narrative contexts, is abstract and without correlation to knowledge and reality as such. Metaphors and myths are more than just a matter of personal preferences. At work they are dynamic, contain relevant knowledge, distribute power, structure and even manipulate reality. Or to cite Raphael Samuel and Paul Thompson: “The mythical elements in memory, in short, need to be seen both as evidence of the past, and as a continuing historical force in the present” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510376284">Samuel and Thompson, 1990</xref>: 20).</p>

<p>Biographical information: Bronislaw Malinowski lived 1884–1942, Ernst Cassirer 1874–1945, Mircea Eliade 1907–1986, Claude Lévi-Strauss 1908–2009.</p>

<p>During the 1970s Eliade was the most influential historian of religion.

<p>Lévi-Strauss uses Saussure in his understanding of culture, but he does not use Saussure in his discussions of myth; Lévi-Strauss explains myth as an exclusive genre of narratives that mediate bipolar oppositions of reality, oppositions in nature as well as in culture (mediator of life–death, mediator of different livelihoods etc.).</p>

<p>A symbol is understood as replacing a myth/narrative that it refers back to. Mytheme is one of Eliade’s concepts defining a mythic element, a parallel to the linguistic term phoneme. A metaphor on the other hand is meant to illuminate, and define, what it is used to point at.</p>

<title>Author Biography</title>
<p><bold>Anna Lydia Svalastog</bold> is associated researcher at the Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics at Uppsala University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crb.uu.se">www.crb.uu.se</ext-link>). She has worked primarily on questions about cultural heritage, and conducted extensive studies on how cultural images structure personal life. She wrote her PhD thesis on abortion, with focus on reproduction, heterosexuality and myth. She has also been analysing how medical ethics structure legal regulations of gene technology and plant science, and how academic writing on Sami history and language reflects national politics and history. Svalastog holds a doctoral degree in Theology, History of Religions from Uppsala University (1998), and became associate professor in religious studies at Umeå University (2005).</p>
