<title>Shut it down, shut it all down?</title>
<p>Standard psychoanalytic theory can help us explain why the Canadian and American governments have invested so much money in new border policies and technologies for so little evident or measurable increase in security, economic flows, or public support. Based on the work of Melanie Klein, we use the notion of ‘phantastic objects’ to explain these (over-)reactions to risk management at the US-Canada border. A phantasy (as opposed to a fantasy, which is a mere daydream or unfulfilled desire) is used by Tuckett and Taffler as ‘an imaginary scene in which the inventor of the phantasy is a protagonist in the process of having his or her latent (unconscious) wishes fulfilled’ (2008: 395). Melanie Klein, the originator of the phrase, explains that phantastic objects are invested with the fulfillment of those unconscious desires, and a vision of the self in which those desires are met (1946: 99–110). We are building here on new work in critical border studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423594">Amoore and Hall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368431011423594">Parker and Vaughan-Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368431011423594">Muller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368431011423594">Salter, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Freezing is a common sign of panic, a response to accidents or events that overflow our capacity to react. Immediately after 9/11, the American government closed the national border, particularly the US-Canada border, previously understood as the ‘longest undefended border in the world’. The freezing of the US-Canada border caused economic disruption (up to $1m per hour for some companies) but did not prevent any further attacks. Border policies are caught between these two panics: security failure and economic crisis. The border is the skin of the body politic and must be protected from penetration: the border is the lifeline to the international economy and must be open. To escape this paradox, American (and Canadian) authorities have implemented a series of security measures to make the border ‘smarter’, notably the implementation of biometric identity documents in passports and at ports and surveillance by UAV Predator drones. Frequent-traveler programs, such as NEXUS or Transportation Worker Identification Card (TWIC) represent not only a security device for separating ‘low-risk, pre-approved’ travelers from others, but also correspond to an American imaginary of the free individual who can make good choices to facilitate his/her liberties. The biometric passport, the TWIC Card and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) patrols also signify an American techno-utopianism, in which complex algorithms, holograms, and rockets make the American homeland open to the economy and safe from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368431011423594">Shapiro, 2005</xref>: 21–34). However, none of these projects have actually increased security or facilitated economic integration, or the public perception thereof. Psychoanalytic theory provides a very useful tool for understanding the affective dynamics of policy decisions in this fraught field.</p>

<title>Notes on method</title>
<p>In political science at a minimum, if not social science in general, the role of the affective and somatic has been completely marginalized in the past 50 or 60 years, having been replaced by a positivist ghetto that follows a behavioralist political psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368431011423594">Volkan, 2003</xref>: 49–76). The primary culprit for the lack of the affective in security thinking is Kenneth Waltz’s thin description of the First Image of the causes of war, in which he relegates questions of the inherent moral and emotional nature of mankind to religion and philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368431011423594">1959</xref>). The discipline of political science took a particularly rationalist turn in the 1950 s and 1960 s, focusing on abstract game theory and structuralist analyses of foreign policies. Despite the nominal attention paid to the ideational character of anti-colonialism, the majority of the discipline was enamored with the strategic logic of deterrence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011423594">Allison, 1971</xref>). Political scientists were interested in ‘explaining’ rather than ‘understanding’, and psychoanalysis gives equal, if not greater, weight to the affective and instinctual, and provides absolutely no specific predicative schema. In particular, psychoanalysis cannot predict a particular pattern, action or reaction. However, if we look beyond simplistic realist thought, psychoanalysis can provide a framework for understanding the dynamics between emotion and rationality in decision-making. In this regard, the best case for psychoanalytic theory in political science is precisely this: psychoanalysis can provide a framework for understanding the logic behind both rational and irrational decisions.</p>
<p>The absence of psychoanalysis is striking across the wide landscape of political science and International Relations. In studies on primordial and instrumentalist nationalism, national roles, humiliation, revenge, panic, or identity, there is very little accounting for psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423594">Holsti, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368431011423594">Lowenheim and Heimann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368431011423594">Saurette, 2006</xref>). It is even absent among feminist, post-positivists and Foucauldian scholars, who might be expected to be indebted to that strain of continental theory, though the feminist scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011423594">Edkins (2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368431011423594">Elshtain (1989</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431011423594">Weber (2006</xref>) do engage with it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368431011423594">Neumann (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368431011423594">Shapiro (1997</xref>) also engage with Lacan in their work on identity.</p>
<p>Two exceptions warrant mention, Bloom’s <italic>Personal Identity, National Identity and International Relations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431011423594">1990</xref>) and Sucharov’s <italic>The International Self </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431011423594">2005</xref>). Bloom starts from Freudian analysis of the identification process, but then interprets identity to be a political commodity and reasserts a very plain and monotonous schema for the analysis of nationalism and national interest. Sucharov, in contrast, is much more engaging. However, her target is constructivism, the driest strand of IR theory, and relational-model theorizing within psychoanalysis. Building on work by Holsti on role theory, she looks at the construction of the ‘international self’, by which she means the construction of a collective, national identity through various state institutions. It is a fascinating book on the Israeli question, but less illuminating on psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Equally, questions about security and politics have been relegated in the psychoanalytic field to questions about trauma and violence or adding case notes to ‘great men’ of diplomacy and statecraft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368431011423594">Volkan et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368431011423594">1991</xref>). Psychoanalysis is primarily concerned with the individual personality, or the dynamics of a self-identified group and focuses greatly on the affective as a necessary supplement to the rational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011423594">Connolly, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In therapy, the process of analysis aims to avoid situations in which individuals make poor choices (a goal similar to rational choice theory, by the way), and particularly to stop repeating poor decisions they have already made (avoiding negative patterns of behavior). The plainest example in the post-9/11 world of this dynamic is: why have airport security procedures and border security rites been so radically changed, but in ways that replicate precisely the vulnerabilities that led to the 9/11 attacks? Since irrational and emotional decisions may have a logic of their own, what helps us understand the persistence of psychotic security measures?</p>
<p>This article brings some of the tools of psychoanalysis, particularly the pattern of phantastic objects from Melanie Klein, to bear on the question of national security in an era of panic. When so much of the political culture of the United States is determined, structured, or conditioned by fear, panic, and anxiety, psychoanalytic reasoning provides the best tool for understanding how irrational security measures are adopted, resisted, and (mis)trusted. For political scientists, this article will be too fuzzy – and not provide enough empirical causation, and for cultural theorists well acquainted with the wrangling of psychoanalysis, it may be too simplistic. However, in bridging these two conversations, we feel that both conversations are enriched.</p>

<title>Exception, trauma, panic</title>
<p>Our exceptional times are defined by the haunting images of 9/11: crashing planes, collapsing buildings, images of a burning Pentagon. One by one, the iconic symbols of assurance that defined the United States for decades – the World Trade Center being an economic figure and the Pentagon being a symbol of American military might – came under attack and highlighted the vulnerability of the American power against an unconventional enemy that transformed benign objects such as a passenger plane into weapons of mass destruction. While the events of 9/11 and what ensued were framed within the discourse of the ‘exceptional’, responses to those events, albeit being exceptional, were framed as rational, calculated and proportionate. However, not only the immediate period following the 9/11 events fell into the realm of the exceptional politics but also the exceptionalist formulations that emerged during that period have transformed what was once deemed to be the norm(al).</p>
<p>By definition, exceptional situations remain outside of the ordinary social/legal structure as demonstrated most recently and forcefully by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423594">Agamben (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368431011423594">2005</xref>). While the politics of exception has certain implications for the legal order – i.e. suspension of the law in order to protect the law and order – it also has an effect on the <italic>affect</italic> of the public. While the implications of the exception on the legal order are widely discussed by Agamben, the psychic impact of exception is ignored in his writings. Deeming an action or an event ‘exceptional’ requires an audience with emotional attachment to the object of that event or action, and the exceptionality of a situation also fuels the emotional response of the audience, thus placing emotion and exception in a co-productive cycle. This is important: the political practice of the invocation of the exception requires a <italic>prima facie</italic> affective relation, one that may be demonstrated by a legal connection but exceeds it. This is a strand of political analyses crucial to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368431011423594">Foucault’s (2007)</xref> understanding of power: the conjunction of disciplinary, sovereign, and biopolitical power relies on affect, confession, and other techniques of the self. Agamben’s engagement with the production of political life, focused as it is on the juridical primary of the sovereign, completely neglects the affective.</p>
<p>Yet as we have highlighted in the section on methodology, the questions surrounding the role of emotions in both the official and academic discourses surrounding the so-called ‘post-9/11 world’ of ours is very limited to analyses of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431011423594">Robin, 2004</xref>). The analysis of other affective registers have had a great impact on our work, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368431011423594">Saurette’s (2006)</xref> work on humiliation and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368431011423594">Rumford’s (2008)</xref> intervention on spaces of wonder. However, as we would like to demonstrate in this article, psychoanalysis provides an insight into the realm of emotions, desires and affects and demonstrates that these sidelined concepts do play an important role in shaping the ‘calculated’, ‘rational’ and ‘removed’ decisions that define the policy-making process. In particular, it is not simply fear as a thin concept that propels political action and policy adoption, but rather specific fantasies of what kind of (inter)acting in the world, can produce the kind of subject and the kind of community: (1) which repeats and then resolves the trauma; and (2) which is invulnerable to that fear.</p>
<p>Following scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011423594">Campbell (1992</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368431011423594">Shapiro (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368431011423594">2005</xref>), we are convinced that foreign policy constitutes national identity – and that we see in the construction of dangers, threats, and traumas the construction of the self through the construction of the Other. We are also persuaded by those post-colonial writers, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368431011423594">Fanon (1967</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423594">Bhabha (1994</xref>), who use psychoanalysis seriously in their study of the formation of personal and national identity. There is a very productive interface to this field which has not yet been explored to the fullest – the psychoanalytic analysis of national identity formation through foreign policy. Bloom’s early treatment leaves us with a project aimed to operationalize certain functions without a deep understanding of what we might term the national unconscious. In addition to using Campbell’s notion of the discursive economy – an account into which investments in language may be placed, interest withdrawn, etc. – we want to supplement Edkins’ notion of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423594">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011423594">2003</xref>) and the role of memory as particular transactions.</p>
<p>Freud’s discussion of trauma stems from his studies of hysteria. He posits with Breuer some ‘universal’ characteristics of traumatic events, which are the causes of hysteria: ‘all of a distressing nature, calculated to arouse the affects of shame, of self-reproach, of psychical pain, and the feeling of being harmed … that one would rather forget’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423594">Breuer and Freud, 1991</xref>: 57). The difference between the healthy and hysterical functioning of the psyche is that<disp-quote>
<p>in the normal course of things, if an experience is accompanied by a large amount of ‘affect’, that affect is either ‘discharged’ in a variety of conscious reflex acts or becomes gradually worn away by association with other conscious material. In the case of hysterical patients … neither of these things happens. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368431011423594">Richards, 1991</xref>: 37)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The affect presents itself in physical and psychic symptoms disconnected from the original event (fainting, headaches, phantom pain, abnormal social relations, etc.). Thus, the trauma involves violence or assault in some way to inflict not only pain, but shame and self-reproach. If that trauma is not discharged or worn away, then the affect surfaces in obtuse ways, disrupting the social and psychic life of the patient.</p>
<p>In seeking a cure, Breuer and Freud contend that the ‘talking cure’ provides relief in cases which have no physiological cause. ‘Each hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bring clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing the accompanying affect’ (1991: 57). Freud himself is clear that this working through is not accidental or facile, but requires genuine ‘psychical work … to overcome a psychical force in the patients which was opposed to the pathogenic ideas becoming conscious’ (1991: 353).</p>
<p>Trauma represents a violent shock, along with a sense of betrayal (and humiliation). Edkins and others discuss the politics at stake in forgetting or remembering 9/11 in a particular way. We want to neither ‘forget 9/11’, as provocatively suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368431011423594">Zehfuss (2003</xref>) nor ‘not forget … trauma’ as articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423594">Edkins (2002</xref>: 249). By taking greater account of the psychoanalytic view of trauma – and in particular the therapeutic resolution of trauma – we want to argue that in addition to the ideographic processes suggested by Edkins (securitization, criminalization, aestheticization and politicization), we must also look at the identification processes generated by trauma. In addition to drawing into fundamental question the constitution of the sacrificed and vengeful ‘we’, we must ask about the material responses to the 9/11 attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368431011423594">Zehfuss, 2003</xref>: 519). Under the guise of the War on Terror (WoT), American and Canadian authorities have implemented a series of security measures to make the border ‘smarter’, notably the implementation of biometric identity documents in passports and at ports and surveillance by UAV Predator drones.</p>
<p>These precautions can be seen as an American ‘acting out’ of the trauma of 9/11 as the foreign policy is a continuing memorial in statecraft to the attacks. In the WoT, we see a number of manifestations of the acting out of trauma. We see a kind of national repetition compulsion, which Freud identified as the continuous and unconscious recreation of the traumatic act – in order to deal with it; fix the trauma. While Freud read this compulsion in dreams and hallucinations, he also saw it in social relations. Creating a situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, where American citizens would be subject to terror attacks (from insurgent terrorists) provides us with a psychoanalytic vantage from which to say that the object of the WoT is to recreate the trauma of 9/11 – both in visiting the same kind of randomized violence by Americans on others and in fixing the violence perpetrated on Americans by others through the application of the very military power which was so impotent before. We see the substitution of the abject victims of 9/11 with abject victims of foreigners. Kristeva links the formation of identity through the notion of the abject – which seems an essential connection to the memorialization of trauma, the politics of memory, and the figure of the <italic>homo sacer</italic> or <italic>Musulman</italic>. In the rejection of the bodily, the scatological, and death, we assert the self:<disp-quote>
<p>Ostensibly, the abject is ‘opposed to I’; it is made up of those elements that transgress and threaten the clean and proper body, that are alien to the bounded body/subject. At the same time, however, the regulation and exclusion of the abject enable the assertion of self. In this way, the existence of the abject both threatens and enables the assertion of a unified subjectivity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368431011423594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This eruption of the ‘Real’ into life threatens the symbolic order – the viewing of a corpse reminds us of our own death, which requires continual repression: ‘The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life. Abject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431011423594">Kristeva, 1982</xref>: 4). We would argue that the image of the planes colliding is already a substitute for the images of individuals leaping to their death from the buildings of the WTC. Not only were these images among the very few live images to be censored, but the image and the helplessness this desperate act illustrates have been all but excised from the national memorializations of the attacks. We see, instead of the praising of first-responders, who though sacrificed expressed intention and will, the substitution of the foreign abject for the domestic abject – the substitution of the victims of war in Afghanistan and Iraq (and Indonesia, Pakistan, Guantánamo Bay, etc.) for the individuals who leapt to their death from the WTC. Judith Butler details the ways in which the US administration did not hide from the conditions of imprisonment in GITMO – but produced the photographs of the prisoners ‘rendered faceless and abject, likened to caged and restrained animals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431011423594">Butler, 2004</xref>: 73). Butler’s early work on <italic>Antigone</italic> is crucial here – the mourned death, the death that may be grieved, the death which provokes grieving and melancholy is the human life: the death that cannot be mourned or grieved is ‘bare life’. In Agamben’s words, it is the life that can be killed but not sacrificed. Butler again contends that ‘[t]here are no obituaries or the war casualties that the United States inflicts, there cannot be. If there were to be an obituary, there would have had to have been a life, a life worth noting, a life worth valuing and preserving, a life that qualifies for recognition’ (2004: 34).</p>
<p>Rather than fulfilling a ‘pharmacotic’ catharsis of trauma, which ‘permit[s] governments to draw on the singular capacity of sacralized bloodshed to unify political communities and generate fungible political power, by orchestrating symbolically charged military operations against demonized foreign enemies, while scapegoating constructed domestic threats to internal security’, these actions illustrate the extent to which American national identity is frozen – glued to the images it dare not watch and cannot express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368431011423594">George, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While trauma was an important element of the post-9/11 anxieties of the American psyche, another source for these anxieties was panic. Panic lies at the root of group psychology, identified late in the nineteenth century by Freud and leBon. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423594">Kernberg (1976</xref>: 247): ‘A potential exists in all of us for activation of primitive levels of psychological functioning when the ordinary social structure is lost, when ordinary social roles are suspended.’ Following the events that occurred on 11 September 2001, the ordinary social structure or the so-called ‘American way of life’ came under attack, as a ‘gut instinct’ the officials in the Bush administration felt the need to shut down the US-Canada border.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis also reinforces the importance of boundaries –between the inside and the outside of the body, in the persistence of disgust for the abject, the canny and the uncanny, between the self and civilization. As such, it is a wonder that psychoanalysts or political psychologists have not looked at national border functions, particularly when those functions are so important for anthropology and sociology, not to mention border studies.</p>
<p>In the case of 9/11, when the boundary between national inside/outside was breached in the attacks – all the more so because the attacks originated from within the United States, and the civil aviation, the very circulatory system – it is not a surprise that the reaction of policy-makers was to shut it all down: airspace, public space, and national borders with Canada and Mexico. Shutting down the border permanently – let alone temporarily – was unimaginable due to the economic costs associated with such an action – with costs up to $1 million per hour for some companies. How then to reassert normality, to draw the national line anew in a way that would erase the vulnerability made so evident in the puncture of the terror attacks?</p>
<p>Since 9/11, both the US and Canadian governments have invested a significant amount of money, time and effort to make the US-Canada border ‘smarter’. Notably the implementation of biometric identity documents in passports and at (air)ports, the creation of frequent-traveler programs, such as NEXUS or TWIC, and surveillance by UAV Predator drones have all been presented as ways that have improved the (in)security situation at the border. Yet, even the implementation of these new ‘technologies’ did not necessarily improve the quality of security and has resulted in very little evident or measurable increase in either security or economic flows. We believe that psychoanalysis and more specifically phantasy, object-relations theory and phantastic objects can help us understand the rationale behind the post-9/11 security measures at the US-Canada border.</p>

<title>Anxiety, phantasy, objects</title>
<p>The trauma of 9/11 in the American psyche represented a rupture in the dominant triumphalist accounts of the late 1990s. Consequently, the post-9/11 world embodies symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anger, hypervigilance and avoidance of the stimuli (images, representations, histories of the day of 9/11) are all symptoms of PTSD and have all in one way or another shaped the nature, intensity or reasoning of events/actions that happened since. The use of steel from the World Trade Center in the construction of a U.S. Navy war ship (<italic>USS New York</italic>) is symbolic of an attempt to re-figure the visible proof of vulnerability into a market of power. Rather than occurring at the individual level, the post-9/11 PTSD affected a nation and (re)shaped the American foreign policy while (re)shaping the American identity. These re-articulations have tried to balance death drives and erotic desires. Due to its paradoxical nature, stuck between economic efficiency and security concerns, these desires and anxieties manifest themselves at the border. In psychoanalytic terms, the international border functions like the limit between the self/Other. In the case of the US-Canada border, both governments have adopted new policies, technologies and gadgets to improve the feeling of security.</p>
<p>Melanie Klein’s work on psychoanalysis and object-relations theory – i.e. phantastic objects – present an interesting perspective into understanding how certain technologies/objects such as biometric passports and UAV drones were implemented to fulfill our unconscious desires to be secure and prosperous simultaneously. Moreover, these technologies not only satisfied American anxieties but at the same time they have re-affirmed if not re-created the desires that shape the image of a safe United States. In this regard, Klein’s use of the term phantasy is a good starting point to understand the role of the unconscious/subliminal in shaping the ‘Real’.</p>
<p>While fantasies are desired objects, phantasies are desired objects that reflect a particular version of the self and the world in which the need for the object is always already fulfilled. We may want youth, affluence, and freedom – and have a fantasy of revisiting our adolescence – but the phantastic object we focus on is the (red fast) sports car that is a sign for youth, affluence, and freedom. Thus, the phantasy involves a vision of the self that does not need the fantasy. According to Susan Isaacs, ‘Phantasy is the mental corollary, the psychic representative of instinct … there is no impulse, no instinctual urge, which is not experienced as (unconscious) phantasy’ (1952: 208). That is to say, our instinctual desires are shaped by phantasies that are in return formed in relation to our fears, anxieties, pains as well as joys, desires and satisfaction. ‘Phantasies are in their simple beginnings, implicit meaning, latent in impulse, affect and sensation’ (1952: 202–3).</p>
<p>We start developing phantasies as an infant when we are forced to ‘deal with the impact of reality, starting with the experience of birth itself and proceeding to endless experiences of gratification and frustration of his desires. These reality experiences immediately influence and are influenced by unconscious phantasy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368431011423594">Segal, 1973</xref>: 14). Yet, unlike Freudian conscious fantasies, Kleinian phantasy operates at the unconscious level. In other words, a phantasy ‘connotes unconscious mental content which may never or seldom become conscious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423594">Issacs, 1952</xref>: 208). This is not, however, to say that phantasy is unreal. Based on Freud’s analysis of psychic reality, Isaacs argues that rather than placing phantasy in opposition to reality, we must understand the value of ‘the inner reality of mind’ in order to understand the value of phantasies as objects of analysis. This is especially the case as ‘the phantasy is fully active in the normal’ or the Real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423594">Isaacs, 1952</xref>: 202–3). The relationship between the reality/conscious and the phantasy/unconscious is an important relationship to understand as it has a direct impact on how we interact with the outside world as well as how that outside world shapes our inner psyche. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368431011423594">Segal (1973</xref>: 15) wrote: ‘If unconscious phantasy is constantly influencing and altering the perceptions or interpretations of reality, the converse also holds true: reality impinges on unconscious phantasy.’</p>
<p>While there are many different manifestations of phantasies – some internal and some external – in general we attach our phantasies to external objects. Our relationship to certain objects gives us comfort. The sub-branch of psychoanalysis called object-relations theory studies our relation with objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423594">Bion, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423594">Kernberg, 1976</xref>). When studied in relation to Kleinian phantasy, object-relations theory results in the study of phantastic objects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368431011423594">Tuckett and Taffler (2008</xref>) suggest that phantastic objects are invested with the fulfillment of our unconscious desires, and a vision of the self in which those desires are met. The relationship between an infant and her/his mother is a good example of phantasy and phantastic objects in action. In order to protect ourselves from the anxiety associated with such instances as ‘[t]he first hunger and the instinctual striving to satisfy that hunger’, we developed ‘the phantasy of an object capable of satisfying that hunger’ which in this case is the mother and the breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368431011423594">Segal, 1973</xref>: 13). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423594">Klein (1946</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368431011423594">2002</xref>) argues that the relationship with the object comes to be understood as an external object of the desire. Similarly it can be argued that insecurities associated with the socio-economic and political climate following 9/11 required a set of phantastic objects to make Americans – and those that sought comfort in American security i.e. most of the world – feel secure again, restore their national identity and re-place themselves in relation to the ‘outside’ world through a focus on a particular set of security objects.</p>
<p>While such a reasoning – a reaction – might seem logical to some, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011423594">Likierman (2001</xref>: 86–7) highlights through her account of Klein’s clinical observations on George, a patient of Klein’s, reliance on phantasies might delay our adjustment to the outside world and reality. In George’s case<disp-quote>
<p>[A]nxiety was warded off by a noticeable exclusion of reality enacted in his play interminable battles in which he was always the winner. These served as an escape from his dissatisfaction with everyday situations. George could not handle the ordinary frustrations of daily life, was made excessively angry by them … Klein realized that his daydreaming about heroic conquests was serving to distance from himself disturbing feelings created by his anger and paranoid anxieties. To this end ‘wish-fulfillment clearly predominated over recognition of daily reality’. However, far from helping George to cope, his escape into phantasies’ omnipotent heroism only served to delay his adjustment to the world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011423594">Likierman, 2001</xref>: 86–7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly, the official response of the Bush administration to 9/11 has a lot in common with the other George’s phantasies. In both cases, both Georges aspired to adopt a heroic persona to ‘ward of anxiety’. In George W. Bush’s case, his administration adopted a discourse and a set of practices – a security assemblage – both at home and abroad, to make Americans ‘feel’ secure again. At times, the message of heroism moved beyond the realm of the subliminal and become overt. This was the case with ‘the Mission Accomplished incident’, when President Bush landed on <italic>USS Abraham Lincoln</italic> in a Lockheed S-3 Viking plane in full combat gear and giving a – premature – speech to inform the public of the end of major combat operation in Iraq to the backdrop of a banner titled ‘Mission Accomplished’. Symbolism in this case was no longer subliminal as it once was with the appraisal of firefighters and first response teams arriving at the scene of the World Trade Center following the first plane crashing into the North Tower. In the mission accomplished incident, not only was the intention to assure the American public that the American military might – and thus American security – was restored following victory in Iraq – and Afghanistan – but that their leader, the president, was also capable of taking part in military activities such as landing a plane on an aircraft carrier due to his previous experience as a pilot in the air force reserves; thus he was a real American hero.</p>
<p>While the security itself was not achieved through this security assemblage, as a result of this process, the feeling of security was both anchored to and reaffirmed by: (1) the fact that ‘we’ have taken the war to ‘their’ home with the WoT – thus getting revenge while re-affirming the ‘us’ and ‘them’ distinction; and (2) ‘we’ have put in place a security assemblage at ‘home’ – consisting of the Patriot Act as a legal framework, as well as increased reliance of surveillance, biometrics, intelligence gathering, etc. – that is most clearly visible at the border – as an exceptional space where precaution is not simply a justification but rather the <italic>raison d’être</italic>.</p>
<p>This security assemblage as a whole was not simply a safeguard against future attacks on American soil but it was an attempt to repair the ‘safe’ and ‘secure’ image of the United States and American identity, removed from all the pain and suffering happening elsewhere in the world. ‘Before September 11 Westerners could have easily embraced the perception that they lived in a world of simulacra … But September 11 changed this optimism: suddenly human body and society itself appeared much more vulnerable again’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368431011423594">Salecl, 2004</xref>: 6). In other words, 9/11 was not just perceived as an attack against symbolic buildings in the US but it was an attack against the American psyche. 9/11 caused a level of anxiety only comparable to the Pearl Harbor attacks. If we take anxiety to arise ‘from the changed perception the subject has of him- or herself as well as from changes to their position in society at large’, only then we can grasp the level of anxiety caused by 9/11 on American psyche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368431011423594">Salecl, 2004</xref>: 2). Consequently, subliminal messages such as: ‘we will prevail’, ‘divided we stand, united we fall’ became common sight in political speeches and Hollywood films; two factors that have considerable impact on American social imaginary.</p>
<p>While, as mentioned above, the War on Terror was a national repetition compulsion that continuously and unconsciously recreates trauma without actually fixing – or internalizing trauma – the security measures on home soil – and the border – can be better understood through the Kleinian phantastic object. By investing in security technologies at the border – which coincidentally became the focus and source of our anxieties after 9/11 – the American and Canadian governments created phantastic objects that ‘tamper with the psychic reception of [danger]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011423594">Likierman, 2001</xref>: 86).</p>

<title>Post-9/11 security measures as phantastic objects</title>
<p>We can analyze the implementation of security measures put in place on the US border, particularly with Canada, since 9/11, according to this scheme of phantastic objects. Understood in this way, the security measures themselves serve two functions: first, they attempt to ‘fix’ the fundamental insecurity of open borders; second, they attempt to construct a particular version of America that has no need of border security measures.</p>
<p>The US-Canada border does not play as large a role in the contemporary American security imaginary as the Southern US-Mexico border. Illegal crossings are much fewer, and cases of border violence are much less frequent and less important. The illegal smuggling over the US-Canada border remains chiefly cigarettes and low-impact drug cases, rather than gun-fuelled drug violence and organized campaigns of illegal migration. Two misstatements have fueled the American anxiety about the Canadian border: an allegation that some of the 9/11 terrorist team infiltrated the US-Canada border, and an allegation that other terrorist groups have infiltrated the border. In the face of the public and bureaucratic attention, we can highlight a number of measures that were framed as responses to the 9/11 attacks, either in their intensification and rollout. We should note, however, that few of these policies are entirely cut from new cloth: the dream of perfect security and smart borders had included a number of these programs, before the attacks – 9/11 gave political capital to allow for the faster or wider securitization.</p>
<p>The new security measures include: robust, searchable, interconnected, secure identity documents; biometric captures and identification systems; the connection of facilitation and security through wide-scale data-mining, interoperable databases, and frontline examinations; trusted traveler programs that triage self-selected, less-risky border crossers; remote surveillance systems, including predator drones. Each of these measures creates, constructs, relies upon, and reinforces an image of an America that does not need those very security measures.</p>
<sec id="section6-1368431011423594">
<title>Identity documents</title>
<p>The US has implemented tighter rules and procedures for the identity documents required to enter the United States across the US-Canada border since 9/11. Initially, in the Smart Border Action Plan and the subsequent Smart Border Accord, both the US and Canada pledged to cooperate on secure identity documents. However, in 2004, as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Information Act, the US Congress passed the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). This unilateral policy required Canadians (and other western hemisphere nationals) to produce passports for their entry into the United States. While a Border Crossing Card scheme had long been used along the Southern border, and US-Canada border officials routinely allowed for other forms of identity documents, the WHTI required all entrants from Canada to produce a passport. The standards of the passports are set by ICAO, under heavy influence by the United States: the three most important features for this paper are: the information is machine-readable, inclusion of biometrics (facial photograph), and the documents themselves are very robust and tamper-resistant. It is important to know that passports have rarely been used to certify an individual’s security status, except in extreme cases, such as convicted felons or terror suspects. The passport is a guarantor of identity only, not intention, and allows states to easily monitor the interactions between that individual and law enforcement or intelligence agencies. What does this stricter security measure tell us about the image of America it attempts to secure? The requirement that Canada produce more passports demonstrates a belief (a phantasy) that foreign governments are: (1) willing to cooperate with the United States and will follow their internal edicts; and (2) are able and willing to verify the identity of their citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1368431011423594">
<title>Biometrics</title>
<p>Identity documents, particularly those using biometrics, are governmental tools that assist in connecting a body–an identifier–a dossier. Regardless of the technical sophistication of the final document, the initial dossier is formed with no biometric information whatsoever. Though a hospital may take a footprint of a newborn, no biometric information is collected on that child or connected to the dossier until much older. Biometrics, then, cannot assert a connection between a dossier–a body–and an identifier (a person, a narrative, a story) – biometrics can merely freeze the moment of congruity between different forms of identity – corporeal, bureaucratic, social. The certification on the back of the passport photo, for example, asks a guarantor if this person has been known under that name for two years. There is no claim by the guarantor – nor indeed by the state – that this is an absolute identity, only that this is a settled, established, socially-recognized identity. Officials at the US border capture facial biometrics and digital fingerprints, under the NSEERS and now US-VISIT Program. While native-born Canadians need not participate in this program, Canadians born in a suspect country or holding dual nationality must. The recent move to ten-fingerprint capture indicates a desire in the policing and intelligence communities to connect border crossers to wider databases. At airports in particular, the Department of Homeland Security is also trialing full-body scanners, heat-sensitive scanners, and behavioral profiling techniques. What does the increased emphasis on biometrics tell us about America’s security dream? Here, there is a reliance on technology itself to make the traveling body confess what its owner-operator may not, its intentions. There is an assumption that the body will tell a truth that the mind does not want to tell. Here, we see the tropes of visual policing – the panoptic sort – play out in terms of the observation and policing of the body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368431011423594">
<title>Trusted traveler program</title>
<p>The border security dilemma is one of high-reliability organization: there are a very high number of cases, with few outliers or failures, but the impact of those failures is astronomical. Each border crosser is examined for, on average, 30 seconds. But, as the forensic reports of the interactions of the 9/11 terrorists with the US Immigration Department demonstrated, it is extremely difficult to differentiate the risky from the less-risky (because of course in a risk-paradigm, there is no such thing as no-risk, only low-risk). The efficient way to manage this security risk is to preselect individuals and populations that are low-risk, verify their identity and authenticate a prima facie cause for travel, and then free the border bureaucracy from an intense examination of these low-risk travelers. On highway crossings, CANPASS and NEXUS members simply fill out a form self-declaring any customs claim, and merely slow down for inspection. At airports, special lanes are available. The Department of Homeland Security is advocating, both internally and externally, that the expansion of the NEXUS program holds the most promise for making the border smarter, freeing the time and resources of the border and intelligence officials to focus on unknown and high-risk travelers. What does this say about America’s security imaginary? In addition to a trust in their bureaucratic intelligence capabilities (wishful thinking at best), it marks a desired capacity to know, to be able to distinguish white hats from black. The trusted traveler programs also reveal a desire for a stability of guilt: that anti-American-ism can be defined, described, and detected. And crucially, those that are safe and trusted, stay safe and trusted (counter-indicated by the cases of John Walker Lindh, Jose Pedilla, Richard Reid, or perhaps more clearly the Beltway sniper, John Allen Muhammad, and the Oklahoma federal building bomber, Timothy McVeigh, both of whom were veterans who had fought in the Gulf War). The anxiety for the enemy inside, which haunts both the individual psyche and the national conscience, is revealed in the enthusiasm for a trusted travel program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1368431011423594">
<title>Databases</title>
<p>Following the additional collection of biometric data and the support for trusted traveler programs, the fundamental technology that supports these programs is a faith in the interconnection and interoperability of criminal and intelligence databases, epitomized in the National Terrorism Screening Center. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431011423594">Amoore and de Goede (2008</xref>) diagnose the wide-scale use of databases, algorithms for creating risk profiles, and what they term ‘transactional surveillance’. In addition to the shocking examples of the NSA’s tapping of the internet backbone in San Francisco or the wholesale surveillance of SWIFT financial transactions, intelligence agencies are also engaging in widespread trawling of private travel data, passenger name record data, and connecting that to broader profiles. Jeff Jonas, for example, a programmer for IBM, has created a system in which ‘data finds the questions’ and ‘data finds the data’. The inestimable complexity of the human conscience thus becomes a matter of statistical record. Similar to Asimov’s psycho-history, the American dream here is that surveillance and processing power can make risky travelers jump out of the chaos of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1368431011423594">
<title>Drones</title>
<p>As part of the increased policing of the US-Canada border (and in part to support a would-be mothballed US Air Force base in the Prairies), unmanned aerial vehicles, Predator drones, are flying above the Northern borderlands. While the actual numbers of cross-border smugglers (and particularly in the prairies) could not justify the expense, it is part of two new strategies for border enforcement. First, through the Smart Border Initiative (SBI), DHS through its contractor Boeing aims to increase surveillance and communications infrastructure along the US-Mexico and US-Canada border. While the trials of a fence/communication system in the American South have spectacularly failed and been over-budget, the use of UAVs has been widely hailed as a rousing success. The second trend is the use of military technologies for border policing, such as the use of sound- and movement detection equipment. The use of military technologies, and the assumption that border threats can be visually detected, feeds into the American imaginary that a military-technology complex can solve any ideological problem. In particular, the use of drones feeds into the American imaginary about the control of space leading to control of the ground, increasing surveillance.</p>
<p>In short, the vision of America that is promoted through these security measures (clearly does not need the security measures, but let us set that aside) is technophilic, liberal and individualist, and self-policing. It displaces the ideological questions of motivation for terrorists onto the technical questions of verification, authentication, and signal-detection. The American dream of border security is structured by the limits of knowledge: the radical uncertainty of fate is tamed through surveillance, the silent testimony of the body, and sheer processing power.</p>

<title>You’re never, ever there</title>
<p>The threat in this ‘post-9/11 security environment’ is not evident and ever-present – as it never is – but rather manifested itself in terms of the risk or possibility of another 9/11. Moreover, security provided by the implementation of these phantastic objects at the US-Canada border was not – by any stretch of the term – total. If contrasted with the literature on risk (management) and securitization theory, then this ‘security aporia’ results in what Aradau and Van Muenster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431011423594">2007</xref>: 101) call the ‘double infinity’ that involves – simultaneously – the ever-present presence of the threat of a catastrophic event, and the uncertainty around the form or time of that event. Second – but in relation to the first point – the border is where this ‘double-infinity’ manifests itself the clearest, due to the paradoxical nature of the border. Consequently, the border as a paradoxical object becomes an exceptional space where we need extraordinary security measures to provide a sense of security while maintaining a normalcy that allows for economic interactions to flourish. As mentioned earlier, (in)securities that have become associated with the political climate of the post-9/11 security landscape were already accompanied by a set of phantastic objects to make America feel secure again. In this (in)security environment defined by preemptive risk management, we have come to regard UAV drones, smart borders, biometric passports, visual surveillance techniques as phantastic objects.</p>
<p>Each of these programs, as with all phantastic objects, believe the very reality they seek to obscure. None of these security measures do provide border security; they cannot control the unforeseen, or guarantee improved security. Most simply cannot be measured, either in their positive or negative impact. The more and different border security measures adopted, the more that the absolute risk is certain. The tighter the passport requirements, the more documents required by commercial travelers, the more biometrics demanded, the more absurd it seems to fingerprint local boy scouts, the louder chambers of commerce along the border fight for trade, the more manufacturers and shippers advocate for more border crossing points. The more airport security makes passengers take off their shoes, empty their pockets, and put their liquids in a plastic bag, the more that passengers revel in the subversion of the security regime, the more they brainstorm the danger of everyday objects. A frustrated pilot, after being repeatedly examined at an airport security screening point, went into his plane and brought the fire-ax installed in his cockpit. The more ‘security’ tightens its grip, the more of everyday life slips through its fingers. As with the infant, the more the mother or the breast is available, the more the infant fears (and is angered by) its withdrawal.</p>
<p>There is a serious political and policy point that is illuminated by this psychoanalytic frame. The adoption of these measures – as with PTSD – delay the acceptance of reality and make more difficult (if not impossible) for the individual or the nation to come to terms with ‘reality’. Elaborate airport security measures are comforting to no one, because the real anxiety – the new normal – is that everyday objects that we considered benign were used to turn airplanes (themselves benign everyday objects) into spectacular weapons of mass destruction. Rather than face a politicization of the civil aviation system, or the border system as such, we have seen an investment in security measures that do little except highlight their inefficacy and inefficiency</p>
