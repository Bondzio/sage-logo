<abstract>
<p>Portfolios have long been a staple in professional writing courses: both in employment materials assignments and in entire classes that ask students to reflect on their experiential learning. Portfolios may also be used effectively in business communication teaching methods courses. This article details the justification and methodology for having a teaching portfolio as the capstone assignment in a business communication pedagogy course. It also explains how this portfolio may be used to anticipate programmatic assessment and verification of entry-level business communication courses during the accreditation process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Professional writing relies heavily on experiential learning, which typically gained through internships and co-ops. In courses with an experiential, or components experiential learning component or activities, students are often asked to reflect thoughtfully on their educational experiences in journals or, more commonly, in portfolios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569912470488">Dubinsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569912470488">Graves &amp; Epstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1080569912470488">Worley, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>I use a variation of the reflective portfolio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569912470488">Brammer (2011)</xref> describes in my graduate business communication teaching methods course. My students create a teaching portfolio, which serves as the capstone assignment for the course. This assignment introduces my graduate students, teaching assistants, and adjunct instructors to business communication theory and practice; allows them to codify their approach to teaching the discipline; and instructs them in teaching business communication within the structure of verifiable, measureable learning goals and outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1080569912470488">
<title>Composition and Structure of the Teaching Portfolios</title>
<p>The structure of these portfolios is the same as the reports and manuals students are often asked to create in a business communication classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569912470488">Rupert &amp; Loudermilk, 2002</xref>), namely, 10 to 20 pages of written material that may include manuals, brochures, handbooks, lab reports, proposals, or electronic documents.</p>
<p>I ask that they publish it as a PDF, include transmittal correspondence, and set the pagination according to business report format with front matter numbered with small Roman numerals and body text with Arabic numbers.</p>
<p>Their completed teaching portfolios have the following elements in this order:</p>
<list id="list1-1080569912470488" list-type="order">

</list>
<sec id="section3-1080569912470488">
<title>Sectional Fly Pages With Advance Organizers</title>
<p>The fly page summaries mirror the advance organizer approach to teaching that promotes the learning and retention of new, difficult, and technical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569912470488">Ausubel &amp; Fitzgerald, 1962</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1080569912470488">
<title>Statement of Teaching Philosophy</title>
<p>I ask that they speak to our university’s Quality Enhancement Plan, which stresses engaged learning, into their teaching philosophies. I emphasize that our business communication curriculum should encourage our students to blend the theoretical with the practical and thus bridge the college or university to the world of work.</p>
<p>This curriculum allows students to develop the following proficiencies:</p>
<list id="list2-1080569912470488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Communicate effectively with a variety of audiences</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practice collaborative efforts</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Connect the principles covered in the classroom to real-world projects</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>View their positions within corporate structures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Develop organizational skills in project management</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Understand the need for experiential and engaged learning by including community engagement/service-learning assignments and projects in the curriculum</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Formulate a responsible, humanistic system of ethics</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Course Content Guides</title>
<p>Instructional goals and outcomes assessment has become increasingly important at universities and colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569912470488">Chrysler &amp; Van Auken, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569912470488">Mitri, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569912470488">Salegna &amp; Bantham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569912470488">Taylor, 2002</xref>). CCGs for business communication courses provide a concise description of each course, its topical areas, instructional goals, and expected outcomes. These standards outline a course’s policies and curricular design and, most important, detail the course’s methods of evaluation and assessment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1080569912470488">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Verification and Validation</title>
<p>For a CCG to be a verifiable assessment tool, all instructors of a particular business communication course must strictly adhere to its standards: the learning goals, educational outcomes, and methods of assessment established at the programmatic level by members of the business writing faculty or the program director. My students must adapt their classroom assignments, exercises, and exams to the learning outcomes and objectives listed in the CCG.</p>
<p>To provide evidence of student learning, the business communication course should use a variety of methods of assessment: direct, indirect, quantitative, and qualitative measurements of the instructional goals and educational outcomes.</p>
<list id="list4-1080569912470488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Direct Measurements</italic>: Standardized pretests and posttests, graded assignments directly related to learning outcomes, and examinations.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section7-1080569912470488">
<title>Annotated Syllabus and Course Description</title>
<p>I ask them to compose and design a three- to five-page annotated course description and syllabus for their business communication course. The assignment specifications dictate that this document includes the following:</p>

</list>
<p>In at least three pages accompanying the syllabus and course description, they must theoretically justify the purpose, scope, organization, and course assignments, as well as show how the course fulfills the instructional goals and learning objectives described in the CCG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1080569912470488">
<title>Assignment Sheet with Specifications for Each Assignment</title>
<p>I ask that they compose a detailed assignment sheet for their course. These assignments should be clearly related to the instructional goals, student outcomes, and methods of evaluation outlined in the CCG:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1080569912470488">
<title>Three Sample Lesson Plans</title>
<p>Each sample lesson plan should cover specific goals. I ask that their plans be thorough enough so that another instructor could teach the class in their absence. To receive full credit, each lesson plan must include the following elements, which I suggest they use as headings:</p>
<list id="list6-1080569912470488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Summary: This element previews what will happen in the lesson.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Materials: This element lists whatever materials are needed to conduct the lesson.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Instructor Input: This element describes what the instructor will do or say at various points during the lesson. This may be lecturing, giving directions, or guiding students through an activity. It provides a general outline of what the instructor will say, rather than word-for-word detail. I prefer they insert “instructor input” wherever it would occur, rather than describing it all in one place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Guided Practice: This element describes the activities they will do with students, together as a class, one-on-one, or in groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Independent Practice: This element describes the activities that students will do independently, either in or outside of class.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rationale: This element provides a 300- to 350-word statement in which they explain (a) how the various activities in the plan address the specific goals that they have specified and (b) how their plan reflects their teaching philosophy.</p></list-item>

<p>They may choose from a variety of topics for their lesson plans, but they must justify how the topics they choose will meet the learning objectives and outcomes detailed in the CCG:</p>

<sec id="section10-1080569912470488">
<title>Podcast Lesson Supplement</title>
<p>Because research has shown that students may need alternative teaching styles to traditional classroom instruction and that multimodal instruction can markedly improve learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1080569912470488">Schilling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1080569912470488">Vigentini, 2009</xref>), I ask my students to create a 10- to 15-minute video podcast to supplement one of their lesson plans. They can then post these podcasts to Blackboard, our course delivery program, for students to download and view at their own pace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1080569912470488">
<title>WWW Resources Review</title>

<title>Oral Presentation</title>
<p>At the conclusion of the semester, they present one of their lesson plans to the class. They share their lesson plans with the other members of the class, which significantly reduces their preparation time for teaching the course.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A pedagogy course such as this is useful for a number of individuals:</p>
<list id="list8-1080569912470488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Where there are business communication courses taught by adjunct faculty</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Where graduate teaching assistants teach entry-level business writing courses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In small programs or departments with few business communication faculty</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Along with the obvious benefits for instructors new to the field of business communication, the teaching methods course provides a scaffold for new instructors to codify their educational philosophy, such as teaching within a technological framework, incorporating community engagement and service-learning activities into their classrooms, developing workplace computer literacies, and stressing the importance of experiential learning.</p>
<p>In the reappointment and tenure review process, the pedagogy course provides the basis for integrating teaching and scholarship within the Boyer model of the scholarship of teaching.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>According to Boyer, the elements that define teaching as a scholarly activity are mastery of the subject being taught, knowledge of pedagogical methods that have been proven effective at promoting learning and skill development, and commitment to continuing personal growth as an educator. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569912470488">Felder, 2000</xref>, p. 144)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, in establishing teaching standards, the pedagogy course later provides for instructor-level improvement and establishes a baseline for assessment and measuring programmatic effectiveness during the accreditation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569912470488">Cunningham &amp; Omolayole, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1080569912470488">Nichols &amp; Nichols, 2000</xref>).</p>
