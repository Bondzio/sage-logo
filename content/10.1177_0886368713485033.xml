<p>This was prompted by a recent exchange with Gerry Ledford, one of the members of the Advisory Board. Our discussion focused on the critics and research claiming that financial rewards diminish intrinsic motivation and can cause problems. He and I agree that the research is, in my words, simplistic and ignores too many highly relevant factors. But it continues, and it reaches a large, apparently receptive, audience. My purpose in writing is to argue that the many blogs and columns repeating the criticism are undermining our credibility and our organizational influence.</p>
<p>The most prominent of the current critics is Daniel Pink and his book, <italic>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</italic>. A Google search on his name produced 47 million hits, with most repeating his argument as if it is gospel. He condemns financial rewards, arguing the practice kills creativity and can have a negative impact on overall performance. As is typical of the critics, he offers no practical alternatives.</p>
<p>My concern is not that the critics will trigger the end of financial rewards in industry; that philosophy is deeply entrenched throughout the world. But the criticism affects the impact of compensation specialists and also feeds resistance to pay for performance in government at a time when agencies at all levels are being pressured to improve performance.</p>
<p>Although I find reading research papers to be tedious, I had to dig out and read those relevant to this argument as background for a report I drafted for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, advocating pay for performance in government. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has 34 member countries and publishes reports on a variety of government issues. (The report is in editing.) The report will, I am certain, have its own critics.</p>
<p>I have also worked as a consultant on pay for performance for the United Nation’s International Civil Service Commission. The people in those meetings were proponents of pay for performance.</p>
<p>I mention that to support this statement, I have discussed pay for performance with representatives from countries as diverse as Russia, Sierra Leone, Mexico, and Japan. No one has opposed pay for performance for their government. The transition for public employers has been ongoing for almost 20 years, albeit slowly and with missteps. The Great Recession brought the changes to a temporary halt, although the contract for my report confirms that the interest continues. There have been problems in implementation, but there is virtually no evidence that public employers have dropped the idea. The continuing support is important because it repudiates the critics.</p>
<p>As a former political speech writer, Daniel Pink has no credentials in this arena, but his argument is influencing far too many people. Another similarly prominent critic some years ago was Alfie Kohn. He had his 15 minutes but had virtually no impact and has been forgotten. Significantly, I am not aware of a critic whose experience would make him or her an “expert” or who has had meaningful experience managing people.</p>
<p>Kohn displayed his naïveté and lack of experience in arguing that all extrinsic rewards are a problem. What he did not seem to realize is that every organization uses rewards of some type, if nothing more than praise from a supervisor. He also did not acknowledge that people like to be recognized for their contribution.</p>
<p>Pink’s argument is better stated, although his answer on pay is also naive—“Pay more than average.” He claims that “higher wages could actually <italic>reduce</italic> a company’s costs.” That is his solution.</p>
<p>He also lists “the seven deadly flaws” of “carrots and sticks” or extrinsic rewards. With each he is careful to always include the word <italic>can</italic> to suggest it’s only a possibility. Frankly there is some truth to each; problems can emerge, especially when financial rewards are large. He is correct, for example, that financial incentives “can foster short-term thinking” or “encourage cheating, shortcuts and unethical behavior.”</p>
<p>His argument is based on the research of Dr. Edward Deci, who is credited with recognizing the importance of intrinsic satisfaction as a powerful source of motivation. His conclusions were based largely on student experiments but have been confirmed in hundreds of studies. The caveat is that the research where rewards are at issue has focused on simple tasks in artificial situations.</p>
<p>That is best illustrated in the opening chapter of Pink’s book, which is largely devoted to a Deci experiment where students rearranged blocks—with their performance rewarded with what today is equivalent to $6. He also discusses an experiment with monkeys. Both the students and the monkeys apparently experienced intrinsic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Actually, for anyone who works in compensation, his statements undermine his credibility. In his book, he makes sweeping statements, lumping together “merit” salary increases, bonuses, profit sharing and so on. By implication, individual and group incentives are equally bad. But then in an interview on sales compensation, he stated, “Again, I’m not saying that commissions are inherently bad.” In his writing, he makes a huge leap from the possibility of problems to his broad condemnation of financial rewards.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368713485033">
<title>Work Is Not an Experiment</title>
<p>One of the obvious differences in comparing laboratory experiments with a real-world work situation is that the focus is extremely short term. The entire “work experience” often lasts less than an hour. Deci’s experiment with students was timed in minutes.</p>
<p>In contrast, most incentives, with the exception of those in sales, are typically paid out at the end of the year. The critics are essentially arguing that an individual’s reaction to the manipulation of an artificial task in a tightly controlled lab setting is a meaningful indicator of how year-end incentives will affect employees. That, for me, is not credible. There are many, particularly the knowledge jobs, that provide intrinsic satisfaction despite incentives.</p>
<p>The performance of people at work is affected by many additional factors—skills, supervisors, internal communications, relationships with coworkers and so on. Moreover, the variety of financial rewards defies cross-organization comparisons. Work settings are very different from controlled lab experiments. The complexity and organizational differences make it virtually impossible to isolate the impact of reward practices on performance.</p>
<p>For the critics to be correct, the intrinsic motivation would be “crowded out” (one of the newer theories) throughout the year because of the year-end payments. Yes, as a consultant has who lived with the prospect of nice year-end checks, I acknowledge the money was in the back of my mind throughout the year. I suspect I’m not unique and that other professionals—lawyers, physicians and so on—continue to be motivated by the satisfaction from the work itself despite the financial rewards.</p>
<p>Ledford made me aware of research showing that incentives can actually increase intrinsic satisfaction when it reinforces an individual’s sense of competence and self-control. My guess is it’s true when employees feel like “winners.” My reading of the literature suggests also that incentives can reinforce one’s sense of competence when they are used to reinforce and encourage skill development.</p>
<p>Yes, reward policies are in some organizations poorly conceived or managed, and they can also motivate inappropriate behavior. That’s been documented in many publications. The solution of course is to regularly assess the policies to confirm that employees are responding as expected. It’s unfortunate that so much space is devoted to failed policies when there are so many success stories.</p>

<title>Some Jobs Are Well Suited to Incentives</title>
<p>We have all had jobs that were monotonous. Actually, most jobs require the completion of at least a few tasks that are distasteful or boring. There are a lot of them, although automation has eliminated many. I built truck tires for two summers in a tire factory. It was not pleasant work, especially from 4 p.m. to midnight, but the pay made college possible.</p>
<p>The company relied on a piece rate system that I read about later in one of my graduate school textbooks. It did not affect our wages but rather was used to control our output. The system defined a “day’s work”; that is to say, the minimum expected output.</p>
<p>It worked, I guess; after a few weeks I was able to meet the quota in less than 8 hours. At that point we were free to read books, play cards and so on. I wanted to go home.</p>
<p>I am sure systems like that influence employee work efforts. I definitely was not motivated by intrinsic satisfaction. Incentives serve a proven purpose with certain types of jobs. Building those tires convinced me that a broad condemnation of incentives is misguided.</p>
<p>Jobs like that can be found in many industries. The introduction of individual as well as group incentives can increase performance and gain solid acceptance. Again, those stories should be told.</p>

<title>Unanswered Questions</title>
<p>We all live with incentives. They are universal in marketing; we see them every time we walk into a store. We use them with our children and with our pets. Those gold stars that Alfie Kohn criticized have been a standard practice in schools for generations.</p>
<p>Piece rate systems were a mainstay in the early factories. Those plans were designed to control how workers performed their jobs. The goal of scientific management was to make certain that worker movements were productive, and factories relied on incentives as the control mechanism.</p>
<p>Incentives, however, are also used as a reward for accomplishments. The Olympic gold medals and the “most valuable player” awards do not control, but the prospect of winning an award inspires a lot of athletes. We select the best performers in many venues. Those “employee of the month” plaques serve the same purpose. Those gold stars also reward accomplishments. That is different from the goal of control. My hunch is those gold medal winners experience high levels of intrinsic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Incentives motivate behavior; that is indisputable. Sometimes they are so powerful that they motivate good people to break laws or otherwise behave in unethical or questionable ways. The subprime mortgage crisis will be a case in business schools for years. At a much lower level, Sears auto mechanics were caught several years ago overcharging customers to earn incentives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problems are not limited to corporate compensation arrangements. Physicians and lawyers have been known to double bill and pad bills to increase their income. There have been movies based on the premise that people will sometimes behave in questionable ways to earn money. The 1993 film <italic>Indecent Proposal</italic> focuses on Demi Moore’s character’s reaction to an offer of $1 million.</p>
<p>One central unanswered research questions is this—How much is too much? Would Demi Moore’s character have responded differently if the amount was $10,000—or $100. Would an individual now paid a salary of $50,000 and eligible for an incentive of $50,000 behave differently if the salary is $90,000 and the incentive $10,000? Would the crisis on Wall Street have been as disastrous with more modest incentives? We simply do not know the answers, but this is central to the critics’ argument.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was offered a job by a high-flying company where I was interviewed by an executive who I was told held options worth considerably more than he had ever earned and was so distracted that he was no longer a good manager. A similar problem occasionally happens to athletes who sign large contracts. It can happen.</p>
<p>Money has been used as an incentive for centuries. There is an almost universal expectation that employees will respond to the prospect of earning more money. Our discussions at times seem to assume that employees will react to incentives in the same way Pavlov’s dogs salivated when they expected food. The role of incentives is reflected in economic theory—but our assumptions are often simplistic.</p>
<p>Another unanswered question for researchers is how the large payouts to the stars—the A players—affect the behavior and commitment of the B players. With reduced bonus and salary increase budgets, the “experts” have been arguing for channeling available funds to reward the stars. The goal of course is to recognize their value—and hopefully retain them. If, and this is an important “if,” they are dissatisfied, however, it’s unlikely a pay increase is going to hold them. The true stars can generally find another job, with higher pay, if that’s what they are seeking.</p>
<p>In developing a policy to reward the A players, it would be useful to consider how it will affect the B players—the 70% in the middle under forced distribution policies—who carry the bulk of the workload. When they learn their peers, possibly their friends, were rewarded with twice as much money or with options worth thousands, is it reasonable to expect them to be pleased, to feel that they were treated fairly? Of course we want all employees to increase their work effort so they qualify for awards, but that is likely to be more textbook than reality.</p>
<p>The unanswered question is how the knowledge of awards paid to high performers affects the performance of other employees. A related question is how those other employees react when payouts are based on questionable performance ratings or they believe favoritism and bias are issues. Their silence does not mean all is well. Those situations are far too common.</p>
<p>Losing the emotional commitment of the B players could be a lot more costly than the resignations of a few A players. Again the research does not provide the answer.</p>
<p>We also do not know how employees at different career stages react to incentives. Does the veteran worker react in the same way as a trainee? Men and women could also react differently. If researchers have studied those issues, I missed the reports.</p>
<p>These unanswered questions would not be as important if employers could fall back on the old policy of demanding everything be kept confidential, but that era ended long ago. Now it is likely that everyone will quickly learn who received awards. Recently the media has reported the high percentages of employees who would like to change employers or who are “actively disengaged,” to use Gallup’s phrase. Some of their discontent has to be associated with the way pay has been managed for the past 4 years. Retaining the best performers is certainly smart business, but the cost could be high.</p>

<title>Rewards Are Indispensable</title>
<p>Both Pink and Kohn ignored the fact that every organization uses extrinsic rewards—and they cannot be totally eliminated. Bob Nelson’s book, <italic>1001 Ways to Reward Employees</italic>, highlights the many forms. My experience tells me they are central to creating and sustaining a culture in which performance is a priority.</p>
<p>At the same time, I agree with the argument of one of the recent authors in this journal, Andre de Waal, PhD, the director of the HPO Center associated with the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands. He studied roughly 1,500 organizations and summarized his conclusions in the article “Bonuses Don’t Matter . . . in High Performance Organizations.” His research shows that bonus systems are not a distinguishing factor in creating high-performance organizations. Reward systems are important to the fabric of a successful organization, but there are many forms and the key is that a reward system has to be perceived as fair and appropriate for the organization, its values and its strategy.</p>
<p>His conclusions are consistent with a common thread in the descriptions of employers selected as the “Best Places to Work.” Employees want to feel valued, and reward systems play a vital role. I cannot imagine an employer in any sector that would be seen by its employees as a best place to work if extrinsic rewards were eliminated. These and thousands of other companies not on the “best places” lists rely on policies that reward employees for their contribution.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is some truth in the research. One point that jumps out is that organizations with high inequality tend to be relatively poor performers. That frankly does not surprise me. There is always a shared concern with fairness.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge that there can be problems. As Steve Kerr argued in a classic 1975 article, “On the Folly of Rewarding A While Hoping for B,” incentives can trigger unanticipated employee behavior. It should be standard practice to evaluate reward practices periodically and to take the steps necessary to enhance their impact. When problems emerge, employees want to know problems will be addressed—but they also like those bonus checks.</p>
<p>There is no reason to sit silently while Pink and other critics condemn our field. We can and should refute their claims although we first need to assemble solid evidence. We should also encourage research and articles that highlight those situations where rewards contributed to a company’s success. There are many.</p>
