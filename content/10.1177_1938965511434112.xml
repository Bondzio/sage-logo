<abstract>
<p>Given the twin objectives of ensuring consistent quality and controlling costs, quick-service restaurants have been in the forefront of automating their operations whenever possible. This article explores a novel approach to achieving these two objectives by using modern robotics technologies to improve operations. Instead of applying robotics technology for direct labor replacement, robotics can augment workers’ cognitive capacity. This alternative application of robotics technologies encompasses two key components: (1) robotic sensing for demand prediction and (2) robotic planning for production management. Using the example of Zaxby’s Franchising Inc., this article explains the improvements possible with modern robotics technologies and the challenges of implementing it. Unusual for quick-service, Zaxby’s uses a fresh, cook-to-order concept, which resulted in backlogs during busy times. Zaxby’s robotics application substantially reduced both service times and food waste. The system tracks customer arrivals, starts the cooking process as customers arrive, and then gives employees specific directions to expedite cooking and service, so that wait times have been reduced. Developing the algorithms needed for robotic systems gives corporate operators the opportunity to analyze their operating systems, resolve inconsistencies, and provide for clear performance assessment.</p>

<p>The challenges faced by the U.S. quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector are well documented. These include a shrinking labor pool, increased competition, rising operating costs, and an increasingly demanding customer base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511434112">Gregerson 2009</xref>). Beyond other quick-service chains, QSR outlets face competition from the fast casual segment and prepared foods in grocery stores and convenience stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511434112">Dahlstrom et al. 2004</xref>). Compounding this, operating costs are rising while customers with limited discretionary income are demanding more in terms of speed, convenience quality, and value for money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511434112">National Restaurant Association 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Competition has always been a challenge, so QSR operators have maintained a steady interest in the application of technological solutions to maintain product quality and service consistency, while also keeping costs down through efficiencies in terms of speed of service, order processing, and labor and inventory management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965511434112">Bickers 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511434112">Gregerson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511434112">Minnick 2007a</xref>). The many now-familiar applications of automation and technology include point-of-sale systems, self-service kiosks, order confirmation systems, call center technology, automatic drink dispensers and cooking equipment, and kitchen management systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511434112">Minnick 2007b</xref>). Also familiar are the benefits of applying technology in production management and resource planning, including cost minimization, revenue management, and human resource support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511434112">Ansel and Dyer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511434112">Kimes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511434112">Puzo and Dulen 2008</xref>). In this article, we explain the possibilities of using robotics to yield further efficiencies for QSR operation—primarily through knowledge management.</p>
<p>The definition of robotics is under continual revision and development. The technology base within robotics has expanded significantly to encompass new definitions of intelligence, thus refocusing robotics definitions towards the software that enables such intelligence. Robotic software systems are now being developed to extend human capabilities in hostile locations, for example, space, military, and undersea environments. More recently, hospitals have employed robotics technologies to extend human cognitive capabilities in operations that tax human workers’ ability to collect, synthesize, and act upon large dynamic data sets. We draw on this notion of applying robotics technologies to extend human cognitive capabilities by proposing a shift away from the conventional view of robotics technologies in the QSR environment (i.e., for direct labor replacement) to their application for labor augmentation (i.e., extending workers’ cognitive capacity). We focus on the application of robotics technologies in two key domains: demand prediction and production management. We contend that the application of robotics technologies affords the QSR operator significant opportunities for competitive advantage in the form of enhanced demand prediction, food quality control, labor training efficiencies, and opportunities for enhanced process management and decision making.</p>
<p>We begin this article with an overview of the current status of automation within the QSR environment and discuss the key factors influencing the manner in which robotics technologies can enhance QSR efficiency. We then describe how robotics technologies can be applied in demand prediction and production management. After presenting an example of robotic implementation, we discuss the opportunities for strategic advantage that the application of robotics technologies in these two domains presents the QSR operator.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938965511434112">
<title>The Current Status of QSR Automation</title>
<p>The application of automation within the QSR environment encompasses both customer-facing and back-of-house activities. At the customer interface, self-service kiosks have been introduced by such chains as Hardee’s, McDonald’s, and Carl’s Jr. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511434112">Anonymous 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511434112">Ganus 2007</xref>). In addition to their potential to improve order efficiency, facilitate upselling, and give customers control over the service transaction, kiosk capabilities hold the potential to cut labor training time and costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511434112">Anonymous 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511434112">Kimes 2008</xref>). InfoAmerica Transactional Kiosks has estimated that this technology saves operators anywhere from 15 to 50 hours per week in labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511434112">Minnick 2007b</xref>). Another trend that has emerged is the application of voice-over-IP and call center technology, which has allowed QSR operators to decrease their dependence on the local labor pool for staffing and provide more focused customer service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511434112">Anonymous 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511434112">Richtel 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the back of the house, technology automates food preparation and assembly functions. McDonald’s Corporation, for example, has installed an automated beverage system at their drive-throughs to speed up service and increase drive-through capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511434112">Robinson-Jacobs 2006</xref>). Advances in the functionality of other kitchen equipment, such as fryers, ovens, and grills, have also yielded efficiencies and consistency in food preparation, including dual grills and fryers with an auto lift function that lowers and raises loads automatically. At Wendy’s International the introduction of dual grills yielded a 4.5-minute reduction in cooking times, from 5.5 minutes to approximately 1 minute, and eliminated the need for an extra grill worker during rush hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511434112">Robinson-Jacobs 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Kitchen management solutions (KMSs) have also linked the front-of-house and drive-through terminals to the food production area in the back-of-house by displaying orders on video screens in the food production area. A sorting feature, such as that provided by the ePic KMS (QSR Automations, Inc.), can be used to guide crew members through the sequence for bagging food items in an order. Similarly, at food preparation stations, the screen can give play-by-play direction for how condiments need to appear on a sandwich or burger. Count-back timers can be set so that items with different cook times finish simultaneously as opposed to having to hold some items. KMSs can also assist with bin management by automating bin inventory levels. To maintain appropriate food quantities, sales projections by bin (food) item, time interval, and day of week are generated by the operator or are developed by the KMS based on historical sales data. Phantom orders can also be used to maintain bin inventory levels. These orders are generated and routed to the KMS display for preparation by crew members when the bin count goes lower than is required.</p>

<title>Designing a Robotics-Based Solution: Issues to Consider</title>
<p>When determining how to best apply robotics technologies for efficiency enhancement in the QSR environment, two key issues need to be considered. First, while the conventional view of robotics technologies for QSRs is their application for direct labor replacement, the viability of exploiting robotic capabilities to advance labor replacement beyond the capabilities afforded by those technologies that are currently on the market (e.g., automated cooking equipment and self-service kiosks) merits consideration. Second, given the high operating costs and tight profit margins for QSRs, consideration must be given to the cost and scalability associated with any robotics-based solution.</p>
<sec id="section3-1938965511434112">
<title>The Potential for Exploiting Robotics Technologies to Further Advance Labor Replacement</title>
<p>The bottleneck in the production process at a QSR outlet is typically the performance limitations of the humans in the production loop. To illustrate, compare the production rates of the manual components of the production process (i.e., assembling and wrapping food products) to the production rates of the capital equipment. A grill can typically cook batches of ten to twenty hamburgers in two minutes, but it takes nearly one minute to assemble and wrap a single cheeseburger. Regardless of how much further existing capital equipment is automated, production speed will still be dictated by the manual component of the process. The application of robotics technologies to remove the human bottleneck through labor replacement would require significant investment in the development of an entirely new class of production equipment that reliably assembles and wraps food products. The costs associated with building robust robotics that would not need human intervention are currently prohibitive (as explained in the sidebar). Thus, while robotics technologies are often considered in terms of the direct replacement of human labor, the ability to significantly drive QSR efficiency in this conventional manner does not currently exist.</p>

<sec id="section4-1938965511434112">
<title>Cost Comparison: Human Replacement Robotics Solutions versus Robotic Management Systems</title>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-1938965511434112">
<p>Human-replacement robotics solutions generally require the design of new pieces of capital equipment. For a QSR, such an approach would require the franchisor to partner with roboticists to build a one-off prototype system, which might then be replicated by the QSR’s existing equipment vendors. The National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), an operating unit within Carnegie Mellon University’s <italic>Robotics Institute</italic>, for example, partners with government and industry clients to develop robotic technologies from concept to commercialization. Using the NREC model as an illustration, a research program that might design a QSR-based prototype would typically span three to four years at a cost of more than $1 million per year.</p>
<p>Following prototype development and replication, the QSR franchisor can reasonably expect to pay in excess of $25,000 per unit (excluding annual costs for software licenses, maintenance, and support) for each new piece of automated equipment that replaces human labor, say, for tasks such as wrapping and packaging food. The franchisor organization would further need to recoup its research and development (R&amp;D) investment by amortizing that cost across the adopting franchisees. Given that most franchisors outside of the top three QSR franchisors have fewer than 2,000 units, the R&amp;D investment (assuming a 4-year development project and 2,000 units) would need to be recouped at a rate of $2,000 per unit. This would result in an initial financial outlay of $27,000 per unit, plus ongoing annual expenditure on software licenses, maintenance, and support.</p>
<p>By contrast, the robotics-based management system proposed in this paper operates on standard, consumer-grade computers, costing no more than $2,500. At the time of writing, the combined cost of software licensing and maintenance fees are listed at $250 per restaurant unit per month, resulting in a financial outlay of approximately $5,500 in the first year, ongoing annual software and maintenance fees of $3,500, and computer replacement following the conventional three- to five-year hardware replacement cycle.</p>

<sec id="section5-1938965511434112">
<title>Considering the Cost and Scalability of a Robotics-Based Solution</title>
<p>Given that the application of robotics to advance labor replacement is not a viable option, any alternative robotics-based solution that is considered must fit the criteria of providing immediate economic value and scalability, and thereby delivering performance benefits at a reasonable cost. This demands the development of a solution that is capable of dealing with the restaurant as is rather than developing futuristic solutions that could be implemented fully only by forcing restaurants to bear the cost of switching to a fundamentally new operating system or significantly altering the physical structure of the restaurant.</p>

<sec id="section6-1938965511434112">
<title>A New Robotics Vision: Labor Augmentation</title>
<p>We propose that QSR crews could operate far more efficiently by applying robotic technologies to (1) consistently make accurate production decisions based on accurate and complete restaurant state information, and (2) deliver those decisions to the crew members in the form of task commands on a second-by-second basis. This strategy would help eliminate those QSR service inefficiencies caused by a lack of complete information about demand, which leads to inaccurate production decisions; an inability to keep track of what food products are available, which are needed, and who is performing each task; and a limited capacity for complex decision making that results from incomplete demand and status information. We suggest a new approach to the application of robotics, where demand and production are explicitly modeled to apply robotic sensing and planning technologies, rather than traditional mechanical automation. This approach to the application of robotics uses a standard operating system and computer hardware, touch screen displays, and low-cost security cameras—an inexpensive platform that supports the cost and scalability criteria of the QSR sector.</p>
<sec id="section7-1938965511434112">
<title>Intelligent Robotics</title>
<p>Intelligent robots are generally defined as systems that display the capacity to sense their environments, devise a plan of action, and act on that plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511434112">Goodwin 2008</xref>). This Sense–Plan–Act cycle, which has become the modern definition of robotic intelligence, is the key to understanding our approach to the application of robotics for a QSR. Most QSR automation has applied to the “act” portion of the cycle, leaving sensing and planning to human workers, but our vision of labor augmentation also assigns the “sense” and “plan” portions of the cycle to the robotic system.</p>
<p>Robotics sensing refers to the use of visual, or near-visual, sensors such as cameras, radar, lidar, and sonar, to detect, localize, or track physical objects. For a QSR, robotic sensing involves the detection and tracking of customers as they approach the restaurant as a means of estimating imminent demand for food product. A prediction of future demand may then be formed by combining evidence of near-term demand from several sources in real time with historical sales data. This methodology enables restaurants to predict demand a few minutes into the future, based on actual dynamic conditions.</p>
<p>Within the “plan” portion of the Sense–Plan–Act cycle, decisions are made regarding how much of each food product to cook, when to cook it, what resources (equipment and people) to assign to cooking tasks, and how to communicate production information to the appropriate crew members. With its evidence-based demand projection, robotics-based planning allows the generation of a real-time cooking schedule and the management of production at a task level rather than at a target output level. Thus, the crew is issued specific cook commands on a second-by-second basis instead of being instructed, for example, to build to or maintain a certain bin level within a given time period.</p>
<p>Taken together, robotic sensing and planning constitute a new approach to QSR management—as well as a new approach to the application of robotics technologies in the restaurant industry. We discuss these components in detail below, and they are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965511434112">Exhibit 1</xref>. We then present challenges and outcomes associated with one chain’s implementation of robotics for labor augmentation.</p>

<title>Robotic Sensing</title>
<p>Robotic sensing can vastly improve on the current QSR practice of using historical sales data to predict future demand or using corporate standards to determine bin quantities and food holding time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1938965511434112">1</xref></sup> Instead of inferring future demand from history, robotic sensing employs a direct measurement of a leading indicator of future demand, in this case guest arrival. It is actual pedestrian and vehicular traffic on a restaurant property that is causal to order placement (with a lead time of a few minutes). Therefore, the objective of the sensing portion of the Sense–Plan–Act cycle is to directly sense that actual demand.</p>
<p>Computer vision technologies (CVTs) offer a capacity for sensing pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the restaurant property. Specifically, CVTs rely on a set of detection and tracking algorithms that enable images captured from standard security type cameras to be processed such that pedestrians or vehicles are detected, counted, and tracked as they arrive at the restaurant and progress to and through the restaurant’s queues. Feature-point tracking (using tests such as feature-point directional flow and bounding box size) is used to distinguish between vehicles and nonvehicle objects moving through the scene. CVTs are capable of operation in all weather and lighting conditions. The cameras may be pointed at key locations throughout the restaurant’s property, notably, the property’s entrance and exits, the drive-through lane, the parking area, the restaurant’s entrance and exit doors, and the front counter. The number and location of the cameras that will be used at a given QSR outlet depends on whether the operator wants to use a combination of measurement (i.e., cameras) and simulation, or measurement alone, to count and track the progress of arriving customers. When a combination of measurement and simulation is used, cameras are used to count the number of arriving vehicles. Queue-theoretic modeling techniques are then applied to simulate how customers and vehicles progress through the queues (walk-in and drive-through). A measurement-alone approach can be used at the QSR drive-through. This approach entails explicitly measuring every vehicle as it progresses through the drive-through. To do this, cameras are set up in such a way that coverage is provided either everywhere or at key points such as the order board, payment window, and food receipt window. The estimated state of the total vehicle queue is derived from the combination of these visual measurements.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the queue time is developed (i.e., measurement and simulation, or measurement alone), the objective is to estimate the number of unmet orders on the restaurant’s property. This is achieved by counting vehicles as they enter the property and then calculating, based on the simulated or measured queue data, the specific amount of time within which those vehicles will be served. For example, if the queue data indicates a lag time of 3 minutes between the arrival time of a vehicle and order placement, the total count of unmet orders will be the count of all vehicle arrivals that have occurred within the last 3 minutes. Once the total number of unmet orders is calculated, this information is then paired with the restaurant’s historical sales data (based on average product mix). This yields a relatively accurate, real-time estimate of how much of each food product the restaurant will need over the next few minutes. Taking the example of Zaxby’s, the fresh chicken concept discussed below, say that historical sales data indicates that 4.8 chicken fingers are sold per car, chicken fingers take 4 minutes to cook, and it takes approximately 3 minutes from the time that a car enters the parking lot to the time that the customer places an order. When a camera shows a car entering the parking lot, the system can prompt an order for 5 chicken fingers to be dropped in the fryer so that by the time the order is actually placed the food is nearly ready. This mimics a cook-to-order setup (which is Zaxby’s concept), but with the advantage of being able to start the cooking before the order is placed. This method might instead be called “cook-to-arrival.” The inherent advantage of a cook-to-order approach is that a higher standard of food quality can be maintained, but the downside is that customers typically experience relatively long wait times. The cook-to-arrival approach illustrated here significantly cuts the wait time but still provides fresh, hot food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1938965511434112">
<title>Robotic Planning</title>
<p>We have already alluded to the other aspect of robotic labor augmentation, that is, robotic planning. This comprises three basic planners: a production planner, a labor planner, and a communication planner. The production planner involves determining what is to be cooked, when to cook it, and the resources (i.e., equipment and labor) to assign to cooking. Once the necessary labor resources have been identified, the labor planner determines the specific step-by-step tasks that each employee will carry out on a second-by-second basis. Finally, the role of the communication planner is to communicate those instructions to the crew in terms of what tasks they need to complete and when they need to be completed.</p>
<sec id="section10-1938965511434112">
<title>Production Planner</title>
<p>The power of a robotics-based approach to production planning lies in its capacity to schedule food production in real time, based on the sensing technologies that we just described. The system then can generate a production schedule that is based on the causal relationship between real-time customer arrivals and anticipated order activity. Rather than cooking to precalculated bin levels that are determined solely by historical demand, bin levels are determined using a closed-loop control system. This type of control system uses feedback on customer arrival activity to automatically adjust production levels. Thus, if there is an unexpected decrease (or increase) in customer demand, the system will sense that decrease (or increase) and will automatically make a downward (or upward) adjustment in production. Underlying the production process are cook-decision algorithms that determine the amount of a specific food product to cook based on the arrival data. These algorithms include an optimization function and associated boundary conditions (or constraints). For example, a burger production optimization objective might be to minimize product hold times, subject to the constraint that there can never be less than two patties available at any time. The specific number, and content, of the cook-decision algorithms that are developed for a given QSR outlet or chain will be a function of the chain’s operating procedures. Once a decision has been made to cook, scheduling algorithms automate the assignment of production resources (i.e., equipment and labor) to cooking tasks. These algorithms determine, from the list of near-term demand for food products, the next batch (and batch size) of a specific food product to assign to a given resource when it next becomes available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1938965511434112">
<title>Labor Planner</title>
<p>Once a resource plan has been developed, the labor planner converts the plan into a task list that QSR workers can easily understand and execute. The manner in which the labor planner approaches task management deviates from convention. Rather than specify target output levels, a robotics-based approach manages at the individual task level. Crew members are issued specific cook commands in response to real-time demand (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965511434112">Exhibit 2</xref>). The ability to issue production commands at this level is a function of the real-time production schedule that the production planner generates.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1938965511434112" position="float">

<p>Sample crew action log</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938965511434112-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>Side work is included in the task listings. For ancillary tasks such as restocking supplies, taking out garbage, and cleaning restrooms, the labor planner is designed to trade off the needs of the production plan against these tasks using algorithms based on the QSR’s operating rules and procedures. For example, a labor optimization objective might be to produce the freshest food possible, subject to the constraint that the restrooms must be checked every thirty minutes. In this way, the QSR manager can codify side work to ensure that those tasks are performed at times that do not detract from the achievement of food-production goals relating to speed, quality, and labor cost.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1938965511434112">
<title>Communication Planner</title>
<p>The communication planner communicates to crew members the tasks determined by the labor planner to crew members. Effective communication entails the application of a human–computer interface (HCI) that displays task commands in an efficient, intuitive, and easy-to-use manner.</p>
<p>The principal constraint in building an HCI for a restaurant operation is that the interface must conform to the restaurant owner’s or franchisor’s established standard operating procedures and processes. The HCI design experiment thus becomes (1) producing an HCI consistent with the defined operating or production process, such that (2) employees use the HCI “often enough” (as defined by the restaurant owner or franchisor), where frequency of use is measured electronically by comparing HCI use against the task commands issued by the robotics solution. Per the crew activity log in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965511434112">Exhibit 2</xref>, the robotics system tracks use statistics for adherence to prompted tasks and for nonprompted events. Together, these two constraints form the basis of a satisficing problem, the objective of which is to find the first adequate solution (i.e., the first solution that meets the experimental constraints) rather than identifying the most optimal possible solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511434112">Simon 1955</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511434112">1996</xref>). Satisficing problems are often proposed in environments where the cost of experimentation is high. In this case, restaurants seek to minimize experimentation in their operating restaurants to avoid the cost of lost production.</p>
<p>Modeling HCI development as a satisficing problem, we have found that the HCI that works best (defined in terms of compliance with the two above-stated constraints) is visually simple, employs colors to indicate status information (such as sufficient inventory, or a need to cook more product), and provides simple, task-based commands such as “Cook 3,” rather than complex plans (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938965511434112">Exhibit 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Robotics Technologies in Action</title>
<p>We are not speaking hypothetically in this article. Robotics have been applied as we describe here, as in the case of Zaxby’s Franchising, Inc., which we mentioned above.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1938965511434112">2</xref></sup> Founded in 1990, the firm, at the time of the writing, operated and franchised more than 460 Zaxby’s chicken restaurants in 11 southern U.S. states. The most recently reported annual sales figures for the company indicated total sales revenues of $664 million for 2008. Given that Zaxby’s overriding objective is to provide “the freshest chicken fingers and Buffalo wings in town,” a practice employed by the company from the outset has been to cook food as close to order as possible. As a means of managing customer expectations of the wait time resulting from this approach to food preparation, Zaxby’s prominently displayed signs in their restaurants and at their drive-throughs that read as follows: “In order to ensure freshness, we cook each order individually. Please allow 10-15 minutes preparation time.” Zaxby’s actual average wait time in-store was 8 minutes 28 seconds, with an average wait time of 5 minutes 56 seconds in the drive-through, hardly fitting with the notion of “fast” food.</p>
<p>This cook-to-order process, with its lengthy advertised wait time both limited the number of customers that would commit to patronizing Zaxby’s and contributed to waste, since it was difficult to predict minute-to-minute needs during high demand periods. According to Steve Dailey, a Zaxby’s franchisee: “We don’t have anything in our restaurant that takes more than four or five minutes to cook, but when you are talking about the peak lunch or dinner rush, you may have 25 or 30 orders on the screen at one time. When you get in the middle of a lunch rush and you’ve got a line out the door, you just tell your cooks to cook until you tell them to stop.” However, the problem with this strategy, as Dailey indicates, is that the manager would either forget to tell the cooks to stop cooking as the rush died down or the cooks overestimated the amount of food needed. As a result, Dailey’s outlets occasionally ended up with as many as 200 chicken fingers that had to be thrown out at the end of the rush.</p>
<p>In 2005, Zaxby’s decided to test the robotics-based solution for labor augmentation as described in this article. According to Blake Bailey, vice president of accounting and finance for Zaxby’s, the solution offered the opportunity to drive customer throughput and create a better customer experience—instead of training guests to wait. The concern was whether the company could maintain its product quality and also close the speed gap with their QSR competitors. In other words, from Zaxby’s perspective, the solution had to be capable of making their just-in-time production model work more efficiently.</p>
<sec id="section14-1938965511434112">
<title>Implementing Robotics</title>
<p>As described in this article, Zaxby’s posts cameras strategically at various points to track customer arrivals. This information is then paired with historical sales data (90 days of POS data) to predict the demand for individual food products. Cook-decision algorithms based on Zaxby’s specific operating rules and procedures then determine what to cook, when to cook, and how much to cook. Next, labor planning algorithms develop the list of tasks that the crew members need to follow and those tasks are displayed on a screen for kitchen crew members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1938965511434112">
<title>Implementation: Challenges and Outcomes</title>
<p>As with any project, there were challenges when the robotics-based solution was introduced at Zaxby’s test outlets, not least of which was resistance to change. Getting buy-in from management, particularly veteran managers who were used to managing based on their own judgment, was essential to the success of the project. According to Bailey, managers needed to be sold on how implementation of the robotics-based solution would improve day-to-day operations and boost the bottom line, although buy-in came much quicker from those operators experiencing high labor turnover. The way that managers were incentivized was also revisited, with incentives reflective of the two-faceted objective of increasing speed and maintaining (or improving) product quality, put in place to stimulate change.</p>
<p>Bailey reports that the robotics-based solution accomplished its two objectives of closing the speed gap with Zaxby’s competition and maintaining their protocol of just-in-time cooking. Because the system tracks customer arrivals onto the restaurant property, food preparation begins at that point rather than when a customer’s order is placed. Wait times at one site’s drive-through dropped from the 4- to 5-minute range to an average of 3:31 minutes. The reductions in customer wait time that have been achieved have allowed outlets to remove the signs warning customers of the 10- to 15-minute wait time. Outlets have also managed to reduce the amount of waste generated during peak demand periods. Rather than continue to produce product until the end of a peak demand time, the production planning capability of the robotic solution ensures that production tapers off in a timely manner such that waste is kept to a minimum. One franchisee reported that by properly guiding the night crews’ production, the system reduced the waste of chicken wings alone by $22 a day, resulting in the real savings of $8,000 a year. That same franchisee also reported a $60,000 increase in annual gross profit per store following implementation based on increased sales, as well as the $8,000-per-year reduction in food waste. In fact, according to Bailey, Zaxby’s was able to serve more customers more quickly without an increase in staffing levels, thereby adding significantly to bottom-line profits.</p>
<p>Ancillary benefits associated with implementation include a 50 percent decrease in training time reported by one franchisee, since employees can follow on-screen directions. That situation offset a weak training environment for another franchisee. The ability of the system to automate cook decisions and commands also frees up some of the time that managers previously spent in the kitchen, allowing them to direct more of their focus to front-of-house operations. Finally, the technology also gives Zaxby’s a way to easily access product hold times and product quality information for the entire chain, information that had been almost impossible to gather in the past. That capability allows Zaxby’s to put reliable, and timely, quantitative measurements on food quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1938965511434112">
<title>Implementation Risks</title>
<p>As the case of Zaxby’s demonstrates, the adoption of any operations-related technology carries with it both real and perceived risk. Concerns arise over changes to personnel roles, shifts in key operations knowledge from people to technology, and system reliability.</p>
<p>Robotics generally creates unwarranted concern that the technologies “replace” humans, in this case the manager. Robotic planning systems do not supplant or change the manager’s role but instead provide restaurant managers with new operational stability, as the system effectively ensures that the crew actually follows the manager’s production rules. Moreover, using robotics to direct kitchen procedures ensures that when supervisory employees resign, the operational knowledge does not leave with them. Planning systems enable consistent adherence to production rules regardless of crew turnover rates.</p>
<p>Consistent application of production rules also enables the restaurant manager to separate the effectiveness of those rules from the faithfulness with which they are applied, an important capability that lends itself to iterative improvement techniques. In this regard, the adoption of robotic planning systems enhances the restaurant manager’s career path as it provides a means for restaurant managers to gain significant new experience and insight in the design of operations processes.</p>
<p>Technological robustness—that is, the possibility of system failure—is a further perceived risk. We suggest that there is far less reliability risk to adopting robotics technologies than to adopting the now-ubiquitous POS. Downtime risks with modern electronics technologies are minimal. Redundant computing is regularly built into all systems at minimal cost, including POSs. In the rare event that a POS system goes down, the restaurant most likely shuts down until the POS is repaired. In the equally rare event that a robotic production planner goes down, the restaurant can actually continue operating, using traditional but less optimal production plans, such as “keep the food bins full.”</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section17-1938965511434112">
<title>Assessing Strategic Opportunities</title>
<p>Zaxby’s adoption of robotics for its nearly two hundred QSR outlets has yielded a 65 percent reduction in product hold times, an 80 percent reduction in product waste, reductions in crew training time, and improvements in the speed of service, as mentioned above. While impressive, these metrics do not fully communicate the breadth of the opportunities for competitive advantage that the robotics-based solution advanced in this article affords the QSR operator. These opportunities derive both from the facility to automate complex processes and provide access to data that conventional kitchen management systems do not. As we have explained above and summarize next, these opportunities are (1) demand prediction, (2) food-quality control, (3) labor training and management, (4) process control, (5) enabling decision control and application of complex production rules, and (6) quantification of corporate objectives.</p>
<sec id="section18-1938965511434112">
<title>Demand Prediction</title>
<p>Robotics technologies provide the means to employ real-time customer arrival data to predict real-time demand. Such predictions can be further enhanced by integrating historical demand data under statistical fusion methodologies such as Kalman filtering. Importantly, arrival data, unlike historical demand data, is causal to future orders. Customers arrive and then place orders shortly thereafter. Depending on the operating rules used at their given outlet, management may choose to use these data to set bin inventory levels or, carrying its application to the extreme, use it to support a cook-to-order approach. In the latter instance, the demand prediction functionality of the system will enable food preparation to begin as soon as customers arrive in the parking lot rather than waiting for the customer order to be placed in the POS system. Regardless of the scope of its application, the capture of customer arrival data allows for better alignment of supply and demand such that key performance measures are improved, including food quality, customer wait times, inventory holding times, and product waste.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1938965511434112">
<title>Food Quality Control</title>
<p>Food overproduction and the related extended holding times are the primary causes of poor product quality in QSRs. A robotics-based approach to demand prediction allows a better alignment of inventory levels with actual demand, thereby curbing overproduction.</p>
<p>Application of the proposed robotics-based solution also delivers the capacity to change the way food product quality is both measured and controlled. Instead of just measuring the amount of food in the bins as a standard for production levels and food quality, robotics provides a means of tracking food production through the entire cooking cycle, recording the time at which each food product was cooked and the time at which it was served, thereby providing a fundamental measurement of food product quality: age. This represents a powerful measure of performance that is not captured by conventional kitchen management systems. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938965511434112">Exhibits 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938965511434112">5</xref> provide an illustration of the different levels at which aging data can be analyzed.) Actual food product ages can be monitored to determine whether they meet quality standards. Aging information can also be compared to customer feedback to examine actual food product ages against customer perceptions of quality, which allows for a more accurate indication of product quality than current methods provide, including mystery shoppers. Actual food age can be reviewed to determine the circumstances under which poor-quality food is generated, enabling managers to reconsider operational processes. Moreover, age data is available for every product served to every customer, not merely the mystery shopper sample.</p>

<title>Labor Training and Management</title>
<p>The successful application of the production and labor planners described in this paper relies on the codification and replication of a QSR chain’s operating rules and procedures in the form of appropriate cook-decision, scheduling, and labor planning algorithms. Therefore, at its most fundamental level, what we propose is to have production knowledge stored, managed, and transferred via software, rather than from person to person. Knowledge in this form becomes a capital asset and represents an important source of competitive advantage. By establishing knowledge as a capital asset, the organization doesn’t lose information when employees leave, and new employees can achieve competency far more quickly. Given that decision making is automated, new employee training can focus on tasks (which are far easier to teach) rather than decisions, which generally require time and experience to learn.</p>
<p>At an operational level, the application of labor planning algorithms allows for discrete tasks to be assigned to individual crew members, and task performance can be recorded for each crew member (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965511434112">Exhibit 2</xref>). Of particular note is the robotics system’s capability of capturing employee response data. This capability for understanding how well individual crew members can perform specific tasks provides the system with inputs that can be used to further optimize labor processes, since crew members can be assigned to those tasks that they perform with the greatest skill. Knowing where employees excel also provides opportunities for bonus programs tied to execution. On the other hand, if a crew member is underperforming, task-specific training can be directed to address that employee’s specific training needs rather than expending training dollars in general, crew-wide training programs.</p>

<title>Process Improvement<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1938965511434112">1</xref></sup>: A Local Focus That Delivers Chainwide Value</title>
<p>With the codification of a restaurant’s operational knowledge through the use of production planning algorithms, the operating process becomes open to automated process measurement and analysis—and, thus, iterative process improvement. Operators can understand the root causes of problems and develop actionable solutions. For example, if too much food is produced during a given time period, the QSR operator can review the system’s decision-making algorithms to determine why it decided to produce that amount, whether because of poor assumptions or incomplete data. Improved algorithms can then be encoded to improve efficiency. In this way, robotic management implies systematic process improvement tuned to the specific conditions of each local restaurant rather than adherence to system-wide operating targets. Locally optimal decisions offer QSR chains a new means of generating economic value. Instead of applying operational processes that work well for most restaurants, locally optimizing decision making means that the chain can implement specific processes that unleash each location’s full value.</p>
<p>At the same time, networking the robotic system chainwide enables regional or corporate executives to analyze each restaurant’s performance through structured quantitative analysis. If, for example, the analysis indicates that a process-improvement idea has proven successful at one restaurant, this improvement can be implemented in other outlets by updating the knowledge and decision rules in the software. Although the system may change the way decisions are made, that does not automatically change the way decisions are communicated to the crew. The user interface might well remain the same, and there would be no need for training based on the new decision rules. The advantage inherent in the speed with which new knowledge can be distributed and acted on is enormous when compared with the length of time that it typically takes to formulate and execute a training program for the typical operational change. This frees the restaurant to make operational changes as needed or indicated by market forces, such as introducing food products more often or updating service management decisions in response to a need for faster service at the drive-through. We also want to emphasize the monetary savings associated with this approach to knowledge transfer and training, as compared to conventional training programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1938965511434112">
<title>Decision Complexity: Enabling the Application of More Sophisticated Operating Rules</title>
<p>In a typical QSR setting, operational processes must be designed with the inherent limitations of human workers in mind. The complexity of decisions that can effectively be fielded across a QSR chain is limited primarily by the speed with which the human mind can aggregate multiple sources of information into a clear state of events. Therefore, the complexity of decisions currently implemented by QSR outlets is typically limited to simple if–then rules, where the “if” can be clearly determined by looking at a single event, for example, “if we are currently out of fries, then pull aside a car waiting for fries.” More complex decisions become problematic. For example, the rule “if we are currently out of fries and it will take more than 30 seconds for the fries to complete cooking, then pull aside a car waiting for fries” requires the crew member to track two pieces of information (and to remember that the customer is waiting, while also fulfilling other orders). Clearly, as decisions become more complex, crew members are required to (1) remember more complex logic and (2) track and aggregate more data. These rules also provide perverse incentives to game the system to improve the performance metrics relating to a bonus. Returning to the drive-through pull-aside example, crew members could decide to pull cars aside even when the if-criterion is not met, simply to stop the drive-through timer and record a shorter service time. As a result, many QSR chains have eliminated such exception rules altogether because they had no way of determining whether they were being used appropriately.</p>
<p>A robotics-driven system can apply complex logic to the drive-through and other production and service issues. The workers can just follow the system prompts, and they need not remember the decision-logic or attempt to aggregate multiple sources of data to determine whether to execute a change in process. Exceptions can be verified, both in real time and after the fact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1938965511434112">
<title>Quantification of Corporate Objectives</title>
<p>Establishing the decision planning rules in a robotics system gives a QSR chain’s executives the opportunity to review all operating standards and processes, because a system’s rules represent the mathematical quantification of corporate goals and objectives. The production and labor planning algorithms must be tailored to fit the given operating environment, and this process invites a QSR chain’s operations personnel to consider their processes in great detail. The quantification of goals and objectives also holds the promise of significantly increasing the accuracy of corporate financial forecasts. Robotic production management systems have the capacity to provide enormous quantities of production and service data, all of which directly bear on quantifying the efficiencies with which QSR outlets operate. This information can, and should, be fed into costs and revenue forecasts as a means of (1) improving their accuracy and (2) providing for a sensitivity analysis to understand, in detail, the best means of improving profitability based on measurements of actual performance in every outlet. Importantly, this sensitivity analysis can be performed on an outlet-by-outlet basis, enabling each restaurant to follow a customized set of goals that represent its best means of contributing to chainwide profitability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using the case of Zaxby’s, this article demonstrates how advances in robotics can improve QSR operations. Because it is scalable, robotic management represents an opportunity for relatively small and agile QSRs to become competitive with large firms. Large chains have maintained a strategic competitive advantage because of a combination of buying power and brand recognition, but affordable robotic management represents an opportunity for adopters to significantly lower the cost of achieving highly efficient, high-quality QSR operations. One early indication of this point of view is Zaxby’s radical performance improvements through the adoption of robotics management technologies.</p>
<p>By challenging the way in which the QSR sector has traditionally viewed the application of robotics with a focus on augmenting workers’ cognitive capacity as a means to gaining competitive advantage, we hope to encourage discourse within the QSR community. Furthermore, we hope that this example of a robotics-based approach to QSR management will serve as a reminder to hospitality firms of how advances in other fields of research can be harnessed to improve hospitality operations.</p>
