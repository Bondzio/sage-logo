<italic>Girls, Cultural Productions, and Resistance</italic> tackles the complex topic of girls’ negotiations of dominant cultural scripts and representations of gender. The underlying purpose of the edited volume, as thickly described by the editors in the introduction, is to challenge an existing dichotomy between the contemporary positioning of girls as entirely rational, active agents, and earlier trends in the field where girls have been positioned as vulnerable and passive victims of dominant patriarchal discourses. Drawing heavily from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313492311">Butler’s (1999)</xref> arguments in opposition of hegemonic feminist subjectification of young girls in the name of emancipation, the editors sought, and succeeded, in providing a series of readings that make use of girls’ lived experiences to discuss how they struggle to navigate within dominant gendered representations while simultaneously exerting affective agency through subversive pleasure-driven everyday expressions and activities.</p>
<p>The editors’ well-defined purpose for the book clearly manifests within each of the 13 stand-alone chapters, with each offering rich descriptions of complexity and diversity within girls’ experiences. For example, the first chapter provides an in-depth description of how two 5-year-old girls embrace and resist gendered proscriptions through digital media production. Chapter 15 offers an in-depth exploration of college women’s descriptions of images of female athletes that they recognize as conflating masculinized and feminized “power” and offering narrow representations of women’s bodies. Other types of resistance described in the volume include women’s participation in Roller Derby events as both playing into and challenging traditional gender norms, nuanced gendered interpretations of popular cultural film and television by teenage girls, and adolescent girls’ participation in gender-inclusive video game design. Several of the chapters missed opportunities to fully discuss the complex interplay between simultaneously living within and resisting dominant discourses of gender, but nonetheless provided accounts that evidenced such negotiations among the participants.</p>
<p>In addition to the cohesive underlying premise that unifies the chapters in this volume, <italic>Girls, Cultural Productions, and Resistance</italic> offers an impressively interdisciplinary and methodologically varied examination of a highly diverse array of girls’ experiences. Chapter authors hail from multiple fields within and outside academia, including art education, political science, social work, educational psychology, women’s and gender studies, communication and rhetoric, and media and popular cultural studies. The interdisciplinary backgrounds of the authors also resulted in a variety of methodologies for gathering, interpreting, and analyzing data, most of which represented multimethod ethnographic approaches. The participants were similarly diverse, such that theyrepresented a broad range of ages as well as racial, ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds. This diversity allowed not only for the voices of frequently marginalized populations of girls to be heard throughout the text but also for analyses and discussions of interactions among gender and race, class, ethnicity, and religion. For example, Chapter 5 included a rich description of how Islamic cultural values intersected with gendered practices at a university in India where female students primarily worked within current patriarchal campus policies to offer subtle subversions to the status quo. Chapter 6 also included an in-depth case study of young a Latina woman navigating issues of culture, class, and gender in her entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>
<p>Given the interdisciplinary focus and broad range of topics, anyone with an interest in girl studies will find this volume to be an illustrative resource. Readers will find the rich descriptions of girls’ experiences to collectively lend support for a complex understanding of girls’ subjectivities. Although the language is dense at times and the volume does not specifically offer practical guidance, I believe that practitioners, educators, and academics alike will find that the material in this book fosters deep consideration of contemporary conceptualizations of girlhood.</p>
