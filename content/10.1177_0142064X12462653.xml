<abstract>
<p>This review treats both Campbell’s book <italic>Basics of Verbal Aspect in Biblical Greek</italic> specifically as well as his view of verbal aspect in Greek more generally. In the assessment of the latter, two points receive particular attention: (a) his desire to replace tense with spatial proximity/remoteness as the underlying semantic category encoded by the indicative, and (b) his identification of the perfect with imperfective aspect.</p>

<p>What is verbal aspect, and how can it help us with understanding the Bible in Greek? Indeed, does it have any relevance at all for better understanding and providing exegesis of the biblical text? These are the primary questions Campbell seeks to address in <italic>Basics of Verbal Aspect in Biblical Greek</italic>. He seeks to do this, furthermore, for the non-specialist, something which is in short supply in a field that not only uses highly technical language, but where there is very little agreement on which technical terms to use.</p>
<p>Campbell first grounds the book in the problem of exegesis of the biblical text, demonstrating some of the pitfalls of naïve applications of the supposed meanings of particular tense forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 13-14). The book is then split into two sections. In the first, Campbell treats verbal aspect theory in general, giving a survey first of what verbal aspect actually is, followed by a history of its study. He then has a chapter for each of perfective aspect, imperfective aspect and the perfect respectively. In the second section, Campbell applies the theory to the forms found in biblical Greek, giving a chapter each to verbal semantics, the present and imperfect, the aorist and future, the perfect and pluperfect and finally a section on specific uses of participles. There are exercises for practising what has been learned, coupled with answers at the end of the book.</p>
<p>There is much to praise in this book. The aim to help introduce students to a complex field such as verbal aspect is to be welcomed. The chapter on the history of verbal aspect gives a good potted account of the most important players in the debate on Greek verbal aspect studies. The same chapter also contains a welcome call for scholars from each field with an interest in Greek verbal aspect, namely theoretical linguistics, Classical philology and New Testament studies, to work together more effectively, without the mutual suspicion and derision that has often played too great a role. The book recognizes the important role to be played by lexical semantics in the interpretation of the tense-aspect of a given form, a factor which is too often ignored in discussions on tense and aspect.</p>
<p>Campbell’s introduction to verbal aspect, defining the term as <italic>viewpoint</italic>, i.e. providing different ways to view the action of the verb, is uncontroversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 19-20). Campbell’s definition of <italic>Aktionsart</italic> as concerning how an action itself actually takes place could be seen as relatively unproblematic, although some other scholars, and, seemingly, he himself in his monograph, understand it differently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X12462653">1</xref></sup> Other elements of the theory he seeks to elucidate, however, are much more controversial, as the author himself acknowledges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 9). It is these controversial elements that I wish to focus on in what remains of the review. The first is Campbell’s attempt to replace tense with spatial proximity/remoteness as the underlying semantic category, along with aspect, encoded by indicative verb forms in Greek. The second is his identification of the Greek perfect with imperfective aspect, and consequent suggestion that it is possible in certain instances to translate the perfect as a progressive in English. I shall deal with each in turn.</p>
<p>For Campbell, aspect is a semantic property of verb forms, while tense interpretations arise pragmatically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X12462653">2</xref></sup> He supports this with reference to the aorist, citing the fact that only 85 percent of aorist forms are past-referring in the New Testament; if past-tense were a semantic property of the aorist, it would be uncancellable and therefore present in every instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 36-37). What, then, does the aorist ‘mean’, alongside its perfectivity? According to Campbell, it is the spatial category of ‘remoteness’. In support of this, Campbell points out that spatial metaphors are often used across languages to describe temporal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 130). He points out, for example, that we talk in English of the ‘remote past’ and the ‘near future’, as well as using the terms ‘remote’ and ‘near’ in a geographical sense, e.g. ‘I live near London’. An important example for Campbell is the use of the aorist εὐδόκησα at Mk 1.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 130):
<disp-quote>
<p>καὶ φωνὴ ἐγένετο ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν· σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός, ἐν σοὶ εὐδόκησα.</p>
<p>And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The apparent present-time reference of εὐδόκησα is consequently explained as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The aorist offers a summary view, because of perfective aspect, and because Jesus’ life is viewed from afar. This does not imply that the Father is relationally <italic>distant</italic> from the Son, or some such viewpoint, but that on this occasion he views his Son from afar in order to view the whole. God may not be in a helicopter (!), but this scene enables a vantage-point that provides a somewhat similar view as from a helicopter— from heaven above itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 38).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The strong implication in such an explanation is that the category of remoteness is literally spatial: the aorist is used because the Father is a long way away, in heaven. Such an understanding implies that the aorist can be used to denote that the person seeing sees from a long distance, as opposed to seeing from close up. This is further implied by the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>[R]emoteness and proximity are, by definition, spatial terms. The primary meaning of remoteness has to do with being <italic>far away, distant</italic>, and <italic>removed</italic>. The spatial idea of remoteness has been applied to time. The “time” is remote… In English, we use spatial terms to describe time, and most of the time we do it without even noticing. <italic>The remote past</italic> is just one example. <italic>The near future</italic> is another. <italic>Near</italic> is no more a temporal term than <italic>remote</italic>, and yet we use the term in order to express temporal ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 130).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Consider the following sentences:</p>
<list id="list1-0142064X12462653" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The shop is a long way away.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Christmas is a long way away. (Uttered in January)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Since the same marker ‘is a long way away’ is used for both a spatial notion, as in the first example, and a temporal notion, as in the second example, Campbell appears to be arguing that, in the same way, tense-aspect morphology, such as the aorist, may in Greek denote either temporal or spatial notions.</p>
<p>Campbell recognizes that it is not always necessary to understand the category of remoteness concretely as geographical distance:
<disp-quote>
<p>First, it should be understood that the terms “remoteness” and “proximity” are best regarded as metaphors. When an aorist is used, it does not mean that the action occurred far away in a geographical place, just because it encodes the spatial value of remoteness. For example, if I were to describe an action that occurred on my street, I am not forced to employ a proximate tense-form simply because it happened close to me physically. By the same token, if the action occurred in Cuba, I would not be forced to use a remote tense-form simply because Cuba is on the other side of the planet from Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 129-30).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, the above quoted paragraph does imply that one <italic>might</italic> on occasion use the aorist in Greek to denote that an action took place a long way away.</p>
<p>It should be stated that the author does not intend to suggest that tense-aspect morphology may be used in Greek to denote relative geographical location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X12462653">3</xref></sup> Rather, he seeks to show that the use of the aorist in this passage is consistent with the large geographical distance involved. Yet I question the validity of positing the development from a metaphorical spatial system to a temporal one. It is certainly true that there is a cross-linguistic tendency for temporal distinctions to be described using spatial metaphors: in Greek πρό may be interpreted spatially as ‘in front of’ or temporally as ‘before’ depending on the context. The difference with tense-aspect forms is that these are <italic>never</italic> used in a purely spatial sense. While the constructed language Lojban does use a literal (i.e. non-metaphorical) ‘spatial tense’ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12462653">Cowan 2005</xref>), to my knowledge no natural language does so, and Greek certainly does not. If an event takes place far away, on the moon for example, the aorist cannot be used to mark that fact. Similarly, if an event takes place right next to me, I would not be more likely to use a present tense form. The supposed metaphor is never used in a concrete sense. Campbell himself underlines this problem in the final paragraphs of the book. Describing the supposed fundamental difference between the English and Greek verb systems he states:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n English usage an event that is distant will be interpreted first spatially (it’s the remote past), but will also have temporal implications for the way the language user thinks about the event (it happened a long time ago) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462653">2008</xref>: 132-33).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What is the difference in practice between ‘it’s the remote past’ and ‘it happened a long time ago’ since the supposed spatial metaphor ‘the remote past’ relies on a temporal term ‘past’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X12462653">4</xref></sup>?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X12462653">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second area of concern is Campbell’s interpretation of the perfect. According to Campbell, this form expresses imperfective aspect with the added value of ‘heightened proximity’. Therefore, so Campbell argues, the perfect ought to be able, given the right lexeme and context, to express an action as in progress, or dynamic. This he sees, for example, in 2 Tim. 4.7:
<disp-quote>
<p>τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα ἠγώνισμαι, τὸν δρόμον τετέλεκα, τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα.</p>
<p>I <italic>am fighting</italic> the good fight, I <italic>am finishing</italic> the race, I <italic>am keeping</italic> the faith.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While the exegetical consequences in this case may not be very great, in other passages they are much more significant. Take, for example Rom. 6.7:
<disp-quote>
<p>ὁ γὰρ ἀποθανὼν δεδικαίωται ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Traditionally this is translated:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the one who has died <underline>has been justified</underline> from sin.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to Campbell, however, this could be translated as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the one who is dead <underline>is being justified</underline> from his sin.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Since with a verb such as ‘to justify’ in English, construction with ‘to be’ and -ing denotes that the event described is in progress, this could be taken to imply that the justification event is not yet complete, and that the one who is dead is in the process of being justified, but has not finally reached that state. It is important, therefore, to establish whether or not Campbell is right. The logic, from his monograph,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X12462653">6</xref></sup> leading Campbell to take the view that he adopts is the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0142064X12462653" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Present tense forms are imperfective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 35-36) and ‘proximate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 56).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Present tense forms also occur mostly in discourse, because they are imperfective and ‘proximate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 56).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Perfects most of the time occur in discourse, more so even than presents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 187).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Therefore the perfect is imperfective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 186) and ‘proximate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 196), although because this would be identical to the present, in the case of the perfect the ‘proximity’ is ‘heightened’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 197).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because the perfect is aspectually imperfective, it may be translated in English as a progressive, just as the present may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462653">2007</xref>: 193-94).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In his monograph, Campbell aims to present an alternative both to the increasingly prevailing view that the perfect denotes stative aspect, and to the traditional view of the Greek perfect that it denotes the present consequences of a past action. Instead, he wishes to show that a framework under which the perfect essentially denotes imperfective aspect gives a better explanation of the facts. The stativity which is observed in the perfect comes from the fact that it is often formed with stative lexemes, and not from the form itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X12462653">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>I agree that the perfect does not in itself denote stative aspect. I also agree that the stative readings which are regularly attributable to the perfect are due to its combination with verbs of particular semantic types, and not to its own function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X12462653">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, I agree that the traditional view is not adequate, since it is not able to account for the numerous cases where no prior action appears to be in view. However, I am not sure that it is sufficient to present the perfect as a straight imperfective.</p>
<p>First, the imperfective in Greek, when formed in combination with dynamic verbs, is regularly used to present the action in question as in process. Aside from verbs denoting the production of sound, I do not believe that the perfect is generally capable of delivering such an interpretation; as far as I can see, Campbell gives no justification for such an interpretation of the perfect, other than the assertion that it is an imperfective. It is true that on occasion the perfect may be translated in English with a ‘to be’ + -ing form of the verb, e.g.:
<disp-quote>
<p>ἀπηγγέλη δὲ αὐτῷ· ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἑστήκασιν ἔξω ἰδεῖν θέλοντές σε. (Lk. 8.20)</p>
<p>And [Jesus] was told, ‘Your mother and brothers <underline>are standing</underline> outside and want to see you.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, this usage has more to do with the idiosyncrasies of English than grammatical aspect: the event described here is a state, not a dynamic event in process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X12462653">9</xref></sup> While state is acknowledged cross-linguistically to share many characteristics with imperfective aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X12462653">Comrie 1976</xref>: 122), this does not mean that a form denoting state, such as the perfect<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X12462653">10</xref></sup> should necessarily be capable of performing all the functions of the imperfective, such as the progressive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the verb in question denotes an accomplishment or achievement event, i.e. an event with an inherent endpoint, the perfect always asserts that that endpoint has been reached. This is a function which is native to perfective aspect, not imperfective. Consider the event described by εὑρίσκω, ‘to find’:
<disp-quote>
<p>τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν Ê0Αβραὰμ τὸν πατέρα ἡμῶν εὑρηκέναι κατὰ σάρκα; (Rom. 4.1)</p>
<p>What then shall we say that Abraham our forefather <underline>found</underline> according to the flesh?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this sentence the question Paul asks is predicated on a terminated and complete ‘finding’ event. Every other example of this verb in the perfect active in the New Testament behaves in the same way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12462653">11</xref></sup> There is not the space here to prove this for all perfects of accomplishment or achievement verbs. Nevertheless, the cases given here make it very difficult to sustain a straight imperfective reading of the perfect. A solution to the aspectual problem of the perfect must lie in another direction.</p>
<p>To conclude, Campbell’s replacement of the category of tense with the category of spatial proximity/remoteness is, in my view, an unnecessary move and has the potential to suggest a linguistically anomalous reading of the tense-aspect system in Greek. Furthermore, the reinterpretation of the perfect and pluperfect as straight imperfectives, allowing the possibility that they could present an action in progress, does not provide an adequate solution to the acknowledged problems with the existing accounts of the Greek perfect, and can lead to unwarranted exegesis of certain texts. Nevertheless, the book is helpful in that it encourages students not to assume that they can superimpose the categories of their native language on the grammar of Greek. It also provides helpful explanations of what aspect is with examples and exercises for the beginning student, as well as some tools for thinking more deeply about the theological implications of the issue. These are resources that are in short supply.</p>
