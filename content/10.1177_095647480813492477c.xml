<p>Martin Amis used to laugh sardonically when interviewers expressed amazement at his Lilliputian stature – always “even shorter than I expected”. Eventually, he said, someone would tell readers that Amis was so tiny he could not reach the door handle, and typed his novels by dancing across the keys.</p>
<p>Even Lionel Barber, editor of the <italic>FT</italic> and of this collection, refers to “this slight figure in a waistcoat … smaller and greyer than I had imagined” – perhaps because on the <italic>FT's</italic> lunch guest list, the Alpha Male predominates: tall, rich, powerful. But Barber captures the voice and vocabulary of the “morally complicated, unreassuring” Amis.</p>
<p>And that is the point about interviews: unlike cuttings-job profiles or newspage background pieces, they must reflect what it's like to spend an hour in the subject's company. They need grit, no matter how thrilled the writer is to be lunching with this famous person. And they must – please – tell me something new.</p>
<p>Nigel Spivey obliges. On Lord Hanson, a dream interviewee, he begins: “Hanson hails from Viking stock. So does Spivey. Eye to eye at the altitude of 6ft 2in, we measured each other up. Hanson's ancestry lies in Huddersfield; Spivey's, around Leeds.” There the similarities end. Spivey gets Hanson to disclose his salary (<italic>£</italic>1,362,000 a year in 1996) and then most enjoyably observes Hanson's reaction when the garcon at The Berkeley, where he is an habitué, forbids him to smoke his usual cigar, explaining that customers have complained. “Manager will be hearing from me,” snaps Hanson ominously. The Berkeley has just lost an esteemed customer. Lovely stuff!</p>
<p>Naturally the best subjects are certifiable egotists. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair – everyone reacted “with horror or pity” when told she was lunching with him – hands Pilita Clark a bagel (not her choice) in a cardboard box in his office. “He loathes the ‘cretins’ of the CAA, Aer Lingus – and Ryanair customers.” Customer always right? “Horse shit!” Lunching with the gay fashion designers Dolce &amp; Gabbana in their gilded HQ in Milan, Vanessa Friedman is told they were once an item, and still cannot work without one another – “But no sex!” cries Gabbana. “No sex,” agrees Dolce.</p>
<p>It's all about the way people say things. Prince Alwaleed, the world's fifth richest man, at the George V hotel, which he owns, tells Simon Kuper proudly that his new book is “foreworded by President Carter”. “Yeah,” he repeats, “it's being foreworded by President Carter. President Carter. By President Carter.” “Wow,” Kuper finally replies. “President Carter,” says Prince Alwaleed.</p>
<p>Few lunchees drink alcohol and many overlook the food. Sometimes it's just a pot of tea. One Coke and one Sprite for Tsvangirai ($2 plus £950 flight to Harare). The homely diner in Plains, Georgia, where the Jimmy Carters eat, has ketchup on the table: bill $24 for three. When James Harding meets P Diddy, the rapper orders soup and adds: “Bring an extra one for my man.” So, “We slurp soup bulked up with pasta from the local fast-soup store, Hale Hearty Soups.” David Hockney ignores his angel-cake “now lightly dusted with ash” from his Camels. Funniest of all is Steve Wozniak. Richard Waters arrives to find Wozniak already seated facing a polystyrene box containing the Hickory Pit ribs he has just absent-mindedly eaten. Taking Jennifer Paterson to Marco Pierre's place costs Nigel Spivey £220. But it's worth it for the fat lady's excellent company: “What a treat!” she exclaims.</p>
<p>Plugging books (some ghosted) won't wash. It's a dread moment when George Soros (“I really have no problem with being rich”) brings up his new book. And people often won't discuss what readers most wish to know. Stephen Green of HSBC (Lionel Barber again) refuses to judge Fred the Shred, even though Green is an Anglican priest who has written two books about business ethics “and that's why we're having lunch!” But he happily spouts Faust in German as, like Barber, he read German at Oxford.</p>
<p>Quirks and oddities emerge. Martin McGuinness asks Kieran Cooke: “Do you know I have written an ode to the sea trout?” Ksenia Sobchak's Moscow flat was raided by police and a million dollars in envelopes confiscated. “Where else would she keep her cash?” she asks. “Socks?” Lucy Kellaway takes Lord Lawson to the Savoy – the former chancellor, “famous for his arrogance and his fatness,” has just published his diet book. Lawson selects a 1989 Chateau Kirwan at £37.10 a half-bottle. He may be two-thirds the man he was, says Kellaway, “but in personality he has not changed one bit”.</p>
<p>Politicians are gently grilled. Celebs are lightly steamed. Jacques Attali sounds preposterous. It's a salmagundi, this over-rich feast of over-rich egos, and I consumed every morsel, as only a madly keen interview-reader would. Few could actually be termed “classic” – many interviewers today would outshine them. But they make a highly dippable bedside read, and James Ferguson's portraits are speaking likenesses.</p>
<p>Incidentally – it's nagging at me – what does it mean, that a customs official at a Uruguayan airport searched Amis's six-year-old daughter and ‘f∗∗∗-f∗∗∗∗∗d her fluffy toy duck?’</p>
