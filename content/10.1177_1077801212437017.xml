<abstract>
<p>Using data from the 2005 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), this analysis focuses on the impacts that domestic violence mandatory arrest policies have on arrest outcomes in “situationally ambiguous” cases: cases where both the female and male partners have been identified by police as both a victim and an offender. Results indicate that although officers arrest male partners more frequently than female partners, after controlling for incident and individual factors, mandatory arrest policies disproportionately affect women. Furthermore, correlates of arrest differ for male-only arrests versus female-only arrests. These findings are discussed in the context of changing legal responses to domestic violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The decision of states to mandate arrest in cases of domestic violence—regardless of the victim’s wishes—has been highly controversial, with battered women’s advocates, feminists, and academics unable to reach a consensus as to whether mandatory and proarrest policies are in the best interests of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212437017">Jones &amp; Belknap, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212437017">Leisenring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212437017">Rajan &amp; McCloskey, 2007</xref>). Some advocates and academics have argued that changes in domestic violence procedures and policies force law enforcement and actors in the legal system to take domestic violence seriously and that arrest is the appropriate response in cases of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212437017">Zorza, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, they argue that removing the arrest and prosecutorial decision(s) from the victim and placing it on the state alleviates the pressure that the victim may face from her abuser to prevent the police from making an arrest and/or “drop” any criminal charges or civil proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212437017">Leisenring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>). Other advocates and academics have argued against the adoption of these policies, contending that the justice system may in fact further endanger the victim by arresting the batterer, that victims are disempowered by mandatory arrest policies, and that mandatory arrest laws are not beneficial for women of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212437017">Dasgupta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212437017">Mills, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212437017">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212437017">Ruttenberg, 1994</xref>). Other research indicates that with the adoption of these policies, there is an emerging problem of “victim-defendants”—victims who are mistakenly identified as the aggressor in the relationship and arrested and charged with domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437017">Crager, Cousin, &amp; Hardy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the passage of mandatory arrest laws, there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women arrested for intimate partner violence (IPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212437017">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437017">DeLeon-Granados, Wells, &amp; Binsbacher, 2006</xref>), indicating that mandatory arrest laws are having the desired effect. However, what is disconcerting to both advocates and academics is that the trend seen in female arrests has not been matched by a similar trend in male arrests. While the percentage of men arrested for IPV has increased, it has only increased slightly, which has led to a narrowing of the gender gap in the ratio of male-to-female arrests for IPV. There have been several theoretical explanations offered for the decreasing gender gap, including changes in behavior by men and women, as well as changes in the institutional response to cases of IPV (for a description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437017">DeLeon-Granados et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the changing institutional response to IPV and examines the impact of state-level domestic violence arrest policies on arrest outcomes. There is an emerging body of literature that uses data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to analyze the effects of mandatory and proarrest policies on the arrest decision in cases of IPV among heterosexual couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel, Buzawa, Pattavina &amp; Faggiani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Hirschel, Buzawa, Faggiani, &amp; Bently, 2007</xref>). All three of these studies, however, only include in their analyses cases where there is a single victim and a single offender. As only one person has committed an act of violence, the decision for the officer in these cases is <italic>whether</italic> to arrest the single offender, not <italic>whom</italic> to arrest. These are the types of cases for which mandatory and proarrest policies were written: the officers arrive on the scene of the crime, identify the bruised and battered victim and the aggressive perpetrator, and then arrest the perpetrator for the crime.</p>
<p>However, reality has proven far more complicated than this stereotypical version of IPV. In many cases, officers arrive on the scene and it is difficult for them to discern who is the victim and who is the perpetrator—both parties may have injuries, both parties may have committed acts of violence, and both parties may claim that they are the “true” victim. I call these types of cases “situationally ambiguous.” In “situationally ambiguous” cases, it may be unclear to the police what the context, motivation, and consequences of the violence are for both parties and who should be considered the perpetrator in the relationship. These types of cases often blur the boundaries of victimization and offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437017">Ferraro, 2006</xref>). In these cases, officers may determine that there is more than one offender and/or one victim, and thus these cases are not included in the samples analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al. (2007)</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Buzawa, Hirschel, &amp; Faggiani (2007)</xref>. Yet I argue that it is in these types of cases that mandatory and proarrest policies may have the greatest impact on officer decision making, as officers may rely on policy to guide their decision to arrest either one or both parties in situationally ambiguous cases. Recent research on victim precipitation and arrests for IPV supports the idea that police in mandatory arrest jurisdictions confronted with situationally ambiguous cases “resolve that confusion by arresting both partners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437017">Finn &amp; Bettis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212437017">Muftic, Bouffard, &amp; Bouffard, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is in these cases that mandatory and proarrest policies have the greatest consequences for the arrest decision (and hence the greatest consequences for women).</p>
<p>This analysis extends the current body of literature on arrests for IPV by examining the effect of state-level domestic violence arrest policies on arrest outcomes in “situationally ambiguous” cases. By understanding officer discretion in these cases, one can more closely examine the impact of mandatory and proarrest policies on both single and dual arrests for IPV, especially in cases that do not fit stereotypical expectations of IPV. Furthermore, one can investigate whether arrests for IPV are “gendered”—whether there are differences in the patterns of arrests for male and female offenders, and whether mandatory and proarrest policies have different impacts on men and women who have committed acts of IPV.</p>

<title>The Criminalization of Domestic Violence</title>
<p>Both the criminalization of domestic violence and the implementation of mandatory and proarrest policies are relatively new phenomena. In 1970, only a handful of police departments encouraged their officers to make arrests in domestic violence cases; in fact, most had policies that explicitly discouraged officers from making arrests in such cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212437017">Ferraro, 1989</xref>). Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, increasing public awareness of the problem of domestic violence, pressure from feminists, researchers, and advocates, and several lawsuits filed by victims against police departments, led to significant changes in both the legal definition of and response to domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437017">Hirschel &amp; Buzawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212437017">Rajan &amp; McClosky, 2007</xref>). By 1980, nearly every state had passed some form of domestic violence legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212437017">Horton, Simondis, &amp; Simondis, 1987</xref>), including mandatory domestic violence training for law enforcement personnel, civil protection orders, and an increase in penalties for committing acts of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212437017">Leisenring, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This growing criminalization of domestic violence was hailed as a “symbolic” victory for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212437017">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>), and advocates of mandatory and proarrest laws argued that their implementation sent a “powerful message” to both batterers and society about the seriousness of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212437017">Goodmark, 2004</xref>, p. 31; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212437017">Miller, 2001</xref>). The adoption of mandatory and proarrest policies was intended to encourage the justice system to treat domestic violence crimes as seriously as other crimes, to deter abusers from future violence, and to help keep victims safe by placing the locus of responsibility for arrest and prosecution on the state (so that the abuser did not have an incentive to threaten or harm the victim).</p>
<p>The first large-scale field experiment examining domestic violence mandatory arrest policies and recidivism rates was the 1984 Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment (MDVE). Initial evidence from the MDVE showed that arresting the perpetrator did benefit victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212437017">Maxwell, Garner, &amp; Fagan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212437017">Schmidt &amp; Sherman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212437017">Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984</xref>). Recidivism rates were 50% lower when the batterer was arrested than when officers chose another form of intervention (either ordering one party out of the home or mediating between the parties at the scene). Replications of the MDVE, however, found that arrest actually <italic>increased</italic> recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212437017">Maxwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212437017">Schmidt &amp; Sherman, 1993</xref>). Despite the mixed results of the MDVE and subsequent replications, the results of the original MDVE dramatically shifted the way that law enforcement responded to cases of domestic violence. After these results were made public, over one third of all police departments adopted some form of a mandatory or proarrest domestic violence policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212437017">Maxwell et al., 2001</xref>). As of 2000, all states had authorized warrantless arrests for IPV if there is probable cause that an offense has been committed by the arrestee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212437017">Miller, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Trends in Arrests for IPV</title>
<p>Since mandatory and proarrest policies were implemented, arrest rates for IPV have increased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437017">Hirschel and Buzawa (2002)</xref> estimate that arrest rates for IPV in the 1970s and 1980s were 7% to 15%, while studies in the 1990s (after the passage of mandatory and proarrest laws) reported rates of 33% to 50% (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212437017">Bourg &amp; Stock, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212437017">Jordan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212437017">Mignon &amp; Holmes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Buzawa, Hirschel, &amp; Faggiani et al., 2007</xref>). This increase is likely due to the implementation of mandatory and proarrest laws; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437017">Pattavina and her colleagues (2007)</xref>, using law enforcement data from the 2000 NIBRS, found that arrest rates were significantly higher in jurisdictions with mandatory and proarrest laws, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Women have been disproportionately affected by the increase in the number of arrests for IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212437017">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437017">DeLeon-Granados et al., 2006</xref>). In California, between 1991 and 1996, arrests of women for domestic violence rose by 156% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212437017">Strack, 2000</xref>). Similar trends in female arrest rates have been documented in New Hampshire, Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, and Maryland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437017">Crager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212437017">Martin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212437017">Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212437017">Simpson, Bouffard, Garner, &amp; Hickman, 2006</xref>). While arrest rates for men who commit acts of IPV have also increased, these increases have not been as large as the arrest rates for women. In California, for example, between 1991 and 1996, arrests of men for domestic violence increased by 21%, far less than the 156% for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212437017">Strack, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the increase in female arrests has been attributed to the increase in dual arrests (where both intimate partners are arrested). Estimates of dual arrests for IPV range from 1% to 33%, with more recent studies reporting lower rates of dual arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212437017">Martin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212437017">Mignon &amp; Holmes, 1995</xref>). Dual arrest defendants are more likely to be women, White, and younger than those who are singly arrested for IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212437017">Martin, 1997</xref>), and women arrested for IPV are four times more likely than male arrestees to have been dually arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212437017">Henning &amp; Renauer, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212437017">Melton &amp; Belknap, 2003</xref>). Officers may rely on dual arrest in situations where they perceive that both the male and female partner have engaged in acts of violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437017">Finn and Bettis (2006)</xref> interviewed police officers who had read a script describing a domestic violence call and found that officers were “reluctant to fully investigate the context within which an incident of family violence occurs” (p. 282). Instead of determining the primary aggressor in the relationship, officers arrested both parties. The officers did not see dual arrest as a punitive measure, but instead expressed that the arrest would be “helpful” to the female partner by encouraging her to participate in the prosecution of her male partner and by facilitating contact with social service agencies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There are significant differences between men who are dually arrested and women who are dually arrested. Many female dual arrestees are the victims of IPV; of the victims contacted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212437017">Houry, Reddy, and Parramore (2006)</xref>, 9% had been dually arrested along with their abuser. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212437017">Feder and Henning (2005)</xref> report that among those individuals dually arrested for IPV, male arrestees were more likely to have physically assaulted, injured, or threatened to kill their partner than were female arrestees. Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212437017">Feder and Henning (2005)</xref>, dually arrested males are more likely to have demonstrated “a pattern of increasing severity and/or frequency of violence against their (female) partner” than women who are dually arrested (p. 163). Women who are dually arrested are more likely than men to have been victimized previously by an intimate partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212437017">Martin, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Relatively few studies have examined the role of gender in arrest decisions in cases of IPV. The results of these studies are mixed. Some studies suggest that female offenders are treated more leniently than male offenders in cases of IPV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212437017">Felson and Pare (2007)</xref> used self-report victimization data from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) and found that women who assaulted a male intimate partner were less likely to be arrested than men who assaulted a female intimate partner. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212437017">Tjaden and Thoennes (2000)</xref>, also using NVAWS data, report that 36% of female victims physically assaulted by an intimate partner reported that their partner was arrested, as compared to only 12% of male victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212437017">Connolly, Huzurbazar, and Routh-McGee (2000)</xref> analyzed cases of domestic violence where there was more than one victim or one offender and found that male offenders were more likely to be arrested than female offenders. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437017">Buzawa and Hotaling (2000)</xref> examined domestic violence cases in three Massachusetts towns and found that when the victim was male, women were five times more likely to be arrested than men.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown no effect of offender and/or victim gender on the arrest decision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212437017">Jones and Belknap (1999)</xref> examined cases of IPV in a proarrest jurisdiction in Colorado and found that male offenders were no more likely than female offenders to have police action taken against them; however, men were more likely than women to be jailed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212437017">Ho (2003)</xref> analyzed cases of aggravated assault among intimate partners and found that men and women had similar arrest rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212437017">Simpson et al. (2006)</xref> used law enforcement data from Maryland to determine whether mandatory arrest policies had differential impacts on men and women. Although both men and women were more likely to be arrested after the implementation of mandatory arrest in Maryland, there was not a statistically significant difference in the change in arrests by gender. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212437017">Hall (2005)</xref> analyzed cases of domestic violence reported to law enforcement in New York State and found that the gender of the suspect was not a predictor of arrest. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212437017">Robinson and Chandek (2000)</xref> examined the effect of the gender of the victim and the offender in cases of domestic violence reported to law enforcement and failed to find a relationship between gender and arrest. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212437017">Connolly et al. (2000)</xref>, all domestic violence cases were included in the analysis, not just cases of IPV.</p>
<p>Once labeled a “suspect” by law enforcement, however, there is some evidence that suggests women are more likely than men to be arrested for IPV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437017">Buzawa and Hotaling (2000)</xref> examined police responses to domestic violence in Massachusetts and found that the odds of a woman being arrested are nearly two and a half times that of a man once she is labeled a suspect. It is important to note that as with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212437017">Connolly et al. (2000)</xref>, Buzawa and Hotaling’s analysis is for all domestic violence incidents, not just IPV. Still, this finding is important to consider given that the study examines cases of IPV where police have determined that the female partner has committed an act of IPV. Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212437017">Bourg and Stock (1994)</xref>, women arrested for IPV are charged with more serious crimes than are men.</p>
<p>Of the three studies using NIBRS data to examine the correlates of arrest in cases of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Buzawa et al., 2007</xref>), two failed to find a statistically significant relationship between the gender of the victim or the offender and the likelihood of arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Buzawa et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al. (2007)</xref> found that if the offender was female, law enforcement was significantly more likely to make a dual arrest. The results of all three studies indicated that mandatory arrest policies were associated with an increase in the likelihood of arrest. Each of these three studies, however, limited their analyses to cases where there was one victim and one offender. No previous research has used law enforcement data to analyze the impacts of gender and mandatory arrest policies on the arrest decision in situationally ambiguous cases of IPV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077801212437017" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The data for this analysis come from the 2005 NIBRS incident-level file. NIBRS contains information about all incidents of criminal activity reported to law enforcement in participating jurisdictions on an annual basis; as of 2005, 28 states and the District of Columbia were participating in NIBRS.</p>
<p>Several elements of the structure of NIBRS afford researchers the unique opportunity to examine cases of domestic violence reported to law enforcement. First, cases of domestic violence can be identified as detailed information about the relationship between the victim(s) and the offender(s) is recorded; in the Uniform Crime Report (UCR), the relationship is not recorded beyond “stranger” versus “nonstranger,” making it impossible to identify IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212437017">U.S. Department of Justice, 2008</xref>). Second, the UCR only collects information on “Part 1 crimes”: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212437017">U.S. Department of Justice, 2008</xref>). NIBRS contains information about 46 crimes (and arrest information about an additional eight crimes), allowing researchers to look at a wider array of IPV offenses, thereby providing a more comprehensive analysis of IPV. For these analyses, the expanded list of crimes in the NIBRS allows for the identification and inclusion of incidents involving intimate partners where kidnapping/abduction, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, forcible fondling, simple assault, and/or intimidation occurred. These incidents do not appear in the UCR.</p>
<p>The UCR also has a “hierarchy rule.” Only one crime is recorded for each incident. If more than one crime is committed by the offender, only the “highest” or most severe crime is recorded for that incident. So, for example, if an offender committed both a forcible rape and an aggravated assault, only the forcible rape would be recorded; the aggravated assault would be omitted from the UCR data set. In contrast, the NIBRS includes information on up to 10 offenses committed by each offender in the incident.</p>
<p>Of the 300,859 incidents of IPV reported to the police in 2005 in participating jurisdictions, a subset of 14,728 “situationally ambiguous” incidents is included in these analyses. I define “situationally ambiguous cases” as those cases that meet four selection criteria. First, the incident must involve two individuals, each of whom is listed as both a victim and an offender. Second, the two individuals must be “intimate partners”: spouses, common-law spouses, ex-spouses, or “boyfriend/girlfriend.” Third, the incident must include offenses that meet the legal criteria of “domestic violence.” Incidents that meet the legal criteria of “domestic violence” included one or more of the following offenses: aggravated assault, simple assault, and/or intimidation. An aggravated assault in the NIBRS, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212437017">Federal Bureau of Investigation (2000)</xref>, is</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>an unlawful attack by one person upon another wherein the offender uses a weapon or displays it in a threatening manner, or the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. (p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A simple assault is</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>an unlawful physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An act of intimidation is</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>to unlawfully place another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to an actual physical attack. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the NIBRS, intimidation specifically includes stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212437017">FBI, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Incidents where only sexual offenses (forcible rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, and forcible fondling) or kidnapping had occurred were omitted from the analyses as they were relatively rare among those dyads where both partners had committed at least one act of IPV (48 cases, or less than .3% of the sample). Finally, only heterosexual couples were included in these analyses as police decision making may be different in cases of same-sex violence than for heterosexual couples; even greater differences are found between male same-sex couples and female same-sex couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212437017">Pattavina, Hirschel, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1077801212437017">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>As noted previously, the dependent variable is the arrest outcome for the case; a single four-category variable with mutually exclusive categories: neither the male nor the female partner was arrested, only the female partner was arrested, only the male partner was arrested, or both parties were arrested. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437017">Table 1</xref> shows the distributions of the dependent and independent variables; in 55% of the incidents included in these analyses no arrest was made.

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The key independent variable of interest is the <italic>arrest policy</italic> as specified by state law for domestic violence incidents. These data were collected from the relevant statutes for each state (available online through Lexis-Nexis). There are three main types of domestic violence arrest policies: mandatory arrest, proarrest, and discretionary arrest. Each type of law requires a certain action of law enforcement officers within that jurisdiction, and thus each has different implications for domestic violence victims and perpetrators.</p>
<sec id="section8-1077801212437017">
<title>Mandatory arrest</title>
<p>Mandatory arrest laws require law enforcement to make an arrest if there is evidence that an act of domestic violence has taken place or that there is an imminent threat of physical or sexual harm. The definition of what constitutes an act of violence or an imminent threat, however, varies widely. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al.’s (2007)</xref> report, in some states any assault would result in a mandatory arrest, while in others the assault must be a felony or have been committed within the past 12 to 24 hours. Of the 23 states included in these analyses, 10 had mandatory arrest policies; 7,618 of the 14,728 cases for this analysis (52%) come from these states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212437017">
<title>Proarrest</title>
<p>Proarrest laws do not require that law enforcement officers make an arrest. Instead, these laws explicitly state that arrest is the “preferred” or “encouraged” outcome. Six states included in these analyses had preferred arrest policies in 2005; 5,228 cases in the sample (35%) are from states with preferred arrest policies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801212437017">
<title>Discretionary arrest</title>
<p>Seven of the states included in these analyses had discretionary arrest policies in 2005; 1,882 cases (13%) occurred in states with discretionary arrest policies. Discretionary arrest policies allow law enforcement to make an arrest if there is probable cause that an act of domestic violence has occurred, but the policies do not mandate arrest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801212437017">
<title>Incident characteristics</title>
<p>Several characteristics of the incident were included in the analyses as they may influence the likelihood of arrest. The type of offense committed during the incident is captured through the inclusion of four dichotomous variables indicating whether the female partner had been the victim of (a) an aggravated assault or (b) an act of intimidation, and whether the male partner had been the victim of (c) an aggravated assault or (d) an act of intimidation. The reference categories for the type of offense committed were simple assault committed against the female partner and simple assault committed against the male partner. The offense type in cases where the female and/or male partners suffered multiple victimizations was coded as the first offense listed by the responding officer that met the criteria for an act of IPV. As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437017">Table 1</xref>, of the female partners, 8% were the victims of an aggravated assault, 86% were the victims of a simple assault, and 6% were the victims of an act of intimidation. The distribution of victimizations for the male partners is nearly identical to that of the female partners; 10% of the male partners had been the victims of an aggravated assault, 84% had suffered a simple assault, and 6% had been the victims of an act of intimidation.</p>
<p>The likelihood of dual arrest in a domestic violence incident may also be influenced by the relative degree of severity of the offense. Incidents in which the offenses committed by each partner are the same (i.e., each party has committed “equivalent” offenses) may be more likely to result in a dual arrest, while incidents in which the offenses committed by one partner are more severe than those committed by the other partner may be more likely to result in the arrest of the party who committed the more serious offense. Whether “equivalent” offenses were committed by each party is measured by a dichotomous variable; equivalent offenses were committed in 95% of the cases included in these analyses.</p>
<p>Two dichotomous variables indicating whether the female partner had suffered a major injury (“apparent broken bones,” “other major injury,” “possible internal injury,” “loss of teeth,” “severe laceration,” or “unconsciousness”) or a minor injury (“apparent minor injury”) were created, with the reference category of no apparent injury to the female partner. These two variables were replicated to indicate the type of injury, if any, sustained by the male partner. Two percent of the men and 1% of the women included in these analyses had sustained a “major injury,” 43% of the men and 45% of the women had sustained a “minor injury,” and 55% of the men and 54% of the women had not sustained an injury.</p>
<p>Other incident characteristics included in the analysis are the use of a weapon (other than hands/feet) by either partner, the location of the incident, and substance use (either alcohol and/or drugs) by either/both parties. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437017">Table 1</xref>, a weapon was used in 12% of the incidents. Seventeen percent of the incidents in this study occurred in a public location; 83% occurred in a private location. Substance use was noted in 19% of the cases analyzed here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212437017">
<title>Individual characteristics</title>
<p>The race of the male and female partners was captured through the inclusion of four dichotomous variables indicating whether the male partner was Black or “Other” (Asian/Pacific Islander or Native American) and/or the female partner was Black or “Other” (Asian/Pacific Islander or Native American). It should be noted that the NIBRS only provides data on Hispanic origin for arrestees, not for all individuals, so it is not possible to identify individuals in this sample who are of Hispanic origin. Thus, White Hispanics are coded as White, Black Hispanics as Black, and Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American Hispanics as “Other.” Thirty-four percent of men and 30% of women in the sample were Black, 65% of men and 68% of women were White, and 1% of both men and women were of another race.</p>
<p>The age of the male partner and the female partner was measured in years. The average age of male partners in the sample was 33.54 years; the average age of female partners was 30.92 years.</p>
<p>The relationship between the male and female partners was measured using two dichotomous variables: whether the partners were spouses/common-law spouses or ex-spouses, with boyfriend/girlfriend as the reference category. Of the dyads included in this analysis, at the time of the incident 37% were married, 6% were common-law spouses, 3% were ex-spouses, and 54% were boyfriend/girlfriend.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077801212437017">
<title>Analytic Technique</title>
<p>To examine the bivariate relationship between arrests for IPV and domestic violence arrest policies, I compare the differences between the proportion of incidents that end in no arrest, female-only arrest, male-only arrest, and dual arrest for each policy type: mandatory arrest, proarrest, and officer discretion. As any observed differences may be due to other characteristics of the incident and of the individuals involved, I also conduct a multivariate analysis. To analyze the relationship between arrest policies and outcomes for cases of IPV on a multivariate level, I use multinomial logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression is appropriate as the dependent variable of interest—the type of arrest made—is nominal and contains four mutually exclusive categories. Multinomial logistic regression can be thought of as a series of binary logistic regressions that compare each of the three arrest types (female-only arrest, male-only arrest, and dual arrest) to a fourth reference category (no arrest). For each independent variable, then, there are three separate comparisons: no arrest versus female-only arrest, no arrest versus male-only arrest, and no arrest versus dual arrest. To measure the magnitude of the effects of the independent variables on arrest outcomes, I calculate the odds ratio for each independent variable. Odds ratios with a value of less than 1 indicates that the variable decreases the odds of a particular outcome, and odds ratios with a value greater than 1 indicates that the variable increases the odds of a particular outcome.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212437017">Table 2</xref> shows, states with mandatory arrest laws have the highest percentage of male-only arrest (7%), female-only arrests (5%), and dual arrests (43%). This suggests that mandatory arrest policies are having the desired effect of increasing arrests for IPV and decreasing the percentage of IPV cases that result in no arrest. It is notable, however, that in 46% of cases of IPV where at least two offenses have been committed (one by the male partner, one by the female partner) the officer(s) still do not make any arrest. These differences are statistically significant at the .05 level.</p>

<p>States with preferred arrest policies have the highest percentage of incidents resulting in no arrest (68%). It is surprising that these states have higher rates of no arrest than do states that have an officer discretion policy, as one would expect there to be a greater number of arrests in states where arrests for IPV are encouraged than in states with officer discretion policies. Preferred arrest states also had the fewest number of dual arrests (24%). States with preferred arrest policies and officer discretion policies had almost identical rates of male-only (5%) and female-only (3%) arrests.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212437017">Table 2</xref> also shows that across each of the policy regimes, men are slightly more likely to be arrested for IPV than are women: 41% of cases of IPV that are reported to the police end in a male arrest (either singly or dually) and 40% end in a female arrest (either singly or dually). This pattern holds true for each of the three policy types. In states with mandatory arrest policies, 50% of men and 48% of women are arrested for IPV; in states with proarrest policies, 29% of men and 27% of women are arrested for IPV; and in states with officer discretion policies, 43% of men and 41% of women are arrested for IPV.</p>
<p>The results from the multinomial logistic regression analysis shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212437017">Table 3</xref> also support the hypothesis that officers in states with mandatory arrest policies are significantly more likely to make an arrest than officers in states with proarrest policies or officer discretion policies. After controlling for incident and demographic characteristics, incidents of IPV reported to the police in states with mandatory arrest policies are 1.59 times more likely to result in the arrest of the male partner (only), 2.33 times more likely to result in the arrest of the female partner (only), and 1.38 times more likely to result in the arrest of both partners as compared to no arrest.</p>

<p>While the bivariate results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212437017">Table 2</xref> indicate that men were slightly more likely than women to be arrested for IPV, the multivariate results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212437017">Table 3</xref> tell a different story. These results indicate that mandatory arrest policies disproportionally affect women: in mandatory arrest states, after controlling for incident and individual characteristics, the odds of a female-only arrest is 1.47 times greater than the odds of a male-only arrest and 1.69 times greater than the odds of a dual arrest. This is notable given that the proportion of female-only arrests is lower than the proportion for male-only arrests and dual arrests under all three policy regimes. As this effect is net of the type of offense committed and the injury sustained by the victim, this suggests that some of the dramatic rise in female arrest rates for officially reported IPV is directly attributable to the implementation of mandatory arrest policies and not simply an increased use of violence by women in intimate relationships.</p>
<p>In proarrest states, however, officers are less likely to arrest the male partner or make a dual arrest than in states with officer discretion policies or mandatory arrest policies. Proarrest policies decrease the likelihood of the arrest of the male partner (only) by three-quarters and the likelihood of dual arrest by half as compared to no arrest. There is not a statistically significant relationship between the implementation of proarrest policies and female-only arrest.</p>
<p>Several characteristics of the incident were also significant predictors of arrest, most of which were consistent with previous research and in the expected direction. First, there was a significant relationship between the type of offense committed and the arrest decision. Incidents where the male partner committed an aggravated assault against the female partner were 2.16 times more likely to result in the arrest of the male partner (only) than to result in no arrest. Similarly, incidents where the female partner committed an aggravated assault against the male partner were 1.79 times more likely to result in the arrest of the female partner (only) than to result in no arrest. However, there was a key difference by gender for dual arrests. Incidents where the female partner committed an aggravated assault against the male partner were 1.47 times more likely to result in dual arrest, but aggravated assault against the female partner was not significantly related to dual arrest. Thus, when examining the decision to arrest both partners, the type of offense committed is significant for female offenders but it is not significant for male offenders. Female offenders who commit aggravated assaults against men are more likely to be dually arrested, suggesting that officers may see these situations as mutually combative rather than as isolated, unidirectional acts of aggression against a male partner.</p>
<p>This explanation is also consistent with the pattern of results for the type of injury inflicted on the other partner. When the male partner suffers a major injury, the police are more likely to arrest the female partner (log odds of 2.98). Similarly, when the female partner suffers a major injury, the police are more likely to arrest the male partner (log odds of 2.66). Intuitively, this makes sense: when one partner is severely injured, the police are more likely to arrest the other partner. However, when the female partner inflicts a major injury on the male partner, the police are also significantly more likely to make a <italic>dual</italic> arrest (log odds 1.99). The converse is not true; there is no significant relationship between major injury of the female partner and dual arrest. This suggests that police often see incidents where the male partner is severely injured as mutually combative and perhaps more complex than as simply a case where one partner has committed acts of violence against the other. A second explanation for this effect is that women, who usually are physically smaller than their male partners, are forced to use more serious forms of violence in self-defense, resulting in more severe injuries to the male partner. Men’s use of more serious forms of violence may be less likely to be in self-defense, which would also explain why major injury to the female partner is not significantly associated with dual arrest. Both of these explanations are consistent with the patterns of effects by gender for the type of offense committed on arrest outcomes.</p>
<p>Minor injuries to both the female and male partner are also associated with arrest outcomes. When the female partner suffers a minor injury, the male partner is more likely to be arrested, either singly or dually (log odds of 2.86 and 1.96), and when the male partner suffers a minor injury, the female partner is more likely to be arrested (log odds of 1.65 and 1.76). The key difference between the degree of injury and arrest decisions is the significant relationship between minor injury to the female partner and dual arrest. While major injuries to the female partner are not significantly associated with dual arrest, minor injuries are positively associated with dual arrest. Thus incidents with minor injuries have more similar outcomes for men and women than do incidents with major injuries, where there is a notable difference by gender. Incidents where the female partner has a minor injury may be more likely to be seen as mutually combative (and thus meriting the arrest of both parties) than are incidents where the female partner has a major injury (meriting arrest of the male partner only).</p>
<p>Three other incident-level factors related to arrest outcomes differed by gender. When both partners commit equivalent offenses, officers are 1.5 times more likely to make no arrest at all than to make a dual arrest, and more than twice as likely to make no arrest than to arrest the male partner. There was no significant relationship between equivalent offenses and female-only arrest. Second, the use of a weapon by either partner was also a significant predictor of male arrest; these incidents were 1.45 times more likely to result in a male-only arrest, but were not related to female-only arrest or dual arrest. Last, incidents that occur in a public location are significantly more likely to result in a female-only arrest (log odds 1.31) or in a dual arrest (log odds 1.23). There was not a significant association between location and male-only arrests. Substance use was positively associated with all arrest outcomes: it increased the odds of female-only arrest, male-only arrest, and dual arrest.</p>
<p>Of the individual characteristics included in the model, only race achieved statistical significance, and solely for female-only arrests and dual arrests. Officers are less likely to make female-only and dual arrests in incidents with a Black male partner (log odds of .63 and .71, respectively). Officers are more than twice as likely to make a female-only arrest when the female partner is not White or Black (log odds 2.31). Incidents with a male partner who is not White or Black are also more likely to end in a dual arrest (log odds of 1.67) than to result in no arrest. Again, it is important to note when discussing the findings on race that the NIBRS does not collect information on Hispanic origin other than for arrestees. As it is not possible to identify those individuals of Hispanic origin, the categories “White,” “Black,” and “Other” likely include individuals of Hispanic origin.</p>
<p>Neither the age of the female and male partner nor the type of relationship were significantly associated with the arrest outcome. The lack of an association of age and arrest outcomes is somewhat surprising as both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437017">Eitle (2005)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al. (2007)</xref> studies found a positive relationship between age and arrest for IPV. The type of relationship also was not significantly associated with the arrest outcome. Although previous research indicates that married couples and common-law spouses are less likely to be arrested for IPV than are unmarried couples, after controlling for policy type and incident and individual characteristics, there were no significant differences in the patterns of arrest for spouses, common-law spouses, ex-spouses, and dating couples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the passage of mandatory and proarrest policies for domestic violence, the number of individuals arrested for IPV has increased dramatically. Although more men are being arrested as a result of these policies, increases in the percentage of women arrested for IPV has far outpaced those for men. It is important to understand the arrest decisions of officers in situationally ambiguous cases, as other research has shown that arrest decisions have important impacts on victims. Victims who are mistakenly arrested along with their abuser are less likely to use the police as a resource in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437017">Crager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>), and prosecutors are significantly less likely to file charges in cases of IPV where no arrest is made at the crime scene or when officers determined that there had been a mutual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212437017">Worrall, Ross, &amp; McCord, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller (2005)</xref>, women arrested for IPV often plead guilty to “get the case over with,” which can result in them</p>

<p>being barred from certain employment opportunities, denial or loss of public housing, denial or loss of welfare benefits, immigration status problems, and problems related to custody hearings—all things that disproportionately harm women since they tend to be the primary caregivers. (p. 85)</p>

<p>(See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437017">Ferraro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437017">Hirschel &amp; Buzawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212437017">Miller, 2001</xref>.) Women who plead guilty also may face additional criminal penalties, which may include fines, jail time, and/or the completion of a court-mandated batterer’s treatment program. The consequences of arrest are especially troubling given that some law enforcement officers see dual arrest as a way to <italic>help</italic> victims of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437017">Finn &amp; Bettis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212437017">Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies have examined the role of gender in the arrest decision in cases of IPV. This study is the first to use NIBRS data to examine the impact of domestic violence arrest policies on arrest outcomes in “situationally ambiguous” cases—i.e., cases where both intimate partners have committed acts of violence against their partner. Previous research on arrests for IPV has examined the impact of mandatory and proarrest policies on arrest decisions for <italic>all</italic> cases of IPV reported to the police, and has generally failed to find a significant relationship between gender and the arrest decision. In the majority of these cases, there is only one victim and one offender, and the decision facing the officer(s) is not whom to arrest but whether to make an arrest. In situationally ambiguous cases, however, officers must decide not only whether to make an arrest but which individual(s) should be arrested. Because of the complexity of these cases, I argue it is in these cases that mandatory and proarrest policies have the greatest impact on officer decision making, and therefore in these cases that domestic violence arrest policies have potentially the greatest consequences for women.</p>
<p>The results of this study lend support to the idea that mandatory and proarrest policies have direct impacts on arrest decisions in situationally ambiguous cases of IPV and that these impacts are gendered—they have differential impacts for men and women. Although a greater proportion of men are arrested for IPV than are women, multivariate analyses indicate that after controlling for incident and individual characteristics, mandatory arrest policies disproportionately affect women. Net of incident and individual characteristics, officers in states with mandatory arrest policies are 2.33 times more likely to make a female-only arrest, 1.38 times more likely to make a dual arrest, and 1.59 times more likely to make a male-only arrest in cases of IPV that are situationally ambiguous. However, even in cases where officers have determined that both partners have committed acts of IPV, officers only make an arrest 54% of the time; in 46% of these cases no arrest is made, despite the fact that mandatory arrest policies <italic>require</italic> arrest when acts of IPV have been committed.</p>
<p>In proarrest states, cases of situationally ambiguous IPV are actually less likely to result in an arrest than in states with officer discretion policies or mandatory arrest policies. Officers make arrests in only 32% of these cases. As proarrest policies are intended to encourage arrests for IPV, the low proportion of cases resulting in an arrest is somewhat surprising. However, when arrests are disaggregated by arrest type—female-only arrest, male-only arrest, and dual arrest—it becomes clear that the decrease in the likelihood of any arrest is due to a sharp decrease in the number of dual arrests. Officers in states with proarrest policies make dual arrests only 24% of the time, far lower than the 43% in mandatory arrest states and 39% in officer discretion states. One explanation for the lower rate of dual arrests is that officers take seriously their mandate to determine which partner is the primary aggressor and which partner is the victim in the case rather than just arresting both parties. However, one would expect that if this were true, there would be a commensurate increase in the number of male-only and female-only arrests. Instead, the proportion of cases that end in male-only and female-only arrests in proarrest states is actually lower than in mandatory arrest states and is nearly identical to officer discretion states. Further research is needed to determine why the proportion of incidents resulting in arrest is lower in states with proarrest policies than in other states.</p>
<p>In many respects, the findings of this analysis are similar to those of other studies of IPV reported to law enforcement. Race is a significant predictor of arrest, as is the type of offense, the use of a weapon, substance use, the location of the crime, and whether injuries were sustained. However, previous research has not found a significant relationship between the gender of the offender and the arrest outcome. The results of this study indicate that gender is an important component of the arrest decision in situationally ambiguous cases. For example, major injury to the female partner is a correlate of male-only arrest, while major injury to the male partner is a correlate of both female-only <italic>and</italic> dual arrest. Similarly, aggravated assault to the female partner is a correlate of male-only arrest, while aggravated assault to the male partner is a correlate of both female-only <italic>and</italic> dual arrest.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study, and thus caution should be used when interpreting the findings presented here. First, it is difficult to know whether the findings here are generalizable to other areas. As noted earlier, the data are not nationally representative. Unlike the Uniform Crime Report, which covered 95% of the U.S. population in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212437017">U.S. Department of Justice, 2006</xref>), the 2005 NIBRS data used here come from only 23 states, and not every jurisdiction in each of the 23 states participates in NIBRS. Furthermore, rural states (and within each state, rural jurisdictions) are overrepresented in the NIBRS. Thus the findings here may not be representative of more urban states and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study is the lack of information about the ethnicity of victims and offenders. NIBRS only collects information about Hispanic origin for arrestees, not for victims or offenders. As the race of both the female and male partner was significantly associated with female-only and dual arrest outcomes, it is reasonable to assume that ethnicity may also be correlated with arrests for IPV. This omission is particularly striking given the proportion of the U.S. population that is of Hispanic origin. The number of Hispanics in the United States is projected to rise over the next few decades, and accurate law enforcement data as to the ethnicity of both victims and offenders will be increasingly important in understanding the dynamics of arrest decisions in cases of IPV among individuals of Hispanic descent.</p>
<p>Finally, the models analyzed here do not include other incident and individual characteristics that may be correlated with the arrest decision, such as the demeanor of the female and male partners, whether either partner had left the crime scene, or whether there were other court orders or warrants. Each of these factors may influence the arrest decision, but are not available in the NIBRS data. The addition of these types of variables would allow researchers to better understand the relationship between arrest and other incident and individual characteristics.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, this analysis has important implications for future research. The results of this study suggest that some of the reasons for the increase in arrests for IPV are due to the passage of mandatory and proarrest policies and that women have been disproportionately affected by these policies. With the one exception of an effect for dual (not single) arrest for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437017">Hirschel et al., 2007</xref>), prior research with the 2000 NIBRS has failed to find a relationship between the gender of the offender and arrest outcomes. One possible reason for the differences in the findings of this study as compared to other studies is that previous research used the 2000 NIBRS, while this study uses data from the 2005 NIBRS. Further research is needed to investigate whether the effect of mandatory and proarrest policies has changed over time. The lack of an association may also be due to the use of different sampling and modeling strategies. This study exclusively focused on dyads where each intimate partner was both a victim and an offender, while previous studies used only incidents where there was one victim and one offender. The previous studies with NIBRS data also used slightly different dependent variables—arrest versus no arrest, and dual arrest versus single arrest—than the four-category dependent variable used here. Future analyses with the NIBRS data can examine each of these possibilities to determine which, if any, of these factors is responsible for the differences in the pattern of arrests by gender.</p>
