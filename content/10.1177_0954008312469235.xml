ZnO is currently used in various applications, such as light-emitting diodes and in solar cells. Furthermore, ZnO-based NCs have been attracting considerable attention because NPs possess a large surface-to-volume ratio. The interaction between ZnO NPs and the surrounding materials can thus strongly affect the physical properties of NPs, offering a valuable means in engineer applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954008312469235">9</xref></sup> In recent years, preparation of polymers hybridized with metallic oxides created an innovative field of active research for different applications due to the unique combination of advantageous properties of each of the components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954008312469235">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954008312469235">11</xref></sup> In fact, the properties of hybrid materials are extensively relying on the situation of inorganic NPs, particle size, distribution and dispersion homogeneity over the entire matrix.</p><p>Different kinds of polymers such as polyurethanes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954008312469235">12</xref></sup> polyamides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954008312469235">13</xref></sup> and polyimides (PIs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954008312469235">14</xref></sup> were mainly used for the preparation of NCs. Due to the complementary balance between properties and functional groups, poly(amide-imide)s (PAIs) being a hopeful matrix nominee for the preparation of NCs. The thermally stable polymers that contain the optical active moieties showed great interest.

Techniques such as high shear homogenization have been used commercially for deaggregation, while power ultrasound has been demonstrated to be a perfect option for this point. Power ultrasound is an inexpensive means of generating cavitations for emulsification, and it is relatively easy to scale-up. Robust ultrasonic wave irradiations can split bulky particles or particle aggregates into smaller particles. Such effects will diminish the particle size and also increase the reactivity in solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954008312469235">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954008312469235">20</xref></sup> In addition, surface-modified NPs with different molecules have attracted lots of consciousness over many years due to the new properties such as biocompatibility of surfaces and improved physical and chemical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954008312469235">21</xref></sup> NPs coating via the sol–gel process is generally performed using metal alkoxide precursors.

The initial weight loss temperature for 0, 5 and 10%, for NCs at 800°C were in the range of 340–360°C, 434–460°C and 471–485°C, respectively. TGA data showed that PAIs are thermally stable up to 330°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954008312469235">Figure 9</xref>). The data revealed high thermal stability of the obtained NCs, which mainly resulted from contribution of inorganic NPs to the polymeric matrix backbone. In addition, it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954008312469235">Figure 9</xref> that the decomposition temperatures for 5% and 10% weight loss in PAIs/ZnO NCs are shifted to a higher temperature range, compared with that of pure PAIs, which indicates the enhancement of thermal stability of the composites. These thermal behaviors of the composites provided strong hydrogen bonding of PAI functional groups with the surface of modified ZnO particles. Also LOI values calculated based on van Krevelen and Hoftyzer equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954008312469235">32</xref></sup><fig id="fig9-0954008312469235" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>TGA thermograms of PAIs and PAIs/ZnO NCs with 4, 8 and 12 wt% ZnO contents.

Increasing in the thermal stability may be related to the presence of ZnO network and the physical interactions of the ZnO NPs with PAI functional groups, which restricted the movement of the molecular chain of polymer. The char yield of pure PAIs at 800°C was 48%, while those of the NCs (4, 8 and 12 wt%) at 800°C were in the range of 51–56%.

This is related to the superior energy of sonication process that made higher temperature in the reaction media, which caused to increase the condensation reaction of surface-modified NPs and pendant hydroxyl units in the structure of PAIs. Due to the different functional groups in the structure of PAIs and functionalization of ZnO NPs with KH550. It can be estimated that the NPs homogenously dispersed in NCs. Also editing the surface of ZnO by incorporating the KH550 caused to introduce organic useful groups on the surface of NPs, which improved their compatibility and better dispersion of ZnO NPs in polymer matrix. The data obtained from FT-IR spectroscopy showed the existence of characteristic absorption bands related to ZnO NPs in the NCs structures. XRD diffraction patterns supported the information obtained from spectroscopic analysis. The morphological studies using AFM, FE-SEM and TEM images of NCs revealed that ZnO NPs were homogeneously dispersed in the macromolecule matrix.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We also extend our thanks to IUT central laboratory staff for their valuable instrumental supports.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1-0954008312469235"><label>Funding</label><p>This work was partially supported by the Research Affairs Division Isfahan University of Technology (IUT), Isfahan.
