<abstract>
<p>The effect of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agents on properties of a new composite made of recycled carbon fibers and recycled polypropylene (rCF/[rPP + MAPP]) was studied experimentally. This new material presented significantly improved properties, compared to the previous generation, without the addition of MAPP (Giannadakis K, Szpieg M and Varna J. Mechanical performance of recycled carbon fibre/PP. <italic>Exp Mech</italic> 2010; published online.). This was mostly attributed to improvement of the fiber/matrix interface. The inelastic and time-dependent behavior of the MAPP modified composite material in tension was analyzed. A series of quasi-static tensile and creep tests were performed to identify the material model, which accounts for: (a) damage-related stiffness reduction, (b)development of stress and time-dependent irreversible strains described as viscoplasticity, (c) nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. The damage-related stiffness reduction was found to be less than 10%. Although damage-dependent stiffness was not the main source of nonlinearity, it was included in the inelastic material model. In creep tests, it was found that the time and stress dependence of viscoplastic strains follows a power law, which makes the determination of the parameters in the viscoplasticity model relatively simple. The viscoelastic response of the composite was found to be linear in the investigated stress domain. The material model was validated in constant stress rate tensile tests.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311423858" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recycling is becoming more and more important incomposites production. New legislation polices, increasing environmental awareness, and threat of shortage of raw materials, in combination with the ever increasing use of carbon fiber composites, force society to recycle these materials. Carbon fibers, even when trapped in composites, are valuable products worth to be recovered. The energy needed to produce pristine carbon fibers is very high, 286 MJ/kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311423858">1</xref></sup> The high stiffness and strength and low density of recovered carbon fibers allow them to be reused in new engineering materials for use in lightweight components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311423858">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311423858">4</xref></sup> With carbon fiber composites, recycling technologies involving burning or chemical decomposition of the polymer matrix have been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311423858">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311423858">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311423858">7</xref></sup> in order toprocess carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite waste.</p>
<p>There are several methods to produce composites using recovered carbon fibers. Injection moulding (IM) and bulk moulding compound (BMC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311423858">8</xref></sup> are two direct methods of remoulding recovered carbon fibers into recycled composite materials. In the IM process, material is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and forced into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the mould cavity. The BMC is a combination of chopped short fibers and resin in the form of a bulk pre-preg. The BMC is suitable for either compression or IM. Wong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311423858">9</xref></sup> manufactured a polypropylene composite reinforced with recycled carbon fibers (rCFs) using IM. By this process fibers aligned in one direction, which resulted in high stiffness of the composite material. Turner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311423858">10</xref></sup> developed a moulding compound process, involving both sheet moulding compound (SMC) and BMC. The formulation of the BMC was tuned to overcome the poor flow properties of the resin and the entangled form of the fibers.</p>
<p>Another method to manufacture composite materials with longer fibers, using recovered carbon fibers is to produce the intermediate dry two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) nonwoven preforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311423858">2</xref></sup> The 2D or 3D nonwoven dry products are then either compression moulded with resin layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311423858">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311423858">12</xref></sup> or reimpregnated through a liquid resin process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311423858">13</xref></sup> In Pickering et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311423858">11</xref></sup> a rCF SMC was manufactured using an intermediate mat material. Mats made of carbon fibers recovered using a fluidized bed process were manufactured employing a paper-making process and interleaved with epoxy resin film. In Wong et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311423858">12</xref></sup> fibers recovered via a pyrolysis process and converted into a randomly oriented mat were employed to manufacture a composite material through a resin film infusion process in a matched die tool. This composite was characterized in terms of its microstructure and mechanical performance in Pimenta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311423858">3</xref></sup> Janney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311423858">13</xref></sup> introduced the three dimensional engineered preform (3-DEP) process for making highly uniform, complex geometry, net shape, chopped fiber preforms for polymer matrix composites. This process was developed for virgin fibers by Materials Innovation Technologies LLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311423858">14</xref></sup> and employed by Janney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311423858">13</xref></sup> tomake preforms for high-quality composite parts using rCF.</p>
<p>Fiber alignment is a crucial part to improve the mechanical performance of composite materials manufactured using rCF. A study by Jiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311423858">15</xref></sup> demonstrated a method to convert fluffy rCFs into a controlled form. A hydrodynamic centrifugal method was employed to produce mats with high degree of fiber alignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311423858">15</xref></sup> In the 3-DEP process developed by Janney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311423858">16</xref></sup> rCFs are aligned circumferentially in a cone by centrifugal forces.</p>
<p>In the present work, a fully rCF/recycled polypropylene (rPP) composite material was manufactured using press forming. In this process, the fiber mats and polymer films are stacked, preheated, and press formed in a warm tool, see for example, Åström.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311423858">8</xref></sup> It is well known that the fiber/matrix interface properties are often the weakest point controlling performance of a composite material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311423858">17</xref></sup> In order to ensure good interfacial adhesion and load transfer across the interface in the rCF/rPP composite a maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent has been added to the rPP matrix. The MAPP improves the interface bonding between the fiber and polymer matrix by two mechanisms. First, the long molecular chain is responsible for chain entanglements and co-crystallization with the nonpolar PP matrix. These entanglements provide mechanical integrity to the host material. Second, the anhydride groups chemically interact with the functional groups on the fiber surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311423858">9</xref></sup> The presence of MAPP has been found to improve the interface and increase the stiffness and strength of injection moulded rCF/rPP composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311423858">9</xref></sup> In this work, the approach taken in Wong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311423858">9</xref></sup> is extended to press formed rCF/rPP composites.</p>
<p>When a polymer composite material is mechanically loaded, its deformation may increase with time even if the load is constant due to their inherent viscoelastic nature. There are several methods available in the literature to characterize materials viscoelastic behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311423858">18</xref></sup> The most common approach is to perform a creep test using dead load application. The stress applied to the specimen is constant and strain is recorded as a function of time. The viscoelastic response may be either linear or nonlinear depending on stress level. For low stresses, the response is usually linear, while for higher stresses it is often found to be nonlinear. The development of viscoelastic strains has been expressed in a general nonlinear constitutive equation for uniaxial loading by Lou and Schapery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311423858">19</xref></sup> which is employed later in this article.</p>
<p>In addition to viscoelastic strains developing in a material due to mechanical loading also viscoplastic strains (VP-strains) may occur. At unloading, after creep loading at high stress levels, often the strain does not fully recover. The development of VP-strain is a function of both stress and time. If the specimen is loaded in creep many times (or for very long time) then the rate of VP-strain development will eventually slow down and become negligible for that particular level of stress and lower stresses. The specimen would then be ‘conditioned’ and thus only pure viscoelastic creep strain would develop upon loading. The development of VP-strains has been expressed via a nonlinear function presented by Zapas and Crissman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311423858">20</xref></sup> employed later in this article.</p>
<p>Research on time-dependent properties is needed by the increased use of polymeric composites for structural components, which require long-term durability. Most of the papers in the literature report properties of recycled carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (rCFRP) concerning only the main mechanical properties of the composite materials such as stiffness and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311423858">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311423858">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311423858">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311423858">21</xref></sup> However, loading curves of composites with short, randomly oriented fibers, which are considered in this article, are usually nonlinear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311423858">22</xref></sup> In the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311423858">22</xref></sup> one reason for the nonlinearity was a very weak fiber/matrix interface, which led to poor mechanical performance of the composite material. As a result, these thermoplastic matrix/short fiber composites experience a complex, time-dependent stress–strain response with loading rate effects, hysteresis loops, and development of permanent strain. The most common reasons for this response are microdamage development, resulting in stiffness degradation, viscoplasticity, which may be related to submicrodamage, and nonlinear viscoelasticity of both constituents in the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311423858">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311423858">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this article is to perform a thorough investigation of the inelastic behavior of a recycled carbon fiber-reinforced MAPP modified recycled polypropylene (rCF/[rPP + MAPP]) composite material. This new rCF/(rPP + MAPP) composite is introduced here as an improved version of the rCF/rPP material developed in Giannadakis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311423858">22</xref></sup> The sources of the inelastic behavior will be analyzed by studying the output from the strain response for different load cases. The significance of the following phenomena will be ranked and included in an inelastic material model; (a) reduced elastic modulus due to microdamage development at high stresses, (b) viscoplastic (irreversible) strains development with time at high loads, and (c)viscoelastic composite material behavior, which may be nonlinear with respect to stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311423858"><title>The inelastic material model</title>
<p>In the development of the inelastic material model, it is assumed that the damage development, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic responses may be decoupled. It should be pointed out that this assumption may be inaccurate, especially at high stresses. Separation of the microdamage influenced by the viscoelastic and VP-strain responses (which are also affected by damage) gives:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998311423858"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where, <italic>d</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) is the function describing the effect of microdamage, ε<sub><italic>VE</italic></sub> and ε<sub><italic>VP</italic></sub> are the viscoelastic and VP-strains, respectively, σ is the applied stress and <italic>t</italic> is the time. To describe the viscoelasticity, the general thermodynamically consistent theory of nonlinear viscoelastic materials developed by Lou and Schapery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311423858">19</xref></sup> and presented in more general form by Schapery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311423858">26</xref></sup> is used in this article. In uniaxial loading considered in this article, the viscoelastic model contains three stress invariant dependent functions, namely <italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>a</italic><sub>σ,</sub> which characterize the nonlinearity. If a region with linear viscoelastic behavior exists, <italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>a</italic><sub>σ</sub> = 1. In addition, the function <italic>d</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) with values dependent on the maximum (most damaging) stress state experienced in service is incorporated to account for microdamage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311423858">25</xref></sup> In monotonously increasing uniaxial loading, the ‘most damaging’ is the current stress state. As demonstrated below (see Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0021998311423858">8</xref>)), the damage function represents the normalized elastic compliance of the composite, which is degrading due to experienced high stress/strain. Certainly, the form of interaction between <italic>d</italic> and VP-strain ε<sub><italic>VP</italic></sub> used in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311423858">1</xref>) can be debated. In Marklund et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311423858">25</xref></sup> it was concluded from a limited number of empirical observations that the interaction as proposed in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311423858">1</xref>) fits the test results better than does a standalone term of ε<sub><italic>VP</italic></sub>. Actually, it states that larger irreversible strains develop in a damaged composite than in an undamaged composite. It hasto be noted that microdamage itself without any viscoplasticity can introduce irreversible strains. The final form of the material model written for the one-dimensional case is:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0021998311423858"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311423858">2</xref>) integration is over ‘reduced time’ introduced as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0021998311423858"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311423858">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0021998311423858">3</xref>) ε<sub>0</sub> represents the elastic strain, which may be nonlinear with respect to stress. The ΔS(ψ) is the transient component of the linear viscoelastic creep compliance, <italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub> are stress-dependent material properties, <italic>a</italic><sub>σ</sub> is the shift factor, which under fixed conditions is a function of stress only, and τ is representing a normalized integration time variable. These functions also depend on temperature and humidity, however, under fixed environmental conditions they are functions of stress only. It was shown by Schapery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311423858">26</xref></sup> that the viscoelastic creep compliance can be written in the form of Prony series:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0021998311423858"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> are stress-independent constants and τ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are constants, so-called, retardation times. Below descriptions of the decoupled damage development, viscoplastic and viscoelastic responses are presented. Strategies to obtain these are outlined as well.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311423858"><title>Damage development and stiffness degradation</title>
<p>The physical meaning of the damage-related function <italic>d</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) can be revealed by comparing the elastic strains (ε<sub><italic>el</italic></sub>) in damaged and undamaged composite at given low stress σ (i.e., linear regime).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0021998311423858"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0021998311423858">5</xref>), <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> is the elastic modulus of the undamaged composite and <italic>E</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) is the elastic modulus after applying a load corresponding to a maximum stress σ<sub>max</sub>. Excluding stress from Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0021998311423858">5</xref>), the elastic strain is obtained as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0021998311423858"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>From Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311423858">1</xref>), the elastic response of the damaged material may be written as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-0021998311423858"><label>(7)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Comparing with Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0021998311423858">6</xref>), <italic>d</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) is identified as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0021998311423858"><label>(8)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Obviously <italic>d</italic>(σ<sub>max</sub>) has the physical meaning of normalized elastic compliance, which is inverse to the normalized elastic modulus dependence on the highest experienced stress level.</p>
<p>In this study, the elastic modulus dependence on the previously applied maximum strain/stress level is measured to evaluate the significance of the modulus degradation and the amount of microdamage accumulation.</p>

<p>As a consequence, instead of testing at a stress σ<sub>0</sub> for the time <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> continuously, one could perform the testing in two steps: (1) creep at stress σ<sub>0</sub> for time <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> unloading the specimen and measuring the permanent strain <inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998311423858"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998311423858"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ɛ</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>VP</mml:mi> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> developed during this step.

<p>From the above discussion, it follows that the time dependence of VP-strain at a fixed stress level can be determined by performing a sequence of creep and strain recovery tests on the same specimen.</p>
<p>The VP-strain time dependence in creep loading at the same stress level σ<sub>0</sub> is given by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-0021998311423858">11</xref>). Hence, the test data should be fitted with a power function with respect to time. According to Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0021998311423858">9</xref>), the constant <italic>m</italic> determined as the best fit by a power function has to be independent on the stress level used in the creep test (it has to be proven experimentally). <italic>A</italic>(σ<sub>0</sub>) is also obtained in the fitting procedure. Following Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0021998311423858">10</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0021998311423858">12</xref>), the stress dependence of VP-strains in creep tests (and consequently <italic>A</italic>(σ<sub>0</sub>)) also has to obey a power law. Performing the above described sequences of creep tests at several stress levels, it is possible to plot <italic>A</italic>(σ<sub>0</sub>) vs. stress and fit it using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0021998311423858">12</xref>). In result, constants <italic>M</italic> and <italic>C<sub>VP</sub></italic> are determined. After that the VP-strain model, Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0021998311423858">9</xref>) can be applied to any arbitrary stress controlled loading ramp.</p>
<p>The assumption that the creep test interruption does not affect the VP-strain development has to be checked experimentally for the analyzed material. In other words, the assumption and validation that VP-strains are accumulative is an important step in validation of the VP-strain model (Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0021998311423858">9</xref>)).</p>

This strain level was used expecting that damage and irreversible phenomena would not develop at these relatively low strains. Due to the possibility of poorly manufactured samples (e.g., at positions close to an edge), an elastic modulus measurement was performed on all of the considered samples prior to any further testing.

In each of the multiple high load steps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311423858">Figure 4</xref>), irreversible strains were developed.

Consequently, the modulus determination in the strain region between 0.05 and 0.15% as described in section Elastic modulus was not possible. Instead of using the strain region between 0.05 and 0.15%, the corresponding stress region was found in the first loading curve and this stress region was then used to calculate the elastic modulus in the following loading steps.</p>

<p>The achieved inelastic material model was used to simulate the response of the rCF/(rPP + MAPP) composite in a constant stress rate test. A validation test was conducted, using an INSTRON 3366 testing machine equipped with a 10 kN load cell. A stress rate of 1.0 MPa/min was applied until specimen failure. The duration of thetest was approximately 40 min. Simulation was performed using a numerical integration to obtain VP-strain according to Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0021998311423858">9</xref>). Since in this case analytical integration is also possible, numerical results were compared with the analytical ones, and the time step in numerical integration was selected to obtain coinciding results.

From the fitting equation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311423858">Figure 11</xref>, the parameters in the VP-law (Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula13-0021998311423858">13</xref>)) can be determined as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula20-0021998311423858"><label>(20)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311423858-eq20.tif"/></disp-formula>

It has to be noted that these values are sensitive with respect to the VP-strain data at low stress levels (see σ = 20 MPa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311423858">Figure 11</xref>), as the accuracy of strain measurements is approximately 0.005%. Consequently, if one was to use VP-strain data from loading at low stress levels, that is, approximately 20 MPa in this particular case, a different and less accurate power law would result.</p>
<p>Use of the determined parameters (see Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula20-0021998311423858">20</xref>)) to predict VP-strain development in creep test is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311423858">Figure 12</xref>. These parameters are used in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0021998311423858">10</xref>) to predict VP-strains at 37 and 40 MPa. One can see that in this stress region VP-strains are significantly affected by a small increase in stress level.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311423858">Figure 6</xref>, complementary to the VP-strain development in the loading (axial) direction, negative VP-strains increase in the transverse direction. For practical reasons, the transverse strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311423858">Figure 13</xref> are presented as positive, where each point represents a certain instant of time during a creep test at a fixed stress. Two specimens are presented: Specimen 4 is subjected to creep at 37 MPa and Specimen 5 to creep at 40 MPa. For each of the specimens, both VP-strain components are proportional at all times, which allows us to introduce a ‘viscoplastic Poisson’s ratio’. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311423858">Figure 13</xref>, the ratio is practically constant at the two stress levels. Due to limited data, it is not possible to investigate if the small difference is due to variations between the specimens or due to the effect of stress level. Linear fit to all the data and the corresponding equation is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311423858">Figure 13</xref>.

</p>
<p>The value of the viscoplastic Poisson’s ratio is equal to 0.275. If the observed proportionality holds not only for a creep test but also for more general loading ramps, the introduction of constant VP-Poisson’s ratio could be very useful for implementation in numerical codes.</p>

The agreement is good even close to the rupture stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311423858">Figure 16</xref> shows the significance of different components in the material model. At 40 MPa, approximately 89% of the strain is linear viscoelastic, of which 71% is elastic strain including stiffness reduction effect. The remaining 11% of the strain is due to viscoplasticity. At the end of the test, about 58% of the strain is linear viscoelastic, of which 44% is elastic strain including stiffness-reduction effect and the rest (42%) is viscoplasticity. For the predictions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311423858">Figure 15</xref>, the average properties were used. Due to the large scatter in data, these predictions are not very accurate, as the validation was performed using two specimens only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311423858">Figure 15</xref>). A different simulation was performed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311423858">Figure 17</xref>), using individual elastic modulus of each specimen and average viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior. The simulation is in very good agreement with test results indicating that the large variability of results is more related to elastic modulus than to viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity. It is clear that at stress levels close to rupture, the inelastic model does not provide an accurate prediction.

<p>This article presents a combined experimental and theoretical study of a new, fully recycled short fiber, carbon fiber thermoplastic composite material. The effect of MAPP coupling agents on properties of a composite made of rCFs and rPP (rCF/[rPP + MAPP]) was studied experimentally. It was shown that adding 10 wt% of MAPP to the rPP matrix leads to an almost 100% increase of the composite strength. This was attributed to improvement of the fiber/matrix interface. The elastic modulus remains unchanged. The inelastic stress–strain behavior of the composite was demonstrated to be related to elastic modulus reduction at high stresses, viscoelasticity, and viscoplasticity. It was demonstrated that the viscoplastic response can be described by Zapas’ model, which in creep predicts a power law dependence of the VP-strains with respect to time and stress level. Parameters in the model were determined by creep and strain recovery tests. In addition, the material was found to exhibit viscoplastic Poisson’s ratio of 0.275. This finding allows introduction a constant VP-Poisson’s ratio, which may be very useful in implementation in numerical codes.</p>
<p>The viscoelasticity of the rCF/(rPP + MAPP) composite is linear in the whole considered stress region. The parameters in the viscoelastic model were also identified.</p>
<p>As a result of these analyses, a complete inelastic material law was developed for the rCF/(rPP + MAPP) composite. The developed material model was validated by simulation of the strain response in constant stress rate tests. Simulation results employing the inelastic material model are in general in a good agreement with the experimental data.</p>
