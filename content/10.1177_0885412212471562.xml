<abstract>
<p>Spatial planning across much of the world is experiencing reform in response to common challenges of globalization, sustainable development, economic competitiveness, economic reforms, and demographic change. In Europe, greater transnational networking and cooperation on spatial planning, often facilitated by European initiatives, have resulted in planning policy makers at different levels being increasingly influenced and exposed to policies and practices from elsewhere. These processes might be assumed to be leading to some sort of convergence of spatial planning policy. However, this is not necessarily the case: there are deeply embedded differences between nations in terms of political, professional, and administrative cultures and structures. There are also significant differences in social models and welfare systems across Europe, as well as different histories. These differences, which are explored conceptually and empirically in this article, potentially put a brake on the idea of the convergence or harmonization of national and sub-national arrangements for spatial planning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are many pressures for change to which spatial planning systems across the world are responding. New trends and policy priorities, such as sustainable development, economic competitiveness, and demographic change, have each contributed to recent changes in planning policy and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471562">Healey and Williams 1993</xref>). At the same time, wider trends in government and governance in many countries (summarized below) have also led to the reformulation of national and subnational systems of spatial planning. This is very much the case in Europe, where reforms of spatial planning have been widespread in the last few decades.</p>
<p>Because many of these trends are common to most, if not all, countries in Europe (and beyond), and since many of the priorities for policy are similar across the European continent, it might be easy to assume that they might be leading to convergence in spatial planning policies and/or practices. Indeed, some authors have been speculating about the likelihood (or existence) of policy convergence in the spatial planning arena for some time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885412212471562">Davies (1994)</xref>, for example, postulated “a gradual convergence of planning policies and practices” as a consequence of mutual learning and cooperation at the regional and local levels of governments and suggested that “[e]vidence for this is already beginning to be apparent” (p. 69).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0885412212471562">1</xref></sup> Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0885412212471562">Koresawa and Konvitz (2001)</xref> have claimed that approaches in national and regional planning systems are converging in Europe, which they explain in terms of “the growing influence of EU and other intergovernmental initiatives” (p. 30).</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of potential facilitators of convergence, however, hard evidence for policy convergence in the area of spatial planning is difficult to find (notwithstanding Davies’ claim in 1993 that evidence for gradual convergence of planning policies and practices was already beginning to be apparent), and various authors remain skeptical about the extent to which European planning systems or planning outcomes are actually converging. De Jong and Edelenbos (2007), for example, question whether the increase in intensity of cross-national comparisons and transnational exchanges necessarily lead to policy convergence of planning systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471562">Fürst (2009)</xref> is unconvinced that policy convergence is taking place in spatial planning, stating that conjecture about convergence seems “to be based on thin grounds” (p. 31). Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0885412212471562">Nedović-Budić, Tsenkova, and Marcuse (2006)</xref>, discussing the development patterns in Central and Eastern Europe, take the view that convergence, “though fostered by mass communication and culture and the extensive flows of goods, capital and people, as well as by grand regional (pan-European) policies…, remains more of an intellectual notion than a concrete reality” (p. 14). Their argument is that the built environment changes very incrementally, and is still heavily influenced by local culture and politics. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412212471562">Beauregard (2001)</xref> argues that “convergence might not be as strong a force, at least as regards the intellectual production and the urban development that it represents, as the forces of globalisation and the European regionalization imply” (p. 258). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref> presents a case both for and against the convergence of different planning systems in Europe, arguing that while there has been some convergence toward certain forms of planning within Europe, (e.g., collaborative and communicative forms of planning) other aspects of the planning process (e.g., implementation, monitoring, and review) show few signs of convergence.</p>
<p>Various explanations have been suggested for the lack or limited degree of policy convergence in spatial planning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471562">Fürst (2009)</xref>, for example, contends that spatial planning processes are relatively slow to change and are restrained by high transaction costs. He argues that policy systems generally only change if the pressure to change is very strong or if ignoring the need to change will be met by severe sanctions. Most planning systems are not usually in this situation: the pressures to change are not usually strong enough and resisting change does not usually incur sanctions or other costs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471562">Healey and Williams (1993)</xref> allude to factors like local institutional structures, path dependency, culture, and local socioeconomic conditions that potentially constrain policy convergence when they contend that “[t]he diversity of planning systems and practices in Europe is the result of the specific histories and geographies of particular places, and the way these interlock with national institutional structures, cultures and economic opportunities” (p. 716). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref> contends that differences in socioeconomic conditions, cultures, and histories between countries form considerable barriers to the convergence of approaches to planning. In a study of the trajectories of urban governance in Austria and Germany, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412212471562">Hamedinger, Bartik, and Wolffhardt (2008)</xref> argue that “there is no evidence of EU-wide convergence of governance structures at the local and regional levels” (p. 2671), which they suggest is due to “mediating” or “filtering” factors such as domestic institutions, political cultures, the distribution of competences, and legal procedures.</p>
<p>In general, the theoretical debates about policy convergence in relation to spatial planning (and supporting empirical evidence) are still in their infancy and have not yet reached any firm conclusions. The question about whether European planning systems are converging is subject to differing views. There are various factors and trends that would appear to be promoting policy convergence in planning (facilitating factors), but at the same time there are also other factors that are mediating against convergence (inhibiting factors). The brief overview of some of the recent debates and opinions concerning policy convergence and spatial planning presented above serves to highlight two important points relating to further discussion on policy convergence. First, policy convergence has been defined and examined in a range of different ways, which helps explain some of the differing conclusions about whether convergence is (or is not) occurring. When discussing and analyzing policy convergence, it is important to be clear about what is being measured and how. Policy convergence can, for example, refer to policy goals, policy content, policy instruments, policy outcomes or policy styles (see below), and the trajectories of these different dimensions do not necessarily follow each other. So, it could be, for example, that policy instruments are converging but policy outcomes are not. Second, the concept of policy convergence clearly has a time and relational dimension—it concerns the trajectory of change over time and how this trajectory compares (or relates) to one or more reference cases. It is therefore important to recognize that the reference case (or cases) and period of analysis will heavily influence any conclusions about the extent to which convergence may or may not have occurred.</p>
<p>This article aims to chart the processes and forces of convergence being exerted on spatial planning, alongside some of the key factors that are potentially resisting convergence. The assumption is that there are forces both toward and away from convergence that are acting simultaneously. This view is influenced by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471562">Healey and Williams (1993)</xref>, who argue that the diversity of spatial planning systems and practices in Europe is the result of a range of related issues such as “specific histories and geographies of particular places, and the way these interlock with national institutional structures, cultures and economic opportunities” (p. 716). The article focuses on some of the main recent trends in spatial planning policies, practices, and development patterns, and considers the extent to which these trends are experiencing convergence, divergence, or are simply remaining constant. Three closely related concepts supporting the convergence of spatial planning are considered: globalization; Europeanization; and policy transfer and learning/lesson-drawing. Alongside these, three interlinked concepts that are potentially resisting policy convergence are discussed: planning and organizational cultures; families of nations and social models; and path dependence and path shaping. This article attempts to synthesize the key academic literature in these different theoretical areas and relate it to empirical evidence on policy convergence and divergence in the field of spatial planning.</p>

<title>Trends in Government and Governance</title>
<p>Before considering the ways in which spatial planning systems in Europe are evolving, and examining whether policy convergence is taking place, this section briefly outlines some of the key trends in government and governance that form the context of recent changes in spatial planning and the reformulation of national (and subnational) systems of planning in many parts of Europe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412212471562">Stead and Cotella (2011)</xref>, who build on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412212471562">Lidström (2007)</xref> and Fürst (2009), identify the following set of general trends which are generally considered to be influencing the dynamic nature of spatial planning across Europe (and often beyond).
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Redefining of the role of the nation-state. The establishment and gradual expansion of what now is the European Union (EU) has limited the role of national borders and transferred decision-making powers to supranational bodies. In addition, states are challenged from inside, by groups with strong ethnic or regional identities demanding separatism or at least self-government.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Strengthening lower levels of self-government. In many countries, functions have been decentralized from central government to local and regional levels of government. In some countries, this has gone hand-in-hand with reorganizations of subnational levels of government, either by amalgamation of municipalities or regions or by introducing new regional levels of self-government.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Accepting increasing diversity, variation, and even asymmetry between how territories within the nation-state are governed. This tendency toward diversity can be seen as the empowerment of the lower levels of self-government but may also lead to greater differentiation. Not only is the scope for variation between subnational units greater, some units are also permitted to follow their own paths that may differ quite considerably from the general national pattern.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Increasing marketization of the public domain. Many functions that were seen as fairly stable public responsibilities during the peak of the welfare state era have either been privatized or are run jointly by public and private providers. Public organizations are increasingly limited to “enabling” other actors to offer services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The changing rationale for planning. Planning systems are being redefined in the light of new challenges (e.g., sustainable development, climate change, social exclusion, territorial cohesion), new powers and responsibilities (see above) and new attempts to increase the societal relevance of planning. Across Europe, spatial planning is being recast as a way of managing the increasing interdependencies of actors involved in territorial development, which provides spatial planning with a new rationale for and presents a new opportunity to demonstrate the contemporary relevance of planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885412212471562">Stead and Meijers 2009</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The internationalization of planning education and practice. International exchange within the academic and practitioner communities of planning can also lead to shifts in spatial planning. Exchanges within the academic community may change mind-sets and value systems and even lead to modifications in methodological approaches, with subsequent impacts on planning practice via education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0885412212471562">Thornley and Rydin 2002</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The influence of the EU. Management and planning approaches in member states are being increasingly shaped by European policies and initiatives (e.g., structural fund rules, environmental management, and nature protection directives). This in turn impacts planning procedures and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412212471562">Dühr, Stead, and Zonneveld 2007</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>Many of the trends outlined above are closely interlinked and several are equally important contextual factors in shaping the evolution of spatial planning systems outside Europe as well as within Europe. More importantly for this article, all of the trends have significant potential implications for the convergence or divergence of spatial planning policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0885412212471562">
<title>Policy Convergence</title>
<p>An important starting point in defining the concept of policy convergence is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412212471562">Bennett (1991)</xref>, who proposed that it can refer to one or more of five dimensions of policy: (i) policy goals; (ii) policy content (including statutes, administrative rules, regulations, court decisions); (iii) policy instruments; (iv) policy outcomes; or (v) policy styles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0885412212471562">Lenschow, Liefferink, and Veenman (2005)</xref> suggest an additional dimension to this list, the dimension of policy settings, which concern the calibration of policy instruments (e.g. taxes, fees, subsidies) as well as procedural settings such as the duration or comprehensiveness of policy review processes. Building on this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0885412212471562">Knill (2005)</xref> defines policy convergence as “any increase in the similarity between one or more characteristics of a certain policy (e.g. policy objectives, policy instruments, policy settings), across a given set of political jurisdictions (supranational institutions, states, regions, local authorities) over a given period of time” (p. 768).</p>
<p>The concept of convergence has links and overlaps with a range of other concepts and theories such as globalization, Europeanization, policy transfer, lesson-drawing, policy diffusion, and isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412212471562">Heichel, Pape, and Sommerer 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0885412212471562">Lenschow, Liefferink, and Veenman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0885412212471562">Knill 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0885412212471562">Turner and Green 2007</xref>). Policy convergence and its related concepts are each concerned with understanding and explaining policy processes but there are, however, also some differences between them. Processes of globalization or Europeanization can, for example, occur without necessarily resulting in convergence, or can even occur while policies are diverging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412212471562">Risse, Green Cowles, and Caporaso 2000</xref>). Consequently, Bennett (1991) contends that the concept of convergence is “a complicated package of different trends and processes reflecting a variety of theoretical and epistemological claims” (p. 230), presumably referring to the links and overlaps with various other concepts, as well as the complexity and parallel nature of forces acting both toward and against convergence.</p>
<p>In recent years, the notion of policy convergence has firmly established itself in the epistemological repertoire of comparative politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0885412212471562">Turner and Green 2007</xref>). According to authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412212471562">Goggin et al. (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885412212471562">Howlett (2000)</xref>, the question of convergence is central to comparative policy studies and of great importance to implementation studies. A growing number of academic publications on policy convergence can be found (although few of these are related to planning), covering a spectrum of policy issues ranging from environmental policy to banking regulation to social policy and telecommunication policy (for a review, see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412212471562">Heichel, Pape, and Sommerer 2005</xref>). After reviewing the findings of a relatively large number of empirical studies into policy convergence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412212471562">Heichel, Pape, and Sommerer (2005)</xref> conclude that evidence both for and against convergence can be found in the literature (as the overview of planning literature related presented in the introduction to this article also suggests), and they report that the evidence for convergence differs according to the regions studied and the observation periods considered. On a methodological note, they conclude that any review of evidence for or against policy convergence or divergence is extremely difficult when clear criteria for comparison often do not exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0885412212471562">
<title>Forces of Convergence</title>
<p>Many of the trends that are thought to be contributing to policy convergence in spatial planning, such as state rescaling, the internationalization of planning education and practice, and the increasing competition between cities and regions (outlined above), relate in some way to processes of globalization, Europeanization, policy transfer, and lesson-drawing. These processes are clearly very much related to each other but are certainly not identical. For example, horizontal (state-to-state or region-to-region) policy transfer processes in the EU that are supported or promoted by EU activities (e.g., trans-national research or cooperation projects) fall under the concept of globalization and Europeanization as well as policy transfer. But horizontal policy transfer can also take place independently of EU initiatives or policies and, in this case, does not fall under the concept of Europeanization. There is a growing amount of literature concerning the impacts of globalization, Europeanization, policy transfer, and lesson-drawing for spatial planning (especially on the Europeanization of spatial planning), and this section attempts to summarize this diverse material, with the primary aim of identifying what this material implies for the issue of spatial planning policy and convergence, particularly in Europe.</p>
<sec id="section5-0885412212471562">
<title>Globalization</title>
<p>Globalization, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885412212471562">Sanyal (2002)</xref> recognizes, is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back many centuries to the origins of international trade. What is new, however, is the growing intensity and complexity of such interaction, particularly the growing dominance of financial flows in and out of territories. The widening, deepening, and speeding up of the worldwide connectedness of markets, society, and information—all of which are associated with globalization—are affecting the way in which planning operates in multiple ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0885412212471562">Thornley and Rydin 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471562">Friedmann (2005)</xref>, globalization is for example bringing about “major changes in the institutional structure, processes, influence, and scope of planning” (p. 184).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885412212471562">Keating and Cairney (2012)</xref> contend that globalization in the form of increased global economic competition may lead to convergence but may equally result in divergence. On one hand, greater competition between territories might lead governments to seek their own solutions and develop innovative policies in order to attract inward investment, impress the local electorate, and attract dynamic, highly qualified residents. On the other hand, the same competition might lead to policy convergence in situations where governments face the same economic constraints and opportunities, and so resort to implementing similar policies and, in some cases, even copying policies directly from elsewhere, as discussed below.</p>
<p>In terms of spatial planning and urban policy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0885412212471562">Ward (1999)</xref> argues that greater economic competition and the globalization of capital is leading to more policy homogeneity, at least in the more affluent parts of the world, which are in completion with each other. His view is that cities borrow “successful” ideas and practices from elsewhere to attract highly mobile investment and consumption, although “exactly how and why… planning innovations have spread as part of globalisation remains rather elusive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0885412212471562">Ward 1999</xref>, 54).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0885412212471562">2</xref></sup> An important reason behind greater homogeneity of planning policy, he argues, is the influence of major international developers, who seek similar development opportunities throughout the world and demand broadly similar planning regimes. Ward’s contention is that the influence of these developers erodes the local distinctiveness of planning because, in attempting to attract such developers and major businesses, cities often feel obliged to go along with these demands. One way they do so is by imitating planning models that are perceived to be successful elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0885412212471562">Ward (1999)</xref> and others recognize (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0885412212471562">Lauria 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885412212471562">Newman and Thornley 2005</xref>), globalization only provides the context and, despite being very important, still leaves scope for different responses and outcomes in different situations. As a result, the globalization of planning ideas and practices can still lead to different outcomes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471562">Friedmann (2005)</xref> notes, “major differences [still] exist in the ways that planning is conceived, institutionalized, and carried out” (p. 184). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885412212471562">Newman and Thornley (2005)</xref> contend that, even when cities and regions are subject to globalization trends, localized decisions are made about the direction of urban change and the scope of public policy to address this change. They suggest that the impact of economic globalization on cities is significant but is mediated in important ways by the regional context and by local politics, thereby limiting any policy convergence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0885412212471562">
<title>Europeanization</title>
<p>The concept of Europeanization has been interpreted in various different ways and used to describe a variety of different phenomena and processes of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0885412212471562">Lenschow 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0885412212471562">Olsen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0885412212471562">Radaelli 2004</xref>). There is thus no single definition. On the contrary, several authors have begun to count an impressive number of rather diverse definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0885412212471562">Olsen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0885412212471562">Radaelli 2000</xref>). There is, however, agreement about a number of elements associated with the concept: it is concerned with the EU, it refers to a process (rather than a state of affairs), and its impacts can be measured in a variety of ways such as changes in rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, “ways of doing things,” shared beliefs, or norms. It is important to recognize that Europeanization is not just concerned with top-down processes of policy “downloading” but also with bottom-up processes of policy “uploading” and horizontal processes of policy “crossloading” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0885412212471562">Marshall 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, there has been an increasing perception that transnational influences on spatial development are growing and that such trends are accentuated by the processes of European integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0885412212471562">Sykes 2008</xref>). Planners across Europe are now routinely involved in trans-boundary cooperation networks and inter-regional collaboration initiatives and thus subject to foreign experiences and exposed to a variety of planning approaches from other member states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412212471562">Dühr, Stead, and Zonneveld 2007</xref>). Various examples of the Europeanization of planning can be identified. The EU’s INTERREG Program is a prime example, which has facilitated cooperation between regions and actors, and has acted as a stimulus for Europeanization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885412212471562">Lähteenmäki-Smith, Fuller, and Böhme 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412212471562">Waterhout 2007</xref>). Various authors suggest that the INTERREG program has contributed to the emergence of transnational spatial planning practices, the diffusion of certain spatial ideas across European countries, and changes in the domestic patterns of spatial planning and regional policies, in terms of both approaches and of institutional capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471562">Böhme et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885412212471562">Dabinett 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412212471562">Dabinett and Richardson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885412212471562">Giannakourou 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885412212471562">Janin Rivolin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412212471562">Janin Rivolin and Faludi 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0885412212471562">Pedrazzini 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0885412212471562">Tewdwr-Jones and Williams 2001</xref>). According to Lähteenmäki-Smith, Fuller, and Böhme (2005), the transnational dimension of spatial planning is becoming increasingly important because of the funding made available for European transnational programs such as INTERREG and the fact that the INTERREG program has (until recently at least) essentially been a ‘de facto field of implementation for the ESDP rationale and policy” (p. 14). Other examples which have been instrumental in promoting processes Europeanization in planning include the PHARE Program in central and eastern European countries across a broad spectrum of areas, including administrative reforms and infrastructure and environment policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0885412212471562">Pallagst 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0885412212471562">Stanilov 2007</xref>) and European research programs, which have also led to the development of various “best practice” guides/comparisons on land-use planning, transport planning, and spatial governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0885412212471562">Vettoretto 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885412212471562">Stead 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>While there is no EU competence in spatial planning, the EU has played a key role in the promotion of a “European spatial planning agenda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885412212471562">Colomb 2007</xref>), discursively shaped by certain normative concepts and “spatial planning ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471562">Böhme et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885412212471562">Jensen and Richardson 2004</xref>). Most of the studies on the Europeanization of spatial planning put forward arguments that the process is taking place in different places and in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412212471562">Böhme 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412212471562">Dabinett and Richardson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885412212471562">Giannakourou 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412212471562">Hamedinger, Bartik, and Wolffhardt 2008</xref>; Lähteenmäki-Smith, Fuller, and Böhme 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0885412212471562">Ravesteyn and Evers 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0885412212471562">Sykes 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0885412212471562">Tewdwr-Jones and Williams 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0885412212471562">Waterhout and Böhme 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412212471562">Waterhout 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0885412212471562">Zonneveld 2005</xref>), corresponding to the notion of divergent impacts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885412212471562">Héritier et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885412212471562">Jordan and Liefferink 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0885412212471562">Stone 2004</xref>), or clustered commonality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471562">Börzel and Risse 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412212471562">Goetz 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the new EU member states, the processes of Europeanization have arguably taken place at a faster rate, and the extent of change has been more profound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885412212471562">Batt and Wolczuk 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412212471562">Grabbe 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412212471562">O’Dwyer 2006</xref>).

<title>Policy Transfer and Lesson-Drawing</title>
<p>The subject of transferring policy ideas, institutions, models, and programs between government authorities (national, regional, and local) has received a significant amount of attention in politics and policy sciences over recent years under the term policy transfer as well as a number of similar related terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0885412212471562">3</xref></sup> Like the concept of Europeanization, various definitions of policy transfer (and related concepts) exist (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0885412212471562">Stone 2004</xref>). Most previous studies of policy transfer have focused on highly developed countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412212471562">Dolowitz and Marsh 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885412212471562">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0885412212471562">Majone 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0885412212471562">Robertson 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412212471562">Rose 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0885412212471562">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0885412212471562">Stone 1999</xref>). A number of factors, including European initiatives for research, territorial cooperation, and development assistance, have helped to promote policy transfer in these countries. Politicians have seen policy transfer as the quickest solution to many problems without having to reinvent the wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0885412212471562">Rose 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885412212471562">Tavits 2003</xref>) as means of avoiding newcomer costs using the experience of other countries.</p>
<p>The validity of policy transfer between different European countries, especially between central and eastern Europe and western Europe, is however open to question. Clearly, the social and economic situation in these member states can be very different. The same is true for institutional frameworks: there is a great variety across Europe. While a number of cases of policy transfer related to spatial planning in Europe can be found, few have been investigated in any detail. Academic literature on policy transfer related to planning in Europe is quite limited (examples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0885412212471562">van Bueren, van Bougrain, and Knorr-Siedow 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885412212471562">de Jong and Edelenbos 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885412212471562">Stead, de Jong, and Reinholde 2008</xref>) and even less has been written about the case of central and eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0885412212471562">Nedović-Budić 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885412212471562">Stead, de Jong, and Reinholde 2008</xref>) although, interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18a-0885412212471562">Cherry (1986)</xref> claims that eastern Europe has been the “recipient of planning ideas throughout the [20th] century” (p. 60). What is clear, however, is that policy transfer is complex and certainly not merely a matter of copying or emulation: policy transfer also involves processes of learning and adaptation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412212471562">Ivanicka et al. (1996)</xref>, for example, highlight that the simple adoption of Western European approaches to housing policy have not worked in central Europe. Former communist countries in Europe have unique features that restrict the direct applicability of imported tools and methods, require their “customization,” or demand entirely new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0885412212471562">Nedović-Budić 2001</xref>). Moreover, there are different policy styles or preferences and planning cultures (see discussion below) that may favor certain options and hinder the consideration or adoption of different policy approaches from elsewhere.</p>

<title>Planning Cultures</title>
<p>Culture not only affects the way in which planning systems are devised and constructed, it also affects the way in which planning operates and performs (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885412212471562">Booth 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471562">Friedmann 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412212471562">Othengrafen 2010</xref>). It affects both the formal and the informal rules, methods, and procedures. Informal rules, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412212471562">North (1990)</xref>, include conventions and codes of behavior arising from “socially transmitted information” influenced by “the heritage that we call culture” (p. 37). Because they are “culturally derived,” informal rules do not “change immediately in reaction to changes in the formal rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412212471562">North 1990</xref>, 45). As a result, there can be tensions between newly introduced formal rules and persisting informal rules with potentially important implications for the way change occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412212471562">North 1990</xref>). This is also linked to the ideas of path dependency and path shaping (see below).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885412212471562">Faludi (2005)</xref> discusses planning culture in terms of the “collective ethos and dominant attitudes of planners regarding the appropriate role of the state, market forces, and civil society in influencing social outcomes” (p. 285), and likens planning culture to political culture, comprising attitudes, beliefs, emotions, and values of society that relate to the political system and to political issues. He contends that planning culture is the product of various interrelated factors such as historical development, geography, ethnic differences, and the socioeconomic situation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885412212471562">Hohn and Neuer (2006)</xref> assert that planning culture (as well as governance in general) is “embedded in the interdependencies of social, economic and political values, norms, rules and laws” (p. 293). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885412212471562">Healey (1997)</xref> refers to planning as embedded in a specific cultural framework composed of interactive processes among involved actors, their cultural cognitive frames, and the particular planning procedures and instruments.</p>
<p>Differences in planning culture are reflected in a diversity of planning instruments, planning practices, and professional ethos. In terms of planning instruments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0885412212471562">van Dijk (2002)</xref>, for example, considers these to be very much anchored in the cultural (and legislative and administrative) context of society, referring to planning instruments as “tailor-made suits.” This view about planning instruments is very much consistent with Booth’s (1986) opinions about the discipline and practice of planning, which he considers to have “a curiously chameleon-like quality whose colours depend intimately on the particular social, political, and cultural context in which it is found” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885412212471562">Booth 1986</xref>, 1). In common with observations about the diversity of planning instruments, there is also a great deal of diversity in professional planning cultures across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885412212471562">Knieling and Othengrafen 2009</xref>). Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for example all have a mature planning profession with their roots primarily in the social sciences. The planning profession in Spain and Italy, for example, is on the other hand more closely linked to (and controlled by) the profession of architecture (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471562">Healey and Williams 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885412212471562">CEC 1997</xref>). Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471562">Healey and Williams (1993)</xref> claim that planning practice in some of the postcommunist countries is heavily influenced and rooted in economics. Despite several authors acknowledging the influence of culture on planning, there is however only a weak understanding of the operation of planning systems and the nature and influence of planning cultures across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885412212471562">Dühr and Nadin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412212471562">Othengrafen 2010</xref>). In the Baltic States as well as the former socialist states, the Communist legacy has had a huge impact on many aspects of life (including political, cultural, and behavioral) and is likely to continue to do so for many years to come (see path dependence and path shaping below). Because of these differences in planning cultures and approaches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref> argues against the existence of any homogenous planning family in Europe and refers instead to the idea of a range of diverse approaches (see also Nadin and Stead, forthcoming).</p>

<title>Families of Nations and Social Models</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0885412212471562">Nadin and Stead (2008)</xref> have explored the way in which European social models and welfare models are related to national planning systems. Their starting point was the assumption that the form and operation of planning systems are embedded in their historical context, the socioeconomic, political, and cultural patterns which have given rise to particular forms of government and law, and that the social model underlies the contextual differences. This is exemplified particularly well in some countries where strong state intervention in spatial development was established as part of the postwar “welfare state.” One of the conclusions of this work is that there appears to be reasonable correspondence between welfare state typologies and ideal types of planning systems. This is perhaps to be expected since the planning system is in part an expression of fundamental values in society in relation, for example, to the scope and aspirations of government, the use of land, and the rights of citizens. The correspondence of the model of society and type of planning system is particularly strong for the British/Anglo-Saxon and the Nordic countries, which demonstrate a very close association between the dominant model of society and the type of the planning system. In the case of England and the Netherlands, recent changes and trends in spatial planning in both countries appear to have close parallels despite their different social models and planning systems (ibid.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412212471562">Goetz (2006)</xref> has put forward the idea that the impacts of Europe—be they institutional, ideational, ideological, actor or policy related—are not randomly distributed amongst countries but instead exhibit a degree of clustering according to “families of nations.” In other words, processes of policy change are shaped by the geographical, linguistic, cultural, and/or historical attributes that define families of nations. The notion of families of nations has three components: (i) that it is possible to identify distinct families of nations, defined in terms of shared geographical, linguistic, cultural, and/or historical attributes; (ii) that processes of cross-national transmission and diffusion are critical to establishing and perpetuating these commonalities; and (iii) that families of nations matter for public policy to the extent that the commonalities of policy outcomes that can be seen in groupings of nations can be explained, in whole or in part, by common ideas, common customs, and common institutions transmitted from the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885412212471562">Castles 1993</xref>). This has close links with the notion of policy styles, or “standard operating procedures” for making and implementing policies in different territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0885412212471562">Richardson, Gustafsson, and Jordan 1982</xref>). Authors have for example suggested that policy goals and implementation preferences in specific regions are not random but rather tend to cluster into favored sets of ideas and instruments and which are used over a wide range of policy-making contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412212471562">Freeman 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885412212471562">Howlett 1991</xref>), thereby contributing to distinct clusters of policy approaches rather than an homogeneous approach to policy making (and thus convergence). In support of the relationship between Europeanization and families of nations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412212471562">Goetz (2006)</xref> argues that the impacts of Europe closely coincide (although not always perfectly) with the most commonly employed distinction between continental Western Europe, Anglo-Saxon Europe, Southern Europe, the Nordic region, and Central and Eastern Europe. While Goetz does not specifically focus on spatial planning, the differential (clustered) effects seem most probable for this area of policy, and the work reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471562">Cotella and Stead (2011)</xref> lends support to this view.</p>
<p>The differential impacts of Europe may also be related to the extent to which spatial planning and regional development policies are separate and distinct from each other. In states where there is a stronger separation and distinction between these policies (and where responsibilities and powers for them are held by different ministries or departments), spatial planning may be less affected by Europeanization processes than where spatial planning policy is considered part and parcel of the regional development agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0885412212471562">4</xref></sup> Similarly, it is also conceivable that the evolution of spatial planning in Europe may follow alternative or clustered trajectories depending on a territory’s dependence on European financial support for regional development.</p>

<title>Path Dependence and Path Shaping</title>
<p>The concept of path dependence was first used in studying technological change and explaining reasons behind inefficient technological lock-ins (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885412212471562">Arthur 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885412212471562">David 1994</xref>). More recently, the concept has been transposed to the institutional sphere in order to try to explain how policies and institutions change. Within a relatively short space of time, it has become a widely used concept in social science (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212471562">Alexander 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412212471562">Arrow 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885412212471562">Berman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412212471562">Bruggeman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885412212471562">Greener 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885412212471562">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885412212471562">Hansen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885412212471562">Hedlund 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885412212471562">Holzinger and Knill 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0885412212471562">Mahoney 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885412212471562">O’Brien 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0885412212471562">Pierson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0885412212471562">Scott 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0885412212471562">Sterman and Wittenberg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0885412212471562">Torfing 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0885412212471562">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0885412212471562">Wilsford 1994</xref>).

The first of these approaches considers that the factors explaining technological path dependence can be directly transposed to institutions. The second approach introduces specific mechanisms to explain institutional change. The third approach challenges and modifies the assumptions from the literature on technological path dependence and adopts a path shaping (rather than path dependent) perspective.</p>
<p>The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412212471562">North (1990)</xref> fits into the first of these three approaches and suggests that “the process by which we arrive at today’s institutions is relevant and constrains future choices”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0885412212471562">5</xref></sup> (p. 94). In an example of the second type of approaches to path dependence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0885412212471562">Stark (1992)</xref>, one of the first scholars to apply the idea of path dependence to institutional change in postsocialist economies, argues that social change is the result of strategic behavior of actors constrained by the existing institutions and resources (essentially political resources). An example of the third approach to path dependence comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885412212471562">Hausner, Jessop, and Nielsen (1995)</xref>, who challenge the degree to which path dependence has a defining role in institutional change but still assume that institutional evolution is bounded by legacies. Their “path shaping” perspective combines inherited constraints and strategic actions. Their approach to institutional change considers that choices are constrained by the path dependent context but that there are nonetheless a range of possible choices. Under the path shaping perspective, actors choose strategically “where to go” within the limits defined by inherited constraints. According to path shaping perspective, changing or shaping attitudes and behavior is a potential means of influencing future development paths.</p>
<p>Not long into the 1990s (i.e., soon after the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe), some authors were already voicing concerns about whether central and eastern European countries were in a position to adopt Western-style policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885412212471562">Campbell and Pedersen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885412212471562">Elster, Offe, and Preuss 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0885412212471562">Offe 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412212471562">Rose 1993</xref>). The main argument was that institutional development in countries and the various constituencies within them are of a path dependent nature: history and context matter. More specifically, their contention was that the historical experiences and developments that these countries have been through have shaped institutional patterns, legal structures, cultural values, public preferences, and professional organizations. There is also still much debate about how European welfare systems (see “Families of Nations and Social Models” above) may give rise to “path dependency” and thereby inhibit mutual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885412212471562">Giddens 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Path dependency also means that previous policy decisions which were more or less successful in the past will tend to be repeated, policy officials will tend to stick to well-known solutions and policy changes will tend to be incremental and kept to a minimum wherever possible. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0885412212471562">Lenschow, Liefferink, and Veenman (2005)</xref>, policy actors generally tend to choose from their existing repertoire of institutional procedures, technologies, and organizational forms, while new institutional patterns that break with established practices and procedures are rarely considered since their introduction will generally involve additional time, personnel, and financial resources.</p>
<p>Whatever the interpretation or approach to path dependence, one fact remains: history matters or, in other words, options for institutional or policy change are narrowed by choices made in the past. Present decisions are linked with previous situations because of the persistence of certain ideas and institutions through time. The interaction between formal and informal rules leads to a path-dependent result (see also “Planning Cultures” above). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412212471562">Goetz (2006)</xref>, new members of the EU, because of their recent history of transition, have more malleable domestic institutions and, as a consequence, “the European project does not encounter a set of historically validated and deeply entrenched domestic political institutions” (p. 7). Looking at the case of regional policy in Latvia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0885412212471562">Paalzow (2006)</xref> argues that the past has an important role in shaping the way actors both think and act. The Soviet legacy has left its mark on policy making (as well as various other dimensions of public life) in many parts of central and eastern Europe.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Policy convergence in the field of spatial planning in Europe is claimed by some but evidence to date is far from conclusive. Because the concept of policy convergence clearly has a time and relational dimension (it concerns the trajectory of change over time and how this trajectory compares to one or more reference cases), the chosen reference case(s) and period of analysis heavily influence any conclusions about the extent to which convergence has or has not occurred. It is clear that convergence relates to a number of different dimensions of policy making (i.e., policy goals, policy content, policy instruments, policy outcomes, policy styles, and policy settings) and these do not necessarily follow the same trajectories. As a result, convergence and divergence of different dimensions is possible.</p>
<p>Considering the key trends in spatial planning across Europe, and looking across the five main dimensions of policy convergence identified by Bennett (1991), there is some appeal to the notion that certain dimensions of spatial planning may be converging while others are not. The small amount of empirical evidence currently available in the area would appear to lend some weight (albeit limited) to this notion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885412212471562">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Policy goals</italic>, for example, may be experiencing some convergence as spatial planning attempts to respond to various issues (e.g., sustainable development, economic competitiveness, European integration, and demographic change) that are common to authorities across Europe and beyond. Nevertheless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471562">Friedmann (2005)</xref> recognizes, that major differences still exist in the ways in which planning is conceived across the world, and this clearly has an influence on policy goals. The principles of spatial planning may also be experiencing some convergence (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams 2008</xref>). There is less certainty when it comes to the convergence of <italic>policy content</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref> claims some evidence for the convergence of the content of spatial planning strategies in selected European countries, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471562">Fürst (2009)</xref> suggests the possible convergence of methodological approaches (which he describes as a consequence of research and education taking a more international perspective). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471562">Börzel and Risse (2000)</xref> meanwhile take the view that, while there may be some convergence in policy outcomes (but maybe only limited to “clustered convergence”), there is often a “divergence with regard to policy processes and instruments, politics, and polities” (p. 14). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885412212471562">Newman and Thornley (2005)</xref> suggest that decisions about the scope of planning and public policy remain localized despite globalization pressures. There is less certainty or evidence for the convergence of <italic>policy instruments</italic> in spatial planning compared to the convergence of policy goals or policy content. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref>, for example, states that “implementation, monitoring and review would appear to be the area of least convergence” in spatial planning (p. 43). There is also little evidence for the convergence of <italic>policy outcomes</italic>, such as development patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412212471562">Beauregard (2001)</xref> takes the view that “convergence might not be as strong a force, at least as regards the intellectual production and the urban development that it represents” (p. 258). On the issue of <italic>policy styles</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471562">Adams (2008)</xref> claims that “there has been a general convergence towards more collaborative and communicative forms of planning” within Europe (p. 34). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885412212471562">Giannakourou (2005)</xref>, in her study of the Europeanization of spatial planning in southern Europe, argues against any “hard institutional convergence of domestic policy styles” (p. 329). Meanwhile, Jordan and Liefferink (2004), in a study of environmental policy in European member states, conclude that evidence for convergence toward a single model is lacking and that policy styles and structures continue to diverge. No evidence is available as far as the author is aware on the issue of policy settings and convergence.</p>

<p>This article has set out various concepts that can be employed to explore the nature of policy convergence in relation to spatial planning: globalization, Europeanization, policy transfer, and learning/lesson-drawing as agents of convergence; and planning culture, families of nations, path dependency, and path shaping as agents resisting convergence. Despite similar policy agendas and common tendencies in approaches, the convergence of planning systems in Europe appears not to have occurred to a great extent. Differences between many national systems of spatial planning in Europe remain (in terms of policy instruments, policy outcomes and policy styles), which suggests that the forces of convergence are evenly matched against a range of forces that are resisting convergence. The lack of convergence also relates to system inertia and the high transaction costs associated with fundamental changes to the planning system, such as the legal framework or the basic type of policy instruments.</p>
<p>Very few studies to date have provided a detailed examination of policy convergence in the area of spatial planning, especially across a wide number of planning systems. Of the studies that do exist, policy convergence and divergence has not been the main focus of the research and a systematic approach to examine the various dimensions of convergence has not been used; in most cases, they have simply referred to policy convergence in a general sense. Differences in findings are quite apparent between the studies, partly due to research approach and partly due to the cases examined. A great opportunity exists for new research to provide a more authoritative and comprehensive account of spatial planning policy convergence across Europe and beyond.</p>

<p>The article has had a relatively long gestation and it has been presented to various audiences in different forms before publication. I first presented some of the broad ideas contained in this article back in 2008 at the joint ACSP-AESOP conference in Chicago. In the following year, I had the opportunity to discuss the issues of convergence and divergence with participants of the ARL Working Group on Comparative Spatial Planning Research at one of their working group meetings. In 2010, I produced a new version of the article as a background resource for an expert workshop (entitled “Territorial Governance in Europe: Convergence, Divergence or Constancy?”) that I organized in Hamburg in 2010 during a three-month stint as guest professor at HafenCity Universität Hamburg. A year later, I updated the article and submitted it to the <italic>Journal of Planning Literature</italic>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my various audiences along the way for their useful comments and questions that have helped to shape the final version of the article. I would also like to thank two anonymous referees for their encouraging and constructive comments on my article.</p>
