<abstract>
<p>This article brings psychosocial methods into conversation with methodological and ethical debates arising from the reuse of qualitative research material, and with issues of ethnographic practice. Our empirical grounding came from the psychosocial technique of reading research texts aloud in a group, listening in an affectively attuned way, and sharing our responses. The texts we revisited—infant observation notes of interactions between a young mother and her baby—were originally gathered for the Becoming a Mother project. We identified affectively dense and compelling episodes in the data and, as we detail with examples, examined the textual sources of the experienced meanings and affects that these events evoked in group members. We discuss the epistemological and ethical complexities and challenges of this approach to the archiving and reuse of qualitative empirical material and show how the process of slow, affectively attuned reading of field notes and interviews may enrich qualitative research practices.</p>

<body>
<p>Affective processes are embedded in every facet of qualitative research. They are present in the social and cultural worlds we seek to understand and in the ways we perceive, interpret, and represent them. Affect (immediate, embodied sensations) and emotion (affects that are more mentally processed and personally contextualized)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411434283">1</xref></sup> are an integral part of the perceived meaning of a situation not only in the lived interaction that the observer tries to record and fix in her notes but also in succeeding situations when the observer reads the notes and tries to grasp the meaning of what took place. They weave through the iterative practices of reading and interpreting empirical material, and they animate constructions of meaning in provisional and final texts. Qualitative research may be seen as a transformative chain of texts, each interpreting the one before—and affects are a crucial dimension of what might be transformed, transposed, and traced along these chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411434283">McLeod &amp; Thomson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411434283">Nielsen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion that affects might “travel”—from person to person, from place to place, and between moments—is a subject of increasing interest within social science discussions. The British psychosocial movement has considered this idea as a part of an ongoing dialogue between clinical and social science perspectives and within a wider turn to affect flows associated with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411434283">Deleuze and Guattari (1987</xref>; for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411434283">Wetherell, 2012</xref>). In this article, we pursue the following questions: How do affects travel through texts? From where do these affects come and what may we learn by listening to them? Can they be grasped through the methods of qualitative research, and why would this be important? We take a primarily methodological approach to questions about what affect and the movement of affect might entail, and how such processes might be accounted for. We approach these questions in a concrete and inductive way by seeking to trace movements of affect between persons and texts and from texts back to persons in new times and places. In combining these two aspects of motility—traveling data and traveling affect—we intend to bring psychosocial methods into conversation with the literature on ethnographic practice and with methodological and ethical debates arising from the reuse of qualitative research material.</p>
<p>We also use the term <italic>traveling data</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800411434283">2</xref></sup> to convey the overriding significance of the <italic>recontextualizing</italic> of material in new times and places, and with different audiences. This process, we will argue, is integral to the restaging and resituating of affect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800411434283">3</xref></sup> Finally, we discuss ways in which debates about traveling affect and traveling data may echo each other. Although expressed in different vocabularies, both areas of debate include realist concerns about the loss of context and questions of evidence, ethical concerns about voyeurism, and interpretive concerns about the boundaries and criteria of a good-enough analysis.</p>
<p>We will begin by describing our effort to analyze traveling data—material gathered at an earlier time and different place—by opening ourselves to the texts, tuning into, reacting to, and increasingly processing their affective content. To help in focusing and understanding of our effort to trace affects as they move through texts, we draw on a number of theoretical resources and literatures, including commentaries on and uses of the concept of the “scenic” as derived from the work of Alfred Lorenzer; and Paul Riceour’s philosophical account of the differences between speaking and writing and how texts find audiences. Although these different writings are located within distinct disciplinary traditions, we feel that they have affinities since each in different ways captures something of the ineffable quality of affect with which we seek to engage. Lorenzer and Ricoeur share a hermeneutic epistemology, an approach that we also work with in this article. The continental hermeneutic tradition, which combines a concept of reality with close attention to representations, does not fit well into the Anglo-Saxon dichotomy between realist and poststructuralist epistemologies. The hermeneutic approach emphasizes textual structures and processes of never ending but approximating interpretation. This also applies to a hermeneutic understanding of the psychoanalytic process: Interpretations are never final, but still seek to approach a psychic reality. Ricoeur’s distinction between the <italic>meaning</italic> and the <italic>significance</italic> of a text seeks to mediate controversy about whether the content of a text is due to its internal structure (meaning) or its reference to the world (significance). A text represents a message, not only a symptom:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My contention is that discourse cannot fail to be about something. In saying this, I am denying the ideology of absolute texts. In one manner or another, poetic texts speak about the world. But not in a descriptive way. As [Roman] Jacobson himself suggests, the reference here is not abolished, but divided or split (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800411434283">Ricoeur, 1970/1991</xref>, p. 8).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After presenting the empirical case study and the context of our work, we will explore these broader theoretical ideas by reflecting on what we have learned through this exercise and by sharing insights that might be relevant to other researchers.</p>

<title>Working With Observational Material</title>
<p>The empirical material we used in this experiment came from the observational part of the Becoming a Mother study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411434283">Hollway, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800411434283">2008</xref>) which involved a series of weekly hour-long home visits taking place over the first year of a baby’s life, focused on everyday interactions and states of mind of mother and baby and other family members. We focused on one case in the study: Azra, a second-generation Bangladeshi mother living in London and her newborn son Zamir. The researchers of the study used psychoanalytic infant observation, originally developed for the training of child psychotherapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411434283">Bick, 1964</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800411434283">4</xref></sup> The observational notes are written up as soon as possible after each visit in a chronological and descriptive style, and include detail about home environments and family relations, bodily movement, facial expressions, and vocalizations. Over the course of the year, and at regular intervals, the observer who visited Azra and her family, along with the five other observers in the same role, convened each week with the seminar leader Cathy Urwin and members of the research team. Notes were kept of the ensuing discussion. Later the observer drew on her notes, what she has processed from the seminar discussion and her cumulative experience of the baby, mother and wider family to write a published account of the empirical case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411434283">Layton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We revisited and reanalyzed this material during a research stay at the Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS) in Oslo, Norway in the spring of 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077800411434283">5</xref></sup> A group of nine researchers spent 8 weeks together at CAS analyzing the Azra case from different theoretical and methodological perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077800411434283">6</xref></sup> Cathy Urwin guided our approach to reading textual material in an affectively attuned way, with techniques of collective work employed in the infant observation seminar groups. The big group of nine was later divided into smaller groups (including the four of us), who pursued different aspects of the case.</p>
<p>Since the infant observation technique focuses on the nonverbal subject of the baby, the texts involve rich and precise descriptions of movement, setting, and interaction. They are highly evocative texts, and the process of reading them aloud is associated with a vivid and sensual rendering of the encounter. The tradition places great emphasis on an inductive methodology that involves close attention to the text and the evocation and processing of situated affects held within the material. In this respect, it has more resemblance to the traditions of the German depth hermeneutic tradition represented by Alfred Lorenzer and Ulrike Prokop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434283">Bereswill, Morgenroth, &amp; Redman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411434283">Bereswill &amp; Morgenroth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411434283">Lorenzer, 1986</xref>) than approaches to group analysis currently used in the psychosocial field in the United Kingdom and Europe. The latter are characterized by research groups collaboratively untangling the presence of projections within interpretations (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800411434283">Walkerdine, Lucey, &amp; Melody, 2001</xref>) and various uses of “panels” to help with the analysis of life history material, with the group operating as a resource for maximizing imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800411434283">Rosenthal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411434283">Wengraf, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There is considerable debate as to what if anything might distinguish a primary and secondary analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411434283">Hammersley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411434283">Moore, 2007</xref>). In our project the boundaries are blurred since the large CAS group includes two members of the original Becoming a Mother research team, who worked hard to provide the relevant context for our deliberations. In addition, our research questions, although not the same as for the original project, are compatible with that study. In this sense we are part of a project of data sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411434283">Irwin &amp; Winterton, 2011</xref>). We will now describe our small group’s experience of reusing these traveling research materials, organized through slow reading of and listening to texts, tuning in to and taking note of our affective responses, and discussing these responses. We sought not only to deepen our understanding of interactions between Azra and her baby and their familial context, but also to explore ways in which the observer described and evoked this original situation. Our overall goal is to illuminate relationships between affect and meaning making in the practices of qualitative research, including questions about how we can argue for our interpretations and what kind of knowledge an affective reading of texts may convey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077800411434283">
<title>The Process of Analysis</title>
<p>On the day before our small group first met, the larger CAS group had worked with two observations of the mother and the baby (12 weeks and 6 months old) in their home environment. When the larger group read the observational notes aloud, the group members responded to them in a contrasting way. Some members responded to the material in a way that was defensive of the mother, wanting to “normalize” what was described. Others took up a position that was more defensive of the baby. How can the same text trigger such different readings and how might these readings be justified in the material?</p>
<p>Our small group made it our task to search for the textual triggers for the experienced meanings and affects that were evoked in the group members. Individually we went through the two observation notes and identified distinct “moments” that felt affectively rich/dense/compelling. We each selected two episodes for further scrutiny, identified simply as characterized by negative affect and positive affect. When we met to share the two episodes (each about a paragraph long) that we had separately flagged, it turned out that we had picked the same ones. Thus, moments of dense situated affect tend to stand out and can be recognized.</p>
<p>We will now quote observational notes describing the episode that we defined as negative, and urge the reader to share with us the experience of slow listening, focusing not only on what is talked/written about but also on the effects created by the way language is being used and the way the text is structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411434283">Ogden, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Episode 1, baby 12 weeks old:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I felt uncomfortable because the news was about the Shia Mosque in Iraq, which had been so badly attacked. There were reports of reprisals from the Shia community on the Sunni places of worship and many were killed. I asked what she was feeding Z. A told me that she fed him Cow and Gate hungry baby formula. A said when she was only breast feeding him he was always attached to her and she could get nothing done. Z is very demanding. Z was feeding quietly and calmly and A was looking at him and he returned her gaze. Z was no longer looking at her but into the distance his eyes lost focus and he seemed to be drifting in to sleep. A poked him in the cheek to wake him up which Z did not seem to mind, woke up a little and continued to feed. The fingers of Z’s right hand were gently around his mother’s finger as she fed him. I commented on his doing this and A said he had only just begun doing that to her. I noticed that he also touched his mother’s hand with the fingers of his left hand. A suddenly jerked and removed the bottle as I asked if he had fallen asleep and A said he had. He woke up and A tried to encourage him to finish the bottle. He moved and the bottle fell on the floor. A picked it up and tried again but Z refused to take the teat. A put him into his chair and left the room. [Then follows a description of Z looking at, talking to the toy “as I had noticed him doing to his mother.”]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When we returned to the material in our small group, reading it aloud again and focusing on this single episode, we found that we were able to allow in some of the difficult feelings in the material, the sense of danger, mistrust, and worry. The movement from instantaneous reactions to a slower tempo let us begin to <italic>process the feelings involved in the affect.</italic> Our capacity to do this was shaped, in part, by temporal rhythms, by our initial experience with the material in the larger CAS group, and by the slow reading aloud in our small group. It became possible to see what textual sources evoked the emotions we felt, rather than simply sensing and reacting to them. We identified two major textual mechanisms that had shaped our responses: the observer’s staging of episodes and her construction of the text through sudden and unmediated jumps.</p>
<p>Vivid and violent imagery from the television as well as the image of the “hungry baby” are crucial to the observer’s framing of the episode. The reference to the TV screen, signaling sudden attack and danger, shaped our response to the subsequent events that are described in the text. Why did the observer hold on to these contextual details and anchor her memories in them? She records her feeling of discomfort in the situation; the descriptive details helped convey these feelings and meanings to us as readers of her text.</p>
<p>The initial description of the scene is followed by a number of sudden jumps from bad/violent/disruptive to good/calm/mundane, or vice versa. These unmediated disjunctions gave each of us a feeling of unpredictability and danger. The first of a series of shifts comes when the violent imagery from the big world outside is replaced by the mundane here and now discussion of formula milk. A new shift occurs when Azra reveals that she experiences Zamir as demanding and doesn’t want him so attached to her, information followed by a description of the baby quietly feeding and baby and mother gazing at each other. The tone of the text is peaceful and quiet, but is then quickly interrupted by the mother’s poking the baby in the cheek. The baby responds by gently wrapping his fingers around those of his mother. As readers, we relax again, only to be unsettled by a new sudden jerk, the mother leaving the room, and the baby trying to relate to his toys instead. The staccato style of the description and the sudden shifts between comfort and discomfort might be understood as the observer’s way of recording her sense of disquiet in her text.</p>
<p>What we especially experienced as painful was the juxtaposition of Azra’s assertion that Zamir “is very demanding” and the observed intimacy and connection between mother and baby in the subsequent sequence. Some of us had an impulse of wanting to warn the calm baby against the lurking danger of a mother who did not want him so close. We sensed a dissonance between a general feeling of disquiet and worry, and the peaceful baby drifting into sleep. Our associations included concern that the baby drifting into sleep involved a potentially alarming “drifting away” (in our fantasy a kind of dying, like the attacked Sunni Muslims). We experienced feelings that seemed to be encoded in the text and that, we imagined, had been circulating in the original encounter—evidently belonging to the observer, but perhaps also involving Azra and the baby. The overall feel of the episode was shaped largely by an evocation of setting that emphasized potential danger, with the TV references appearing like a Greek chorus warning us of the potential danger for violence.</p>
<p>One member of our small group was herself the mother of a baby close to Zamir’s age. In her response to the text she experienced the observer’s question “what are you feeding him?” as a reproach. In contrast to others in the group she was not alarmed by the jumps between intimacy and disconnection, something she related to her personal situation of being subjected to her own baby’s shifting, often incomprehensible, needs and states of being. She felt that the claim that the baby is very demanding and his quiet feeding were not necessarily contradictory. On the contrary, the mother’s constant availability to her baby is what feels exhausting but simultaneously provides the baby with a feeling of safety that makes him calm/able to fall a sleep.</p>
<p>In terms of the original situation, we felt that we could discern from this written episode the existence of cross purposes between mother and baby. The observer seemed to respond to this mismatch, which contributed to her conveying a lack of trust and a sense that danger was present. As secondary analysts, we interpreted her use of words such as “seemed” and “appears” as conveying a feeling that she could not make sense of what she was witnessing, and indicated that the baby and Azra had a disquieting style of interaction, with the baby not reacting as she—and we—expected. Of course this terminology might also be characteristic of a training that seeks to maintain epistemological uncertainty. Our reading placed emphasis on these words as textual mechanisms that reveal how affects can be stored in texts and then “released” in subsequent readings. Stepping back in the transformative chain of texts, reading, and interpretation, we understand the observer as a conduit of feeling, producing a semiprocessed text that requires more attention and work. Like the observer, we (as secondary analysts) are unsure of what things mean, and, in the case of this passage, we have to hold the tension between the murderous and the mundane without falling into either—keeping an open, uncertain attention.</p>
<p>Episode 2, baby 6 months old:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The bedroom was tidy and comfortable. A told me that Z’s grandmother had made all the throws and the two bolsters and cushions in Z’s cot. A said they were very useful. The embroidery on the materials was attractive detailed and must have entailed a lot of work and dedication. A said it took her two months to make them. Z’s cot is large and comfortable with several soft toys, the embroidered bolsters and curtains around the wooden frame of the cot. A patted his back and put on some music, Brahms lullaby. Z was playing with a soft toy that A gave him and which looked like a duck. He turned and wanted to hold onto her fingers. A roughly turned him over and away from her picking up by one leg and one arm. His eyes closed momentarily when placed in this position.</p>
<p>I said that my watching on him was a distraction and I stood behind the door so that Z could not see me. A joined me; it was an intimate feel between us as we both watched Z who was playing gently with his toy. He was stroking the toy’s face with his hands. Z was making sing song sounds while looking at his toy. His legs moved about kicking the cushions at the side of his cot. His attention seemed focused on his toy, which he held with one hand and moved about freely. A smiled and I said he was able to go to sleep on his own now and she nodded. I said it was time for me to go. I said I would not phone next week because I knew she was having a driving lesson. She said she would see me between 3.15 and 3.30 p.m. and she came to the door and unlocked it and said goodbye.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After choosing this episode because it appeared to be unproblematically positive, we subjected it to a similarly close analysis, reading aloud and paying attention to the relationship between the construction of the text and our affective responses. While recognizing that the notes were written with the aim of being faithful to recollections of the original situation, we wanted to discover what it was that the observer was doing in and with this text that evoked such positive feelings in us as readers. At first glance, the observer’s choice of words affects us. Whereas she introduced Episode 1 with the word “uncomfortable,” she uses the opposite word—“comfortable”—to introduce this episode, repeating the word twice. As with the other episode, she vividly evokes the scene by a description of the setting—this time a move into the baby’s bedroom, a more private and intimate space. We felt enveloped in a soft, comforting environment, with references to the paternal grandmother in Bangladesh whose embroidery adorns the room and materializes time-consuming labor, implying a persistent commitment towards the baby and Azra, even from afar. The reference to the Brahms’ Lullaby offers a contrast to the loud TV in the previous episode, capturing and evoking feelings of safety and care associated with more western cultural traditions familiar to members of our group and possibly also to the observer. The bedroom is described as large and distinct, representing a space for the baby separate from the living room/shared family space, and contributing to a sense of demarcation between generations. In her text, the observer places Azra and Bangladeshi culture in a familiar world which may add to our comfort and willingness to engage in positive reading.</p>
<p>On later reflection, we wondered how much ethnocentrism— the baby with his own contained and private space, listening to Brahms, and meeting Western ideas of proper child development—contributed to our feeling of security. The two grandmothers in our group wondered, in particular, if the felt presence of the paternal grandmother, via her embroideries, enhanced their feelings of comfort and security as they read the observation notes. The two younger members of the group were somewhat uneasy with this idea as it did not credit enough of Zamir’s development to his mother. In some ways these readings resonated with the different responses in the initial large CAS group. The difficulty of fixing a single interpretation was highly generative for our analysis—pushing us towards a descriptive rather then explanatory mode of enquiry.</p>
<p>In this described episode, as in the previous one, the baby is falling asleep, but, as we read this text, we felt more confident and assured by the comforting rhythm of Azra patting his back and laying him down in the cot. We were taken aback momentarily by her picking Zamir up by arm and leg, especially since the observer describes the gesture as “rough.” This echoes a moment in the earlier observation when Zamir also reacts to roughness with manifestations of feeling relaxed and sleepy. This remains uncomfortable and difficult to interpret, but it is framed in a different setting, more associated with routines and clear messages, not danger. It has become more familiar to us and appears to be so for the baby as well.</p>
<p>The sequence of the actions also suggests that the observer overrides her emotional reaction to the “roughness” in order to recognize what Azra was trying to achieve in getting Zamir ready for sleep. She acknowledges (and affirms) Azra’s mothering by stepping away behind the door, and Azra responds by accepting this gesture and moving behind the door with the observer. Together they gaze at Zamir, a moment the observer describes (and which we, as readers, strongly felt) as intimate. Azra smiles and then the observer speaks, naming this new stage of development: He is able to go to sleep on his own now. The leave taking described in the final sentences of the episode involves an unlocking of the door, signaling to us that the observer experiences something (Azra) “opening up.”</p>
<p>This overall episode is distinguished by warmth and a sense that the observer is trusting Azra more than before, able to give her the benefit of the doubt even where ambivalence remains. Our relief and pleasure here seemed related both to placing the unfamiliar in a more familiar setting (separate bedroom, Brahms, ideas about infant development), and recognizing the greater ease and even intimacy between observer and observed. In discussing this sequence of action and affect and what contributed to the overall “feel” of the episode, we noted that we seldom relied on one source of evidence alone. Many unspoken assumptions contributed to the overdetermination of the pervasive affective tone of the situation, suggesting a reliance on shared meaning that can itself consolidate intimacy—in this case, the discourse of development that the observer and Azra now share.</p>

<title>Conversations Between Analyses</title>
<p>In the concluding stage of our secondary analysis, we read the Becoming a Mother seminar group’s discussion of the two observations we had worked with. The overall picture of the seminar group and our analysis do not differ radically, rather they were created within different genres with different purposes. We also read the observer’s published article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411434283">Layton, 2007</xref>), based on her observation notes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077800411434283">7</xref></sup> To our pleasant surprise, the two episodes we had selected from a larger body of material were among the relatively few excerpts of her observational notes the observer chose to include in her article, but she framed and used them in slightly different ways. By examining the differences, we learned more about ways in which affect works through texts and how it may be encountered, coded, recoded, and circulated. Note that temporal layers of affect—felt, experienced, processed—are piling up: the original interactions in Azra’s home contexts; Layton’s observational notes; the discussions in the Becoming a Mother seminar group; our much later reading and interpretations of extracts from the observations; Layton’s published article, based in part on and quoting from those episodes; and now our responses to her article. The experience of comparing “our” versions of episodes with those presented in Layton’s published article gave rise to feelings of connection and separation from the primary analysis. On reflection, we recognize that as secondary analysts we are drawn into struggles over meaning with the observer—however, inappropriate given that her purposes in writing the notes and the article had not involved us. Our discussion of the way that “our” episodes are presented in Layton’s published account bear traces of these ambivalent feelings, which we seek to use in a way that provides further insight into the operations of affect within travelling data.</p>

<title>Episode 1, as it appears in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411434283">Layton (2007</xref>):</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The arrival of Zamir with his needy feelings stirred up the hungry infant inside her [Azra] and her own needs overwhelmed her. There were now two hungry babies in competition with each other [. . .]:</p>
<p>Azra had decided to wean Zamir from the breast. Azra said, “When I only breast-fed Zamir he was always attached to me and I could get nothing done. He was very demanding.” Zamir was feeding quietly and calmly from the bottle while Azra was talking.</p>
<p>Azra felt overwhelmed by Zamir’s persistent request for food and attention. She was concerned she did not have enough to give him She wanted some distance from his needy feelings and her own. I think it was difficult for her to breastfeed Zamir because the hungry baby inside her felt left out and deprived of that much wanted close relationship. (p. 259)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this extract from her published account of the year long observation with Asra and her family, Layton cites material that was part of our “Episode 1” in the section of her article looking at weaning. Our response to the text focused on subtle but (to us) important changes in relation to the original observation, which had consequences for the interpretation we had done. Perhaps most striking for us, the published account does not include the vivid scenic framework that we felt was important to our idea of the “episode” (a description of what was on television and the mention of the Hungry Baby branded milk). We also noted a shift in the language of the description, with the enigmatically direct statement in the original (“Zamir is very demanding”) revised to the past tense and semblance of reported speech: “Zamir was very demanding.” Highlighting the time line—he was demanding, but now he is quiet and calm—makes the abrupt jump between the two statements feel less threatening. The bottle that now emerges in the sentence “Zamir was feeding quietly and calmly” also assures us that the weaning was a success. We noticed that a fragment central to our analysis has been cut: “A was looking at him and he returned her gaze,” and substituted with “while Azra was talking,” which also makes the baby and the possible tensions in the interaction less salient.</p>
<p>As secondary analysts, the text itself rather than the original encounter is the primary source of meaning, and each of these altered phrases represents a crucial mechanism for holding the situational affect that we had identified as encoded in the episode. In that respect, the changed text no longer communicated the feelings that we experienced in reading the original. We did recognize, however, that some of the feelings we had identified as crucial had not disappeared, but had been integrated into Layton’s analysis, including the identification of tussles between mother and child around intimacy and an apparent discordance between roughness and relaxation. In particular, the figure of the “Hungry Baby” that had figured in juxtaposition to the violent imagery of the television had found its way into Layton’s interpretation that Zamir’s birth had unleashed strong feelings of need, dependency and desire within Azra. Layton makes illustrative use of the episodes within an analytic narrative that is informed by detailed processing of a years worth of observations. As secondary analysts, we can only work backwards through the text, and in doing so we notice how affect is both encoded in the original observation text, and is also present in a more diffuse way in the new text. Ironically, the material that had made this episode emotionally disturbing for us had been moved/ changed – including the juxtaposition of roughness and intimacy and the ambiguity of the phrase “Zamir is very demanding.”</p>
<p>It could also be the case that Layton and we are picking up different affective layers of this specific observation. As mentioned, we felt that Layton in the moment of her observation could not make sense of what she was witnessing, but in the later moment of interpretation she uses the elements in the observation to interpret Azra’s unconscious state of mind, her rivalry with her baby, and her need of distance during the process of weaning. What we as secondary analysts may be picking up—through the way Layton coded her original observation—could be other aspects that may be unconscious and unsymbolized to Azra, and which stay at the margins of Layton’s use of this specific episode. Our focus on a child in danger, the fear of dying, and the feeling of something unpredictable, of being thrown back and forth between the murderous and the mundane, may catch unsymbolized knowledge about how it may feel to be a mother to a newborn infant: the fear of the child dying or oneself dying, the feeling of chaos and the ambivalent loss of oneself in the baby. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411434283">Winnicott (1956)</xref> in the earliest holding of the infant,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077800411434283">8</xref></sup> the mother, at great physical and emotional costs to herself, absorbs the impact of time, because time is a human invention, felt as other, and threatens the infant’s sense of continuity/being alive. Layton’s observation has stored this knowledge through a highly evocative scenic account of situated affect and thus made it available to us as secondary analysts. The new context of her text resulted in a restaging and situating of the affect in it.</p>
<p>We then moved on to look at Layton’s use of the second episode, which in our collective reading we had identified as characterized by positive affect, and which she includes towards the end of her article in a section about intimacy. Layton provides an extended extract from the observation note. She begins and ends her extract before what we defined as our second “episode” and cuts considerable material from it.</p>
<p>Episode 2 as it appears in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411434283">Layton (2007</xref>, pp. 263-264):</p>
<p>Later in the observation Azra shared with me some intimate moments between herself and Zamir:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Zamir began to grizzle and Azra picked him up somewhat roughly and stood him up. After a few minutes she tried to put him down on the floor but he resisted by keeping his legs straight. He sat down and fell over onto his front. [I was stuck by his need to manage and not cry and show his vulnerability.] Azra said he was tired and again picked him up. Again he struggled to get away from her. She took him into the bedroom. [I noticed the beautiful and gaily-coloured throws and bolsters in his cot.] Azra said “Javed’s mother made them all.” [The embroidery on the material was very attractive and must have entailed a great deal of work and dedication.] Azra said, “It took my mother-in-law two months to make them.” She patted Zamir’s back and put on some music, Brahms’ Lullaby. I said I would leave the room because my watching him was a distraction. Azra joined me and we stood together just outside the bedroom looking at Zamir through a crack in the door. There was an intimacy between us and we both enjoyed watching Zamir playing gently with his toy duck. He was stroking the duck’s face with his hands and making sing-song noises while looking at it. His legs moved about kicking the cushions at the side of the cot. His attention seemed focused on his toy, which he held in one hand while waving it over his head. Azra smiled. I said that he was able to go to sleep on his own now and she nodded.</p>
<p>I was standing close to Azra as we both watched Zamir through the crack in the door. It felt like a grandmother and mother watching together and I realized how much she missed the support of her own mother and her mother-in-law. I think Azra felt contained by my presence and Zamir felt held in his mother’s mind so that he could bear being alone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this, as with the first of our episodes, the author excludes some of the descriptive detail that we emphasized in our secondary analysis of the episode, and which we identified as a key textual element producing an emotional response in us as readers. The words “comfortable” and “soft” were no longer used, as was the description of Zamir reaching out to hold Azra’s finger and the sequence of action that includes her picking him up “roughly” and Zamir’s “eyes closing momentarily” that we had placed at the centre of our reading. Also, the passage about Azra “unlocking” the door is left out. Again we noticed that many of the ideas and themes identified in our analysis were present in Layton’s overall analytic account even though material from “our” episode is presented in ways that change its affective quality.</p>
<p>In contrast to the way in which the first of “our” episodes becomes less negative in Layton’s account, the way in which she presents the second episode renders it as less harmonious than our approach—drawing our attention to the significance of the way in which episodes are “framed.” Layton’s version opens with a “tussle” that still seems to go on between Azra and Zamir and makes it part of Zamir’s development that he can now manage not to show his vulnerability. In this account, Zamir’s development becomes less idyllic and linear than in ours. By cutting the episode the way we did, we only kept the positive side of the baby’s capacity to be alone, not the pain and emotional conflict that separation also entails which is underscored by the way Layton edits her account. In this respect, Layton’s account encouraged us to notice the ways in which we had reified specific aspects of the text within our secondary analysis. The project of looking for an episode with “positive affect” shaped our analysis, giving it a very different quality compared with the primary analysis that sought to integrate the whole corpus of research material. It is our contention that dissonances of this kind between primary and secondary analyses may be generative, extending and deepening insight through the staging and recontextualizing of affect, including feelings produced between the different analytic moments and actors.</p>

<title>Animating Affects: Voice, Text, and Digestion</title>
<p>On reflection we were able to locate a series of key points in our process where situated affects could be identified in traveling data. First, when we individually read the observation notes to identify two affectively loaded episodes, we chose the same ones. Experienced affect is intimately related to the organization of the text, and even minor changes do something to the kind of affect that is transmitted. Perhaps there was also an element of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411434283">Ogden (1999)</xref> calls “events that rhyme” in our discovery of resonance between the two moments—conscious and unconscious feelings, thoughts, and other intrapsychic and intersubjective events “echoed each other.” We noted that both episodes involve incidents of “holding,” with the child falling asleep, as well as juxtapositions of physical roughness and relaxation. Yet these episodes differ significantly in affective tone, and this very contrast, a pattern of tension and then relief, may be part of the rhyming. Second, our ability to engage with the material changed over time, suggesting the value of group sharing and discussion for processing and digesting the affective material. A third insight into our process of identifying situated affects in traveling data emerged from our privileged perspective on how the “episodes” changed in the observer’s final, published account and the ways in which we reacted to this difference and processed the feelings involved. Initially the vantage point of secondary analysts enabled us to identify textual mechanisms through which affect is housed in material, and to witness the releasing of affects into another layer of symbolization—the observer’s and our own interpretations. Subsequently, in the writing and revision of this article we have become aware of the ways in which feelings of connection and separation between primary and secondary analysis might themselves be part of the affective character of the material that we are working with. To make sense of these processual observations, we have drawn on theories that bear on the affect-laden process of <italic>animation</italic>.</p>
<p>One element of animation may have been the sheer act of reading the text slowly. In such reading (aloud or to oneself), particular sentences/utterances set in motion conscious and unconscious associations that draw upon what is most “alive” in the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411434283">Ogden, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800411434283">Ogden (2009)</xref> explains that in the act of being read/spoken/heard, words create a fresh immediacy of experience in the reader/listener. In the language of the archive, this is creative “recontextualization” when material is reanimated in new times and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434283">Geiger, Moore, &amp; Savage, 2010</xref>) while, we assume in the case of empirical material, remaining connected to and even evoking the original event.</p>
<p>When reading and listening to the observational notes, we attempted to listen to the sound and feel of “what’s going on” in the observed encounter, in the text, the observer’s article, and in our group’s discussions. This is akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411434283">Ogden (1999</xref>; using Bion’s term) describes as the state of reverie in the clinic. Ogden believes that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the unspoken and the unspeakable are present (sometimes in their absence) in the language that is spoken, in the manner in which it is spoken, in the sounds of the words and sentences, in the feelings elicited in the listener, and (in the analytic setting) in the behaviors and bodily sensations that accompany what is being said. (p. 990)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on our process of working through and analyzing a particular chain of texts, we can add that “the unspoken” was present in the textual mechanisms we identified (in relation to Episode 1) that evoked first our sense of fear and discomfort, and later our sense of uncertainty and calm.</p>
<p>Ogden suggests that content that might have been too uncomfortable to be picked up consciously by the listener in the “original” situation, may nevertheless be stored in the text and when read aloud in a containing group may surface again. It is not simply that material is restaged and with it newly situated affects are produced through a new context and audience, but that something of the original, encoded in the text, also travels. For Ogden this “something” might need the support of the group to be noticed, processed, and gradually enter into some form of symbolization. This insight informs clinical traditions of supervision and the recognition that we may need the help of others to think through unprocessed affect. It is an insight that helped us make sense of how and why our initial responses to the observational material differed from our subsequent encounters and has encouraged us to continue to work with our affective responses throughout the writing and editing process of producing this article.</p>
<p>It is an issue of heated debate within qualitative research communities whether and how these kinds of interpretative knowledges can be used outside the clinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411434283">Frosh &amp; Baraitser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411434283">Urwin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800411434283">Urwin &amp; Sternberg, 2011</xref>). Reflecting on this issue, we found inspiration in a special issue of <italic>Culture, Psychoanalysis and Society</italic> that profiles the work of Alfred Lorenzer and seeks to make his ideas about the <italic>scenic</italic> available to an English-speaking audience and the contemporary psychosocial field. For Lorenzer the scenic is an “autonomous level of meaning” through which as yet unsymbolized affect may find expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434283">Bereswill et al., 2010</xref>). His approach to cultural analysis assumes that scenic material can be encoded within and communicated by texts—transcripts of interviews, written descriptions, and highly constructed media texts such as literature or television programs. For Lorenzer, this depth hermeneutic approach is distinctly different from the analysis of unconscious phenomena that takes place in the clinic. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434283">Bereswill et al. (2010)</xref> formulate it,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If the function of clinical work is to identify what an individual patient finds difficult or troubling to symbolize, and to make a therapeutic response to this difficulty, the function of social research is to identify the specifically social factors present in failures of symbolization and to reflect on the consequences of these failures for social life. (p.224)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Lorenzerian approach draws explicitly on the clinical habits of active listening that we discussed earlier—“letting the text speak” rather than too quickly imposing an interpretation—allowing ourselves to be “provoked” by the text, and noticing and processing our affective responses. This is close to the process of reverie described by Ogden, but transformed from dialogue in the clinical setting to an interpretative panel of social researchers working on texts. In Lorenzer’s theory, the scenic elements in a text works affectively on the readers’ subjective experience and may result in a “scenic understanding” of that which has failed to achieve full symbolization. Thus, when Layton offers “scenic”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077800411434283">9</xref></sup> descriptions in the two episodes, she also makes it possible for herself later, and for subsequent secondary analysts, to reach a scenic understanding of what is going on and eventually symbolize this further.</p>
<p>The characterization of the scenic as both embedded in texts and as somehow seeking symbolization has affinities with the idea of affect being completed in discourse (Burkitt cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411434283">Wetherell, 2012</xref>). It also evokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800411434283">Ricoeur’s (1970/1991)</xref> discussion of the interruption between meaning and significance in texts (as opposed to speech, where they melt together in the moment of lived communication). Whereas the meaning of the text emerges from its internal structure, the significance relies on a reader who revokes the indecisiveness of the text and fulfills it in discourse, leading it back to the living communication.</p>
<p>Lorenzer is in accordance with Ogden in his view of the significance of working in a group for the process of transforming unsymbolized material. Much of the research inspired by Lorenzer relies on groups as a vehicle for the analysis of affective communications. Thinking about our own experiences of collective reading and analysis, we were intrigued by the possibility that affective material may have been embedded in the descriptions of the settings that is central to the two episodes and that was released into another level of analysis in the observer Layton’s published account. The idea of the scenic may help account for the way in which affects can travel through texts, “reprising” the scenic material of the original encounter ad infinitum in new moments of reading and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434283">Bereswill et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since, according to Lorenzer, the latent elements of scenes are collective in nature, most readers will be able to pick them up if they listen carefully enough, but may also react to them in different ways. In the special issue profiling the influence of Lorenzer’s ideas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411434283">Morgenroth (2010)</xref> observes that panel members often responded to scenic content with greater emotional intensity than the researcher did during original fieldwork (p. 277).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>During the interpretation process, the transcript evokes emotional reactions in the data interpretation panel, that, if handled with care, can be shown to be countertransferences, that is, responses to something present in the material and not simply reactions generated by the biographies of individual panel members. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411434283">Morgenroth, 2010</xref>, p. 278)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In such interpretation, configurations of feelings may arise between members that in some ways correspond to the configuration of the scenic content as it occurred in the original setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411434283">Bereswill et al., 2010</xref>, p. 239). Morgenroth provides an interesting example of how this might unfold. She describes two analysis groups that worked very differently with material from the same case study. The first group, according to her interpretation, “acted out” the difficult feelings provoked by the text they encountered; the second group managed to hold and work with the affective content of the same interviews. This account resonates strongly with our own analytic process—our initial tendency to “bounce off” the text was to some degree superseded by a greater ability to listen and think with the material—a dynamic that was restaged in the writing and editing of this article. Whereas our reaction to the first episode involved symbolizing difficult feelings of death and the unpredictable nature of things, our reaction to the second episode—which we already had defined as positive—partly left us with an acting out of the dilemma of separation: shifting between the mother’s and the baby’s perspective. Further work with this episode might have given us insight into the different interpretations of the group and what they revealed about feelings we were trying to avoid moving into symbolization.</p>

<title>Two Lessons for Qualitative Analysis</title>
<sec id="section7-1077800411434283">
<title>Questions About Context</title>
<p>In this article we have described a research process that involves exploring material collected for one purpose (the Becoming a Mother project) as part of another enterprise, the CAS project on Personal Development and Socio-Cultural Change. The epistemological and ethical challenges characteristic of “reuse” and secondary analysis have become features of our work. We have discovered something of the emotional texture of secondary analysis. How working from the text as our primary source orients us into a particular mode, tantalizingly close yet excluded from the original research encounters—giving rise to worries about loss of context, the “validity” of our interpretations, and the evidence behind them, as well as the ethics of locating the observer within our research gaze, rather than metaphorically standing with her and Azra, the mother, behind the door.</p>
<p>In terms of the debate on the archiving and reuse of empirical material, our discussion is relevant to a growing awareness that temporal processes in research can help reveal the emotional undercurrents that connect researchers, subjects, and the changing times and places of the analytic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411434283">McLeod &amp; Thomson, 2009</xref>). Writings by qualitative researchers who have revisited their own empirical material after the passage of time often highlight the emotional dimensions of interpretive work and the ways in which fieldwork continues after writing up the observations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411434283">Andrews, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411434283">Riessman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800411434283">Rosaldo, 1989</xref>). Drawing on an interdisciplinary analysis of archiving practices and debates, Geiger et al. (2010) suggest that the “archive” constitutes a productive space for thinking about the ephemeral nature of research encounters and the challenges of documenting the affects and aftermath of these “performances,” including ways in which they might be “restaged” through instances of secondary analysis and practices of archiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411434283">Cvetkovich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411434283">Freshwater, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077800411434283">Steedman, 2002</xref>). We hope that the potential for secondary analysis of qualitative material to engage with “reprisals” of traveling affects might be encouraged by the example of this article.</p>
<p>What might be the implications of understanding data not simply as travelling, but as connective—creating links along a temporally structured interpretive chain that connects a series of “Thens” with a sucession of “Nows”: Azra and Zamir, the observer Sandy, the original infant observation seminar group, the large CAS group, the small group writing the paper, the reader, or the audience that encounters the text. What are the implications of flow and direction on the analysis? How might we distinguish between the kind of work involved in <italic>putting the “Now”</italic> of the analysis group <italic>to work in the service of the “Then”</italic> that is captured in the observational notes, and an approach which might put the “Then” that is embodied in the material in the service of the “Now” of the analysis group and their associations? These are important questions for both psychosocial research and secondary analysis.</p>
<p>The psychosocial field may have further things to learn from issues central to the “data reuse” debate, such as ethical concerns about the potential for exploitation or misrepresentation of both the original researcher and the research subject through, for example, the partial or selective use of data. As the empirical material is redeployed for new purposes with unanticipated audiences, it is also ethically decontextualized, giving rise to concerns about questions of validity and boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800411434283">Possick, 2009</xref>). These concerns echo discussions of “wild analysis” in psychosocial studies as clinical methods are transposed into social science settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411434283">Clarke &amp; Hoggett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411434283">Frosh &amp; Baraitser, 2008</xref>). But, those who have commented on “reuse” have also identified potential gains, including an ethical dividend of depth and complexity since the passage of time does not simply decontextualize data but also recontextualizes it, providing new perspectives and opportunities for meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411434283">McLeod &amp; Thomson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411434283">Moore, 2007</xref>). As the archive ages, analysts gain some distance and freedom from the research questions and frames of the original investigator. These frames gradually become visible as characteristics of the material. In historical context, this might mean that the assumptions of the researchers, and the language of the respondents can be read as evidence of the historical and cultural moment, preserved, perhaps in part, in the scenic elements of the observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411434283">Evans &amp; Thane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800411434283">Savage, 2005</xref>). Yet as we have suggested in this article, each time research material are restaged, we also enter into an ongoing affective conversation with the original research encounter and successive moments of analysis.</p>

<title>Enhancing the Practices of Qualitative Research</title>
<p>Our exploration has relevance not only for psychosocial research and for debates about the “reuse” of data, but also for other qualitative research practices. As we proceeded with our inductive analysis of observation material, we recognized many affinities with the logics and practices of sociological and anthropological fieldwork or ethnography. We have learned a great deal from the theory and practice of infant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411434283">Urwin, 2007</xref>). This has included the temporal experience of slowing down, as our group read and processed the affective dimensions of observational notes that led us to reflect upon the speeded-up tempo of more conventional ways of doing qualitative research. Taking time to slow down at various intervals in the research process can enhance creativity and deepen insight into the worlds one is trying to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800411434283">Richardson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Being more attuned to the affective impact of meaning making can help observers attend to and record (in a disciplined way) telling detail in the contexts they are studying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077800411434283">10</xref></sup> Ethnographers talk about the thrill of “intuitive leaps,” when resonances emerge between incidents or processes that earlier seemed to be unrelated, or when one line of analysis begins to converge with another. Ogden’s discussion of “events that rhyme” or that “echo” one another—which acknowledges underlying affective connections—seems relevant to this process and has an affinity with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411434283">Emerson’s (2007)</xref> conceptualization of empirically rich “key incidents.” Key incidents may be intuitively grasped from a mass of observational material, with analytic implications that emerge through “a gradual clarification and unpacking of one dimension, then another, then another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411434283">Emerson, 2007</xref>, p. 439). These vivid passages may resemble the two episodes we flagged for closer analysis—loaded with situated affect and conveying emotional dimensions that extend much further than a particular incident.</p>
<p>Going back to reread original material can reanimate one’s lived experiences of the world one is seeking to understand, and reading someone else’s field notes in an affectively attuned way can also deepen one’s “feel” for that world. In addition, reading and processing data excerpts in a group can enrich analysis by bringing in multiple perspectives; groups can also help in discovering latent as well as manifest dimensions of data and in processing and digesting these over time. Lorenzer believed that the analysis of countertransference can be seen as “the crucial contribution of psychoanalysis to anthropology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411434283">Morgenroth, 2010</xref>, p. 279).</p>
<p>The insight that “seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees” condenses a paradox of perception and knowledge. If the observation notes describing Azra and her baby had been written in a more abstract, analyzing mode, we couldn’t have tuned into underlying affective registers and rhythms and deepened our own understanding of the originating events. Moving too quickly to labeling, categorizing, and analysis can obscure layers of meaning and block more nuanced understanding. Qualitative research practices are enriched by more explicit, self-aware attention to the affective dimensions of meaning making.</p>

<p>The concepts of affect and of emotion and the distinction between them, is a much debated and inconclusive issue (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411434283">Wetherell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411434283">Hemmings, 2005</xref>). In this article, we have chosen not to go into this debate, but rather allowed ourselves to use the two concepts to mark a rough distinction in the level of mental processing. Our reflections later in the article on the relation between scenic understanding and symbolization have similarities with this way of thinking.</p>

<p>In this article, we use the concept of “data” in the broad sense of qualitative empirical material, thus, the terms will be applied interchangeably.</p>

<p>The extent to which it is possible to restage the original “context” in which data is generated has become an important part of debates on the secondary analysis of qualitative data. Key contributions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411434283">Moore’s (2007)</xref> argument that the constant recontextualization of meaning is an inescapable aspect of empirical research, something that is recognized and embraced within the humanities yet which causes worry within the social sciences. An exception has been in the field of qualitative longitudinal research, where the temporal instability of the empirical and analytic project cannot be escaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411434283">Henderson, Holland, &amp; Thomson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411434283">McLeod &amp; Thomson, 2009</xref>). Interdisciplinary work on archives suggests that the social sciences have much to gain by engaging with ideas of how emotions are an integral part of archival research as well as the ways in which the affects embedded within archives might be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411434283">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>). We address some of these issues later in the article.</p>

<p>The CAS at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters is a basic research institution funded by the Norwegian government. Each year the centre hosts three projects which bring together researchers from around the world in Natural Sciences, Social Sciences/Law, and the Humanities. In the academic year of 2010/2011, AQ:Please approve the deletion of the number “21.”the social science project, Personal Development and Socio-Cultural Change, was initiated and directed by Hanne Haavind, professor of psychology and Harriet Bjerrum Nielsen, professor of gender studies, both at the University of Oslo. The researchers in this project, who stayed at CAS for periods between 8 weeks and 10 months, came from five different countries and from a variety of backgrounds, including social anthropology, sociology, psychology, gender studies, and literature studies.</p>

<p>Wendy Hollway and Cathy Urwin, two of the researchers behind the Becoming a Mother study, were among the nine researchers in residence at CAS during our session. We want to thank them and their colleagues for generously sharing their empirical material with us, for teaching us how to work with techniques from the infant observation tradition, and for commenting on the draft paper. We also want to express our appreciation to the observer, Sandy Layton, for the excellent material we have been able to draw on from her work.</p>

<p>In our discussion, we noted that accounts of infant observations constitute their own genre (more fully discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411434283">Urwin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411434283">Hollway, 2007</xref> and in press), with the task of digesting and reflecting on the series of observations with the support of a seminar group. This is facilitated through the identification of characteristic features, themes and developments over time, including what can be known through the relationship between the observer and observed.</p>

<p>Holding, for Winnicott, is an ontological concept that he uses to explore the specific qualities of the experience of being alive at different developmental stages as well as the changing intrapsychic-interpersonal means by which the sense of continuity of being is sustained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800411434283">Ogden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411434283">Winnicott, 1956</xref>).</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, we have attempted to use the term <italic>scenic</italic> only in the theoretical sense outlined by Lorenzer rather than the more prosaic sense of portraying a scene. However, we acknowledge important slippage between the two meanings since we identified passages of text that involve detailed descriptions of scenes as also communicating the “scenic,” as theorized by Lorenzer.</p>

<p>These dimensions have long been present in qualitative research even though the concept of affect has seldom been used. For example, at the outset of hands-on training in the “Chicago School” of fieldwork, Robert E. Park and Everett C. Hughes told their students to record “the sights and sounds” they encountered in an area of the city. The sensuous, immediate present of physical settings, as we have noted, conveys affective registers of various kinds. The writing of field notes has also become more self-conscious over the last few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411434283">Clifford &amp; Marcus, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411434283">Emerson, Fretz, &amp; Shaw, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411434283">Sanjek, 1990</xref>).</p>
