<p>Almost 100 years ago, Joseph Schumpeter wrote that the sociology of public finance could provide unique insight “into the laws of social being and becoming and into the driving forces of the fate of nations,” and described fiscal sociology as “a special field … of which much may be expected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">[1918] 1991</xref>: 101).</p>
<p>Why have those expectations gone unfulfilled? In <italic>Taxation, the State and Society</italic>, Marc Leroy offers a plausible answer. The same facts that make public finance uniquely important make it uniquely difficult for sociologists to study. Taxation is not a single policy domain, but instead a policy instrument that provides resources for every activity of the state, and therefore cuts across conventional academic specializations. Taxation touches virtually every area of economic and social life, and therefore has developed an extremely large and technical body of rules that is especially forbidding to non-specialists. And the implementation of tax policy is in the hands of powerful finance ministries that resist scrutiny.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, Leroy has done as much as anyone to overcome these barriers, publishing dozens of sociological studies of tax administration, tax evasion, fiscal federalism, tax competition, the intellectual origins of fiscal sociology, and much else besides.</p>
<p><italic>Taxation, the State and Society</italic> is an introductory overview of this impressive oeuvre in a new (and uneven) English translation. The premise of the book is that fiscal sociology is a science or “metadiscipline” with its own methods, its own theory, a large body of proven findings, and even a distinctive set of policy implications. The achievements of fiscal sociology are little known only because the literature is scattered among multiple social science disciplines and national schools of thought. The purpose of <italic>Taxation, State and Society</italic> is to pull these insights together and thereby to make the insights of fiscal sociology available to a greater audience.</p>
<p>The book therefore takes the form of an extended literature review. Leroy has read widely, and he ranges across disciplinary and linguistic barriers to pull together a huge swath of the literature that is available in European languages. The result is a bibliography that should be consulted by every specialist.</p>
<p>It is not, however, a picture of coherence. Chapters One, Two, and Three, for example, offer different and apparently incompatible intellectual genealogies that trace the origins of fiscal sociology variously from the early nineteenth-century writings of Tocqueville to the early twentieth-century writings of Goldscheid, Schumpeter, and Pareto, and to the sixteenth-century writings of Bodin. Chapters Five, Six, and Seven report three different theoretical syntheses, summarized in path diagrams that represent the “system of tax revenue” (p. 142), the “elemental factors of tax policy” (p. 202), and the “causal biases of fiscal public action” (p. 219). These diagrams include many of the same concepts but appear to describe different causal relationships among them. The book proliferates analytical schemes and conceptual taxonomies whose uses are sometimes unclear.</p>
<p>As a literature review, this book also errs in matters of detail. For example, in a footnote on the correlation between income and tax evasion, several of the studies cited in support of the null hypothesis are studies of public opinion that contain no evidence about tax evasion at all (p. 260, n. 13). Another example: the book argues repeatedly that Tocqueville deserves credit for discovering Wagner’s law, because Tocqueville was the first to write that “public expenditures invariably tend to increase when the people govern” (p. 32). Wagner’s law, however, says nothing about popular government—it holds that government spending as a share of the economy increases with economic development. A reader who does not already know the literature will find most of its highlights cited here, but that reader would be well advised to follow the citations to their original sources.</p>
<p>Despite these cautions, <italic>Taxation, the State and Society</italic> contributes some provocative and original arguments, of which I find three particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>The first is the argument that the legitimacy of taxation in democratic states depends on state intervention in the economy (pp. 273–5). Leroy argues that taxpayers have a capacity for rational altruism: they will contribute willingly if they believe that their contributions yield valuable public goods, and they are most likely to believe this if they have a say in how the money is spent. The surprising implication is that resistance to taxation may indicate that <italic>too little</italic> economic activity is subject to the control of democratic government, rather than too much; conversely, more government intervention, rather than less, may be necessary to overcome public resistance to taxation (pp. 364–7).</p>
<p>A second provocative argument is that structural crises, such as wars and depressions, do not contribute to the development of the tax state. This null hypothesis runs contrary to a great deal of published research on the evolution of tax systems. Leroy argues that the prevailing crisis theories are too deterministic. A “crisis” is a rhetorical strategy by which elites legitimate their tax strategies, rather than a structural given (p. 138).</p>
<p>A third argument is that an excessive emphasis on efficiency in tax administration may perversely undermine the political legitimacy of taxation. When revenue officials are evaluated exclusively on the revenue yield of their activities, they have an incentive to get more revenue by hook or by crook. In practice they may resort to informal bargaining, to the advantage of those wealthy taxpayers who have the most legal and political sophistication (pp. 249–50). Efforts to make tax administration more efficient may make it unfair and ultimately rob it of political support.</p>
<p>These arguments are not demonstrated findings of fiscal sociology. They are interesting hypotheses that are worth investigating further. What unites them is not a common basis in theory, but a common rhetorical and theoretical foil: they are directed against neoliberal public economics, with its vision of <italic>homo economicus</italic> as a self-regarding, well-informed, competitive individual who is averse to taxes except in a crisis and who is indifferent to the well-being of others.</p>
<p><italic>Taxation, the State and Society</italic> will not persuade many readers that fiscal sociology is a coherent and freestanding metadiscipline. This book ultimately provides more support for an alternative view of fiscal sociology as a kind of residual category, a shadow tradition that has provided a haven for all of the research programs that were purged from the science of public finance when neoliberal economists took over in the twentieth century.</p>
