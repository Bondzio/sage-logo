<p>The subtitle of this very provocative Dutch study is ‘The <italic>Wiedergutmachung</italic> for the damage Suriname and her population suffered under Dutch colonial rule’. Its main title, ‘Compensation’, is the ultimate goal the author had in mind when undertaking his research. As such this work has become a very polemical and political text. But at the same time the author has initiated a full-fledged attack on some of the most widely read Dutch historians (such as Emmer and Oostindie) who have written about the colonial era and its legacy. It is this contribution to an intense historiographical debate (mostly undertaken in Dutch) that will be of most interest to readers of this journal and academics in general. In essence, the author revisits the famous Williams Thesis about the long-term contributions of slavery to the economic development of Western Europe while positioning himself as something of an intellectual fellow-traveler of Immanuel Wallerstein’s world-system school. The latter, however, does not imply the book is theoretically oriented. It is instead a very rich and detailed compilation of empirical data, a collection of historical (mainly quantitative but also qualitative) sources, and intellectually stimulating interpretations. It is also an attempt to discuss the ‘deleted opinions’ (p. 122) about the status of Suriname as a colony and the degree to which contemporary Dutch historians have deliberately ignored evidence or scholars contradicting their statements about the overall limited economic contributions to the economic well-being of the Netherlands, a position which Zunder critiques at length throughout this study.</p>
<p>Especially in the light of the World Conference Against Racism in Durban in September 2001, and the statements made by then Dutch Minister Van Boxtel at that conference (reproduced on pp. 429–431, and considered by Zunder as an admission of guilt of the horrors of slavery which took place in the Dutch Caribbean), the author argues that a new and critical reinterpretation of colonial exploitation is warranted. Though a considerable portion of the book is devoted to documenting the Dutch slave trade, which continued until 1814, and interpreting profits made by the coercion of hundreds of thousands of enslaved people of African descent in the Dutch Caribbean, the author also analyzes in great detail the export of Surinamese raw materials such as sugar, coffee, cacao, wood, gold, balata, and bauxite to document the diversity of contributions the colony made to the Netherlands, and especially its financial center, Amsterdam. In addition, profits made from the mass migration of Javanese and Hindustani workers who moved to Suriname after the abolition of slavery in the Dutch empire in 1863 and their deplorable working conditions, are also discussed (pp. 247–264). There is also, quite appropriately, an interesting discussion of the enslavement of the native population (pp. 338–343) and how it too suffered under colonial rule. In sum, the total picture that Zunder provides is one in which during the period 1683–1940 the Surinamese colony was quite a profitable one, even taking into consideration the subsidies the Dutch authorities granted it.</p>
<p>But this volume is more than a scholarly attempt to rectify, through the use of archives and calculations, the economic picture that mainstream Dutch historiography has so far provided. It is also a challenge to a particular way of thinking, writing, and talking about the (post)colonial other in the Dutch classroom and the way Dutch history courses are taught about the country’s so-called ‘Golden Age’. It is too a call to acknowledge, at the very least, if not compensate for, decades of Dutch mismanagement of the colony (pp. 279–310).</p>
<p>The last part of the book (pp. 311–373) makes an extensive case for financial compensation to the Surinamese population, both those currently living in Suriname as well as those parts of the diaspora living in the Netherlands, the majority of whom, asserts Zunder, would prefer to live in their own country if possible. This is one of several very provocative statements (p. 323), which are unfortunately not backed up by any explanatory footnotes or references. The absence of the latter at several instances throughout this controversial study can be irritating for scholars who would like to know more about specific issues. At times the author also makes references that are not included in the bibliography, which in itself is limited since it does not list any publishing entities. Several tables throughout the volume have listed as sources ‘Diverse sources compiled by Zunder’, which of course makes verification quite difficult. Sometimes historical figures are mentioned but not fully explained (e.g. ‘Parma’ on page 64 is actually Alexander Farnese, the future duke of Parma). Some paragraphs on Colbertism and Dutch protectionism are a bit out of place and not sufficiently elaborated upon to be entirely satisfactory. There are also occasional errors such as when Zunder claims (p. 223) that Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands separated in 1839, when the Belgian Revolution actually dates from 1830. The lack of an index is also very inconvenient, to say the least.</p>
<p>The main goal of this polemical study remains, however, compensation. Zunder does a great job undercutting those who would dismiss these arguments out of hand by citing plenty of precedents. Not only does the <italic>Wiedergutmachung</italic> of the German and Austrian governments in the aftermath of the Holocaust serve as an example. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Canadian and American governments also provided financial compensation to minorities wronged by years of internment during the Second World War. As recently as the year 2000, Dutch Prime Minister Kok was still addressing the Japanese government about its policies in the Dutch East Indies in the 1940s, after the Dutch government had obtained war reparations from Germany. In 2001, the Haitian government requested financial compensation from France for its actions. For Zunder, it is only normal that the Surinamese government should do the same and this study might facilitate a step in that direction. After all the Dutch government, in abolishing slavery, did provide financial compensation to the owners of plantations in Suriname and on the Dutch islands that remain under Dutch control until this very day. Along the same lines, argues Zunder, why not compensate the descendants of the real victims? And Dutch ‘developmental aid’ granted to independent Suriname after 1975 has only constituted a fraction of the total amount that the Dutch obtained over centuries of colonial rule (p. 144). Is it possible that racism prevents any further political discussion of this matter? Or is the lack of political clout of the descendants of the enslaved, as compared with the Jewish community’s suing of Swiss banks (pp. 374–376), part of the answer?</p>
<p>In conclusion, Zunder’s book is much more than a traditional historical study. It is a sociological intervention, a call to action, an introduction to ethical dilemmas and an invitation to more rigorous methodological research regarding the ongoing legacy of slavery all at once. Ironically, the National Institute for the Study of Dutch Slavery and Its Legacy (NiNsee) in Amsterdam, (with whom Zunder sympathizes (p. 323)), and which has played a crucial role in the Surinamese community in memorializing and shedding light on the legacy of slavery, has had to close in the summer of 2012 due to budget cuts imposed by a conservative Dutch government. The yearly commemoration of the abolition of slavery in Amsterdam’s Oosterpark, which is inextricably linked to NiNsee, is therefore likely to become an empty gesture. Zunder hopes that his study will have a major impact in getting beyond empty gestures and enable all to discuss openly and urgently the various ways in which wealthy western societies such as the Netherlands have a moral obligation to compensate countries they colonized and exploited for centuries. These are only some of the first opening shots that can be expected to continue for a considerable time in many postcolonial societies. This volume therefore deserves to be taken seriously and debated beyond the more narrow academic disciplines it may originally appeal to given its historical focus.</p>
