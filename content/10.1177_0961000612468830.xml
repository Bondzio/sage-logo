<p>Khumbar’s Library Classification Trends in the 21st Century is one of the Chandos Information Professional series. The stated aim of the series is to ‘provide the reader with an authoritative view of current thinking’ and the focus is on providing practical coverage of topics of interest to LIS professionals. In this context, Kumbhar’s book succeeds in drawing attention to topics of current interest, but what is more questionable is whether the book does so in a way that adds critical or insightful value to the topics in question and, if it does not, whether this form is the most effective one to actualise the aim of the book. At stake here is the purpose of the book series, and the relationship between purpose, content and form. What does it mean to provide ‘an authoritative view’ if the book is light on critical analysis?</p>
<p>Khumbar explains the method undertaken to compile this review in the preface. It is ‘based on the abstracts published in LISA’ (p. 8). The reviews presented in this book ‘are based on abstracts of publications in English as well as other languages’ (p. 8). It is the focus on abstracts that concerns me about this book, which certainly reads as if a considerable amount of it is based on abstracts rather than any critical examination of the full-text of articles. The book is described as ‘a useful research and reference tool for librarians and other information professionals’ (p. xi), but if that is its purpose, then I am not sure that it is organised to maximise its potential as a reference tool. It seems to me to be a book best described with reference to what it is not: it is not a textbook aimed at students, it is not an in-depth monograph, and it is not an annotated bibliography, which might have been a better choice of form for purpose.</p>
<p>The book is organised into 10 chapters. The first chapter discusses articles that deal with knowledge organisation (KO) and knowledge organisation systems. The lack of critical analysis makes itself felt from the very first page in the chapter when we are presented with a stark definition: ‘Knowledge is the sum total of ideas, beliefs and experiences conserved by the society (Satija, 2008)’ (p. 1). This is certainly a workable definition, but not necessarily the only definition; however, there is no room in this book for a wider debate. The chapter takes us from some quite basic concepts very quickly to taxonomies and topic maps. It is difficult to gauge the intended audience. The conceptual leap would be difficult for a novice to make, yet it is highly likely that the elementary information is not needed by the kind of information professionals who would be interested in the book. Chapter 2 deals with classification in the digital era with reference to the semantic web context. I wonder whether it might have been easier to follow the book if the digital semantic web information had been dealt with later on, after discussions about more conventional aspects of bibliographic classification.</p>
<p>Conventional bibliographic classification is dealt with in Chapters 3–5. Chapter 3 deals with the construction of classification schemes, and in keeping with this subject, some of the specific topics covered are highly technical and highly specialised. There are references to the technical language of Ranganathan and to modern uses of facet analysis in web information organisation. Chapter 4 deals with the literature published on general classification schemes. The arrangement of the book is such that we move from the specialised terminology of facet analysis in Chapter 3, p. 37, to a much more basic introduction to DDC in Chapter 4, p. 39. Chapter 5 covers DDC, its uses in digital and non-digital environments and its revision; Colon classification and its terminology; UDC and its revision; LC, BC and, strangely enough, Brown, because it is mentioned in a theoretical article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612468830">Beghtol (2004)</xref>. There is a statement about main class order: ‘The order of main classes of knowledge mapping, Satija says, is based on different principles such as those given by D. W. Langridge’ (p. 51). I take it that the reference here is to DW Langridge’s <italic>Subject Analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000612468830">1989</xref>), which is one of the books in the LIS canon that I most admire. The sentence really needs to be unpacked as the reference to Langridge is opaque and positively unhelpful.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 deals with special classification schemes, including schemes for comics and fiction, music, patents and records management. The second part of the chapter deals with non-bibliographic classification. Chapter 6 covers automatic book classification, reclassification and non-classificatory approaches to KO. The literature covered includes a number of case studies. Chapter 7, which is quite short, deals with classification education. Chapter 8 deals with taxonomies, ontologies and interoperability while Chapter 9 deals with text categorisation and is full of highly technical content, dealing with the tools, models, methods and algorithms used in text categorisation. The writing in this chapter is more fluent and sections are longer. As a reader, it seems as if this is the real focus of interest for this author. The final chapter is very short and deals with theories, research trends and personalities.</p>
<p>There is an excellent reference list in this book, as one might expect given its genesis and its purpose. Overall, it is a bit of a curate’s egg. It certainly covers a great deal of material and in Chapters 8 and 9, it provides some very useful discussion. Some of the earlier chapters are less helpful. The writing of these is not always of the highest standard, and the structure of some of the earlier chapters is bitty and disjointed. I think that there is another book in here. If only the author had focused more on the subject content of Chapters 8 and 9, and expanded these topics, perhaps dealing with them in greater detail and providing a critical overview, and edited down the material in the other chapters to provide a contextual rather than a comprehensive coverage, then there might be a very good book in this, and one that would still have fulfilled the original aims.</p>
