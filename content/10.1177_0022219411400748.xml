<p>What are the longitudinal cognitive profiles of Hong Kong Chinese children with specific reading difficulties in Chinese only, in English only, or both? A total of 16 poor readers each of Chinese (PC) and English (PE) and 8 poor readers of both orthographies (PB) were compared to a control sample (C) of 16 children; all were drawn from a statistically representative sample of 154 Hong Kong Chinese children tested at ages 5 to 9 years. PE and PB children’s mothers had lower education levels than did the other groups. With children’s ages and mothers’ education levels statistically controlled, the PE, PC, and PB groups were significantly lower than the C group on phonological awareness. The PB and PE groups also scored significantly lower than the others on English vocabulary across years, whereas the PC and PB groups were significantly poorer than the C and PE groups on morphological awareness across years. Finally, the PB group was significantly slower than the other groups on speed naming at every age tested, underscoring the potential importance of automaticity in reading across orthographies. Findings highlight the need to consider the issue of how to identify reading difficulties in a second language.</p>

<p>Although several research studies have demonstrated some overlap in children’s performances on reading tasks across two languages, often referred to as “transfer” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400748">Chung &amp; Ho, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400748">Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411400748">Deacon, Wade-Woolley, &amp; Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411400748">Gottardo, Yan, Siegel, &amp; Wade-Woolley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400748">Ho &amp; Fong, 2005</xref>), few, if any, have tackled the notion of specific reading difficulty in an orthography being learned as a second language. Specific reading disability is variously defined, but definitions tend to share the concept that those in the predetermined lowest percentiles on one or more reading tasks can be considered reading disabled (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400748">Ferrer, Shaywitz, Holahan, Marchione, &amp; Shaywitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400748">Francis et al., 2005</xref>). Because second language reading mastery likely includes skills that are somewhat different from those required for first language word recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400748">Geva, Yaghoub-Zadeh, &amp; Schuster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411400748">Lesaux &amp; Siegel, 2003</xref>), the concept of specific reading difficulty in a second orthography may be controversial. At the same time, however, from a practical point of view, in some societies, parents, teachers, and clinicians typically do target those lowest in second language reading as at particular risk for learning problems. In Hong Kong, the location of the present study, for example, although Chinese is the first language, learning via the written English medium is essential for higher level primary and secondary school achievement. Reading difficulties in English can spell disaster for Hong Kong Chinese children’s learning.</p>
<p>Overall, reading difficulties in English are sometimes assumed to be the result of reading difficulties in Chinese in Hong Kong. For example, in many Hong Kong schools, children diagnosed as dyslexic in Chinese are automatically given remedial classes in English as well because it is assumed that reading difficulties in Chinese are associated with similar difficulties in English. At the same time, anecdotal evidence from some of the primary school teachers we have met suggests that this is not always the case. For example, several teachers have noticed that Hong Kong Chinese children who are routinely exposed to English because their parents sometimes speak it at home or because they have a helper (i.e., maid) at home who speaks English tend to perform relatively well in English even when they are dyslexic in Chinese.</p>
<p>Importantly, some (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411400748">Siok, Niu, Jin, Perfetti, &amp; Tan, 2008</xref>) have suggested that the neurological bases of Chinese dyslexics and English dyslexics may be different. Chinese learning tends to involve multiple connections between meaning and print, and it is quite unreliable in terms of phonological cues as compared to word recognition in English, which is most efficiently acquired by making use of the alphabetic principle. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400748">Ho, Chan, Tsang, Lee, &amp; Luan, 2004</xref>) have found that the central cognitive correlates of developmental dyslexia in Chinese tend to be somewhat different from those typically demonstrated for English. For example, in both older and younger children, researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Lam, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411400748">Shu, McBride-Chang, Wu, &amp; Liu, 2006</xref>) have focused on morphological awareness as a particularly salient feature of dyslexia in Chinese. Given these suggestions of some possible differences in the underpinnings of reading difficulties in Chinese and in English, it is possible that there may be some children who have difficulties in either Chinese or English but not necessarily both. Understanding the early predictors of reading difficulty in English as a second orthography as compared to Chinese as a first orthography was the focus of the present study.</p>
<p>Although few studies have systematically examined reading difficulties in a first and a second orthography, there are hints that it is possible to have a reading deficit in one orthography and not another one. For example, in one case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411400748">Wydell &amp; Butterworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400748">Wydell &amp; Kondo, 2003</xref>), an adolescent bilingual was dyslexic in English but not in Japanese. A study of Japanese children also demonstrated differences in the rates of reading disability (defined in that work as falling 1.5 standard deviations below the mean) across Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji, all representing oral Japanese in different Japanese scripts, in the same children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400748">Uno, Wydell, Haruhara, Kaneko, &amp; Shinya, 2009</xref>). Thus, it seems possible for reading disability to differ across orthographies. Theoretically, it is possible that certain scripts such as Chinese or Kanji in Japanese demand greater use of visual-orthographic and semantic connections and less of a focus on phonological representations than do alphabetic scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400748">Ho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411400748">Siok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411400748">Wydell &amp; Butterworth, 1999</xref>). If this is the case, it may be possible to find children with relative strengths in visual-orthographic or semantic connection making but weaknesses in phonological processing or vice versa. Children with these different profiles might require different teaching and training focuses in learning to read different scripts. At the same time, however, few, if any, have tackled the issue of whether reading disability might be distinguishable in a first and second orthography representing different languages, let alone different scripts representing different languages or cognitive-linguistic correlates of these.</p>
<p>Thus, one central focus of the present study was the correlates of reading disability in Chinese versus English and in those with reading difficulties in both orthographies as compared to those with reading difficulties in only one of these. We looked retrospectively at some basic metalinguistic skills in children across 3 to 4 years to trace patterns of differences for these groups of children who manifested reading difficulties around the ages of 8 and 9 years old. Because children in Hong Kong typically receive formal literacy instruction in both Chinese and English from the age of 4 or so onward, we reasoned that those who were stably low in reading either or both of these orthographies by the ages of 8 and 9 could be designated as poor readers.</p>
<p>One critical skill in learning to read across orthographies, especially in young children, is phonological awareness. For example, phonological awareness is important for learning to read a variety of alphabetic languages, including Finnish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411400748">Puolakanaho et al., 2008</xref>), Arabic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411400748">Mannai &amp; Everatt, 2005</xref>), and Latvian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411400748">Sprugevica &amp; Hoien, 2003</xref>), as well as English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411400748">Bus &amp; van Ijzendoorn, 1999</xref>). Phonological awareness skills are also important for Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411400748">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411400748">Shu, Peng, &amp; McBride-Chang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400748">Siok &amp; Fletcher, 2001</xref>). Because phonological awareness is likely the foundation for reading across languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411400748">Perfetti, Zhang, &amp; Berent, 1992</xref>), we hypothesized that poor phonological awareness might be associated with reading difficulties in both Chinese as a first orthography and English as a second orthography, as found previously for children diagnosed as dyslexic in Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400748">Chung &amp; Ho, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, morphological awareness in the form of lexical compounding appears to be particularly important for learning to read Chinese. Here, the term <italic>morphological awareness</italic> is defined as the awareness of morphemes, or the smallest units of meaning within a language, in words composed of two or more morphemes. In Chinese, one major focus of morphological awareness is that of lexical compounding, or the ability to form compound words, such as <italic>snowman, birdseed</italic>, or <italic>flowerpot</italic>, from two or more individual morphemes, for example, <italic>snow</italic> and <italic>man</italic>. Lexical compounding in a first language (L1) has been examined in relation to word reading for English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang et al., 2005</xref>) and Dutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411400748">Rispens, McBride-Chang, &amp; Reitsma, 2008</xref>), but such compounding was not uniquely associated with reading variability. However, lexical compounding is clearly associated with reading development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Shu, Zhou, Wat, &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400748">Tong, McBride-Chang, Shu, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>) and impairment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400748">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Lam, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411400748">Shu et al., 2006</xref>) in Chinese children. In a study on bilingual first graders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400748">Wang, Yang, &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>), although lexical compounding in both Chinese and English explained reading in Chinese, such compounding failed to predict reading in English, underscoring the relative importance of lexical compounding for Chinese but not English. Given this previous research, we expected to find that morphological awareness in the form of lexical compounding would be more strongly associated with reading difficulties in Chinese than in English in the present study.</p>
<p>Both phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411400748">Bowey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411400748">Gathercole, Service, Hitch, Adams, &amp; Martin, 1999</xref>) and morphological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Tardif, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400748">Nagy, Berninger, &amp; Abbott, 2006</xref>) tend to be associated with vocabulary knowledge. Moreover, children’s vocabulary knowledge also tends to be significantly associated with their reading performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411400748">Anderson &amp; Nagy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411400748">Baumann &amp; Kame’enui, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411400748">Nagy, 1988</xref>). We, therefore, expected that children who were poor in reading skill in either Chinese or English would, correspondingly, show difficulties in vocabulary knowledge in the language representing that orthography. We hypothesized that this difficulty would be particularly marked in English, a second language (L2) for these children. Poor understanding of the meanings of English words might be either a cause or an effect in relation to poor English word reading, but limited literacy proficiency in English was anticipated to reflect poor knowledge of English overall in this sample (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411400748">Hudson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A final variable we included in the present study over time was rapid automatized naming (RAN). RAN has been linked to reading development and impairment both in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411400748">Berninger, Abbott, Thomson, &amp; Raskind, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411400748">Manis, Seidenberg, &amp; Doi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411400748">Swanson, Trainin, Necoechea, &amp; Hammill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400748">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>) and in Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411400748">Ding, Richman, Yang, &amp; Guo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400748">Ho, Chan, Tsang, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411400748">Ho &amp; Lai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411400748">Liao, Georgiou, &amp; Parrila, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411400748">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400748">Tong et al., 2009</xref>). RAN was reported as an important indicator of dyslexia by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411400748">Denckla and Rudel (1976)</xref>, and Bowers and Wolf extended this work, underscoring the importance of RAN specifically and fluency more generally, for reading acquisition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411400748">Bowers &amp; Newby-Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400748">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400748">Wolf &amp; Katzir-Cohen, 2001</xref>). Previous studies on bilinguals have also shown that RAN was predictive of reading in both languages among English–French bilinguals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400748">Comeau et al., 1999</xref>) and Chinese–English bilinguals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400748">Chung &amp; Ho, 2010</xref>). Therefore, a deficit in RAN was expected in poor readers across orthographies.</p>
<p>To summarize, we examined cognitive-linguistic correlates of Hong Kong Chinese children with reading difficulties, defined as having scored in the bottom 25% of all children from a representative sample of the city across 2 consecutive years. We further divided these reading disabled children into those who had this reading difficulty in Chinese only, in English only, or in both Chinese and English. These three groups of children were then compared to a control group. Our goal was to test for the extent to which these different groups had manifested similar versus different cognitive-linguistic difficulties across the ages of 5 to 9 years old. Establishing these children’s patterns in phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and RAN, all consistently administered in Chinese only, as well as word recognition and vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English over time, might offer some clues as to how similar or different reading difficulties are from early on in development across these two orthographies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0022219411400748">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were children who had taken part in a longitudinal study beginning from ages 9 to 16 months. The sample was originally recruited from Maternal and Child Health centers located in different districts in Hong Kong. They were originally selected to be statistically representative of all of Hong Kong. The participants from which the selected groups were identified consisted of 154 children (63 boys and 91 girls). The mean age of the children in the final testing phase was 9.14 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.29). In Hong Kong, children begin learning English in the first year of kindergarten at age 3. English classes typically occur daily in school. However, children’s parents’ knowledge of English is quite variable, given a relative lack of support for use of English in daily life in Hong Kong (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400748">Chow, McBride-Chang, &amp; Cheung, 2010</xref>). Those parents with higher levels of education tend to be those whose levels of English knowledge are higher and better supported; correspondingly, these parents tend to be wealthier as well (e.g., Cheung &amp; Ng, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400748">Chow et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>From this complete sample, we selected children who were poor readers in Chinese, English, or both. Our criteria for selecting “poor readers” were (a) scoring in the lowest 25% of all participants on the respective word reading test (b) consistently across the 2 most recent years of testing. We selected the lowest 25% as a cutoff point because it has been used in previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400748">Francis et al., 2005</xref>) and because it seemed reasonably liberal given our sample size. There were 16 children in the poor Chinese group, 16 in the poor English group, and 8 in the poor in both orthographies group who qualified given these criteria. The control group consisted of those 16 randomly selected from a larger group of 74 who consistently scored at or above the 26th percentile on our word reading test over 2 years. Note that this method of selection ensured that the control group of children consisted of those who had a fairly wide range in word reading skills, though none were “low.” The rest of the sample was not included in the analyses. Hence, the following four groups were examined in subsequent analyses: (a) children who were poor in word recognition in Chinese but normal in English reading (called PC, for “poor in Chinese”), (b) children who were poor in English word recognition but normal in Chinese reading (called PE, for “poor in English”), (c) children who were poor in reading in both orthographies (called PB, for “poor in both”), and (d) a random control group (called C, for “control”). The mean ages in years of the groups were 8.95 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.25), 9.15 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.29), 9.29 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.24), and 9.15 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.21) for the PC, PE, PB, and C groups, respectively.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Although our measure of nonverbal reasoning was administered at age 4 only, all other measures described below were administered from age 5 onward. All, except the phonological awareness and RAN measures, which were tested through age 8 only, were tested through age 9 (ages of administration for every measure are indicated across all tables). Vocabulary knowledge was consistently an expressive measure for Chinese and a receptive measure for English, primarily for practical reasons: Expressive vocabulary measures tend to distinguish performances of Hong Kong Chinese children better than do receptive ones in the L1; receptive language skills are easier to tap than are expressive skills in English in these children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Cheung, Chow, Chow, &amp; Choi, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Raven’s Progressive Matrices</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411400748">Raven, Court, &amp; Raven, 1995</xref>) included 24 colorful pictures with a portion missing, and the children’s task was to choose a correct portion out of the six portions given. Raw, rather than standardized, scores are presented for this measure.</p>

<title>Chinese word reading</title>
<p>At age 5, this test consisted of 61 items of word reading (with both single- and two-character words), in addition to our standard test used from age 6 onward (described below), so means on this test for this age appear to be higher than those at age 6 because this test was easier than the one used subsequently. From age 6 onward, the 61-item word reading test was no longer administered because it was too easy for the children. The test consistently administered across all ages was the Chinese word reading test obtained from the <italic>Hong Kong Test of Specific Learning Difficulties in Reading and Writing</italic> (HKT-SpLD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400748">Ho, Chan, Tsang, &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>). This test consists of a list of 150 Chinese two-character words. Children were asked to read each of the words aloud. One mark was given for each correctly pronounced word. The test was terminated when the child scored 0 in 15 consecutive items. The split-half reliability of the test, as mentioned in the HKT-SpLD manual, is greater than .90.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022219411400748">
<title>English word reading</title>
<p>Different tests of English word reading were used across ages, which is why means on these tests appear to decline over time from age 5 to age 6. Actually, the test at age 6 was just more difficult than at age 5. A list of 40 English words was used to test children’s English reading ability at age 5. The words were obtained from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang &amp; Kail, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang &amp; Treiman, 2003</xref>). At age 6, this word reading test was changed to include more difficult words, based primarily on items from primary school English textbooks in Hong Kong. This test was consistently administered across all subsequent ages tested, but at age 9, 20 more difficult items were added to the test. Across testing times, children were asked to read the words aloud, and each correctly pronounced word was awarded 1 point. The test stopped when the child scored four consecutive 0s.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022219411400748">
<title>Chinese vocabulary knowledge</title>
<p>As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Tardif, et al. (2008)</xref>, vocabulary knowledge in Chinese is easier to measure for native speakers using an expressive as compared to a receptive test for older children in part because many common Chinese vocabulary items are relatively semantically transparent, leading to early ceiling effects on some traditional receptive measures. Thus, we tested expressive vocabulary only across age in the present study to maximize variability on this task. In this expressive vocabulary test, modeled after the <italic>Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale</italic> Vocabulary subtest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400748">Thorndike, Hagen, &amp; Sattler, 1986</xref>), children were asked to give definitions of the Chinese words orally presented by the experimenter. Depending on the precision of each definition, the score for each item ranged from 0 to 2. There was a total of 52 words in the list, resulting in a total score of 104.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022219411400748">
<title>English vocabulary knowledge</title>
<p>The <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</italic> was used to test children’s English vocabulary knowledge. It had been used in a previous study on Hong Kong children, with a reliability greater than .90 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang et al., 2006</xref>). It was important to test receptive, rather than expressive, vocabulary knowledge in English because of some limitations on Chinese children’s early English knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400748">Chow et al., 2010</xref>). During the test, the experimenter orally presented an English word, together with four pictures, to each child individually. The child was then asked to choose the picture that best matched the meaning of the word presented. The first 144 out of the 204 items were used, with 12 items per level. The test was terminated when the child made more than seven mistakes within a single level. Only raw scores were used for analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022219411400748">
<title>Morphological awareness</title>
<p>In the morphological awareness task, children were asked to combine morphemes in new ways to produce novel words. All of this was done orally. For example, children were told that when the sun rises, we call that a sunrise (日出), and were further asked to come up with a new word to express the idea of the moon rising (the correct answer should be 月出, moonrise). Versions of this task have been used in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Lam, et al., 2008</xref>). This test was modified across years to increase the numbers of items on it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022219411400748">
<title>Phonological awareness</title>
<p>Phonological awareness was accessed with two skills, namely syllable deletion and initial phoneme deletion. The syllable deletion task included items of three-syllable words or nonwords; children were asked to delete one of the identified syllables. The initial phoneme deletion task employed the same principle, but the items were syllables and the children were asked to delete the initial phonemes. These items were combined across time points and implemented in a basal-ceiling format (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Tong, et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022219411400748">
<title>Rapid number naming</title>
<p>We tested RAN for numbers, rather than colors or other measures, because RAN for numbers tends to be a particularly strong correlate of literacy development in Chinese children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411400748">Liao et al., 2008</xref>). In this task, the children were presented with a sheet of a 5 × 5 array of 5 digits in random order. Their task was to name the digits as quickly as possible, and the experimenter measured each naming time with a stopwatch. Two trials were given, and the average time used across trials was the recorded naming speed used for subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022219411400748">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Experimenters contacted the participants every summer across years of testing to obtain their consent for testing as well as to arrange a suitable testing time. Trained psychology majors then traveled to the children’s homes for testing. Since the testing involved slightly different materials in different years, the time taken for this testing varied from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. Breaks were given when necessary. Supermarket coupons were given after the testing as an expression of gratitude for participation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The means, standard deviations, and reliabilities of all tasks across different years are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411400748">Table 1</xref>. All the measures had reliabilities above .70 across years except for the <italic>Raven’s Progressive Matrices</italic> measure. The range of mothers’ education levels for the PC group was 3 to 6. The C group’s range was 2 to 7. For the PE and PB groups, however, the range was 2 to 4 and 2 to 3, respectively. These ranges clearly indicated some differences in educational backgrounds. Therefore, separate ANOVAs were carried out to investigate whether there were group differences in demographic and background information in the children. The PC group was significantly younger than the other three groups, and the PE and PB groups had mothers with significantly lower levels of education than did the other two groups. Therefore, these two variables, that is, child’s age and mother’s education level, were statistically controlled in subsequent analyses focused on differences across the four groups and ages. Our approach was first to examine overall group differences in repeated measures analyses where we focused on only between-group differences. The rationale for this approach was that the repeated measures analyses took into account repeated testing, though we were primarily interested in group differences rather than age-related changes. (Age-related changes were more difficult to explore given changes in some tests across years.) We then moved onto individual ANCOVA analyses for each year of testing separately.</p>

<p>Repeated measures analyses indicated that group differences existed for every task. The results of the Chinese and English word recognition tasks were relatively straightforward. Those selected as controls or manifesting difficulties in Chinese but not English (PC) scored significantly higher than those with reading difficulties in English. For Chinese word reading, those who were poor in reading only English but not Chinese (PE) and those in the C group were, not surprisingly, the highest scorers. However, PC students, though poorer than the PE and C groups on Chinese, were significantly better in Chinese than the PB group. In general, individual ANCOVAs by year reflected a similar pattern.</p>
<p>Vocabulary knowledge in Chinese and English distinguished across the four groups less strongly. Overall, the PC and C groups outscored the PE and PB groups fairly consistently in terms of English vocabulary knowledge, as reflected by both repeated measures and individual ANCOVA analyses. At the same time, though there were some differences in Chinese vocabulary knowledge across groups in the expected direction (i.e., those who were poor in Chinese, either PC or PB, sometimes scored lower in Chinese vocabulary knowledge), these trends were not very stable.</p>
<p>On the phonological awareness measure, all three groups with any reading difficulty (PC, PE, and PB) scored significantly lower than the C group on the repeated measures analysis. For the individual ANCOVA analyses, the trend was similar, though the groups appeared to differ more strongly on this task in the last 2 years of analyses but showed no differences initially (at ages 5 and 6 years).</p>
<p>One relatively clear trend related to the morphological awareness task was that the two groups with difficulties in reading Chinese (PC, PB) tended to score lower on this task relative to the other two groups. This pattern held across both the overall repeated measures and individual ANCOVA analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, a clear pattern for the RAN measure emerged as well. That is, across both the repeated measures and ANCOVA analyses for all years tested, those children who were poor in both Chinese and English (PB) were significantly slower on the speed naming task than any of the other three groups, which did not differ from one another. The descriptive and statistical analyses results on all measures are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022219411400748">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The focus of the present study was on characteristics of children showing different patterns of reading in Chinese and English. Although there is no such concept of dyslexia per se in an L2, we were interested in the extent to which similar or different patterns of cognitive and metalinguistic skills would emerge for specific reading difficulties in Chinese, English, or both. At least three trends emerged from these data, apart from the expected finding that phonological awareness was relatively lower across all three poor reader groups as compared to the controls. First, those with reading difficulties in English were relatively poor in both word recognition and vocabulary and came from homes with mothers of relatively lower education levels overall. Second, those with poor Chinese word reading had significantly lower morphological awareness than did the other groups. Third, speeded naming was significantly slower in those with reading difficulties in both orthographies relative to any of the other groups.</p>
<p>One issue in comparing these orthographies at the outset is the question of environment for L2 learning. In the present study, our “proxy” for environment was mothers’ education levels. It is clear from these data that those who are poor in English word recognition from this sample seemed to have grown up with mothers with less education than those from other groups without English difficulties, including those who were specifically poor in Chinese reading. For example, although about 30% of the mothers in the C group had an education level at the college graduate level or above, none of the mothers in the poor English reading groups had experienced university education. This finding highlights the fact that L2 learning is multidimensional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411400748">Hudson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411400748">Lesaux &amp; Siegel, 2003</xref>). These problems were also linked to significantly lower scores in vocabulary knowledge in English. In general, those with relatively poor reading skills in English tended to have home backgrounds that may have been less conducive to or supportive of learning the L2 as well as somewhat lower phonological awareness skills than controls (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400748">Chow et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that, at least in the Hong Kong context, in which English skills learning tends to be associated with higher status and education in the general public (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411400748">Cheung &amp; Ng, 2003</xref>), poor English reading skills themselves may be primarily attributable to reduced opportunities to learn relative to other groups.</p>
<p>In contrast, children with specific difficulties in learning to read Chinese only were consistently and significantly lower than the other groups overall in morphological awareness. This finding highlights the fact that morphological awareness in the form of lexical compounding is linked to reading acquisition of Chinese as shown in some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400748">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), including one demonstrating that those children at risk for reading difficulties in Chinese were relatively low in morphological awareness even in kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang, Lam, et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, these children also showed difficulties in phonological awareness, similar to those manifested in the other two disabled groups. Thus, although the morphological awareness measure best distinguished children with reading difficulties in Chinese across years, the phonological awareness of these children, in addition to those with poor reading in English, was also low, as found in previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400748">Chung &amp; Ho, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most novel finding from the present study was the fact that the group that was poor in both Chinese and English word recognition was significantly slower on the RAN tasks across all years, as compared to all three other groups. Previous research has linked slow RAN to poor reading in both alphabetic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411400748">Manis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400748">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>) and Chinese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400748">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400748">Tong et al., 2009</xref>) orthographies as well as across different alphabetic orthographies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400748">Comeau et al., 1999</xref>) and across English and Chinese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400748">Chung &amp; Ho, 2010</xref>). There seemed to be some suggestive trend for those who were either PC only or PE only to be a bit slower on the RAN tasks across most years than were the C participants. Nevertheless, these differences were not significant in the present study. At the same time, it is clear that those with “global” reading difficulties were slower than all other groups. The strength of this association suggests some automaticity difficulties in reading disabled children. This idea has been put forward before (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411400748">Wong &amp; Ho, in press</xref>). However, ours may be among the first studies to underscore the depth of this difficulty because we have demonstrated that this slowness is relatively stronger in those who are poor readers in both English and Chinese. Perhaps this finding suggests that RAN might be a particularly useful clinical marker of reading difficulties for Chinese children learning to read either Chinese or English.</p>
<p>The primary limitation of the present study is that of sample size. In each group of children, the sample was small and thus subject to potential difficulties in interpretation. For example, as noted above, although we did not find that the children who were PC or PE only were significantly slower than the C group on RAN, there seemed to be some trend toward a slower performance in each of these disabled groups. With a larger sample size, we likely would have found a significant difference between the control and impaired readers on this variable. At the same time, ours was a longitudinal study, and our criteria for selection of poor readers required persistent poor word reading (i.e., over 2 years). Given this relatively strict selection, the sample was ultimately small. On the other hand, a strength of our sample was that the children were originally selected to be statistically representative of all of Hong Kong. Therefore, we were relatively confident in identifying those who were poor in reading in either Chinese or English. This is in contrast to most studies, particularly of L2 reading, for which samples typically emerge from a single or a few schools only. These schools are likely to have readers who are skewed in ways that a representative sample from across the whole of Hong Kong such as ours is not. This sampling allowed us confidence in designating poor readers, even in an L2.</p>
<p>A second limitation of the present study was the fact that we measured metalinguistic skills only in the L1 in the present study. Thus, any notions about deficits in phonological awareness, morphological awareness, or RAN come from the native language only. In previous work in Hong Kong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411400748">McBride-Chang and Ho (2005)</xref> found that phonological awareness and RAN tasks in Chinese were, practically speaking, stronger indicators of reading variation in both Chinese and English in young Chinese children than were English versions of these tasks. However, the extent to which we might expect similarities in findings for morphological awareness is unclear (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411400748">Deacon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400748">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Although it would have been better to have included measures in both languages as done in some previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400748">Comeau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411400748">Deacon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400748">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), we did not, particularly for practical reasons. At the beginning of this study, the children’s proficiency in English was limited, and such testing would have been time-consuming and perhaps ultimately unclear.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our study has focused on a relatively new area and yielded some novel results. The issue of specific reading disability in an L2 has only rarely been explored thus far (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400748">Uno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411400748">Wydell &amp; Butterworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400748">Wydell &amp; Kondo, 2003</xref>). Our findings suggest that it is possible to find those who are specifically poor in one orthography (and language) that varies substantially from another in a wide-ranging sample. Moreover, the characteristics of poor readers of L2 English vary noticeably from poor readers of L1 Chinese. Poor L2 English readers tend to have difficulties in phonological awareness and may also have less home support or experience in the L2 than others. In contrast, poor L1 Chinese readers seem to have some difficulties in both phonological awareness and morphological awareness. Finally, children with reading difficulties in both orthographies have difficulties in phonological awareness and morphological awareness, but, notably, they are also particularly slow in RAN tasks. Such findings bring to mind the notion of multiple deficits in the poorest readers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400748">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400748">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>) and extend them to the newer area of reading difficulties across orthographies. Taken together, these findings suggest that for children faced with the task of learning to read English in addition to their native Chinese, reading difficulties across orthographies may be associated with multiple metalinguistic deficits.</p>
<p>The major educational implication of this work has to do with testing. Specifically, it may be cost-effective and educationally important to test Chinese children for reading difficulties separately in Chinese and in English; moreover, the markers of each may be different. This idea requires additional exploration. However, our findings, combined with anecdotal reports from Hong Kong teachers who find that some children who are dyslexic in Chinese are not in need of remedial work in English, suggest that educational psychologists should be open to the possibility that Chinese dyslexic children may or may not have reading difficulties in English as well. Correspondingly, children who are adequate readers of Chinese might nevertheless demonstrate particular difficulties with English and, if teachers notice that this might be a special problem, should be evaluated separately for this possibility. This will ensure better targeted services to all children with specific learning difficulties. It is likely that children with specific difficulties in English need more exposure to the language because their home environment does not support English language learning as much as the home environment does for other children. The Hong Kong government might consider additional English support programs for these children. Results indicate that English difficulties emerge as quite consistent by the age of 7 in these children, suggesting that extra support programs in English should begin in first grade for these Hong Kong children.</p>
