<abstract>
<p>This article presents an empirical investigation of music education students’ journals within a percussion methods course at a Midwestern university in the United States. The findings of this investigation raise issues about music education students’ sense of self-awareness, specificity within the journals, and the predominance of discussions about concrete (e.g., technique) over abstract (e.g., musicianship) aspects of the course. The issues are discussed from a variety of perspectives, including a discussion of the potential shortcomings of verbal thinking within a music education course. Implications are offered regarding the design and pedagogy of music education courses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Music methods courses are a specific type of music education course that are designed to prepare music education students for their future careers in the teaching profession. These courses often focus on techniques of performing and teaching. This focus is appropriate; after all, once these music education students become practicing teachers, their success may well depend on these techniques. Still, a question is begged: are music education students thinking substantively about the course content? The relationship between teaching, performing, and thinking is nebulous in music education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott (1995)</xref>, for example, has suggested that cognition is evident through performing; and he often discounts the value of explicating the thought apart from the performance. But if thoughts are not explicated then how do we know that they even exist? Could a strong performance not be the result of rote repetition and imitation of models? Such questions are worthy of exploration, particularly in light of the fact that pedagogy in music education is based on a behaviorist tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X12470598">Knowlton, 2010a</xref>), including ‘clear, explicit directives and positive modeling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1321103X12470598">Taylor, 2006</xref>, p. 231). But often-ignored thinking skills are essential in the field of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X12470598">Blocher, Greenwood, &amp; Shellahamer, 1997</xref>) and, more specifically, in learning to play a percussion instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X12470598">Knowlton, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X12470598">Mixon, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>If a music education student should think substantively about techniques of teaching and performing, then teachers of university methods courses must implement instructional strategies that require such thinking. These types of strategies are best referred to as cognitive learning strategies – those strategies that ‘focus on what is going on in the mind of the learner rather than thinking of learning as a simple stimulus-response connection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X12470598">Steadman &amp; Svinicki, 1998</xref>, p. 13). One common cognitive learning strategy is the implementation of journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X12470598">Blackmore, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X12470598">Garmon, 2001</xref>). This article offers an analysis of music education students’ journals that were written within a percussion methods course.</p>

<sec id="section2-1321103X12470598">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>This theoretical framework has two components. The first relates to the merits of journal writing. The second relates to the ways that music education students understand themselves and shape their own identity.</p>
<sec id="section3-1321103X12470598">
<title>Why journal writing?</title>
<p>Summary/response journals provide students with opportunities to create their own learning. As students generate language, they discover their own ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1321103X12470598">Thomeczek, Knowlton, &amp; Sharp, 2005</xref>). The notion of students learning how to learn through articulating their own ideas is an important part of the process of becoming an educator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X12470598">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X12470598">Apfelstadt (1996)</xref> has noted, ‘Learning how to learn remains an essential ingredient of [a future teacher’s] educational preparation’ (p. 5). Even more relevant to this article, some evidence suggests that elaborating on ideas in writing can be useful within music courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1321103X12470598">Knowlton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In essence, these written elaborations lead to careful thinking and reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X12470598">Barry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X12470598">Conway, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X12470598">Shand, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X12470598">Shiraishi, 1999</xref>). Certainly, music teachers must think carefully in ways that are intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X12470598">Shiraishi, 1999</xref>). Similarly, reflection is key to innovation within music teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X12470598">Shand, 1996</xref>). Part of this reflection should involve teachers’ self-knowledge and understanding of relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X12470598">Shand, 1996</xref>). Journal writing can lend itself to each of these ways of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X12470598">Barry (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X12470598">1996</xref>) seems to agree and suggests that journal writing is one strategy for promoting reflection among music education students. Still, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X12470598">Barry (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X12470598">Conway (1997)</xref> implemented journals within music education courses; each found the results to be insufficient for promoting meaningful learning.</p>

<title>How do students construct themselves through writing summary/response journals?</title>
<p>As students discover their own ideas and reflect upon those ideas, they not only develop an understanding of content, but also develop an understanding of themselves and, in that process, shape their own self-identity. When a person generates language about music, he or she is also involved in generating a musical self-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X12470598">MacDonald, Miell, &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott (1995)</xref> disagrees and notes that verbal constructs hinder musical growth. In spite of Elliott’s prominence in music education, this article adopts the perspective that generating language serves as a type of social construction; and, in fact, music education students can construct and communicate their own identities to others (and perhaps themselves) through writing summary/response journals.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the identity that music education students are likely to construct? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X12470598">Isbell (2008)</xref> has suggested that music education majors are actually socialized more as musicians than they are as music educators. Musicians seem to have a higher status than do music educators. Yet Isbell found that her subjects ‘did not feel stigmatized by being labeled as <italic>teachers</italic>’ (p. 175, italics in original). Importantly, though, Isbell notes that this finding contradicts earlier research that dealt with the question of music teacher socialization and enculturation. Among university students, a separation in identity exists between musician and music educator, and research suggests that many students experience a shift in their identities during their university training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X12470598">Conway, Eros, Pellegrino, &amp; West, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This method section begins with a discussion of the context for this study. Preliminary research questions, data collection, and data analysis also are discussed.</p>
<sec id="section6-1321103X12470598">
<title>Context for this study</title>
<p>This research was conducted within an undergraduate percussion methods course at a Midwestern university in the United States. The course met twice a week – on Tuesdays and Thursdays – for 80 minutes; major topics included an overview of snare drum, mallet percussion, timpani, hand drumming, marching percussion, drum set, accessories, and so forth. The course focused on the techniques of playing the various instruments. An assumption of the course’s framework seemed to be that if the music education students knew of the technique, then they were equipped to teach the technique. The course had a hands-on component but, mostly, the teacher demonstrated various performance techniques. The students’ opportunities to perform the techniques were secondary, and notions of percussion pedagogy were virtually non-existent. The researcher was not the course teacher, but served as an administrative assistant and second instructor.</p>
<p>The 14 students who were enrolled in this course completed a weekly summary/response journal that they submitted to the researcher by email. On the first day of class, the students received assignment guidelines to help them understand and complete the journals. Those guidelines noted that a summary ‘should report the <italic>highlights</italic> of … the topics covered [in class] that you found to be significant and/or [during-class] activities that … you found to be the most meaningful.’ A response, the assignment guidelines noted, was that which went ‘beyond summary.’ Importantly, the assignment guidelines emphasized informality and freedom to ‘not treat journals as formal essays that must be revised, edited, and polished. Length, grammar, spelling, and punctuation are all irrelevant! Simply “think on paper” – get your ideas “out there” in ways that show a clear summary and a thoughtful response.’ Following the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X12470598">Barry (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X12470598">1996</xref>), the assignment guidelines offered specific strategies for writing responses. For example, the assignment guidelines suggested that students might consider making connections between class activities and their ‘own experiences as a musician, teacher, learner, and/or music listener.’ Another suggested response strategy was to address what seemed particularly ‘hard,’ ‘surprisingly easy,’ or intellectually ‘uncomfortable.’</p>

<title>Guiding questions</title>
<p>Rigid research questions can be restrictive and counter-productive if those questions alone dictate the scope of analysis and findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X12470598">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). Findings should emerge organically from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X12470598">Van Manen, 1990</xref>). Still, both the theoretical framework and the context of a music education methods course led to the following questions that guided the researcher’s thinking as he began data analysis: within their journals, do music education students</p>
<list id="list1-1321103X12470598" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>more often write from the perspective of being a musician or an educator?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>engage in discussions of metacognitive thinking and self-knowledge?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>demonstrate intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic thinking about music and/or percussion?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>acknowledge the classroom as a community of learners?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1321103X12470598">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The students’ summary/response journals served as data. When the students submitted their weekly journals, the researcher saved each one in a folder designating specific weeks of the semester (e.g., ‘week 7 journals’). Collectively the journals resulted in approximately 140 pages of text.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1321103X12470598">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Using the word processor’s colored highlighters, the researcher used the constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X12470598">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) to code each journal. During the first five weeks of the semester, the researcher adopted a hermeneutical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X12470598">Van Manen, 1990</xref>) and coded quite liberally; the colored codes, though, were based on themes that (a) were inherently connected to the guiding questions of this study and (b) emerged organically through cyclical data analysis process. Cyclical and iterative analysis is common when using the constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X12470598">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>) and is needed to create cogent themes. On this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X12470598">MacNealy (1999)</xref> suggests that ‘if you find you have overlapping categories, then you may need to create additional ones to help reduce this confusion. Or you may need to rewrite the category descriptions to narrow their boundaries or make the boundaries more specific’ (p. 133). Through iterative analysis, the researcher discovered two heuristic questions to guide identification of units for analysis: what is the dominant theme within the journal? Where does one dominant theme end and another one begin within a journal? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X12470598">Table 1</xref> lists the 10 themes and their corresponding descriptions that emerged from the iterative and cyclical analysis that occurred during the first five weeks of the course. These categories and their descriptions served as the basis for coding all journals that were submitted between week 5 and the end of the semester.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>As noted, the themes and definitions shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X12470598">Table 1</xref> served to guide analysis, but those themes and descriptions were solidified through analysis. Therefore <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X12470598">Table 1</xref> provides significant information about findings. Indeed, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X12470598">Table 1</xref> identifies and defines the themes that were ‘found’ through careful cyclical analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref> shows the frequency counts of the researcher’s codes from weeks 5 through 14. As can be seen, the table is divided by weeks and then subdivided into codes for summary (S) and response (R). For each week, the number of journals submitted (N) is reported. Across the 10 weeks, a total of 112 journals were submitted. The coding of these journals resulted in 545 passages of text that were coded as individual units with different dominant themes – an average of 55 codes per week. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref> also shows the total number of codes for each week’s summary and each week’s response (discrete totals); below that row are weekly totals – the total number of units for analysis that were identified within each week’s journals. The bottom row shows the percent of total units that were coded each week (% of total).</p>

<p>Space limitations prevent discussion of all themes. A discussion of the six most prominent themes is offered.</p>
<sec id="section11-1321103X12470598">
<title>Self-awareness</title>
<p>Forty-three (8%) of the coded passages contained a self-awareness or metacognitive dominant theme. When a passage focused on the students’ own thinking, ideas, feelings, or involved other self-referential approaches, the passage was coded as belonging to this category. One student wrote: ‘When I had to conduct, I was kind of embarrassed … for some reason.’ Another student said: ‘I have to admit that Tuesday’s class did not keep my interest. I’m not exactly sure why, but it is probably because I am more of a “hands on” learner.’ Consider a third example: ‘I really want to succeed in this class so I can be the best music teacher that I can be. On the other hand, sometimes I find it really difficult to tell the difference in some examples given. I can still hear a pitch in the good chime example. Maybe it’s just me. LOL.’</p>
<p>The focus within this theme sometimes addressed notions of being ‘discouraged’ or ‘overwhelmed.’ For example, one student noted that a teaching simulation that was done within the class was ‘very helpful.’ She continued:<disp-quote>
<p>I am fully aware how I learn things, but explaining it to someone else is completely different. This helped me to think of a different way to put things, and was very useful. In the beginning, I was very confused about rolling. … I was also very confused when it came to closed rolling. I think I was confused because of the way it is written. … However, once I was able to hear the rhythm, it was much easier for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1321103X12470598">
<title>Teacher</title>
<p>Eight percent of the passages were written from the perspective of a teacher. Consider the following typical example:<disp-quote>
<p>[How can I] allow my students to master all of these different instruments[?] My answer is exactly what we did today. We have to allow the students to … work with the instruments hands on. By doing this, the students [are] able to find out for themselves the correct and incorrect ways to play that specific instrument. … The key to being successful in teach[ing] my students is simply by capturing their attention.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A second example further illustrates this theme:<disp-quote>
<p>I also think [that providing students with lots of opportunity for practice] would be a good thing to do if I ever ended up teaching percussion [in a] middle school. Most middle school kids probably won’t want to practice, I know I didn’t want to, so this would be a good way to make sure they are understanding the techniques and get a bit of practice in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the units that were coded as falling within this theme addressed the notion of hands-on practice. There were, however, some exceptions: ‘If [students] were struggling with [understanding the pulse of rolls] I would give them a copy of the roll chart in my binder, give them an etude with lots of rolls and have them write out all the rhythms.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1321103X12470598">
<title>Musician</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref> shows, 47 of the 545 units (8%) that were analyzed fell into the category of offering a frame of reference from a musical or musician’s perspective. One example dealt with playing the tambourine during class:<disp-quote>
<p>When I played the tambourine I could play an endless array of different sounds and colors. I could tilt the tambourine at 30 degrees and get a good balance of membrane and jingle sound. I could lay it flat and get mostly membrane sound, or I could hold it vertically and get mostly jingles. If I wanted to play a delicate passage like one I would find in a ballet piece, I can put the bottom end of my palm on the head or the tambourine and tap the edges with my fingers for a dry, light sound.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage discusses the mechanics of technique, but the dominant impression within this journal passage is musical sounds – dry, light sound; color; and balance of membrane and jingle.</p>
<p>The category of ‘musician’ was frequently found within responses. For example, one student reacted as a musician to a cymbal demonstration:<disp-quote>
<p>The dynamics were neat to learn about. … I didn’t think that holding the cymbals tall compared to holding them flat would ever change the dynamics of them. I also liked the idea of muffling them. It was really cool that he said when going from a quick forte to piano you just muffle one by putting it against your body, that’s a clever idea.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1321103X12470598">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>Ninety of the 545 passages that were coded (16%) were offered from the psychomotor or physical perspective; these passages dealt with the mechanics of technique. For example, during week 5 of the course, class time was devoted to the students working individually with the two course instructors. One student wrote about this experience:<disp-quote>
<p>My favorite part was the one-on-one time with [the course teacher] to analyze the things I’m doing wrong. … He showed me that it’s all in the wrist, I need to hold the stick firmly with my index and thumb, and keep control with the rest of my fingers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Occasionally, some of the units that were analyzed did address a musical perspective through a mechanical approach. Consider the following extended excerpt:<disp-quote>
<p>To grip the cymbal with maximum control, the performer tightly grips the strap with the thumb and pointer finger close to the bell and wraps the rest of the strap around the hand. A louder sound is produced by a horizontal strike, whereas marches are often played with the quieter vertical strike. The ideal strike has many overtones that ring for a bit of time. Basically, there are three ways to produce a cymbal crash. The first two produce a CA-RASH sound by the cymbals striking together at two different points. The first of the two is an upstroke in which the dominant hand strikes upward while the weaker hand slightly moves toward the point of crashing. The dominant hand’s cymbal should strike the other cymbal around an inch below the edge. The second crash is a downstroke, in which the same basic principles as the first crash are applied, except the dominant hand now strikes downward.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though this excerpt addresses a few elements from the perspective of the musician – overtones, louder sounds, and quieter sounds – it was coded as being related to technique because mechanics and physical movement were more prominent than musicianship; technique was the dominant impression within the passage because the musical elements were discussed in terms of the physical approach to creating the music. Consider another excerpt that was coded as belonging to the theme of technique but that does include a musical element within:<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that struck me the most was about the grip that was created by the symphony percussionist. With the way [that the course teacher] described and demonstrated it, the cymbals <italic>may</italic> be a little freer when they hit, but then the bottom cymbal falls back on the hand, any extra vibrations seem like they would be muffled anyway, so I didn’t quite get that idea (although I did think that the crashes he did with that grip sounded quite full.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, the student in this case even set off his musical comment within the parentheses. While not common, there were occasionally other examples of students who took primarily a technician’s approach but somehow included a musical comment within the discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1321103X12470598">
<title>Information replication</title>
<p>Ninety-three passages (17% of the total) were coded as information replication. These passages in the journals did not offer synthesis, analysis, or other higher-order thinking; instead, they restated course content. Key to the definition of this theme is the inclusion of detail within the journal; detail separates this theme from ‘generalized explanation,’ which is the next theme that will be discussed. Information replications often provided a detailing of facts or explanations of concepts. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref>, this theme was found more commonly in summaries than it was within responses.</p>
<p>Detail does not imply length, as the following example illustrates: ‘We also talked about two different kinds of tambourines, ones with one row of jingles and ones with two rows of jingles. In elementary and middle school you would see one row of jingles and in high school on, you see two rows of jingles.’ Most passages that were coded as belonging to this theme were longer, however. Consider this example of a summary:<disp-quote>
<p>On Tuesday, we learned about the rope drum. … This particular drum uses special sticks to play on it. They are much bigger so they can carry the sound more. Normal drum sticks would not be loud enough. It is tuned by the leather straps around the outside of it. Tightening them makes the sound slightly higher. When putting the drum away, you always loosen all the leather straps. It would not be good for the drum head to be left so tight for a long time. We also learned that these drums were used in wars. There would be three camps and every hour the outer would play, then the middle once he heard him finish, then the last. If one did not play, or it did not start on time, they would know something had happened to the other camp.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here is another example of information replication from the course:<disp-quote>
<p>This week we focused on timpani. There are two main grips to use with timpani: the German grip, which is identical to matched grip on snare drum, and the French grip, which is used with the thumbs pointed up. When purchasing timpani, there are different sized heads you can buy. The staple timpani sizes are the 29’ and 26’. When you have funds, the 32’ is the next buy, followed by the 23’. Each timpani has a usable range of a Perfect fifth starting at D for the 32’, F for the 29’, B♭ for the 26’, and D for the 23’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The examples that have been presented are typical of passages belonging to this theme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1321103X12470598">
<title>Generalized explanation</title>
<p>One hundred forty-seven (27% of the total) of the coded passages were generalized statements about content. These generalized statements simply addressed <italic>what</italic> was covered within any given classroom session or experience, but that coverage did not include specifics or details. Sometimes these statements were one sentence: ‘On Thursday we just heard a lot of loud cymbal crashes.’ Another student simply offered this in a response: ‘I had the biggest reaction when discussing the price of these instruments.’ Neither of these examples was supported with specifics or elaboration. Importantly, though, length is not a defining characteristic of this theme. The defining characteristic is the lack of specifics. Consider this excerpt from a summary:<disp-quote>
<p>Basically all we did was a fake solo and ensemble contest. I went in a room with [the teacher] and played ‘Parade of the Clicking Sticks’ (which I am thoroughly sick of), and then he asked me to play flams, five stroke rolls, flam accents, and nine stroke rolls. Then we talked about how I did and what went well and what I could improve on. I thought it went pretty well and [the teacher] did too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This contribution has significant length beyond a single sentence, but it still only provides a very general explanation.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref> shows, this category also manifested itself within responses. Often, these segments were summaries with statements of ‘agreeing,’ ‘liking,’ or ‘enjoy[ing]’ tacked on to the beginning of them.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have a lot of fun playing the accessory instruments. I think this is because these are all the unidentifiable sounds I have heard. They are unique to the typical wind brass and string instruments, and even some percussion instruments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section17-1321103X12470598" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A consideration of the findings illuminates three ideas deserving discussion. In this section, a consideration of why the journals may have been so generalized is offered. Also, a hypothesis regarding why some themes emerged more frequently than others is put forth. Both of those points follow a discussion of the emerging issue that the students seemed to lack self-awareness. These ideas within the discussion pave the way for the final section of this article, which will provide implications for music methods courses.</p>
<sec id="section18-1321103X12470598">
<title>Music education students lacked depth of self-awareness</title>
<p>The researcher observed a lack of development of ideas within the self-awareness theme. Clear statements of self-awareness existed within the journals, but those statements were not explored, elaborated upon, or analyzed. Consider, in particular, the following excerpt that was presented in the findings section: ‘When I had to conduct, I was kind of embarrassed … for some reason.’ The ellipsis was in the original journal, and that ellipsis might represent the student’s hesitation to explore her embarrassment within that learning situation. The embarrassment was simply ‘for some reason.’ By not exploring it, she bypassed an opportunity to see the teaching and learning of music in a self-referential light. Consider a second excerpt from the findings about self-awareness: ‘I have to admit, that Tuesday’s class did not keep my interest. I’m not exactly sure why, but it is probably because I am more of a “hands on” learner.’ The student acknowledges that she is ‘not exactly sure why’ she could not pay attention, but then she offers some answer as to why. Still, her analysis of her own reaction stops far short of providing potential insights into the ways that she could have better understood her own ability to focus her attention and maximize the learning opportunity.</p>
<p>As argued in the theoretical framework of this article, self-knowledge enhances reflection, and the process of becoming a music teacher involves a type of identity creation. Given the importance of both self-knowledge and identity formation, it is concerning that deeper self-analysis and metacognitive exploration seemed missing from the journals. When we consider the way that university students are often trained, though, the lack of self-analysis seems expected. After all, in many university classes, students are conditioned to ‘cover content’ and to do so through routine and impersonal rituals based in repetition and memory work. For many students, perhaps it is a leap to be asked to consider self-awareness as a relevant aspect of learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1321103X12470598">
<title>Generalized journal Ideas</title>
<p>The illustrative quotes provided throughout the findings section of this article demonstrate that journal ideas often were generalized. In fact, the largest emerging theme was that of ‘content coverage’ (27%) which by definition included a lack of specificity, elaboration, and explanation. Sometimes the students would offer simple statements of confusion, but they would explain neither the basis of nor the details about their confusion. Consider the following example: ‘It was interesting to work on a piece that a fifth grade [student] could play and see it from their perspective.’ The student who wrote this comment provided no discussion of either what made working on that piece of music ‘interesting’ or what new insights she gained about the ‘perspective’ of a fifth-grade percussionist. So a passage that substantively could have addressed a musician’s or teacher’s perspective became a case of ‘content covered.’</p>
<p>What can be made of the predominance of ‘generalized explanation’ within the journals? Because journals are neither objective assessments nor applied performances, so one line of reasoning goes, music education students are not willing to put as much time and effort into writing journals as they are willing to invest in, say, studying for an exam or preparing a piece of music for juried performance. Alternatively, although the assignment guidelines for the journals asked the students to focus on what they ‘learned about the topics and from the activities,’ the students may have taken the guidelines very literally, believing that what was wanted was a report of ‘content covered.’</p>
<p>The predominance of the ‘generalized explanation’ theme can be explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott (1995)</xref> who argues that students cannot – and should not be expected to – articulate meaningful ideas about music or music teaching, as both are inherently non-verbal and focus on knowing-in-action. If Elliott is right, then to articulate ideas about music and music teaching would impede meaningful learning; therefore journals are ill-equipped as a medium for displaying appropriate thinking about music. Perhaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X12470598">Elliott’s (1995)</xref> perspective also can help us understand the order of the next four largest themes that emerged – information replication (17%), technique (17%), musicianship (9%), and teaching (8%). This order does seem to start with the most concrete verbal knowledge and move toward themes that would be demonstrated better in action than through words. For example, information replication is inherently more verbal than either musicianship or teaching. This order of the themes seems to add credence to the view that the more abstractly one tries to address thinking-in-action, the less one will have to say and the more generalized the ideas will become.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1321103X12470598">
<title>Technique emerged more often than musicianship and education</title>
<p>Methods courses are both music and education courses, not merely courses in technique. In terms of the content of the students’ journals, though, the theme of technique (17%) appeared more frequently than the next three highest themes – musician (9%), teacher (8%), and a sense of self-awareness (8%). Certainly, technique is concrete and fundamentals of technique are more easily communicated than are the abstractions of musicianship and teaching. Therefore it seems reasonable that the students might focus on concrete techniques. Perhaps more benignly, it could be that the students simply viewed a consideration of technique to be an important precursor to the other categories. Therefore it was strategic decision-making for them to spend more effort writing about technique.</p>
<p>If this interpretation was accurate, though, then one intuitively might anticipate a transition from a heavy emphasis on technique early in the semester toward musical and pedagogical journal emphasis later in the semester. Such a transition seems logical because the students might be learning techniques early in the semester and then applying those techniques as the semester progresses. However, a consideration of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X12470598">Table 2</xref> shows that this transition across the semester did not occur. In fact, as that table shows, the theme of ‘techniques’ emerged at a consistent rate across all 10 weeks.</p>

<sec id="section21-1321103X12470598" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Implications and conclusions</title>
<p>This article’s discussion section might be summed up by considering that the short-comings of the journals might arise from the medium of journals, the nature of the guidelines given, the students’ literal interpretation of those guidelines, or lack of ability and shortsightedness. In some respects, these explanations are exculpatory in absolving university methods teachers of responsibility to rethink both the curriculum and pedagogy of a methods course. Rethinking curriculum and pedagogy within music has been discussed in the literature:<disp-quote>
<p>How might we define the job of … a music appreciation instructor? Would it be to teach the facts and figures of music history – a litany of who wrote what opera or symphony joined with the dates and composers? Or, is the job of that instructor to teach students <italic>how</italic> to learn about music – the learning process that a musicologist, music theorist, or performer engages in to better understand the nature of music? Erring toward requiring students to consider their own learning provides a metacognitive (thinking about thinking) perspective and shifts the emphasis [away from merely focusing on] content acquisition. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X12470598">Knowlton, 2010b</xref>, p. 81, italics in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though the above quote does not address methods courses, the logic of that quote is pertinent. Indeed, a premise of the following implications is that the preceding findings and discussion should cause methods teachers to rethink the ways in which they present content and the ways in which they encourage students to process content.</p>
<sec id="section22-1321103X12470598">
<title>Teachers presenting content</title>
<p>Methods teachers should aim the presentation of content toward the need for students to think professionally in the classroom. Techniques should be attached to the musical effects that those techniques create. Furthermore, specific techniques should be aligned with pedagogical approaches that the students can use in their future classrooms. With these injunctions in mind to present techniques within the curriculum, without addressing an approach to helping percussion students <italic>learn</italic> those techniques may well be a hindrance to their development.</p>
<p>Perhaps a specific example from the course will illustrate this notion: during the class period in which the students learned about the tambourine, the teacher emphasized the tambourine’s physical structure (e.g., one row of jingles versus two rows) and proper performance techniques (e.g., thumb rolls and shake rolls). There was little – if any – discussion of the musical effect of tambourine. Presentation, for example, of the connection between idioms and techniques were non-existent. Notions of tambourine pedagogy also were absent. The point here is not to argue that the physical structure of an instrument and technique are irrelevant; rather, this example simply raises the point that the content of methods teachers’ presentations will incline music education students toward some types of thinking and away from other types. If teachers focus mostly on technique during their presentations, then perhaps it is unfair of those teachers to expect methods students to have broader and more robust responses to a given presentation. Integrating a variety of perspectives into presentations and lectures – those of performers, teachers, composers, and audience – might better broaden students’ thinking about various topics within music methods courses; broadening the students’ thinking will allow for broader types of journal responses by those students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1321103X12470598">
<title>Music education students processing content</title>
<p>Music education students must be guided to process content through ‘interventions and strategies’ that will help them learn ‘to think like professional teachers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X12470598">Conway et al., 2010</xref>, p. 272). Sadly, many music education students note that they only ‘started thinking like teachers when they began the field experience component of the program’ (p. 270). Quite possibly one reason for this is that methods teachers did not provide substantive opportunities for students to develop thinking skills, which include the abilities to cogently summarize and robustly react. The thinking skills of music education students can be enhanced through both the pedagogy of day-to-day class sessions and pertinent journal implementation.</p>
<p>In order for methods teachers to help the students in their classes develop professional thinking skills, such thinking cannot be relegated to the out-of-class assignment of journals. Instead, teachers must conduct classes in ways that allow journals to become logical extensions of the types of thinking that are expected during class. Skills in summarizing, reacting, and analyzing cannot be abdicated to a handout; instead, they must become the center of classroom protocol and practice. The content coverage within a percussion methods course is necessarily broad – a type of survey of percussion. But, through questioning, small group discussions, and other pedagogies that allow student voices to be heard, teachers can help students focus on specifics within lectures and content presentations. For example, if a methods teacher asked students to perform ensemble pieces during class, the teacher could debrief the performance experience with simple prompts: ‘What did you learn from that experience?’ ‘What was easy?’ ‘Difficult?’ Substantive evidence suggests that helping students master techniques requires a teacher to help students form a mental model of the technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X12470598">Morrison, Ross, Kalman, &amp; Kemp, 2011</xref>). Such during-class questioning can begin accomplishing that goal in ways that will establish for students the types of thinking required in the outside-of-class activity of journal writing.</p>
<p>Journals must be implemented in ways that allow music education students to understand the importance of journal writing in general. One reasonable response from methods teachers might be to note that writing is not the point of a music methods course. While this is true, professional thinking is the point, and writing can promote professional thinking. To this end, perhaps providing examples of some of the writings of professional musicians (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X12470598">Bernstein, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1321103X12470598">Copland, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1321103X12470598">1985</xref>) will help methods students understand the necessity of working through ideas in writing. Such models of good writing about music might help music education students see the value of explaining their own thoughts as a matter of self-understanding. For this type of process to be useful, music education students must be taught how to use specific strategies to generate useful summaries and responses. Such strategies would consciously help music education students focus on content from a variety of perspectives – a verbal knowledge perspective, mechanical perspective, teacher’s perspective, and so forth. Methods teachers must teach students <italic>how</italic> to learn. Perhaps part of the ‘how’ is to provide students in our methods courses with scaffolding to focus thinking. Examples of the types of scaffolds that might be useful could include heuristic questions that are broadly applicable to thinking like a professional teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X12470598">Knowlton, 2010a</xref>), processes and structures of rhetorical argumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X12470598">Jonassen &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>), and reflective writing prompts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1321103X12470598">Lai &amp; Calandra, 2010</xref>). As noted earlier in this article, the assignment offered approaches to reflecting, but the empirical and practical truth of the prescribed approaches must be verified.</p>
