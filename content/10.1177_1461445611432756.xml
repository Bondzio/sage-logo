<p>Heritage and Clayman provide an expertly described introduction to the conversation analysis (CA) of institutions. Introductory Chapters 1–4 provide clear and systematic descriptions of CA method, including illustrative examples from a range of contexts that would prove useful for beginning CA and institutional discourse students and researchers.</p>
<p>Subsequent chapters examine institutional talk in various domains. Emergency-line calls are the subject of Chapters 5–7, highlighting important characteristics of institutional interaction including asymmetry, gatekeeping and deviant cases. Chapters 8–11 describe features of doctor–patient interaction, including patient problem talk, accountability, question–answer sequences and authority. Chapters 12–14 examine legal proceedings, specifically trial examinations, jury deliberations and informal conflict resolution; Chapter 12 is particularly effective in underscoring how language shapes outcomes. News interviews are the focus of Chapters 15–17, exploring turn-taking, question design and answers and evasions. The final substantive chapter focuses on mass communication. While a chapter-by-chapter description is useful, a thematic analysis may provide a more accurate view of the strengths and weaknesses of the volume. Thus, this review is organized according to the following two themes: 1) institutional roles/norms and 2) question–answer sequences.</p>
<p>The authors argue that institutional talk and preference structures established therein are influenced by ‘institution-relevant identities’ that create normative patterns for institutional interaction (p. 34). Chapter 4, addressing the relationship between institutions and talk, positions identity as static, synonymous with participant role. However, given the book’s stated attention to ‘identities’, a broader, more variable conceptualization of identity could have been acknowledged vis-a-vis the literature on role and participant framework.</p>
<p>While such a conception of identity receives less attention, the authors address the salience of institutionally relevant roles in many chapters. Emergency-call opening sequences, for example, are constrained by the operator’s role and their associated institutional goal of determining the emergency. Likewise, in doctor–patient talk, patients are obligated to present their problem in different ways depending on whether the source of the illness is known or unknown, and whether the illness itself is routine. The authors expertly demonstrate how participant frameworks are constrained by institutional roles, while additionally highlighting deviations from those normative structures, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">Erickson (2004)</xref> might call ‘wiggle room’ (p. 15). These moments might have been used to illuminate the variability of participant identities. For example, the jury deliberation context highlighted a lack of consensus about the role jurors should play, discussed in terms of argumentation and rationales, but which might have been examined in light of juror (performed) identity. Moreover, the authors’ identification of deviant cases and wiggle room invites a larger, more diversified understanding of role and identity.</p>
<p>In addition to institutional role, the authors rightly devote much time to the design, structure and implications of question–answer sequences in institutions. Chapter 3 introduces question–answer sequence structure and identifies how participant roles, participant knowledge and asymmetry are evoked through discursive practices. Chapter 4 separates those sequences into the macro-conversational structures that shape institutional talk (opening, problem-initiation, disposal, closing). Examining the macro-structure of emergency calls, Chapter 5 reveals asymmetrical distribution of power, as well as how these interactions differ from non-emergency calls. Though emergency calls are highly asymmetrical interactions that place gatekeeping and assessment power with the operator, his/her salutation and opening question and the caller’s request for service are often structurally flexible, as is doctor–patient talk. These chapters capture rich portraits of emergency calls and acute care visits.</p>
<p>While questions and answers are a prevalent interactional structure in emergency calls and doctor–patient visits, trial examinations and news interviews represent more specialized turn-taking systems in which institutional goals dictate adherence to question–answer sequences, with participants generally relegated to one side or the other of the sequence based on their institutionally relevant role (i.e. witnesses and interviewees rarely ask questions). While this rigidity may be seen as limiting, the authors illuminate how participants use the form of questions and answers to accomplish more interactionally; for example, a prosecutor may form a question including information as given, and a witness may likewise take issue with a presupposition embedded within a question. These examples not only show how participants find wiggle room within the institutional turn-taking structure, but they also hint at how preference structure may be invoked by question design.</p>
<p>The topics in this volume are thoroughly described, reflecting decades of scholarly research and uncovering a diversity of characteristics of institutional talk. Moreover, as a primer for the analysis of institutional talk, CA more generally, and talk in emergency, medical, legal and media institutions specifically, it is an excellent resource. However, as the authors admit, the depth of analytical scope comes at the expense of breadth across institutional types and domains. While it would be impossible to include all institution types, news and political speeches seemed less fitting than educational institutions, a domain that was noticeably absent from the text, apart from one example from classroom interaction in Chapter 3. The authors’ criteria for limiting the text’s scope (historically situated, intrinsic interest, significant outcomes) do not appear to justify the omission of educational institutions, and a balanced and representative course on institutional talk would require a supplemental text on classroom discourse. It is worth noting that by limiting the institutional domains, the authors may have intended to present a wide array of issues relevant to institutional talk research, which they accomplish very successfully; the inclusion of less orthodox domains (e.g. jury deliberation, speeches) illuminates facets of analytical import that are often ignored in mainstream institutions (e.g. rhetoric, audience response). As such, this volume provides a valuable guide to analytical tools for understanding institutional talk. Useful for students and emerging scholars of CA and institutional talk, this volume sheds light on both the analytical approach and conceptual themes that are relevant within these domains and beyond.</p>
