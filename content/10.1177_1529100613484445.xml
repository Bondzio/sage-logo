The treatment program she developed for PTSD sufferers has proven to be highly efficacious and has been widely disseminated in the United States and around the world. She has published 18 books and over 350 articles and book chapters, and her work has been recognized with numerous awards and honors, among them the <italic>Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Clinical Psychology Award</italic> from the American Psychological Association, the <italic>Lifetime Achievement Award</italic> presented by the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, the <italic>Lifetime Achievement Award</italic> presented by the Association for Behavior and Cognitive Therapies, inclusion in TIME’s 100 most influential people of the world, the 2010 <italic>Lifetime Achievement in the Field of Trauma Psychology Award</italic> from the American Psychological Association, and the Inaugural International Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Foundation Outstanding Career Achievement Award.</p>
