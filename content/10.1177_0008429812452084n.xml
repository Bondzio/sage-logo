<p>Judaism is a test case for what is meant by “religion.” A likely majority of Jews today see their identity as cultural and not religious. Even premodern Jews emphasized practice over belief, and defined Jewish identity primarily by maternal descent. The study of the world’s religions can scarcely leave out Judaism, but can a concept of “religion” broad enough to encompass the Jews be meaningful enough to be useful?</p>
<p>This challenge to the concept of “religion” assumes that the concept of “Judaism” is useful. In the realm of Jewish Studies, however, that assumption has been falling apart for decades. While an earlier generation of scholars might have addressed “Jewish literature and culture,” the book under review is about Jewish Literatures and Cultures. As contributor Moshe Rosman notes, the plural can be seen as “denying the existence of a common Jewish culture” and thus in effect “denying the existence of a Jewish people” (145).</p>
<p>As summed up in Anita Norich’s introduction (1–8), the essays gathered in this book acknowledge the ambiguity and complexity of Judaism(s). Dan Miron (“From Continuity to Contiguity,” 9–36), Michael L. Satlow (“Beyond Influence,” 37–54), and Moshe Rosman (“Hybrid with What?” 129–154) address this theme with particular verve and sophistication.</p>
<p>Miron discusses literary criticism. Early twentieth-century thinkers worked to develop “a theory of Jewish literature” (12). Their context was the Jewish situation as a stateless minority in ideological turmoil. After the founding of the State of Israel, however, it appeared that Zionism had supplanted other ideologies and the Jews had become a normal nation. Israeli scholars now aimed for “a general literary theory” which would not be specifically Jewish, though it would be “illustrated by Hebrew texts” (13). Today, however, there is a realization that “the existence of Israel … does not solve the existential—let alone the cultural—problems Jews as a stateless collective had faced” (14). In this context, Miron calls for a return to theorizing about Jewish literature in specifically Jewish terms, but without the “wishful thinking” which seeks “all-encompassing unities and continuities” (33).</p>
<p>Satlow’s field is the history of Jews in antiquity. He traces the decline of historiographic approaches that “turn culture into static binary encounters, characterized by ‘conflict,’ ‘resistance,’ [or conversely] ‘influence,’ ‘assimilation,’ ‘acculturation,’ or ‘appropriation’” (38). In this light, Satlow instructs historians of Jews in antiquity to “focus on people, not abstractions” (40), that is, Jews in their various local situations, rather than Judaism; “de-essentialize the Jews” (44) since “to be a Jew in antiquity could mean many different things” (45); “assume similarity, explain difference” (46) between Jews and their neighbours, instead of the other way around; and “justify data selection” (51), recognizing that evidence from antiquity is sparse and must be combined in ways that are never obvious.</p>
<p>Rosman, a historian of early modern Polish Jewry, notes that this community could be imagined as part and parcel of Jewry everywhere, unaffected by its Polish surroundings; or, conversely, as a Polish cultural community disconnected from other Jews. He summarizes the views of historians from various points on this spectrum, showing how each falls short of accounting for the historical evidence about Jews in Poland. In particular, attempts to view Polish Jews as primarily Polish run against the continuity of their culture with “earlier Ashkenazic and even talmudic forms” (135) and “the mutual cultural alienation of Gentiles from Jews in Poland” (136). Rosman himself strives for a balanced and nuanced view (141). However, while Satlow goes rather far toward disintegrating the whole idea of Jewishness, Rosman is attuned to the communal cohesiveness of Jews over time and across geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>The other chapters share a goal of questioning received assumptions. Not all are equally convincing. Gabriele Boccaccini’s “Hellenistic Judaism” (55–76) synthesizes various references to “Wisdom” in pseudepigrapha, Philo and early Christian writings into a distinct “strand of Judaism” in which “Judaism [was] not a Temple-centred or Torah-centred religion but a Wisdom-centred religion” (69). This article would have benefited from Satlow’s call to “justify data selection.” Kalman P. Bland’s “Idols of the Cave and Theater” (155–176) challenges the stereotype of Jewish culture as textual rather than visual. In doing so, Bland revisits Sholem Aleichem’s novel <italic>Motl Peysi dem Khazns</italic>, in which the young protagonist is beaten by his older brother for drawing pictures. Bland argues (164–169) that this has nothing to do with any Jewish antipathy to art; Motl is also slapped or rebuked for playing with a calf and for wanting to be a musician, which no one would claim were the subjects of “traditional Jewish taboos” (168). This argument, however, ignores the thematics of Sholem Aleichem’s writings, in which the young embody the breakdown of the old order. The old order is bookishly disconnected from nature—which is challenged by Motl’s friendship with the calf—and hierarchical—which is challenged by Motl’s fascination with klezmorim, low-status wandering musicians. In this context, Motl’s art is another challenge to the “taboos” of shtetl society, at least as Sholem Aleichem presented it.</p>
<p>More convincingly to this reader, Martha Himmelfarb (“He Was Renowned to the Ends of the Earth,” 77–97) shows that I Maccabees, the epitome of resistance to Hellenism, is also a Hellenistic work, as it “adopts Greek ideals of heroism and glory more or less unaltered, although it sets them in a narrative written according to biblical models” (96). Yaron Z. Eliav’s “Roman Statues, Rabbis, and Greco-Roman Culture” (99–115) begins with a vivid depiction of how “sculpted images were omnipresent in the urban landscape of the Roman realm” (99). Eliav argues that discussions of idolatry by rabbis in Roman Palestine reflect distinctions in Roman thought between statues that were or were not formally consecrated and worshipped.</p>
<p>Some essays argue for more, rather than less, continuity than is usually noticed between different Jewish communities. David B. Ruderman (“The Ghetto and Jewish Cultural Formation in Early Modern Europe,” 117–127) says that all European Jews were affected by factors such as “mobility and social mixing … an explosion of knowledge … [and] the blurring of religious identities” (125) which were especially salient in the ghetto of Venice. Shachar Pinsker (“Intertextuality, Rabbinic Literature, and the Making of Hebrew Modernism,” 201–228) shows that literary works of “Hebrew modernism” written in the early twentieth century do not reflect only a break with the past, but an “intertextual dialogue with traditional Jewish literature” (228). Julian Levinson (“Brooklyn am Rhein?” 229–244) argues that Jewish American literature, often seen as descended from Yiddish culture, is also rooted in the thought and writing of “prewar German Jews and their particular ways of engaging with the world” (229–230).</p>
<p>For many Jews throughout history and today, Jewish living requires more than one language. Translation between them is the theme of two of these essays. Gabriella Safran’s “Reverse Marranism” (177–200) takes as its starting point the recent discovery of the original playscript of S. An-sky’s <italic>The Dybbuk</italic>. First produced in 1920, this play has been produced many times in Yiddish and Hebrew; but An-sky’s earliest written version was “in Russian … for a Russian-speaking audience” (177), illustrating the complex linguistic identities of Russian Jewish intellectuals. Naomi Seidman retells her father’s story of speaking in Yiddish to bewildered refugees in postwar Paris, telling them they need not fear the French police, who “were certainly goyim, [but] weren’t Nazis”; he then gave the policemen themselves, in French, a more palatable version of what he had said to the crowd (245). Seidman’s concluding essay, “Diaspora and Translation” (245–257), is an extended meditation on this anecdote, and a fitting conclusion to these essays on the multifaceted complexity of Jewishness.</p>
<p>Jewish religious thought today, especially in the liberal spectrum from Modern Orthodoxy to Jewish Renewal, is strongly influenced by developments in academic Jewish Studies. Therefore, the approaches to the Jewish past represented in this stimulating book may also play a role in shaping the future of the Jewish religion. If it is a religion.</p>
