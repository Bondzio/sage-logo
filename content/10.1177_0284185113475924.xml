               <p>Sentinel node (SN) biopsy in esophageal cancer has the potential of becoming an important tool for ruling out the presence of lymph node metastases in patients opted for less extensive surgery without neoadjuvant treatment.</p>

               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To investigate preoperative SN imaging in esophageal cancer using hybrid single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT.</p>

               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>Eight patients with esophageal cancer scheduled for thoracoabdominal esophagectomy after neoadjuvant treatment, underwent endoscopic submucosal injection of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-nanocoll the day before surgery, followed by imaging with SPECT/CT for preoperative detection. Intraoperative detection of SNs was performed with a gamma probe.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>SNs were identified by SPECT/CT in 7/8 cases (88%) and by gamma probe in all cases. The median number of identified lymph node stations with SN in the operating field was 1 (range 0–2) for SPECT/CT and 1 (range 1–3) for gamma probe. The median distance between the perceived location of the respective SN according to SPECT/CT and the location identified with the gamma probe was &lt;5 mm (range &lt;5–15 mm). In one patient who had a complete histologic response to neoadjuvant treatment in the primary tumor, there was one single metastasis that was not contained in one of the SNs.</p>

               <p>Preoperative identification of sentinel nodes with hybrid SPECT/CT after endoscopic injection of radiocolloid is a technique with obvious potential for SN mapping in esophageal cancer.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>The sentinel node (SN) technique has been explored in different gastrointestinal malignancies, but there are major differences in its applicability. The potential benefit of avoiding redundant lymphadenectomy and neoadjuvant therapy in cancer surgery of the gastrointestinal tract is most predominant in esophageal surgery because it has the highest risk of postoperative morbidity. The results from Japanese studies have generally been encouraging for SN biopsy in T1 squamous cell cancers of the esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C2">2</xref>), whereas the detection rate and accuracy is unsatisfactory for T2–T3 tumors. In publications from the West based mainly on patients with adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction and distal esophagus of mixed T-stages, the results have been much better with a detection rate and accuracy of SN biopsy exceeding 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C4">4</xref>). In order to explore the potential of SN biopsy in clinical staging of esophageal cancer improved imaging techniques are needed, given that esophageal cancer SNs may be located far away from the tumor in both abdominal, mediastinal and cervical lymph node stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C2">2</xref>). Preoperative detection of SN has previously been performed with planar lymphoscintigraphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C1">1</xref>), but this technique does not define the exact anatomic location of the SN. Keeping in mind also the variable lymphatic drainage pattern of the esophagus, hybrid single photon computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging could assist in overcoming both these difficulties. So far, the available literature on the use of hybrid SPECT/CT in lymphatic mapping is limited and there are no reports on patients with esophageal cancer. Hereby we report our first experiences of preoperative detection of SN by hybrid SPECT/CT imaging in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer.</p>

            <title>Patient inclusion and ethics</title>
            <p>This study was conducted between October 2011 and May 2012. Nineteen thoracoabdominal esophagectomies due to cancer were done during the study period and all these patients were considered for inclusion. Three patients declined to participate, two patients could not receive endoscopic injection of radiocolloid because of an esophageal stent and in six cases hybrid SPECT/CT was not available on the day before surgery (weekends, et cetera). The remaining eight cases were included and are presented herein. The Regional Ethical and Radiation Protection Committees approved this study and all patients gave informed consent to participate.</p>

            <p>On the afternoon the day before surgery, the patients underwent endoscopic submucosal injection of 4 × 0.5 mL in total 60 MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc-nanocoll (GE Healthcare Srl., Milan, Italy) proximal to the tumor. Injection distal to the tumor was not performed in cases with a tumor in close relation to the GE junction or because the endoscope could not pass the tumor. A close relation to the GE junction increases the risk of spillage of radiocolloid due to a difficult angle when injecting. Spillage may compromise interpretation of images and can easily also occur if injection is done into the tumor, which was avoided.</p>

            <title>Imaging protocol</title>
            <p>Planar gamma camera imaging was performed approximately 1 h after the <sup>99m</sup>Tc- nanocoll injection from the auditory canal to the symphysis in order to first localize the sentinel node (SN), (256 × 1024, 10 cm/min). This image was used to guide the SPECT/CT examination. A Siemens Symbia T16 (Symbia<sup>®</sup> Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a low energy, high-resolution collimator was used for all imaging.</p>
            <p>SPECT imaging was performed using a 128 × 128 matrix, 64 projections over 360° and 40 s per projection in non-circular, step and shoot mode. The subsequent CT scan had a tube current of 110 kV with quality ref. mAs 75mAs using CAREDose 4D<sup>®</sup> and pitch 1.3. Iterative reconstruction of the SPECT data was done with ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM, four iterations, eight subsets) including resolution recovery. Finally a gaussian postfilter was applied with 0.75 cm FWHM.</p>

            <p>Hermes Hybrid viewer (Hermes Medical solutions, Stockholm, Sweden) was used for image fusion and presentation of the images. The transverse SPECT slices were fused with the transverse CT slices (0.75 mm/ 0.7 mm recon increment, B31 medium smooth) and displayed as transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes. Furthermore the place of the injection had to be masked in order to emphasize the small uptake in a possible sentinel node. The focal <sup>99m</sup>Tc-nanocoll uptake/uptakes on SPECT corresponding lymph node on CT was considered as SN(s) and demonstrated to the operating surgeon.</p>

            <title>Intraoperative sentinel node detection</title>
            <p>All patients underwent open thoracoabdominal esophagectomy. Before dissection commenced, the perceived locations of the sentinel nodes according to the preoperative imaging, was marked with a suture. The whole operating field was then scanned with an intraoperative gamma probe (Neoprobe, Cincinnati, OH, USA) for identification of SNs, except for patient No. 1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475924TB1">1</xref>). A radioactivity with an intensity more than 10 times of background was defined as a SN. The distance between the suture marked location and the place of the SN identified by the intraoperative gamma probe was measured. The dissection of lymph nodes according to the Japanese classification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475924F1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C5">5</xref>) was then performed <italic>en bloc</italic> and the SNs were scanned again in the specimen back table and each lymph node station with sentinel nodes was sent for separate analysis. Cervical sentinel nodes encountered during preoperative imaging in distal esophageal or GE junction tumors were not dissected. All patients underwent a two-field lymphadenectomy including abdominal and mid-mediastinal lymph node stations and in some cases also proximal thoracic and cervical nodes.

            <p>SNs were detected by preoperative SPECT/CT in seven of eight cases. In one case (No. 3), a sentinel node only could be found intraoperatively with the gamma probe (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475924TB1">1</xref>). The median number of lymph node stations containing SNs was 2 (range, 0–2). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475924F2">2</xref> demonstrates a SN with SPECT/CT with and without image fusion. Thoracic and even cervical SNs, were found in patients with tumors of the GE junction, while one patient with a squamous cell carcinoma in the mid thoracic esophagus (No. 7) had a SN in the abdomen only demonstrated by SPECT/CT but not with the gamma probe. Four patients were clinically staged as N1. Among these cases, suspected metastases before neoadjuvant treatment according to CT coincided with the location of SNs as specified by the SPECT/CT in two cases (patients 6 and 8). In the remaining two cases suspected metastases were found with endoscopic ultrasound, which precluded any direct comparisons of the anatomical location of SN with the suspected metastases according to the clinical staging. The respective locations of all detected SNs are illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475924F1">1</xref>.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>There are several reasons why a major breakthrough has not been achieved for the SN technique in esophageal cancer. Identification of SN is difficult in patients with esophageal cancer metastatic spread to lymph nodes located far away from the primary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C6">6</xref>). Moreover, the esophagus passes through several body compartments and the procedure of acquiring SN in esophageal cancer may therefore reach a level of complexity that could make complete lymphadenectomy a more reasonable option. However, the addition of extensive lymphadenectomy and also neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may not be mandated allowing therapies with less postoperative morbidity and possibly also mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C8">8</xref>). We observed that hybrid SPECT/CT after endoscopic injection of radiocolloid seems to be a feasible method to improve SN detection prior to esophagectomy, with a sufficient resolution to distinguish lymph node stations with SNs as shown by the short distance between the perceived location of the SN according to the preoperative image and the location of the SN found by the intraoperative gamma probe. There are two explanations why SN not could be demonstrated preoperatively in all cases. SPECT/CT imaging was performed 1 h after injection of the radiocolloid and therefore, the accumulation of radiocolloid in SNs could increase after a longer time period. Another problem is the “shine through” phenomenon, which means that the high radiation at the injection site interferes with the imaging of adjacent SNs. In one case we were unable to locate one of the SNs with the gamma probe. The SN demonstrated with hybrid SPECT/CT had a very low activity and the small amount of radiocolloid in the SN may have become undetectable during the time between endoscopic injection and surgery. Sentinel nodes in the cardia and hiatus were undetectable by SPECT/CT in two of eight cases, possibly due to “shine through” whereas all SN stations in the mediastinum and along the celiac trunk were detected by both methods. The single case among our patients that had a false-negative SN biopsy had T3 squamous cell cancer and also a complete response in the primary tumor to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. As shown previously, the accuracy of SN biopsy is low in T3 squamous cell cancers or after chemoradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C2">2</xref>). On the contrary, the accuracy in SN biopsy may be better in adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and GE junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475924C4">4</xref>), but this needs to be addressed in larger studies. In conclusion, we hereby show that preoperative identification of SNs with hybrid SPECT/CT is a feasible technique, which may be useful for staging of cancer in the esophageal or GE junction. The important future indication for SN biopsy may be selected cases with T1b adenocarcinomas suitable for endoscopic resection, which have a significant risk of lymph node metastases. In such cases, esophagectomy could be avoided, provided that a SN biopsy is negative.</p>
