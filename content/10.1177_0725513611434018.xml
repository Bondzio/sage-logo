<italic>On Critique: A Sociology of Emancipation</italic> is a contribution to the sociology of critique, which as an empirical topic is at best a fledgling field. On the other hand, the book concerns the place of critique in sociology, self-evidently a matter of very wide relevance, and increasingly a matter of concern. What is critique? What are its social consequences? Can critique rise from the ashes again? It is over 200 years since Kant announced the ‘age of critique’, and surely that epoch cannot last indefinitely – or, as Bruno Latour put it, ‘why has critique run out of steam?’ In what ways is critical sociology challenged and transformed by the emergence of a sociology of critique?</p>
<p>Boltanski’s interest in the sociology of critique stretches over three decades, but came to wider notice with <italic>The New Spirit of Capitalism</italic>. Empirically, this work discussed the ‘projective’ spirit, the cultivation of engagement and commitment and ‘excellence’ in the workplace and how contemporary capitalism harnesses this ethos of innovation and dynamism. More significant was the analysis of how capitalism absorbs, incorporates and even profits from critiques against it. In particular, ‘aesthetic’ critiques that unmasked the boring, instrumental and constraining elements of companies were redeployed to enable high-level employees to put all their creative talents at the disposal of business. So the field is concerned with the various deployments of critique, as a real social phenomenon, rather than a solely academic tool.</p>
<p>I will resume the argument of <italic>On Critique</italic> briefly, suggest some problems, and then consider what the book means for the contemporary state of critique.</p>
<p>The work begins with an attempt to reconcile the pragmatic sociology of critique as deployed by ‘ordinary people’ with the metacritical theories of critical sociology, particularly in its Bourdieusian incarnation. An encounter between the two is inevitably under way as academic disciplines genuinely influence the ‘real world’. Boltanski’s synthesis attempts to overcome the localized limits of merely describing the capacity of actors for critique, and the demoralizing tendencies of ‘radical’ critiques, which often lack nuance. He salvages the way ‘the sociology of critique undertook to describe the world as the scene of a trial’ (p. 25); that is, analysis of the diverse flows of accusation and justification which make up disputes. From critical sociology he retains the ‘standpoint of totality’ which provides actors with ‘exteriorisation’ and ‘collective tools’ for critique; in short, a critical vision which transcends the locality of dispute (pp. 44–45). Boltanski avows that he is learning from the history of critique, and argues against ‘general unmasking’ – the nihilistic ‘dizzily exciting’ suspicion of everything (p. 114). While the author is too kind to list examples of this sort of critique, it clearly resembles his description of critical sociology. As a limit to excesses, Boltanski proposes that critiques should provide an alternative vision – although this does not have to be ‘utopian’, merely better.</p>
<p>Boltanski then links critique firmly to institutions, by which he means those elements which define or construct social reality. These are always necessary to deal with ‘uncertainty, which is at the heart of social life’ (p. 70). Institutions articulate and justify a certain state of affairs, and it is this ‘justification’ that links them to critique in Boltanski’s sense of ‘tests’. Institutions generally attempt to justify and naturalize themselves through <italic>truth tests</italic>, generally tautologies such as ‘the king is the king’ or ‘the committee acknowledges itself as the committee for acknowledging committees’. This meta-pragmatic confirmation of the institution nurtures everyday pragmatic, unreflective action: ‘When they succeed, their effect is not only to make reality accepted. It is <italic>to make it loved</italic>’ (p. 105, emphasis in original). However, the tendency for these truth tests to be unconvincing, particularly when events in the ‘world’ disrupt the social construction of ‘reality’, lead to more robust critiques. (For critics ‘reality’ is socially constructed, and always different from the real but partially unknown ‘world’ of nature or society which occasionally disrupts the constructed ‘reality’.) The particular tendency here is for crisis to lead to critique – and it is unfortunate that Boltanski does not engage here with the work of Koselleck, who gave this a firm historical grounding.</p>
<p>Therefore, critique is the subjection of institutions to tests, firstly by <italic>reality tests</italic> that measure real outcomes against articulated values – for example, assessing the concrete effects of policies of gender equality or the implementation of ‘mission statements’. Such tests can affirm or challenge the institution by generating meta-pragmatic reflexivity, but only within the bounds of the institution itself; ‘is this king the true king?’ or ‘has this committee been legitimately formed?’ Such challenges also have the effect of renewing or reforming the institution. Beyond these there are <italic>existential tests; </italic>these question the validity of the existing institutions and even the tests to which it subjects itself: To ask ‘should we have kings at all, and do our tests robustly assess their royalty?’ or ‘are committees appropriate instruments and are our criteria for forming them sufficient?’ would constitute an existential test of monarchy or bureaucracy. These tests are made in the name of genuine lived experience, both humiliation or suffering and even ‘the joy created by transgression when it affords access to some sort of authenticity’ (p. 108). Such tests come from outside the institution, even from outside the socially constructed ‘reality’, hailing from the ‘world’ whose uncertainty institutions keep at bay. Existential tests thereby expose the arbitrary nature of institutions, forcing them into change or justification.</p>
<p>In this we can see Boltanski’s ‘alternative vision’ – institutions subjected to constant critique. Rather than the eclipse of institutions, Boltanski would prefer reflexive institutions (pp. 154–155). This would unmask all forms of ‘domination’, that is, the unacknowledged institutional determination of social life, and replace it with ‘power’ which is explicit and must claim legitimacy via justification, and therefore is engaged with critique. Boltanski doesn’t view this as a cyclical process (institutions – crisis – critique – institutionalization – crisis – critique, which he compares to Weber’s model of legitimate domination), but a distinctive turn from domination and illusion to reflexivity about power.</p>
<p>All of the above is theory; but when Boltanski turns to the contemporary scene of capitalism there are clear difficulties. Contemporary capitalism is founded on constant change, on protean shifts in ‘tests’ which make critique play catch-up with institutions which don’t necessarily trouble themselves with consistent justification. Social change was once the ground for relativizing critique of the arbitrariness of institutions, but constant change undermines critique. Consequently, uncertainty is accepted rather than kept at bay by contemporary institutions, and often cited as justification for temporary arrangements, flexibilization and so forth. Simultaneously, the ‘reality’, say, of property rights is socially constructed and asserted fully, yet the intrusion of the ‘world’ – for instance, in the form of financial crashes – is smoothly incorporated by institutions that no longer accept responsibility for ‘reality’ but make it appear an inevitable ‘natural’ phenomenon. Even crises seem to exonerate the system which in fact causes them. More importantly, Boltanski’s contemporary capitalist partially resembles the critic. Institutional rules are seen as arbitrary, ‘handicaps’ to action in an uncertain world; instead, the preferred tactic is to interpret creatively or make new rules (‘Rules are for the little people’). Clear concrete examples of this are to be seen in the competitive banking culture worldwide, which recently bankrupted the Irish state. On such a world, critique has difficulty in gaining any purchase. A further similarity is capitalism’s future-orientation (change-making, embrace the future!) which corresponds to the requirement of an ‘alternative vision’ in critique.</p>
<p>Boltanski scarcely responds to these difficulties, other than insisting that critique is the only bulwark against domination, which must react against institutions’ injustice, and hoping ‘that the first victim … would be nothing other than the nation-state’ (p. 158), presumably because this is a target which will actually stand still long enough for critique to unmask it. Boltanski recommends the critique of the arbitrariness of property rights, an arbitrariness which he insists the dominant class is already aware of, and also a major questioning of ‘tests’ which judge people, specifically education, for the purposes of emancipating certain classes from domination. He insists that critique is necessary (inevitable?) as institutions will collapse without its challenge, and that critique’s meta-pragmatic questioning will unmask domination and replace it with reflexive emancipation. In support of this he insists that contemporary lack of interest in the state, and vague unease about certain tests (education, employment, elections), are further steps on the ‘eternal road of revolt’ (p. 158).</p>
<p>Clearly, even Boltanski finds critique to be floundering in the contemporary scene, and recognizes that critical sociology has its excesses. To what extent does his synthesized version of critique answer the challenge?</p>
<p>The first problem with the book as a whole is the absence of history. Institutions are clearly necessary to all societies, and if they must justify themselves this implies critique, which makes critique trans-historical. However, generally, critique is temporary – often confined to ritual scrutiny and renewal of institutions. Boltanski does not address why reflexivity becomes interminable in modern times. From this account, rituals always seem empty ceremonial formulae, and institutions are brittle and verging on being meaningless; the creative, persuasive and emotional power of these elements are de-emphasized so that ‘doubt is introduced and critique erupts’ (p. 83). In this account, institutions rarely appear capable of allaying uncertainty about reality and almost never of ‘making it loved’.</p>
<p>Boltanski’s assumption that uncertainty is always at the heart of social life is misleading – surely this is only the case in times of reflexivity and meta-pragmatic questioning. Moreover, while critique may take its genesis from the self-justification of institutions, surely institutions mainly exist to replace uncertainty or the ‘world’ with a social construction of reality, that is, a meaning for the world. Critical attempts to unmask institutions as arbitrary, ‘meaningless’ or ‘foundationless’ may not necessarily lead to better institutions but their ineffectuality or the generation of new institutions, that is, new social constructions of reality.</p>
<p>A further problem in this is the assumption that reflexivity lends itself exclusively to relativizing critique; another possibility would be scientific detachment, and though the two are historically linked they cannot be collapsed into each other. Other varieties of reflexivity might be creativity, or the celebration of cultural specificity. Boltanski objects to the Weberian position as circular (p. 116), and because it insists domination is ubiquitous and inevitable. To an extent unacknowledged in the text, Weber’s work closely foreshadows Boltanski, except with the word ‘charisma’ instead of ‘critique’ – charisma is a radical rupture with institutions and even inverts hierarchies. There is certainly something circular in the ‘institution-crisis-charisma-instiutionalization-crisis-charisma’ cycle, but historically there are innumerable examples of reflexivity fading back into routine, and Weber uses this to describe long-term processes of rationalization. However, charisma is not the same as critique. It is another potential response to crisis, a renewal of values, an invigoration of tradition that gives an answer to the meaning of the ‘world’ – one of Boltanski’s core concerns. Charisma and critique are responses to crises in social institutions; focusing exclusively on critical responses can only be justified if they pre-dominate in a particular society.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the question of the sociology of critique: If we are to examine critique as a social phenomenon, should we adopt its commitments? If we borrow the ‘tools’ of critical sociology, what are the consequences for our understanding? Boltanski’s work focuses on the pragmatic capacities of actors for critique in distinct situations, and it is important that these are recognized, rather than the actors being glossed as passive dupes of ubiquitous domination. Yet whether we agree with these ‘critical capacities’ is quite beside the point; for instance, many actors seek to expose the ‘arbitrary’ and constructed nature of ‘political correctness’. Of course, many would prefer to label this as an effect of domination, the institutional social construction of reality asserting itself again against ‘the world’ or even against ‘critique’, but critique as a social phenomenon is not co-extensive with the bounds of meta-critical critical sociology.</p>
<p>However, the wider diffusion of this ‘critical tool’ of ‘unmasking the arbitrary’ simply cannot be ignored by sociology. Furthermore, it forces sociology to reflect upon the nature of its ‘critical tools’. Is critique a non-cultural transcendent form of thought which exposes the social construction of reality so that institutions appear as they really are – arbitrary? Or could critique be a modern form of Gnosticism, which disfigures the world/reality as the creation of a demi-urge/domination? Of course, any critique of critique appears paradoxical, as critique is now unmasked as a mere ‘truth-claim’, something like power/knowledge in Foucault’s sense. Partially, Boltanski addresses this, arguing that ‘full exteriority’ from the social world is impossible, and hence any analyst inevitably partakes in local, specific critiques – but how often is critical theory posited as transcendent of particularity?</p>
<p>Having observed the play of critique in social disputes, Boltanski has sought to reconcile it with critical sociology, in order that critique be stronger and more powerful (p. 150). If this can generate more successful critiques and further emancipation, it is worthwhile. However, in my work I find that the sociology of critique is better served by the hermeneutic investigation of the meanings generated by critique, or a genealogy of critique, or an analysis of how critique is constitutive of modernity. In terms of concrete analysis, Boltanski observes how constant change and uncertainty is the preferred environment of contemporary capitalism. Confirmation of this is found in Thomas Frank’s analysis of the ‘critique of mass-society’ emerging in post-war America which has spread to the managerial manifestos of the corporate world, or in the ‘counter-cultural critique’ which is the dynamo of contemporary consumerism described in Heath and Potter’s <italic>Nation of Rebels</italic> (2005). Together these diagnose the contemporary currency of a critical attitude to rules as mere arbitrary constraints, and a vague hostility to institutions, always disfigured as constraints on freedom.</p>
<p>Without ignoring nuances, it is necessary to explore the similarities of Boltanski’s ideal critic and the sort of criticism which he eschews; that is, the excessive critic and the capitalist critic. All of them take their identity from transgressing existing institutions in some way, and all of them provide an alternative vision of the future; but Boltanski’s ideal critic is distinct in that it is in favour of explicit testable egalitarian rules. ‘No rules’ is as much a recipe for disaster as authoritarianism, as recent events in the ‘financial world’ have proved uncontrovertibly. As such, the ideal critic must do more than merely provoke crisis by unmasking and exposing the arbitrary. It should also be an ‘arbitrator’ – one who judges and discriminates – or even a <italic>kritikos </italic>(Greek for judge). Crisis also means a moment in which judgement becomes necessary, be it to justify or criticize, but also thereby to institute a testable rule for society. Moreover, the critic comes to the scene when existing institutions appear to fail, whether this is apparent to few or many or all. This is exactly the situation to which charisma responds. However, the resources of charisma are not just critique, transgression, or the exposure of the arbitrary; charisma renews institutions by rekindling older values, adapting tradition to new circumstances, always new but never a complete break from the past. Just as Boltanski argues that institutions rely upon critique, critique must also hope to form institutions rather than simply laying the social construction of reality bare. Without this, critique tends to excess and even nihilism.</p>
<p>To link critique to judgement and charisma may be unpalatable. Yet, as Boltanski demonstrates, academic critiques inevitably have social consequences. The task of exposing the arbitrariness of rules has probably run its course, and spurred the proliferation of nihilistic, trivial and capitalistic versions of critique. Rather than pursuing the eclipse of all institutions, the future of critique may be in testing robust, egalitarian and meaningful social institutions.</p>
