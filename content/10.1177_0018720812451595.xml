<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Combat identification (CID) is the capability to rapidly and accurately identify friendly, enemy, and neutral forces; manage and control the battlespace; and optimally employ weapons and forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451595">Defense Science Board, 1996</xref>). Accurate CID increases combat effectiveness and overall operational success, but it is generally the failures of CID that cause the most concern both operationally and nationally. Failure of a CID system can lead to fratricide (the inappropriate engagement of a friendly soldier or unit), neutricide (mistakenly engaging a neutral contact), and harm to oneself caused by failing to identify an enemy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451595">Harris &amp; Syms, 2002</xref>). Other negative effects include decreased morale and unit cohesion, loss of initiative, disruption of tempo (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812451595">Regan, 1995</xref>, pp. 98–132), and loss of “hearts and minds” of the local population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812451595">U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Fratricide and neutricide are fundamentally issues of human judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812451595">Regan, 1995</xref>, p. 240). Most instances can be related to either the loss of situation awareness (SA), misidentification of the target, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451595">Allegretti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451595">Harris &amp; Syms, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812451595">Snook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720812451595">Wilson, Salas, Priest, &amp; Andrews, 2007</xref>). SA and target identification, along with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), are considered the basic elements of CID (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812451595">Dean &amp; Handley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451595">Hart, 2007</xref>). Many features of the modern battlespace, however, increase the difficulty of CID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451595">Harris &amp; Syms, 2002</xref>). Weapons generally have longer ranges than in past conflicts, and targets can often be engaged before it is possible to acquire positive identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451595">Cruz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451595">Doton, 1996</xref>). A wide range of environmental conditions can reduce visibility or hinder the functioning of sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812451595">Kogler, 2003</xref>). Greater mobility has led to operational environments in which forces are more dispersed, making it more difficult to maintain good SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451595">Defense Science Board, 1996</xref>). All of these issues are exacerbated in high-tempo operations that decrease margins of error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451595">Harris &amp; Syms, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There are three main approaches to improving CID performance. The first is to address TTPs and training to increase soldier skill and discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812451595">Briggs &amp; Goldberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812451595">Greitzer &amp; Andrews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720812451595">Wood, 2001</xref>). Another is to support target identification in some fashion, typically by outfitting friendly units with some reliable indicator, such as an IFF (Identify-Friend-Foe) transponder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451595">Cruz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812451595">Karsh, Walrath, Swoboda, &amp; Pillalamarri, 1995</xref>). The third approach is to support SA, typically by providing so-called blue force tracking (BFT) systems. An example is the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below–Blue Force Tracking (FBCB2-BFT) system, fielded by the U.S. Army on vehicles in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812451595">Bitar &amp; Felsman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812451595">Rider, 2004</xref>). The FBCB2-BFT system consists of a computer, satellite antenna, and GPS receiver connected by line-of-sight radios and commercial L-band satellites. These systems form a tiered architecture using ground, airborne, and over-the-horizon relay to track friendly forces and collate their positions, which are transmitted to friendly units. The FBCB2-BFT delivers tactical- and operational-level pictures, including positions of friendly units in relation to one another.</p>
<p>The importance of SA to CID can be understood in terms of cognitive models of CID decision making, such as the “integrative combat identification entity relationship,” or INCIDER, model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812451595">Dean &amp; Handley, 2006</xref>). According to INCIDER, a soldier interacts with the battlespace through SA and sensing channels, which can be organic human senses or external sensors. Information from sensing channels is combined with SA knowledge by a mixture of fusion processes. Data are accumulated for friend, enemy, and neutral classifications until the evidence for one classification exceeds a decision threshold. The output of the fusion engine is a target classification with an associated level of confidence.</p>
<p>The INCIDER model is consistent with a broad class of decision models known as accumulator models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812451595">Vickers, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720812451595">Vickers &amp; Lee, 1998</xref>). These models operate by taking in discrete pieces of evidence and combining them according to some rule to reach a conclusion. A unique feature of INCIDER is the premise that the soldier will have an initial belief about the identity of a target as soon as it is encountered. This initial belief is based on SA and expectations of where enemy and friendly units will be located in the operational environment.</p>
<p>For a dismounted infantry soldier, a key element of SA is a spatial representation of the positions of friends and potential enemies in relation to one’s own position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812451595">Endsley et al., 2000</xref>). Soldiers need to know enemy locations to anticipate enemy fields of observation and predict enemy actions as well as friendly positions to adjust their fields of fire and avoid fratricide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812451595">Matthews, Strater, &amp; Endsley, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Positional knowledge affects the target identification process in two ways. First, as in the INCIDER model, position information can be used as a cue in evaluating a target. When a soldier sees a target at a presumed location of a friend, he or she can combine visual cues (uniform, weapon, etc.) with the position knowledge to facilitate the correct identification of the target. SA can include knowledge of both friend and enemy positions, but typically, soldiers will have more accurate knowledge of friendly positions, especially if BFT is available.</p>
<p>Positional knowledge can also serve as the basis of expectations concerning the true state of the battlespace and affect the decision thresholds needed to assign an identity to a target. Thus, belief that a friend occupies a specific location reduces the threshold for identifying a target at that location as a friend but also raises the threshold for identifying that target as an enemy. This dynamic reflects the general propensity for human judgment to be subject to expectation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812451595">De Martino, Kumaran, Seymour, &amp; Dolan, 2006</xref>). BFT should help in the identification of friends by providing evidence of a target’s friendly status to the identification process and by increasing the threshold level of evidence to identify it as an enemy. This aid should reduce the likelihood of fratricide but might also increase the risk of failing to identify a target that is actually an enemy.</p>
<p>IFF and BFT systems seem to be promising decision aids for CID, but so far, there has been little systematic evaluation of their impact on the performance of human decision makers. In one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812451595">Dzindolet, Pierce, Beck, Dawe, &amp; Anderson (2001)</xref> showed participants a series of pictures of a wooded terrain, of which 24% contained a camouflaged soldier, and asked them to indicate whether a soldier was present or absent in each. In an aided condition, participants received the output (present or absent) of a “computer program routine” that emulated an IFF system by providing an indication of the presence of a soldier. Participants were told that the decision aid could mistakenly indicate the presence of a soldier when one was not present or fail to indicate the presence of a soldier when one was present, and participants were given an estimate of the overall likelihood of an error. Dzindolet et al. found that the decision aid did not significantly improve participants’ CID performance, even when the aid provided highly accurate outputs. When aided, participants tended to overrely on the system output, making more errors when the system gave incorrect feedback than when feedback was correct. In a similar study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812451595">Karsh et al. (1995)</xref> found that availability of an IFF system did not reduce the participants’ fratricide rate compared with a control condition, although it did significantly reduce instances in which participants failed to identify enemy targets.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812451595">Bryant and Smith (2009)</xref> compared the impact of a handheld BFT device and rifle-mounted IFF on CID judgments in a simulated combat environment. Participants played the role of a dismounted infantry soldier in a dynamic, first-person-perspective gaming environment as friendly and enemy troops moved through the participant’s area of responsibility. Participants attempted to engage enemies in three conditions (with no decision support, with a rifle-mounted IFF, and with a handheld BFT). Results indicated that participants were both more accurate in engaging enemies and significantly less likely to mistakenly engage friends in both the IFF and BFT conditions. These results suggest, contrary to previous studies, that both an IFF and BFT system could improve CID judgments for the dismounted soldier. The difference in these results from earlier studies may be attributable to Bryant and Smith’s use of a dynamic simulated combat environment, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812451595">Dzindolet et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812451595">Karsh et al. (1995)</xref> used still pictures of targets as stimuli.</p>
<p>The benefit of BFT to SA likely depends, in part, on the proportion of friendly units for which timely and accurate position information can be obtained. Although the goal for a BFT system is to provide real-time position information, in practice, such systems typically suffer a lag of several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812451595">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>). Any wireless, ad hoc network will be subject to periodic loss of connectivity, limited bandwidth, and variable latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812451595">Suri et al., 2009</xref>). Existing BFT systems depend on communications networks that can be adversely affected by weather, terrain, equipment failure, or interference by outside sources, including deliberate disruption by the enemy. Thus, some degree of lag in the updating of positional information can be realistically expected, and such delays could seriously reduce the usefulness of a BFT device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812451595">Penny, 2002</xref>). Presumably, dismounted soldiers would require fairly precise information as they operate in relatively small areas. Thus, it is important to know how the CID judgments made by human operators will be affected by disruption or delays in updating BFT information.</p>
<p>Despite the paucity of empirical data on the effectiveness of BFT systems, several nations are proceeding with their acquisition and fielding (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451595">Hart, 2007</xref>). The experiment reported here is intended to provide insight into the potential benefit of a BFT device for the dismounted infantry soldier. Participants’ CID performance, in terms of accuracy in engaging enemies and avoiding fratricide, was compared between conditions in which participants had access to a handheld BFT system as opposed to no decision support. In addition, the experiment considered the impact of a realistic lag in the updating of positional information, given the technical limitations of BFT systems and wireless communications networks. In two conditions, participants had access to a BFT device that provided data that were 10 s old. In one case, participants were unaware of this lag, whereas in the other, participants were alerted to the lag.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 24 male and female participants at Defence Research and Development Canada–Toronto and local universities. All participants were ages 18 and older, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were unfamiliar with the experimental procedure and hypotheses. Two of the participants were military personnel, but neither had combat experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720812451595">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was conducted with use of the Instrumented Military Modeling Engine for Research using Simulation and Virtual Environments (IMMERSIVE) software platform. IMMERSIVE creates a first-person- erspective environment in which the participant assumes the role of a dismounted infantry soldier manning a fixed position. This platform was used to present participants with trials comprised of robotic computer controlled entities (bots) moving into view. The participant’s task was to engage (i.e., shoot) only those bots that were enemies. Participants remained at a specific fixed location in the simulated environment while targets entered their field of view. Participants used the computer mouse to control the direction of facing and to fire the weapon (by clicking the left mouse button).</p>
<p>Participants were provided with rules of engagement (ROE) at the beginning of the experimental session. The ROE distinguished friendly from enemy bots according to four characteristics of the soldier: (a) the weapon carried, (b) the uniform worn, (c) the type of walk (friendly bots walked upright whereas enemy bots walked in a semicrouched posture), and (d) whether the soldier had his or her rifle aimed. An example of a friendly bot is shown on the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812451595">Figure 1</xref> and an enemy bot on the right. To establish a mission context, participants were told that intelligence reports had indicated that enemy combatants were planning to attack a local orphanage to spark conflicts among various ethnic and political factions. Thus, it was crucial for participants to stop enemy combatants passing their position.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812451595-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>Participants performed a total of 100 trials across five blocks with 50% friend and 50% enemy bots. In each block, a total of 20 bots (10 friends and 10 enemies) were in motion, following prespecified paths at prespecified times. The bots traveled into and out of view sequentially so that no two bots were visible to the participant at the same time. To control for effects of position and path of movement, a friendly and enemy bot started at the same position and followed the same path on different trials in each block. Thus, participants encountered a friend and enemy following the same path in the same conditions. The order in which bots moved along the paths followed one of two orders (forward and reverse).</p>
<p>The IMMERSIVE software logged each instance in which the participant fired the rifle and the identity of the bot fired on. The primary experimental measure was decision accuracy (i.e., whether the participant engaged a hostile or friendly bot). To capture such events as intended engagements, the software logged for each shot fired whether it hit a bot and, if not, how close the shot was to a bot (i.e., minimal distance between shot and bot). Shots fired within a certain distance of a bot (approximately 1 m in the simulated environment) were counted as engagements. (Because the criterion for engagement was a fixed distance with respect to a bot, the angular displacement from rifle to bot varied somewhat with the distance of the bot to the subject’s firing position. However, angular displacements were not computed for each shot because the range of firing angles associated with engagements was fairly small.) Participants received no feedback in any condition to avoid learning effects. Feedback on false alarms (FAs), in particular, would be expected to alter participants’ decision thresholds.</p>
<p>Response times were not considered because it was impossible to distinguish the target detection and target identification aspects of the task. Participants did not provide any observable indication that they had detected a target. Thus, overall response times measured from the first appearance of a target would contain varying amounts of time reflective of the presence but not detection of that target, making response times unreliable indicators of CID performance across targets.</p>
<p>In four of the five experimental conditions, participants could call up a simulated BFT device as a decision aid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812451595">Figure 2</xref>). The device, which was modeled on a PDA, presented a top-down map of the local area. Superimposed on the map were blue dots representing the position of friendly soldiers. Participants could call up the BFT device at any time during the experiment by pressing a specified key on the computer keyboard.</p>

<sec id="section11-0018720812451595">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The experiment employed a single-group, pretest-posttest design to control for potential effects of participant learning across the course of the experiment. Participants performed the first block of trials with no decision support system (no DSS) to serve as an initial pretest of CID performance. They performed the second block with access to a BFT that provided real-time data on friendly bots’ positions (BFT). This block was also a pretest to establish participants’ baseline performance with access to completely accurate positional information. The next two blocks served as experimental treatments in which the position information provided by the BFT lagged by 10 s after events in the simulated environment (i.e., positions indicated by the BFT were 10 s old). In the third block, participants were not warned about the data lag (10-s no warning), whereas in the following block, participants were told that BFT data lagged by 10 s (10-s warning). All participants followed this order of blocks; otherwise, participants who received the warning first would be cued to detect the lag in the unwarned condition. In the final block (end BFT), the BFT returned to real-time data, which served as a final baseline to determine whether any practice or fatigue effects had occurred.</p>
<p>The choice of a 10-s delay was somewhat arbitrary, but this time interval is a plausible update lag for BFT systems in an urban environment likely to contain various dead spots and interference affecting connectivity and available bandwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812451595">Suri et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, a 10-s delay would be a significant improvement compared with earlier systems. The U.S. Army, for example, set a target refresh rate of 10 s for an updated FBCB2-BFT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812451595">Osborne, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Providing a real-time BFT device led participants to exhibit greater hit rate and lower FA rate than observed when participants had no decision support. Adding a 10-s delay to the updating of position information in the BFT significantly impaired participants’ ability to identify enemies relative to real-time BFT. Although participants’ hit rates were not significantly different from the initial and end-BFT conditions in either the 10-s no-warning or 10-s warning conditions, participants’ <italic>d′</italic> did significantly differ between those conditions. In addition, the 10-s delay significantly increased participants’ FA rate. Thus, participants were as likely to commit fratricide when using a lagged BFT as when they had no decision support, whether they were warned of the lag or not. Finally, participants exhibited a strong response bias toward engaging targets in both 10-s delay conditions, compared with essentially zero or small negative bias in the BFT and end-BFT conditions. Overall, a delay in BFT updating made participants significantly more likely to commit fratricide.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fratricide is a prevalent threat on the battlefield (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812451595">Briggs &amp; Goldberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451595">Defense Science Board, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451595">Harris &amp; Syms, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812451595">Regan, 1995</xref>). In the near future, it will likely be possible to place BFT devices on individual dismounted soldiers to enhance SA. The results of this experiment confirm that SA is a critical part of the CID decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812451595">Dean &amp; Handley, 2006</xref>). Enhancing SA with a real-time BFT resulted in considerably better performance relative to unaided judgments. This effect, however, depended on highly accurate and timely positional information, and a short lag in the update of the BFT eliminated any benefit to the decision maker.</p>
<p>According to the INCIDER model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>), when BFT provides timely and accurate position information, the user’s CID performance is improved because that position information serves as a cue in an evidence accumulation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812451595">Vickers, 1979</xref>). However, when BFT provides inaccurate information, the user lacks a useful cue. In this case, the user has only the information available to a soldier without a BFT and is as likely to mistakenly identify the friend as an enemy. If the user knows that the BFT device is providing inaccurate position information, he or she could conceivably compensate by mentally estimating the true positions of friends. This estimation would be very difficult, however, as the movements of friends are unpredictable. Moreover, the mental effort of estimating the positions of all friends is likely too demanding to be practical.</p>
<sec id="section20-0018720812451595">
<title>Appropriateness of Trust in the System</title>
<p>Despite being told of the lag in data update in the 10-s warning condition, participants exhibited roughly the same FA rate as they did in the 10-s no-warning condition. Participants could have been expected to be more cautious or to rely on the BFT less when a warning was given. Given that the FA rates in the 10-s no-warning and 10-s warning conditions were about the same as that of the no-DSS condition, the simplest explanation for this finding is that participants disregarded the BFT in both lagged conditions. The BFT usage data, however, indicated that participants consulted the BFT as frequently as in the baseline and end-BFT conditions, in which FA rates were considerably lower.</p>
<p>It is not clear why participants relied on the BFT to the same degree in the 10-s warning and 10-s no-warning conditions. Although researchers have focused on the competence of a decision aid as the key factor determining users’ reliance, other factors play a role, such as attitudes toward automation, perceptions of one’s own competence, and the availability of feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451595">Beck, Dzindolet, &amp; Pierce, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812451595">Merritt and Ilgen (2008)</xref> suggest that when a user is unable to accurately gauge the competence of a decision aid, his or her reliance is more likely to be guided by personal factors, such as a disposition to trust automation.</p>
<p>In attempting to explain a user’s overreliance on a support system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451595">Beck et al. (2007)</xref> distinguishes between appraisal errors, in which the user is unable to assess the system’s competence, and intent errors, in which the user opts to disregard the system’s competence. They note that efforts to mitigate appraisal errors do not necessarily reduce misuse, because factors promoting intent errors remain. In the current experiment, the warning provided to participants about the 10-s lag was intended to help them more accurately assess the reliability of the BFT. Participants, however, may have been unable to translate the 10-s lag into a clear assessment of error. Thus, they may have made an appraisal error and decided that the lagged BFT remained a useful decision aid. (Participants’ trust in the BFT may have been bolstered by the initial BFT condition, in which the device displayed completely accurate, real-time data. Participants may have trusted the BFT less if they had experienced lag or other issues, for example, dropped signal, in the initial trial.) Alternatively, participants may have decided to continue to rely on a lagged BFT because they estimated their own ability to perform the task to be even worse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812451595">Lee &amp; Moray, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812451595">1994</xref>). In fact, participants’ unaided performance was not much worse than that of the 10-s warning and 10-s no-warning conditions.</p>
<p>Inaccurate position information may present a greater problem than simply denying useful information. The INCIDER model proposes that a soldier will always have, from the moment of detection, a preconception regarding the identity of a target based on evolving SA during a mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451595">Dean et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, incoming evidence about a detected target has to overcome the soldier’s initial preconception to change the target’s presumed classification. This model suggests that soldiers will have a confirmatory bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812451595">Klayman, 1995</xref>) in their CID judgments. Indeed, participants exhibited a marked bias to engage targets in the 10-s no-warning and 10-s warning conditions. Thus, inaccurate SA can be particularly dangerous, as it affects soldiers’ preconceptions regarding targets.</p>

<sec id="section21-0018720812451595">
<title>Effect of BFT Latency</title>
<p>Another important question concerns the conditions in which BFT aids CID decision making. The finding that a 10-s delay in updating reduced the effectiveness of BFT for a dismounted soldier in an urban environment begs the question of what length of delay is problematic in general. Given the results, a 10-s delay is significant to a soldier operating on foot in a small-scale urban environment. For a unit operating across a larger-scale environment, however, a 10-s lag would result in a smaller discrepancy between the displayed and actual positions in a BFT.</p>
<p>Research on human spatial cognition supports the notion that people represent small-scale (immediately perceptible environments) and large-scale (environments requiring exploration) spaces differently in terms of reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812451595">Tversky, 2003</xref>) and granularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812451595">Montello, 1993</xref>). Representations of large-scale spaces have less granularity than those of small-scale spaces, and locations correspond to larger objects or landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812451595">Timpf &amp; Kuhn, 2003</xref>). With a larger scale, mental representations of large environments cannot represent movements across very short periods. That is, considering a larger operational area, 10 s would probably not be sufficient time for a soldier to move an appreciable distance relative to the internal scale of that cognitive map. However, a longer lag in a large-scale environment would be expected to produce a similar decrement in the effectiveness of a BFT system as a decision aid. Thus, the results of this experiment are limited to CID performed by dismounted soldiers. Both the speed with which things move and the complexity of the operational environment (i.e., the amount of clutter and features that can obscure the movements of units) are also factors that play a role in determining the granularity of a soldier’s spatial representation and, hence, the impact of data lag on the effectiveness of BFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812451595">Tversky, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Representing Uncertainty</title>
<p>The question arises whether it is possible to mitigate the negative impact of data lag on BFT users’ CID performance. A simple warning was not sufficient, although more rigorous SA training could help users deal with an unreliable decision aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812451595">Bolstad, Endsley, &amp; Cuevas, 2010</xref>). It may be possible to derive greater benefit from a BFT by representing the positional uncertainty that results from data lag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812451595">Neyedli, Wang, Jamieson, &amp; Hollands, 2010</xref>). Considerable work has been done, especially in the context of geographical information systems (GIS), to develop practical means to represent uncertainty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812451595">Harrower, 2003</xref>). Much of the research supports the option of displaying a representation of the temporal and spatial uncertainty associated with displayed information rather than as a part of a separate display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812451595">Edwards &amp; Nelson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812451595">Evans, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A way to represent spatial uncertainty on a map display is to use circles or ellipses to encompass an area in which an entity might be located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812451595">Edwards &amp; Nelson, 2001</xref>). A drawback of this approach, however, is the need to develop a model of entity dispersion that can predict potential direction and extent of motion by entities displayed on the BFT. Another technique is to manipulate free graphical variables associated with the symbology of an information display. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812451595">MacEachren et al. (2005)</xref> suggest that color saturation, crispness, transparency, and resolution as candidates well suited to representing uncertainty. For example, elements with a high degree of certainty could be displayed in pure hues, with increasingly less certain elements displayed in progressively less saturated color. Finally, additional static objects (e.g., labels, images, or glyphs) can be added to the display symbols to communicate uncertainty. For example, symbols depicting entities in a GIS can be appended with elements such as slides, bars, or dots that convey an associated degree of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812451595">McFadden, Li, &amp; Trinh, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Work</title>
<p>Given normal operational conditions that include inclement weather, dust, and other environmental factors that can disrupt the functioning of BFT devices, it is crucial to further examine how the decision making of the human operator will be affected by factors that reduce his or her effectiveness. It will be important in future research to conduct evaluations in real-world settings as well as simulation platforms. Although the IMMERSIVE platform used here presents an engaging and challenging CID task, it is a low-fidelity simulation. It uses low-resolution graphics and, more importantly, dramatically simplifies the task and environmental conditions in which a soldier operates. Many of the effects observed in a simulation environment will likely be attenuated or otherwise affected by the kinds of operational factors (weather, stress, etc.) that cannot be easily simulated in the laboratory. It may be that the negative effect of lag can be partially mitigated when a BFT is used in combination with other communication and command-and-control devices.</p>
<p>Future experiments should also include trained soldiers, preferably with combat experience. Experienced soldiers would likely be more conservative in firing decisions than would the untrained participants in the current experiment. They may also show less trust in a BFT that does not present real-time data. More research is also needed to determine whether immediate feedback on firing decisions affects a user’s trust in BFT. Presumably, knowing that a fratricide has been committed would make users more cautious and biased against firing at a target.</p>
<p>The experiment employed a pretest-posttest design to avoid contamination of the 10-s warning condition. This design, however, may have contributed to participants’ inappropriate trust in the lagged BFT, because all participants initially experienced a perfectly accurate, real-time BFT. Participants who experience a lagged BFT first, and are warned of the lag, may exhibit less trust in the BFT overall and especially in lagged conditions in which no warning is provided. Given that we found no difference between the 10-s warning and 10-s no-warning conditions in the current pretest-posttest design, it is possible to employ a factorial design in future experiments to explore such potential order effects. The length of data lag also needs to be systematically examined to define its impact on CID performance across a wider range of operational environments.</p>
<p>The experiment reported here is an initial step in evaluating the usefulness of BFT for dismounted infantry soldiers. Future research must determine the extent to which the results generalize to more realistic operational conditions, user populations, and training and feedback conditions. Given the tremendous cost of fratricide, replicating the negative impact of data lag, even to a smaller degree, in more realistic operational conditions would mean that careful attention must be paid to the way users of BFT are trained and to the design of interfaces that can convey error and uncertainty.</p>
