<abstract>
<p>This article reviews the basic concepts of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and its uses in theoretical and empirical planning literature. Continuing a discussion among planning theorists that was initiated at the 2003 ACSP/AESOP Joint Congress, the authors respond to specific gaps identified in papers presented at that conference. Specifically, the authors review the literature on SNA within disciplines related to planning and empirical planning studies using SNA. The authors find that the knowledge base on SNA specifically and network analysis generally is highly fragmented along disciplinary lines, contributing to the critique that it is a fuzzy concept.</p>

<body>
<p>The use of social network analysis (SNA) in many social science disciplines has increased exponentially over the past two decades. Although documented applications of SNA in planning research and practice are still quite rare, instances of its use in planning’s allied disciples of sociology, management, economic geography, and political science are increasingly common. Journals including the <italic>Annals of Regional Science</italic> (2009); <italic>American Politics Research</italic> (2009); <italic>Methodological Innovations Online</italic> (2009); and <italic>Innovation: Management Policy and Practice</italic> (2010) have published special issues focused on the use of SNA within their respective disciplines. Individual papers—many of which are reviewed or cited herein—have demonstrated the applicability of SNA to a wide variety of social science problems relevant to planning, from studies concerning the nature of “community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885412211411092">Wellman 1979</xref>, 2001b); to collective action in estuarine management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885412211411092">Scholz, Berardo, and Kile 2008</xref>); to public participation in the redevelopment process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885412211411092">Holman 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0885412211411092">Rydin and Holman 2004</xref>); to innovation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885412211411092">Fagerberg and Verspagen 2006</xref>); to environmental management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885412211411092">Davies 2002</xref>); and supply chain management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885412211411092">Borgatti and Li 2009</xref>). Social network analysts themselves have addressed the broader use of network analysis in the social sciences and increasingly, the physical sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>). With rapidly growing interest in the potential uses of SNA, it is both appropriate and timely to review its applications and potential within the field of urban planning.</p>
<p>Within the discipline of planning itself, planning theorists have wrestled with whether networks represent a new paradigm for planning; how they relate to and organize space and time; and their potential to influence the process of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412211411092">Albrechts and Mandelbaum 2005</xref>). Growing out of the 2003 Joint Conference of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning and the Association of European Schools of Planning, The Network Society: A New Context for Planning is a compilation of eighteen papers on the subject with commentaries by several leading planning theorists. Within this volume, two essays, one by Innes and the other by Fainstein, represent both the divergence of opinion among planners with respect to networks and the common conclusion that more information is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211411092">Innes 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885412211411092">Fainstein 2005</xref>). This article responds to Innes' call to review the base of knowledge in related disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211411092">Innes 2005</xref>, 60), and to the common observation of the lack of empirical research. By introducing the field of SNA proper, as opposed to the generic term “network analysis,” this article also seeks to address Fainstein’s critique of network analysis as a “fuzzy concept” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885412211411092">Fainstein 2005</xref>, 223). One unavoidable observation from this volume is the complete lack of reference to the specific field or methods of SNA that are described in this article. The fact that just five years ago a volume of 347 pages with 26 highly esteemed contributing authors from the field of planning could present a coherent, balanced, and comprehensive discussion of the role of networks in planning without a single reference to the field or methods of SNA is itself worthy of reflection. Is this simply an indicator of how rapidly the field of SNA has emerged, or does it reveal some insular tendencies within the planning academy? We do not answer this question, but offer it along with the research that follows as reflective practitioners in an effort to advance the debate initiated in The Network Society.</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, planning scholars and practitioners argued that the traditional, top-down, expert-driven, and often unrepresentative, “rational” planning process was not effective in addressing the types of problems we might now refer to as “wicked problems” and “social dilemmas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885412211411092">Arnstein 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412211411092">Davidoff 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412211411092">Jacobs 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0885412211411092">Rittel and Webber 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0885412211411092">Ostrom 1998</xref>). A wide range of “alternative” participatory theories and approaches evolved over the last half century to address problems arising from limited or ineffective involvement of key actors and the general public in planning processes, including advocacy, equity, consensus building, and communicative planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412211411092">Davidoff 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885412211411092">Krumholz and Forester 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885412211411092">Innes 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>). Although theoretical and practical debate about how to plan in the face of uncertainty and competing interests continues to be lively, the inherently embedded nature of actors in networks is a cross-cutting and consistent theme. The eighteen papers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412211411092">Albrechts and Mandelbaum (2005)</xref> explore five variations of that theme: (1) whether a network view of society is a new paradigm for planning; (2) the impact of physical networks; (3) the organization of space and time; (4) local networks and capital building; and (5) governance capacity and policy networks. Despite the lack of reference to SNA or citations of some of its core texts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211411092">Wasserman and Faust 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412211411092">Scott 1991</xref>; or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412211411092">Granovetter 1973</xref>), the five variations resonate in the network analysis literature reviewed below.</p>
<p>Innes and Booher present a useful conceptual model of “network power” as part of their body of work over the last fifteen years on collaborative planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412211411092">Booher and Innes 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 2010</xref>). They argue that the diversity and interdependence of actors are tremendous assets in planning processes that can be leveraged to produce better outcomes of the particular planning process in question as well as adaptations to the ongoing system of actors and interests over time. Yet, understanding and harnessing those assets in a constructive way is a tremendous challenge because of the complexity associated with the diversity and interdependence of actors. In our view, although the planning literature has begun to engage network issues from multiple angles, empirical knowledge of how actors in planning processes are embedded within networks and how the structure of those networks serves to enable or inhibit individual and joint action to address wicked problems and social dilemmas is underdeveloped. We review the empirical work that does exist and argue that SNA is a promising approach for exploring questions along these lines.</p>
<p>This article seeks to answer five questions concerning the use of SNA in urban planning research and practice. (1) What is social network analysis? (2) What unique value does SNA offer compared to other approaches and methods commonly used in planning? (3) What bodies of social science literature can planners turn to for ideas on how SNA might be applicable to planning? (4) For what types of planning problems and processes does the use of social network analysis offer significant benefits? and (5) How has social network analysis been applied in planning research or practice and what contributions have these applications made?</p>
<p>The answers to the first two questions provide an overview of key SNA concepts and place SNA as a methodology within the broader toolbox of methods commonly used in planning research. The answer to the third question relates SNA to the concerns of planning theory, particularly those of communicative action and equity planning as advocated by Forester, Krumholz, and Friedmann, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885412211411092">Friedmann 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885412211411092">Krumholz and Forester 1990</xref>). We argue that SNA does not replace the relationship building and political savvy that these authors describe in their respective works. It does, however, provide a useful tool for visualizing, analyzing, understanding, and remembering complex networks of actors in support of the judgment and relationship building they advocate. For answers to the fourth question, we draw on and adapt research on the use of SNA in the field of political science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412211411092">Heaney and McClurg 2009</xref>). The answer to the final question draws from a relatively small number of documented applications of SNA that fall within the domain of planning and urban studies. Planners often draw on the concepts and literature of related disciplines, and determining which papers belong to “planning” and which belong to “related disciplines” is not always clear. Drawing on a broad literature review, we identify three types of planning-oriented papers using SNA. These include (1) papers focusing on issues of community and social capital and (2) papers focusing on issues of collective action and governance, both of which can be grounded in any subfield of planning (i.e., economic development, land use, transportation, etc.); and (3) papers primarily focusing on substantive issues in planning subfields. We review these three clusters of literature and conclude with a brief discussion of potential applications of SNA in areas of planning that have yet to be undertaken.</p>

<title>What is SNA?</title>
<p>SNA is both a theoretical perspective on how the interactions of individual autonomous actors form the social structures of community and a set of analytical tools to analyze those interactions and social structures as networks of nodes (actors) and ties (relationships). Some earlier scholars questioned the claim that SNA represents a distinct body of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412211411092">Scott 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885412211411092">Watts 2008</xref>). More recently, other scholars have offered compelling evidence suggesting the emergence of SNA as a body of theory in its own right and not just a set of methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>). Several papers apply social network concepts without actually using the analytical methods. This would tend to support the latter position of an emerging theoretical discipline.</p>
<p>Social networks are one among multiple domains in which network analysis approaches are considered useful. Drawing from these domains, we place SNA in a useful context for understanding what is both familiar and unique about SNA. Newman identifies four “loose categories” of network analysis, including: (1) social networks, such as forms of contact or interaction between individuals; (2) information networks, such as links in the World Wide Web and academic citation networks; (3) technological networks, such as water, transportation, and energy systems; and (4) biological networks, such as food webs with predators, prey, and decomposers (2003, 5).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0885412211411092">1</xref>
</sup> All four categories of approaches share a common empirical focus on relational structure and a similar set of mathematical analyses. Although the evolution of each type of network approach has varied, empirical analysis has historically been limited to smaller, dense networks and the visualization of those networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0885412211411092">Newman 2003</xref>). This is especially true of social networks drawn from costly-to-collect data sources such as interviews and surveys. More recently, development of improved statistical models and a shift toward using data from available affiliation networks (e.g., company directors serving on the same boards of directors and coauthorship among scholars) has enabled increasingly systematic analysis of larger and more complex networks of all kinds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0885412211411092">Newman 2003</xref>). Rapid growth in the study of networks has been described as a “dramatic surge” crossing a wide range of disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885412211411092">Butts 2009</xref>, 325). What is unique about SNA as compared to the other three types of network analyses is its utility in theorizing about and systematically analyzing the competing forces of individual agency and structural social forces. This notion frames several critical debates regarding SNA and should be of interest to planners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0885412211411092">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>SNA has been criticized and defended as both a conceptual approach and an analytic methodology. One of the debates concerns SNA’s status and validity as a theoretical discipline that encompasses more than a set of analytical methods. A second, somewhat related criticism focuses on the issue of agency among actors in the network. Social network theory suggests that an actor’s behavior and outcomes are determined to some extent by network structure, and this contention has been criticized by scholars who view actors' behavior and outcomes as the result of choices made by the actors themselves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0885412211411092">3</xref>
</sup> Some authors take a more nuanced approach. Rather than viewing network structure and agency as mutually exclusive, they contend that actors exhibit agency, but network structure constrains the choices available to them. In turn, the actors' choices influence the structure of the network over time (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412211411092">Safford 2009</xref>). Additional debate focuses on how actors' awareness and understanding (or misunderstanding) of the structure of the network in which they are embedded shapes their behavior, and whether this in turn affects network structure. This debate in particular is reflected in the communicative planning literature. For example, Innes and Booher have categorized four types of results that typically arise from collaborative planning processes, each of which relate to how planning networks can change over time: (1) increased awareness of reciprocal interests among stakeholders, (2) new relationships, (3) single and double-loop learning that can reframe understandings of problems and interests, and (4) adaptations to the network itself as perceptions and practices change and new partnerships and institutions arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Returning to the agency–environment debate, the reflexive response is to position SNA on the side of environment. However, this position is less clear in our reading of the literature, as the forgoing (previous instead of forgoing??) discussion illustrates. Perhaps, networks and network analysis belong neither to agency nor environment, but instead represent a mediating concept between agency and environment. Thus, networks may represent one of the mechanisms by which environments constrain the choices of individual agents at any given moment, but also one of the mechanisms by which agents alter their environment over time. Because network analysis considers and measures both the influence of individual agents on the entire network and the influence of the entire network on individual agents, the nature of the debate changes significantly. The either–or debate between agency and environment not only presents a false choice, it also presents a meaningless one; replaced instead by a much richer discussion of the dynamic interplay between agency and environment. While the tools of network analysis make this dynamic interplay apparent, it is the theory of social networks that allows us to interpret it.</p>
<sec id="section2-0885412211411092">
<title>A Brief History of SNA</title>
<p>While all forms of network analysis may be traced back to Euler’s development of Graph Theory (mathematics) in 1736, the antecedents of SNA in particular extend to Comte’s notion of “social physics” in the early 1800s. Durkheim’s comparison of societies to biological systems fifty years after Comte suggested that the reasons for social irregularities were to be found in the structure of social environments in which actors were embedded. The development of Field Theory and Gestalt psychology are also widely credited antecedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885412211411092">Crossley, Prell, and Scott 2009</xref>; O’Kane, McGinley, and Kelly 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412211411092">Scott 1991</xref>). Accounts of SNA’s historical development diverge between European and U.S. perspectives, but they merge in the 1930s with Sociometry and Jacob Moreno’s study of teenage runaways from the Hudson School in upstate New York. Moreno and his colleague Helen Jennings measured and mapped the friendship ties between girls at the school as a social network in what Moreno called a “sociogram.” Noting that these friendship ties depict a structure of influence that even the girls themselves were unaware of, Moreno argued that the position of the girls within the network structure determined whether they ran away, and if so, when (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885412211411092">Moreno 1934</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1940s, 50s, and 60s saw continued development of “structural” approaches involving the mapping of actors and relationships as networks, and the use of matrix algebra and graph theory to manipulate and analyze those structures mathematically. Influential studies include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885412211411092">Davies, Gardner, and Gardner’s (1941)</xref> study of social status among women in the Deep South; the work of Bavelas and the Group Networks Lab at MIT on the effect of communication network structures on problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>); and Bott’s (1957) study of kinship and social networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885412211411092">Davies, Gardner, and Gardner (1941)</xref> were able to identify cliques and social status among a group of women based on their attendance patterns at a series of social events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211411092">Wasserman and Faust 1994</xref>). Bavelas and his team at MIT quantified the importance of coordination in the efficient functioning of human networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>). Bott’s anthropological study examined the influence of social networks on spousal roles among British families, finding that the types of network ties indeed influenced whether spouses shared responsibilities or held to a traditional division of responsibilities between husband and wife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885412211411092">Bott 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>Sociologists during this period also began applying SNA techniques to studies that have shaped our current understanding of community structure and urbanism. For example, Fischer’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885412211411092">1948</xref> study of social networks in California found that urbanization decreases network density, and a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0885412211411092">1949</xref> study by Hollingshead documented the influence of cliques on adolescent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By the 1970s, an influential group of sociologists had adopted SNA. Led by Lorraine and White, who were focused on issues related to roles, network position, and structural equivalence, several students emerged as influential scholars in the field. Mark Granovetter’s The Strength of Weak Ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885412211411092">1983</xref>) has been widely cited, shaping our understanding of network interactions in a number of disciplines. Barry Wellman’s work has shaped our understanding of what “community” means and has influenced the study of social capital in multiple disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885412211411092">Wellman 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>). The strong influence of sociologists has continued since the 1970s, although influential work by scholars in allied disciplines is increasingly common. A sampling of these scholars will be reviewed later in this article.</p>

<title>Modeling and Measuring a Social Network</title>
<p>Networks may be modeled using dots or “nodes” to represent actors in the network, and lines between the dots to represent the relationships or “ties” between actors. Actor attributes are measures associated with the nodes and the full set of actor attributes is the network composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211411092">Wasserman and Faust 1994</xref>). The pattern of all the ties between actors is the network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211411092">Wasserman and Faust 1994</xref>). Two actors (nodes) and the relationship (tie) between them form the simplest possible network known as a dyad. It is possible to measure the structure of a network from the perspective of a single actor, and this perspective is called an ego network. The actor at the center of this perspective is called the “ego,” while all the actors he or she is connected to are referred to as “alters.” Ego networks may also be referred to as “personal communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0885412211411092">Wellman 1999</xref>). A subtle but important point is that while network measures of ego networks produce values that may be analyzed in combination with actor attributes (e.g., in econometric models), they have not become actor attributes. Rather, they remain descriptions or “snapshots” of the network from the perspective of each individual actor.</p>
<p>Moving from picturing a social network as a graph made up of nodes and lines to relational data that can be analyzed using matrix algebra techniques requires the construction of an adjacency matrix. The row and column headings for an adjacency matrix are identical, listing the names of the actors involved in the network. In the simplest case, the cells of the matrix are coded with a “1” if a tie exists between the actors or “0” if no tie exists.</p>
<p>Ties may also be “valued.” Values indicate a characteristic of the relationship that the research has quantified, for example, measurements of the intensity of interaction. Ties may also be “directed.” For example, the relationship “lends money to” is a directed relationship. Graphically, this would be depicted using arrowheads on the lines connecting nodes. In matrix form, row actors “send” ties to column actors. Thus, if Jill lends money to Jen, the (Jill, Jen) cell would be set to “1” while the (Jen, Jill) cell would be set to “0.”</p>
<p>Social networks analysis tends to follow two different models of organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412211411092">Borgatti et al. 2008</xref>) depending on the goal of the analysis. Architectural models tend to focus on the structure of the network, seeking to discern whether specific structures lead to similar outcomes, or whether actors in similar network positions behave in similar ways. Planning applications related to the social and spatial structure of “community” tend to be organized and analyzed as architectural models. Flow models view the network as a system of pathways along which things flow between actors. Analysis of flow models can, for example, identify which actors in the network are more active, or which ones are more powerful. Flow models are good for evaluating processes, as will be shown in the review of public participation in the planning process.</p>
<p>Numerous analytical measures of social networks have been developed to help evaluate network structure and flow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0885412211411092">4</xref>
</sup> These measures can be applied at the node level and at the network level, and some measures can be applied to both. Some are intuitive and easy to calculate, such as degree, which is measured as the number of actors directly connected to any given actor. Others are more complicated and computationally intensive, such as “betweenness” centrality, which measures the centrality of an actor in the network based on how much others depend on that actor for connectivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211411092">Wasserman and Faust (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412211411092">Scott (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885412211411092">Jackson (2008)</xref> are recommended references for descriptions of the theory and uses, as well as the formal calculation, of these measures.</p>

<title>What Unique Value Does SNA Offer Compared to Other Approaches and Methods Commonly Used in Planning?</title>
<p>SNA is both a conceptual approach to social science research and a set of methods to model and measure the relationships between actors. There are four key points that will help readers new to SNA understand (1) how it differs from traditional approaches to social science research; (2) how it relates to those traditional approaches; (3) how networks are constructed, manipulated, and measured; and (4) what value SNA offers beyond traditional approaches.</p>
<p>The first point is illustrated nicely by the well-known saying “it’s not what you know, but who you know” that matters when it comes to access and opportunity. This saying implies that there are two types of knowledge—technical (what you know) and relational (who you know). Abstracting this notion to the realm of social science research, it becomes clear that these two types of knowledge utilize two types of data. The first is data about the actors being studied—what we refer to as attributes. Attributes describe characteristics of individual actors, for example, their race, income, or physical location, and are the primary variables considered in traditional social science research. The second type of data is relational data—that is, data about the relationships between individual actors.</p>
<p>Relationships are also referred to as ties in SNA. Ties cannot be attributed to any single actor. Rather, ties only exist between actors. This leads to the second point about SNA—that it requires a different conceptual approach. Because ties only exist between actors, it is useful to think of ties existing in a separate dimension from actors, who are anchored in physical space. This dimension is sometimes referred to as relational space. To visualize the difference, think of someone far away with whom you correspond regularly, say using a phone, e-mail, or Facebook. Even though the two of you are not physically close, you have a strong relationship. The two of you are distant in physical space but close in relational space. This notion of relational space is in part what Castells means when he refers to the space of flows as something distinct from the space of places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885412211411092">Castells 2001</xref>). Wellman also takes up the distinctions between <italic>communities</italic> as networks of personal relationships and <italic>neighborhoods</italic> as spatially bounded places. These two ideas have become conflated in popular and political dialogue since the 1950s, and much of Wellman’s work has been focused on disentangling the two (Wellman 1999).</p>
<p>The third point that distinguishes SNA from other social science approaches is that it involves different methods of analysis. Because traditional research methods consider actor attributes as variables in a wide variety of statistical analyses, these methods are sometimes referred to as variable analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885412211411092">Scott 1991</xref>). Social networks use network analysis methods to model relational data and to measure various characteristics of network structure. A fundamental concern, and challenge, of network analysis is that the relationships between actors are treated as being dependent on each other. That is, when actor A has a relationship with actor B that relationship is not considered independent of actor A’s relationship with actor C.</p>
<p>The idea that network structure may be correlated with actor attributes and behaviors is the fourth point to consider in comparing SNA to other approaches. Planners may recognize a parallel concept in the idea that the arrangement of actors in physical space—what we will refer to as the spatial structure of the network—is often correlated with the behavior or attributes of those actors. This is the basis for cluster analysis and spatial autocorrelation methods. For example, these methods have been used to identify the spatial distribution of industry and occupational clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412211411092">Feser 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412211411092">Feser, Sweeney, and Renski 2005</xref>). In SNA, the arrangement of the network in relational space—what we will refer to simply as the network structure—may also be correlated with the behavior and attributes of those actors. For example, employees of the same firm may share similar attributes such as location or department, and actors in similar roles (jobs) within that network may share similar behaviors. Conventional social science analysis measures various attributes of actors (the nodes in a network) and attempts to discern something about the relationships between actors (the ties or lines in a network) based on those attributes. When the network structure is simple and the differences in node attributes are clear, the conventional analytic approach is sufficient. However, when relationships are complex or node attributes are more nuanced, clear answers using conventional analysis may prove elusive. SNA offers a tool to help researchers disentangle some of the relational complexities, just as cluster analysis and methods for dealing with spatial autocorrelation help researchers disentangle the complexities of spatial organization.</p>

<title>What Bodies of Social Science Literature can Planners Turn to for Ideas on How SNA Might be Applicable to Planning?</title>
<p>SNA has a long history, but recent growth has been considerable. Two general themes in the literature relevant to planners have exhibited particularly strong growth. The first theme investigates questions related to the nature and influence of social capital and community and tends to extend from sociology, business, and management. The second theme investigates questions related to collective action and governance and tends to extend from political science and public policy. In general, these two themes converge in the realm of planning theory. However, with respect to convergence of the two themes specifically in regard to networks and network analysis, we have found limited integration to date.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0885412211411092">5</xref>
</sup> Here we briefly review these two themes and identify a few studies that have begun to integrate them.</p>
<p>The idea of social capital is that there is value embedded in the relationships between people and thus in the networks that they form. The theoretical foundations of social capital and community lie predominantly within sociology; however, the applications of this concept in planning were well documented in a special symposium section in an issue of the <italic>Journal of the American Planning Association</italic> (Putnam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0885412211411092">2004</xref>). Definitions of social capital vary, and perhaps the three most often cited are Bourdieu, Coleman, and Putnam. Writing from a Marxist perspective, Pierre Bourdieu attributed social capital to the elite class, connecting it with the ability to access other forms of capital (economic or cultural; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885412211411092">Bourdieu 1986</xref>). James Coleman approached social capital from a structural–functional perspective. He connected social capital and social structure more broadly, but rather than attributing social capital to specific structures, Coleman offered a more contextual definition that included how individuals use their positions within the social structure to achieve their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885412211411092">Coleman 1988</xref>). Robert Putnam’s definition is focused more specifically on the characteristics of the ties or relationships between individuals in a network. Putnam focuses specifically on social capital accumulating from the value of trust and reciprocity characterizing relationships between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0885412211411092">Putnam 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpretations of the relationship between social capital and community differ sharply, often depending on how rigidly “community” is defined and whether it is spatially bounded. For example, Putnam’s 1995 paper “Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital” and his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0885412211411092">2001</xref> book of similar title both document and decry the loss of social capital and “civic community.” Putnam’s work has fueled a vigorous debate; however, one could argue that much of the debate has less to do with social capital than with the definition of community. Putnam’s two “Bowling Alone” pieces bracket the 1999 publication of Networks in the Global Village in which Barry Wellman argues that “community” is in fact alive and well if you know where, how, and what to look for. In framing “community” from the perspective of individual networks of “personal communities,” Wellman addresses some of the key criticisms of Putnam’s work without ever mentioning Putnam or “Bowling Alone” directly. Wellman’s “communities as personal networks” approach avoids problems that arise as a result of spatially bounded definitions that assume networks are neatly contained within discrete spatial boundaries. It also avoids a priori normative assumptions about the attributes of community members versus nonmembers (Wellman 1999).</p>
<p>Manuel Castells both extends Wellman’s notion of personal communities, accounting for the effects of technological enhancements, and rejects Putnam’s claims of social isolation. For Castells, technology has extended the reach of individuals beyond the confines of physical location, allowing them to easily develop and maintain long distance ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885412211411092">Castells 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885412211411092">Foth 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0885412211411092">6</xref>
</sup> Rounding out the discussion of social capital and community, we will briefly mention the contributions of Mark Granovetter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885412211411092">1983</xref>) and Ron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885412211411092">Burt (1992)</xref> in quantifying the idea of social capital in network analysis. We will return to them in a later section. Finally, any planning related discussion of social capital would be incomplete without at least mentioning Jane Jacobs and her observations of how urban design contributes to building and maintaining social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412211411092">Jacobs 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Just as there have been a variety of approaches to defining and investigating social capital, many theoretical lenses have been used to understand social dilemmas and wicked problems in public policy and planning arenas. We focus on two—Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Design (IAD) and Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith’s Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF)—because of their relevance to planning, the considerable empirical testing that has been used to update the frameworks over time, and the natural fit they provide for network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0885412211411092">Ostrom 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0885412211411092">2007</xref>; Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0885412211411092">1993</xref>; Sabatier and Weible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0885412211411092">2007</xref>). The IAD has been applied to a wide array of collective action situations domestically and internationally, including provision of public services and natural resource management, while the ACF has been applied extensively to understanding environmental policy action, including coastal planning and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0885412211411092">Norton 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0885412211411092">Salvesen 2005</xref>) and regional land use and transportation planning in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885412211411092">Henry, Lubell and McCoy 2010</xref>). Both frameworks focus on factors that influence policy action that occurs within a realm where a diverse array of interdependent actors engage issues of policy and shared governance. This realm is termed the action arena in the IAD and the policy subsystem in the ACF. One manifestation of this realm is the set of communicative processes for developing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating plans. The IAD and ACF focus on complementary sets of drivers of action of interest to planners with the IAD focused on institutions (formal and informal rules) and the ACF focused on the beliefs of individual actors. Particularly relevant to the study of networks in planning is the shared emphasis on the patterns of interactions among actors that lead to policy coalition formation, policy outputs, and policy outcomes.</p>
<p>These two complementary and planning-relevant frameworks are supplemented by a growing policy networks literature. Echoing other criticism of SNA, Adam and Kriesi argue that “the policy network approach is more an analytical toolbox than a theory” and caution researchers “not to overreach its possibilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412211411092">2007</xref>, 146, 131). They also argue that it will provide the greatest contribution when linked with factors drawn from other theoretical systems for explaining policy change, such as the institutions of the IAD and the beliefs of the ACF, by addressing actor diversity and interdependence in a structural way (2007, 146). Two other key points to take from their review of the policy networks literature is the underutilization to date of its mathematical capabilities in the policy context and the need for clearer demonstration not only that policy networks exist, but that they matter in influencing policy outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaving these two broad literatures of social capital and collective action/governance together in a network context, Scholz and colleagues seek to explain the influence of network structure on collaboration and agreement among actors in estuarine management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885412211411092">Scholz, Berardo, and Kile 2008</xref>). They draw on the works of Putnam, Burt, Granovetter, Ostrom, and Sabatier among others to frame competing network theories for overcoming obstacles to collective action. Their findings indicate that large, boundary-spanning networks facilitate collaboration while smaller, denser networks are associated with greater perceptions of agreement. These findings are consistent with Burt’s study of the influence of network structure on innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885412211411092">Burt 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885412211411092">Henry, Lubell, and McCoy (2010)</xref> also draw on these two literatures to examine the comparative influences of ideology, power, and social capital as drivers of the structure of policy networks in regional land use and transportation in California.</p>

<title>For What Types of Planning Problems and Processes Does the Use of SNA Offer Significant Benefits?</title>
<p>A broad expansion in the use of SNA has occurred across many disciplines over the past decade and several researchers have evaluated the impact and potential of this approach on their respective disciplines. Three of these works from related disciplines are particularly relevant to planning and provide a logical framework for organizing the types of problems where SNA has been used or has significant potential to augment traditional analysis methods. Ter Wal and Boschma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885412211411092">2009</xref>) frame the use of SNA from the perspective of economic geography. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412211411092">Chan and Liebowitz (2006)</xref> explore the use of SNA from the management perspective, introducing its use as a tool to facilitate organizational knowledge mapping. They present a case study using SNA to map knowledge networks within a large foundation in Washington, DC. More broadly, asset mapping as a generalized case of knowledge mapping is a technique promoted within various planning disciplines. Chan and Liebowitz provide a good example of upgrading that process with SNA. Liebowitz expands the discussion of such applications in a later volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211411092">Liebowitz 2007</xref>). In Social Networks and American Politics: Introduction to the Special Issue, Michael Heaney and Scott McClurg provide insightful analysis of the reasons why network analysis is useful in the study of politics. They highlight four types of problems where network analysis yields unique and valuable insights that are not possible through the use of traditional methods alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412211411092">Heaney and McClurg 2009</xref>). The political nature of both planning theory and planning practice makes the framework suggested by Heaney and McClurg a natural entrée into a discussion of the use of SNA in planning. This section will introduce and elaborate on that framework, augmenting it with insights from Ter Wal and Boschma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885412211411092">2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412211411092">Chan and Liebowitz (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Planners routinely face six types of problems where SNA may prove especially useful. These include problems that involve (1) coordination, cooperation, or trust; (2) the sources and uses of power and influence; (3) multiple levels of organization; (4) informal organization; (5) flows of information and/or transaction costs; and (6) problems involving the dynamics of community (network) development (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412211411092">Heaney and McClurg 2009</xref>). Each type of problem is discussed separately in this section.</p>
<sec id="section7-0885412211411092">
<title>Problems Involving Coordination, Cooperation, and Trust</title>
<p>Planning is a social undertaking and almost always involves issues of coordination, cooperation, and trust. These are essential elements of communicative planning that are “reproduced” in a communicative planning process, as the actors work together to produce substantive plans and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>). Similarly, the practice-oriented consensus building and dispute resolution approaches often applied to planning problems also emphasize the importance of these elements in resolving conflicts and achieving satisfactory agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885412211411092">Innes 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885412211411092">Fisher, Ury, and Patton 1991</xref>). At a more general theoretical level, Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom (1998) has developed a behavioral approach to the rational choice theory of collective action supported by empirical evidence. Her model explains social benefits, akin to those planners seek to foster through planning processes, as a function of the level of cooperation among actors, which in turn varies as a function of interactions between trust, reputation, and reciprocity.</p>
<p>In addition to the practical and theoretical recognition of the importance of coordination, cooperation, and trust, another key observation we wish to make is that these three elements are each relational or dyadic in nature. That is, they are characteristics of the relationships between people. Further, they have no specific meaning as actor attributes. If one considers only a single actor, then coordination, cooperation, and trust become meaningless. There is no one else to coordinate with, to cooperate with, or to trust. If one considers two unrelated actors, the same condition holds. It is only in the relationships between actors that coordination, cooperation, and trust are meaningful. When planners evaluate conditions of coordination, cooperation, and trust within a group of actors involved in a planning process, SNA offers a unique set of measures and methods. For example, problems involving insufficient coordination, cooperation, and trust between two competing interest groups (i.e., a development firm and a neighborhood group) may be improved by establishing or strengthening ties between a few key actors—a process known as “bridging.” SNA enables the identification of actors and relationships that need to be bridged to overcome problems of coordination, cooperation, and trust.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0885412211411092">
<title>Problems Involving the Sources, Uses, and Exercise of Power</title>
<p>Power and influence are central to politics and planning. Power and influence contribute to control of decision making, and agenda setting and even the awareness and framing of underlying problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0885412211411092">Lukes 1974</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412211411092">Altshuler’s (1967)</xref> study of comprehensive planning in the Twin Cities laid bare the challenge that planners face in defining and achieving the “public interest” in a political landscape by demonstrating planners' relative powerlessness. Arguments have been made that consensus building techniques developed and honed over the decades since Althsuler’s work address many of his critiques by fostering dialogue and shared decision making among actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885412211411092">Innes 1996</xref>). By extension, planners who employ such techniques increase their relevance, legitimacy, and power. This line of argument aligns with the foundational principle of communicative planning that a key source of planners' power is their ability to shape attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>). In what Castells has labeled the informational age or network society, attention shaping is becoming increasingly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412211411092">Booher and Innes 2002</xref>), suggesting an increasingly important role for planners who understand how to shape attention. Booher and Innes draw on an extensive literature on conceptions of power, including the works of Altshuler, Flyvberg, Forester, Bryson, Crosby, and Gidden in defining network power as “a shared ability of linked agents to alter their environment in ways advantageous to these agents individually and collectively” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412211411092">Booher and Innes 2002</xref>, 225). They posit that higher amounts of network power arise through relationships among a diverse set of actors with interdependent interests.</p>
<p>SNA can contribute to our understanding of the formal and informal exercise of power and influence by analyzing the diversity (network composition) and interdependent relationships (network structure) of actors in planning processes. Granted, SNA is not needed for simple assessments of network composition; that is, to measure the relative levels of key assets actors bring to a planning process. However, what it does offer is the ability to identify and compare the structural positions of individuals or organizations in information sharing, trust, and other relationship networks. Systematically and simultaneously analyzing network composition and structure provides much deeper insights into how what you know, and who you know combine into the ability to affect problem framing and decision making. Practically speaking, such information can be useful to planners in regard to how they seek to position themselves in a network and, especially, the types of connections they seek to foster for actors whose interests are underrepresented in planning processes. SNA also includes models developed specifically to answer questions related to formal and informal flows of information and other forms of influence through networks. Tracing information flows through a planning network can expose critical gaps or inefficiencies that may contribute to communicative distortions as classified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885412211411092">1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0885412211411092">
<title>Problems Involving Multiple Levels of Organization</title>
<p>Perhaps the hallmark of contemporary planning is the need to coordinate multiple organizations, both formal and informal. The most obvious example of coordinating multiple formal organizations may be planning processes involving multiple political jurisdictions across local, regional, state, and even federal levels. One example of such formal coordination is hazard mitigation planning under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, which has been characterized as a reflexive law devolving federal power and requiring intergovernmental collaboration (Nolan 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885412211411092">Berke, Smith, and Lyles 2010</xref>). The Federal Emergency Management Agency provides guidance for and formal review of state and local plans, state agencies provide their own guidance for local plans, develop their own plans, provide support for local planning, and provide intermediate review of plans, while local governments often participate in multijurisdictional plans that can involve dozens of municipalities and counties. This complicated set of guidance, support, review, and collaboration relationships fits the collaborative governance model that Innes and Booher contrast with the top-down, hierarchical method of traditional governance network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 2010</xref>). They highlight that these forms of governance consist of an interdependent network of clusters.</p>
<p>Informal organizations may also span multiple “levels” including ad hoc groups of residents; neighborhood-based community organizations including community development corporations; issues-based advocacy organizations, for example, housing councils; or community foundations and business groups. Quite often, each group claims to speak for the “community.” How do planners sort it all out? As with problems involving informal organization, no analytical tool can replace political instincts. Proponents of communicative action and equity planning including Forester, Krumholz, and Friedmann have devoted significant attention to this issue.</p>
<p>SNA offers tools to visualize the myriad relationships, organizations, and factions, along with analysis methods that can augment political instincts. These can be especially useful for planners attempting to design and manage participatory planning processes. For researchers, who often are not immersed in any one community enough to develop an appreciation of the local politics, SNA offers a systematic method for modeling and understanding the interactions of multiple groups and organizations in the abstract. Key players, cliques, and cohesive subgroups may be identified and their relative qualities assessed. Structural holes and opportunities for bridging may be identified and remediation strategies devised. Analysis of structural equivalence may help researchers sort out which factors are unique to specific networks and which factors are common to all networks. These may be especially helpful, for example, in multijurisdictional and environmental planning efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0885412211411092">
<title>Problems Involving Informal Organization</title>
<p>For planners, problems involving informal organization are generally of two distinct types. The first involves informal networks within an established organizational structure. Specifically, these problems deal with the informal networks of influence and power that coexist and interact with existing political structures. Understanding and using these informal networks are often key to a planner’s survival within a political environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885412211411092">Hoch 1994</xref>) or their ability to pursue an activist agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885412211411092">Krumholz and Forester 1990</xref>). While no analytical tool can replace the instincts necessary to navigate such environments and activities, SNA offers a systematic framework for thinking about such informal structures and analytical methods that may remove some of the guesswork.</p>
<p>The second type of informal organization that planners must work with is the community itself. For any given plan, there will be a host of individual and group stakeholders, each with their own agenda. Understanding how these actors are connected to each other and what they bring to the process is a central task of communicative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>). SNA offers an obvious tool for collecting, organizing, and understanding informal structures that influence both planning processes and planning outcomes. Mapping and analyzing such informal structures using SNA can provide insight into planning problems related to communicative distortions; coordination, cooperation, and trust; the sources and uses of power; the aggregation of preferences; and network dynamics that may signal shifts in perception or co-opting of the planning process. Such problems often go unnoticed or undocumented because they occur within informal or poorly understood organizational structures. SNA helps make these structures visible, and thus can help identify and pinpoint the sources of problems in the planning process. Maintaining network graphs and analyses over time may also provide a metric to evaluate planning activity and progress toward process goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0885412211411092">
<title>Problems Involving Flows of Information and/or Transaction Costs</title>
<p>Much of the process of planning involves flows of multiple forms of information between diverse groups of people. In practice, the transaction costs associated with those flows vary dramatically. Flows among planners and between planners and elected officials often follow established channels and formal structures and are therefore relatively efficient (low transaction cost). Flows between planners and citizens and community groups are not routine, and often no formal structure or mechanism exists to convey such information. Knowledge gaps may hinder comprehension of the information being conveyed. Information flows between planners and the public are likely to have higher transaction costs. For example, Hanna has shown that participation alone is not enough for measuring the success of a planning process because participation is not the same as access to information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412211411092">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, communicative planning theories recognize the central importance of establishing and maintaining good flows of information between planners, elected officials and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211411092">Forester 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885412211411092">Friedmann 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885412211411092">Hoch 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Forester pays particular attention to building and maintaining a network of relationships with particular emphasis on groups that are typically disenfranchised (1989). His typology of four sources of disinformation that constrain rationality categorizes the distortions based on whether they are inevitable or socially unnecessary and whether they are socially ad hoc or socially systematic–structural (1989, 1993). Additionally, there are a multitude of forms of knowledge and the importance of local, or nonexpert, knowledge needs to be better incorporated into planning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412211411092">Innes and Booher 2010</xref>). By providing a tool to map and measure relationships and information flows, SNA can provide planners with new insights into the sources of communicative distortions, especially those that are socially systematic–structural. It also holds the potential to help elucidate how multiple forms of knowledge, originating from both “experts” and “lay” actors can be distributed throughout a network. These forms of analysis may identify specific practices planners can use to reduce the transaction costs associated with information flows and produce better planning outcomes.</p>

<title>Problems Involving the Dynamics of Community (Network) Development</title>
<p>Network dynamics refers to the changing nature of networks over time. Within the broader context of community, some networks persist for long periods of time relatively unchanged. Other networks represent ad hoc associations that exist for a specific purpose and then disappear, although the residual relationships may lead to other, more permanent networks. Wellman characterized personal networks as “unstable,” not in the sense that they were disintegrating but rather that they were in a constant state of flux (1999, 25). Without explicitly focusing on the static versus dynamic issue in network analysis, Wellman nevertheless does so succinctly in stating that “People are not wrapped up in traditional, densely knit, tightly bounded communities, but are maneuvering in sparsely knit, loosely bounded frequently changing networks” (1999, 24). Although most established SNA methods are typically static in nature, dynamic SNA tools do exist. SIENA software, for example, is designed to work with longitudinal data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/">http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/</ext-link>). Dynamic network analysis is an active area of research within the field of SNA.</p>

<title>How Has SNA Been Applied in Planning Research or Practice and What Contributions Have These Applications Made?</title>
<p>Relatively few uses of SNA in planning related applications have been documented. The majority of documented uses fall into three broad types of applications. The first type of planning application in which the use of SNA has been documented is in understanding the spatial and social dimensions of “community” and social capital. The second type of application involves using SNA concepts and methods to understand and improve public participation and equitable outcomes in the planning process. In both of these applications, the literature shows a progression from theoretical to empirical approaches over time. As noted previously, public participation applications tend to be more flow oriented, while network structure tends to be emphasized more in the community studies. These first two types of applications can be used across many subfields of planning to understand participation and community, for instance, in economic development, environmental planning and natural resource management, and land use planning. We categorize subfield specific applications as the third type of planning for which SNA has been used and focus on economic development as an example.</p>

<title>Using SNA to Understand the Spatial and Social Dimensions of “Community” and Social Capital</title>
<p>The first group of studies that apply SNA to planning issues is focused on understanding the spatial and social dimensions of community, to what extent social “distance” depends on spatial distance, and what the implications are for planning policy and practice. Within this group, the work of Barry Wellman is central in defining community and establishing the context for most of the other studies. In considering the relationships between spatial and social distance and their affect on the social bonds associated with “community” and “social capital,” Wellman provides an easy transition from the discipline of sociology to that of planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885412211411092">Wellman 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0885412211411092">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0885412211411092">2001b</xref>).</p>
<p>Hajer and Zonneveld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885412211411092">2000</xref>) frame a critique of the Dutch planning process in terms of what greater personal connectivity and the “coming network society” is likely to mean for a wide spectrum of planning issues. While largely editorial, the analysis is thoughtful, driving home the compelling message that planners must be increasingly aware of rapidly changing social dynamics when planning physical spaces and other systems that are subject to spatial and social distances.</p>
<p>Assessing the effect of social networks among residents of clustered versus scattered public housing units on the job search process, Kleit (2001) found that public housing residents in scattered suburban housing relied on their neighbors less than those in clustered public housing when searching for a job. Her findings contrast with Granovetter’s findings for executives on getting a job, which showed that weak ties were more important, but they are consistent with Granovetter’s later study on the influence of weak ties among low-income individuals in getting a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885412211411092">Kleit 2001</xref>). Moreover, the findings are consistent with other studies on different perceptions of social capital in low-income neighborhoods compared to middle- and high-income neighborhoods (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885412211411092">Hutchinson and Vidal 2004</xref> and related papers in that issue). The implication is that the trade-offs between spatial and social distance are different depending on the income/social status of the individual and the prevailing income/social status of their surroundings.</p>
<p>So to what extent are social networks neighborhood based, and how do residents' conceptions of social networks and social capital relate to their perceptions of what a neighborhood is? These questions were taken up by Gary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412211411092">Bridge (2002)</xref>. His study utilized SNA to answer these questions, finding that most neighborhood residents had many more total ties and many more strong ties outside the neighborhood than within. Ties within the neighborhood were important to residents, but were generally weak in nature. Bridge concludes that the findings suggest planners should eschew preconceived notions of neighborhood “solidarity” and focus instead on designing neighborhoods with greater “porosity” and connectivity. While Bridge suggests that neighborhood interventions should be designed from the perspective that residents have citywide networks, it does not appear that the influence of income/class discussed in the previous paragraph was considered. Thus, the interpretation of Bridge’s research may be different between, say a new urbanist neighborhood and the redevelopment of a low-income neighborhood.</p>
<p>Applying a new urbanist perspective at the scale of the city and region, Stanley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0885412211411092">2005</xref>) examines the prospects of applying social network measures including centrality, density, and structural holes to evaluate the sizes, locations, and activity (flows) in and through systems of cities in the Middle East. The author does not attempt such empirical measurements but makes a compelling case for doing so. One particularly interesting idea evaluates “black holes”—places that should be thriving and much larger based on the network structure, but which have not developed according to their potential. Such an analysis sets the stage for comparative policy studies to determine the causes of differential development.</p>
<p>The book <italic>Why the Garden Club Couldn’t Save Youngstown</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412211411092">Safford 2009</xref>) evaluates the role of social networks among elite members of Allentown Pennsylvania and Youngstown Ohio societies in shaping the capacity of these two cities to respond to the impacts of industrial globalization. This exceptional work stands in a class by itself. Safford traces the histories of these two cities and shows how similar they appeared in 1975 using the demographic and economic metrics common in planning studies. After demonstrating that none of the traditional explanations could account for the subsequent economic divergence of the two cities, he presents key differences in the structure of business and social networks between them. In the case of Allentown, business and social networks only partially overlapped, while in Youngstown the overlap was far more extensive. When deindustrialization swept over the two communities, business networks were hit hard. Leaders in Allentown were able to fall back on their social networks to rebuild. In Youngstown, the high degree of overlap meant that deindustrialization decimated both business and social networks, leaving little structure upon which to rebuild the community’s leadership.</p> 
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885412211411092">Clark (2007)</xref> offers a thorough review of the literature covering the “shifting terrain of ‘community’ research,” identifying a growing need to move beyond the spatial/social dichotomy to an interactive view of how spatial and social aspects combine to shape emergent forms of community. Clark evaluates the “death of distance” and the compression of space and time afforded actors connected in relational or social space rather than physical space. One important aspect of these concepts is that they tend to exclude low-income individuals and communities. One wonders whether these concepts are related to the apparent polarization of society along class and income lines.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0885412211411092">Piselli (2007)</xref> approaches the study of community from a network analysis perspective, arguing that while the spatial and social dimensions of community “condition and reinforce each other,” community must ultimately be considered as a network, not a place. Central to Piselli’s argument is the notion that relationships involve exchanges or flows of many different kinds, one of the most important being communication. Historically these exchanges have involved face-to-face contact and spatial proximity. However, there are an increasing number of examples where community is created and maintained, even over great distances. These include the continuity of community among groups of emigrants and the creation of virtual online communities. While making a compelling case for defining community as a network rather than a place, the author does not discount the importance of place in shaping and supporting many communities. For example, the relationship between geographically bounded industrial districts and the community of establishments, workers, and institutions that define industry clusters has endured and even intensified with the globalization if industry.</p>
<p>Mandarano’s case study of a multijurisdictional environmental planning process demonstrates the use of SNA in evaluating social capital as a necessary intermediate outcome in an ongoing collaborative planning process (2009). Her study focuses on a regional collaborative environmental partnership formed through the National Estuary Program (NEP), finding that SNA was a useful tool for measuring the creation of social capital in terms of the formation and structure of new relationships built through the collaborative planning process. The study also shows that both internal and external factors influenced the participants' capacity to build dense social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0885412211411092">Mandarano 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers challenge planners working at multiple scales to engage a more precise and nuanced definition of community in their work. Terms like “place making” and “community building” which in the world of practice could easily be understood as synonymous, take on very different and distinct meanings. A widespread reconception of place and community as separate but related phenomenon that condition and reinforce each other would have enormous implications for the planning profession, the places we create and the communities we work with. The conflation of these terms in the past is understandable. Places are easy to visualize and represent with great precision. Community in the strict sense is more of a fuzzy concept that is difficult to picture or represent but it is nevertheless powerfully emotive. The combination is a marketer’s dream. Disentangling the two concepts in the minds of planners, let alone the public, will be no easy task. The value of SNA in facilitating such a reconception is that it provides a conceptual framework and methods to visualize and analyze community as a relational network, separate and distinct from the geography of place. As planners decouple their conceptions of place and community, these papers also caution us that class differences—predominantly income and education—have a strong influence on social and spatial dimensions of community and perceptions of social capital (See e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885412211411092">Hutchinson and Vidal 2004</xref> and related papers in the special section on social capital). Sean Safford’s work in particular also points out that communities have many “layers” of networks that interact in different ways and that overlap to a greater or lesser extent. Understanding how those layers of social capital are connected and how they overlap in a community may have significant implications for community resilience in times of crisis.</p>

<title>Applications of SNA in Understanding and Improving Planning Processes</title>
<p>The second group of studies focuses on understanding and improving public participation in the planning process. Focusing on the role higher-level government interventions can have on fostering stronger local networks, Schneider and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0885412211411092">2003</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0885412211411092">7</xref>
</sup> frame management of estuaries as a policy domain where top-down, government-driven approaches may be less suited than network-oriented approaches that are community based and inclusive. This type of policy domain describes many, if not most, planning situations, from reducing risks to people and property from natural hazards to ensuring affordable housing availability to integrating multiple modes of transportation within a region. This article identifies a typology of four classes of networks that can help address barriers to cooperation: (1) vertical boundary-spanning networks (i.e., involving multiple levels of government; (2) horizontal boundary-spanning networks (i.e., coordinating across jurisdictions in the same geographic area); and (3) expertise boundary-spanning (i.e., accessing academic, private sector, and other experts); and (4) ideological boundary-spanning networks (i.e., providing less confrontational settings for airing and negotiating conflicts). It also categorizes a variety of supports the federal NEP used to increase collaboration and span these boundaries in the estuarine management policy domain. Schneider and his colleagues' results suggest the NEP supports have made progress in spanning these boundaries and increasing cooperation, a finding that should be of interest to planning scholars on both theoretical and applied levels.</p>
<p>Beginning with the critique of communicative planning that it does not translate easily into practice, Doak and Parker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885412211411092">2002</xref>) present a detailed and highly theoretical argument for a “pre-plan mapping” of the network of actors and capitals (economic, environmental, social, human, and cultural). Their arguments focus on the value of visualizing the “planning network topology” as a precursor to enhancing network and capital interactions for those with limited access to the planning process. Such a visualization also includes an assessment of what they refer to as the “power geometry” of the network (e.g., cliques, subgroups, positions, and brokerage roles), with particular attention to the position and role of the planner within the network. While Doak and Parker include conceptual diagrams of what is to be included in “pre-plan maps” and discuss how these would be useful in the context of a specific project, they do not undertake the process themselves.</p>
<p>Moving from a highly theoretical approach to a more practical grassroots presentation, three different “how-to” approaches are presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211411092">Provan, Veazie, and Staten (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885412211411092">Krebs and Holley (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0885412211411092">Prell, Hubacek, and Reed (2009)</xref>. Provan, Veazie, and Staten focus on the use of SNA in helping communities build and sustain functioning networks of social service providers and community action groups. The authors provide a sample questionnaire (as an appendix) that may be used to gather data to populate the network. Most of the article is focused on a presentation and analysis of eight strategic questions that communities may then ask about the network analysis results that may help them build stronger, more sustainable networks. As was the case with Doak and Parker, the authors do not actually undertake a case study. Krebs and Holley also offer a “hands-on” approach that focuses on building community economic networks or clusters in Appalachia. The article offers an extensive discussion of what they term “network weaving”—the process of building and facilitating relationships strategically over time to transition a region through increasingly ordered and stable network structures. While they do not present the detailed empirical analyses one would find in peer-reviewed journals, they take a step in that direction, relating examples of how they have used the various methods they describe in practice.</p>
<p>The third “how-to” paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0885412211411092">Prell, Hubacek, and Reed (2009)</xref> demonstrates the utility of SNA in conducting a stakeholder analysis in a natural resource management process in the United Kingdom. Although the article does not reference the dispute resolution or consensus building literatures discussed earlier, the authors' conception of a stakeholder analysis designed to identify and target stakeholders for inclusion in a planning process aligns closely with these literatures. Prell and her colleagues use SNA techniques to determine which stakeholders are already most heavily involved in the network, which of those stakeholders are most central, and which categories of stakeholders are currently underrepresented. In turn, the results of these analyses can be used in practice to ensure that a planning process network includes those stakeholders that are already highly central, those that have been underrepresented previously, and, importantly, those that bring preexisting bridging contacts to the process.</p>
<p>Nancy Holman’s case study of community participation in planning for a large-scale redevelopment in Portsmouth, England uses SNA to examine the effects of network structure on “due process” participation, social–developmental,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0885412211411092">8</xref>
</sup> and instrumental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885412211411092">Holman 2008</xref>). The case is well documented and analyzed, focusing on the effects of network structure on flows of information, and the use of power to control instrumental outcomes. Holman finds that network structure does in fact influence the planning process, as well as both developmental and instrumental outcomes. Participants and planners alike were largely unaware of these structural influences. In light of her findings, Holman discusses what the outcomes might have been, had the network structure been explicitly known or accurately perceived at the outset of the project. She concludes that the use of SNA as a tool in planning practice is likely to lead to an improved process with better developmental and instrumental outcomes.</p>
<p>A provocative dissertation proposal by Genevieve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412211411092">Borich (2008)</xref> rounds out the literature focused primarily on understanding and improving participation in the public process. Borich proposes the use of SNA to develop empirical evidence about participation in both formal and informal planning networks and how formal and informal planning processes relate to each other. She argues that formal planning networks are fully contained within informal planning networks and that the two types of networks are both structurally and functionally different. The results of her research could present some valuable new insights into planning practice and provide the grist for further refinements of communicative planning theories.</p>
<p>In summary, the literature documenting the use of SNA in understanding and improving public participation and outcomes in the planning process suggests that further use of SNA’s concepts and methods are likely to have a positive influence on both planning practice and planning research. These applications typically involve all five types of problems for which SNA is especially well suited. The potential for improving the implementation of communicative planning theories is apparent. So too are the possibilities for new approaches to empirical research into the relational processes that planners care about and that influence much of their work.</p>

<title>Substantive Applications of SNA in Planning</title>
<p>Many of the studies reviewed thus far present substantive as well as procedural examples of SNA in planning. This section reviews several substantive examples that have not been discussed previously in this article. These studies fall into three categories. The first pair of studies examines social activity–travel behavior from a social network approach. The second group of studies uses SNA to understand the organization and interaction of economic development and policy networks. The third group of studies uses SNA to understand the social and spatial dimensions of innovation as an economic development driver.</p>

<title>Using SNA to Understand Social Activity–Travel Behavior</title>
<p>Two related papers document the use of SNA in understanding social activity–travel behavior and the data collection methodology necessary for such an analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412211411092">Carrasco and Miller 2006</xref>; Carrasco et al. 2008). The papers hypothesize that “individuals' travel behavior is conditional upon their social networks; that is, a key cause of travel behavior is the social dimension represented by social networks” (Carrasco, Hogan, Wellman &amp; Miller, 2008, 961). They develop new data collection methods that allow researchers to consider the social dimension of social activity-travel behavior more explicitly. The methods developed in these papers allow researchers to examine and understand spatial and social dynamics of social activity-travel behavior in new ways that were not possible with conventional analysis alone.</p>

<sec id="section18-0885412211411092">
<title>Using SNA in Economic Development and Policy Networks</title>
<p>SNA has been used in economic development to help understand networks of policy and practice and to facilitate complex projects involving multiple jurisdictions and actors from the public and private sectors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412211411092">Eraydin et al., (2008)</xref> used SNA in conjunction with econometric methods to model and evaluate the development of “policy networks” consisting of both governmental and nongovernmental actors among various cities and towns within the Izmir region of Turkey. Such networks were considered important in augmenting existing government infrastructure or in some cases providing that infrastructure when government institutions did not. The study found that even in the absence of effective institutional structures, the networks had a positive effect on economic performance. The authors conclude that the expansion of policy networks would be an effective way to boost innovation and economic performance throughout the region.</p>
<p>From a methodological perspective, the Eraydin study also illustrates a critical issue related to the use of SNA as a “new” and relatively unfamiliar method in planning studies. Because SNA is not yet widely understood there is the potential that it will not be used correctly. In this case, although the researchers were able to construct the networks from survey data and other sources, their study could have been much more robust with a few changes to the survey and the use of additional network measures that would have allowed them to evaluate several issues they regarded as qualitative, including trust, reciprocity, power relations, and ideological divisions. Their use of SNA was not “wrong” in terms of their technical execution. The precise reasons for the weak application of SNA are not entirely clear, and as this is the only known example of its kind to date, any criticism is tempered by a greater respect of the researchers for having tried it.</p>
<p>In a practitioner-oriented paper, Reid, Carroll, and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0885412211411092">2007</xref>) advocate and illustrate the use of SNA in the cluster building process, using it to map key actors in the Ohio greenhouse industry. The authors are effective in placing SNA within an integrated group of analytical methods that include spatial clustering/spatial autocorrelation, and input/output analysis, and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis. However, the article does not fully explain or document their SNA methodology. They identify three survey questions and the software package used in the analysis, and then move on to discuss the findings and interpretation of the network analysis. The authors found it particularly helpful in identifying influential network members and in identifying where network connections should be established or strengthened. A second practitioner-oriented paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412211411092">DeSantis (2006)</xref> discusses the use of SNA and networking more generally as “purposeful” economic development tools.</p>
<p>In a relatively early use of SNA, Hagen, Killinger, and Streeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885412211411092">1997</xref>) mapped and analyzed economic development organizations (EDOs) in the Tampa Bay, Florida region. The analysis was undertaken to help facilitate the reuse of a decommissioned federal facility with substantial technological assets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0885412211411092">9</xref>
</sup> A primary goal of the study was to determine an appropriate (new) role within the network for the University of South Florida with respect to the Pinellas STAR Center and regional engagement with the dozens of EDOs in the Tampa Bay area. Additional goals of the study were to assess levels of communication, interaction, and leadership among the region’s thirty-seven EDOs, as well as specific development capacities and specializations. The study used SNA measures of centrality, equivalence, centralization, and density to evaluate the network. As a whole, the study suggests and demonstrates that SNA may be viewed as a rapid assessment, research, and planning tool for evaluating regional economic development in a multijurisdictional context.</p>
<p>Shifting the focus from mapping and assessing EDOs in multiple jurisdictions to identifying the conditions necessary for them to actually work together, Hawkins (2010) examines the effects of network structure and social capital on multijurisdictional collaboration on regional economic development projects. The article makes several important and timely contributions to the field, combining a lucid assessment of the theoretical literature with empirical analysis to advance a critical understanding of the roles of social capital and governance (network) structure in determining whether multijurisdictional collaboration on economic development projects is likely to occur. Policy implications are also discussed. Interestingly, competition and collaboration are presented as an interactive policy dynamic rather than mutually exclusive policy choices. From a methodological perspective, the author provides a clear example of how SNA may be combined with other methods to facilitate insights that would otherwise not be possible.<sup>

<title>Understanding and Facilitating Innovation as a Regional Economic Development Strategy</title>
<p>As an example of how SNA can be used to inform substantive issues in planning subfields, the third area we review concerns the spatial and social dimensions of innovation, which is thought to be a key contributor to economic growth. Economic developers in particular are interested in the social, spatial, and technological characteristics associated with innovation and how to create regional environments that foster innovation and growth. Within the innovation studies literature, there have been multiple studies concerning the use of SNA. Many of the published studies identified during this review emerge out of related disciplines other than planning, although European Planning Studies has published several papers within the past year addressing the role of networks and network analysis in innovation and economic development from the planning perspective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0885412211411092">11</xref>
</sup> Most recently, several papers were published together in a special issue of Innovation Management: Policy and Practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885412211411092">Kastelle and Steen 2010</xref>).<sup>

Given the timeliness of the focus on innovation to economic development policy in the United States, what follows is a brief review of this large volume of multidisciplinary research under the banner of innovation studies.</p>
<p>One strand of literature shaping innovation studies emerges from a debate within economic geography over the effects of spatial agglomeration versus network effects on the spatial distribution of innovation activity. Those advocating agglomeration and knowledge spillover effects have held the high ground in the argument for some time and have had significant influence on economic development policies and practice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412211411092">Florida 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412211411092">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885412211411092">Porter 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211411092">1998b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0885412211411092">1998c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885412211411092">1998d</xref>). While acknowledging the underlying importance of networks, agglomeration-based analyses have nevertheless focused almost exclusively on spatial structure and the attributes of place. Little attention is paid to relationships or network structure.</p>
<p>Those advocating network effects of innovation have suggested that the colocation of firms that lead to agglomeration effects are actually spatial manifestations of underlying network dynamics (i.e., interactions and changes over time) and that network growth is a catalyst for spatial agglomeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0885412211411092">Prevezer, Opsahl, and Panzarasa 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0885412211411092">Sorenson 2003</xref>). They also suggest that within spatial agglomerations, innovation and cluster growth result from the interaction of multiple overlapping networks (Granovetter 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211411092">Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0885412211411092">Sorenson 2003</xref>; Whittington, Owen-Smith, and Powell 2008). Differences in cluster performance have been linked to the effectiveness of such networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0885412211411092">Saxenian 1996</xref>). More recently, researchers have begun to consider the effects that industry sector (i.e., technological) differences may have in network development and colocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412211411092">Breschi and Malerba 2005</xref>). Sectoral differences are believed to influence communication styles and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885412211411092">Cowan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412211411092">Okamura and Vonortas 2006</xref>), labor mobility, and communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885412211411092">Saxenian and Hsu 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The dominance of agglomeration arguments in this debate may be interpreted in several ways. For example, Wellman points out that popular literature and political rhetoric often conflate the social concept of “community” with the spatial concept of “neighborhood” (1999). This conflation, while likely not intentional, nevertheless tends to serve political predilections toward place-based rather than people-based economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412211411092">Bolton 1993</xref>). Whatever the reason, the focus on agglomeration has led to an economic development policy environment that is heavily skewed toward an interpretation that spatial density and concentrated institutional resources are the only factors that influence innovation. Such policies have been based in large measure on cluster concepts advanced by Michael Porter, and creative class concepts advanced by Richard Florida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412211411092">Florida 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412211411092">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885412211411092">Porter 1998a</xref>, 1998b, 1998c, 1998d). Widespread implementation of strategies based on these concepts has yielded mixed results (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412211411092">Feldman 2007</xref>), but one clear observation can be made. Both concepts are manifestations of agglomeration theory and are therefore based on certain assumptions about population and institutional resource density. For example, it is widely believed that spatial density and depth in both talent and institutional resources are necessary to drive the knowledge spillovers that are fundamental to the growth of innovation clusters under these theories (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0885412211411092">Muro and Katz 2010</xref>). The central role of research universities in such strategies exemplifies this assumption.</p>
<p>SNA has been used in at least one empirical study of knowledge spillovers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412211411092">Okamura and Vonortas (2006)</xref> offer an exploratory analysis of knowledge networks based on patent citations and technology alliance networks based on strategic partnerships, predominantly within the European context. These two types of networks are modeled and compared for five industrial subsectors: pharmaceuticals, plastics, computers, electronics, and instruments. The analysis revealed apparent differences in the networking behavior in the pharmaceuticals subsector vis-à-vis networking behavior in computers, electronics, and instruments; a difference in effectiveness between knowledge and alliance networks across all examined sectors in terms of knowledge communication; and apparent differences in the competitive positioning of European firms compared to U.S. and Japanese firms in the examined sectoral knowledge networks suggest significant differences in intercontinental business strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412211411092">Okamura and Vonortas 2006</xref>). While the findings themselves are interesting, this article demonstrates SNA’s graphical and analytical power in helping to identify and frame future research using more traditional social science methods. This approach to using SNA contrasts nicely with the mixed-method approach demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885412211411092">Hawkins (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>A handful of studies within economic geography have applied SNA to patent data in order to study the spatial distribution of inventors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412211411092">Bettencourt, Lobo, and Strumsky 2007</xref>); the effects of inventor networks on the spatial distribution of patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0885412211411092">Strumsky, Lobo, and Fleming 2005</xref>); and the effects of state policies on inventor mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0885412211411092">Marx, Strumsky, and Fleming 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the literature covering the spatial and social dimensions of innovation and economic development presents planning professionals and academics with some broad challenges. The first of these is that widely held and taught concepts of spatial agglomeration may be incomplete and the policies they inspire may need to be revisited. The issue is not that current conceptions are wrong but rather that they may be incomplete, especially in “non-agglomeration” regions. This in turn leads to the creation of policies and programs that yield inconsistent results and a lack of policies and programs that address critical network-building needs like those identified in the Izmir region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412211411092">Eraydin et al. 2008</xref>). Further empirical studies on the spatial and social dimensions of innovation and economic activity using SNA represent a critical need in advancing a more complete understanding of regional economies and improving the policies and practices of regional economic development.</p>
<p>A second challenge to both planning practitioners and academics concerns the training of planners in the concepts and methods of SNA. As illustrated in the discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412211411092">Eraydin et al. (2008)</xref>, SNA is more than simply a method to be applied after the data are collected. A full appreciation of the SNA perspective will help shape the research design and data collection activities as well. The Eraydin study illustrates the more benign case of missed opportunity in the research. A more serious potential problem is the misapplication of SNA methods and/or a misinterpretation of the results due to inadequate training in SNA. This problem may be compounded by a lack of critical readers or researchers with sufficient understanding to catch and correct errors. Such problems are not unique to SNA but rather accompany the rapid growth of any new concept or method.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has presented a brief introduction to the history, concepts, and methods of SNA. It has attempted to position SNA as both a unique perspective and a unique methodology with respect to analytical approaches and methods commonly used in planning. Building on this foundation, the paper then identified six types of problems for which SNA has been identified as particularly useful, and examined these types of problems in terms of their relevance to planning theory and practice. We conclude that SNA has the potential to advance and operationalize certain aspects of communicative planning theory, which have been criticized due to their reliance on tacit knowledge in the form of judgment and experience. In particular, SNA has the potential to help planners visualize, measure, and document sources of communicative distortion and to identify specific steps to address these situations.</p>
<p>Having developed a basic understanding of SNA and its relationship to planning from both methodological and theoretical perspectives, the paper proceeds to review and evaluate documented examples of the use of SNA concepts and methods in planning-related applications. The applications found in the literature tended to focus on three broad planning issues. On the issue of understanding the spatial and social dimensions of community and, by extension, social capital, the literature challenges planners working at multiple spatial scales to engage more precise and nuanced definitions of “community” and “place” in their work. Disentangling the two concepts in the minds of planners, let alone the public, will be no easy task. The value of SNA in facilitating such a reconception is that it provides a conceptual framework and methods to visualize and analyze community as a relational network, separate and distinct from the geography of place. As planners decouple their conceptions of place and community, these papers also caution us that class differences—predominantly income and education—have a strong influence on social and spatial dimensions of community and perceptions of social capital.</p>
<p>On the issue of understanding and improving public participation in the planning process, the literature suggests that further use of SNA’s concepts and methods are likely to have a positive influence on both planning practice and planning research. These applications typically involve all five types of problems for which SNA is especially well suited. The potential for improving the implementation of communicative planning theory is apparent. So too are the possibilities for new empirical research into the relational processes that comprise so much of what planners do and care about.</p>
<p>The literature on the spatial and social dimensions of innovation and economic development offers two additional challenges for both planning practitioners and academics. The first challenge presented by the literature suggests that widely held and widely taught concepts of spatial agglomeration may be incomplete if they do not include a basic understanding of network influences and dynamics. This is not simply an academic question since agglomeration theories have a strong influence on economic development policy and practice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412211411092">Safford (2009)</xref> demonstrated, network structures may be critical to regional resilience. More empirical research is needed to clarify the relationship between spatial agglomeration and social network effects and to design more effective economic development policies, particularly for “non agglomeration” regions. The second challenge suggested by the literature is the need for training among planning researchers and practitioners on the concepts and methods of SNA.</p>
<p>Some broad conclusions may be drawn from this body of literature as a whole. First, the issues around which the literature has concentrated are all characterized by “elusiveness” when researchers have approached them using traditional methods. This elusiveness stems in part from the fact that all three issues tend to wrestle with all or most of the problems for which SNA is ideally suited and which, conversely, traditional methods are poorly suited. All three issues are characterized by the presence of a complex set of formal and informal relationships involving a wide array of actors with highly variable attributes. These actors and relationships form social networks that may be modeled and visualized with SNA. Emergent structural influences on behaviors and outcomes may be identified, measured, and analyzed along with actor attributes to yield better explanations of the phenomena being observed.</p>
<p>While documented empirical planning studies using SNA remain quite rare, the literature evaluated in this article nevertheless presents a clear and compelling case for planning practitioners and academics to expand the understanding, use, and teaching of SNA concepts and methods. These concepts and methods augment existing approaches and provide tools for exploring the relational dimension, which has been widely acknowledged as influential but difficult to measure using traditional methods. The research potential related to the issues discussed in this article is substantial. Other research possibilities related to, say, issues at the intersection of planning and public health; or those related to fundamental debates concerning the claims for and against New Urbanism are equally enticing. Addressing the challenges identified in this article represent first steps in a strategy to take advantage of these new opportunities.</p>

<title>Addendum</title>
<p>In keeping with the rapid expansion of the use of SNA in planning related applications and the highly fragmented nature of the literature in this regard, several new papers and examples were published or discovered during the final peer-review period. We expect this trend to continue, so in the interest of timely publication and the length of this paper we have chosen not to include any additional studies herein. While interesting in themselves, these additional studies do not add significantly to the main thrust or findings of this paper. We do however recognize the need and the opportunity for a real-time, ongoing supplement to this paper that gathers and reports on new research in this emerging field. To that end we have created a “Uses of Social Network Analysis in Planning” blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snainplanning.blogspot.com/">http://snainplanning.blogspot.com/</ext-link>). The blog is a supplemental resource for researchers and neither replaces the discussions taking place in academic journals like JPL nor circumvents the peer review process to which such journals adhere and that we wholeheartedly support. Reviews of the additional sources noted above will be posted on the blog by the time this paper is published.</p>

<p>Environmental planners trained in environmental sciences and ecology will see connections between biological network analysis and their own efforts to conserve and manage lands to promote such goals as ecosystem health and creation of green infrastructure that provide ecosystem services. Transportation and infrastructure planners will be very familiar with technological network analysis and tasks such as bus route planning and transmission line siting. A wide range of planners will be familiar with information network analysis including, for example, those involved in developing and updating comprehensive plans that must account for information in transportation plans, utility plans, housing plans, hazard mitigation plans, and so on, as well as the plans of adjacent and overlapping jurisdictions.</p>

<p>In reviewing this article, it was unclear whether the regression analysis was carried out using the UCINET software or another software package. Efforts to contact the author for clarification were unsuccessful. In general terms, typical regression models are based on the assumption that the observations (i.e., actors) are independent. If the network measures are “ego network” measures, this assumption holds true. However, if “whole network” measures are used, then the assumption of independence does not hold, and the regression model should be modified. UCINET, along with other SNA software packages provide this functionality. This question is raised here not as a criticism of Hawkins, for it is entirely possible and even probable that this issue was addressed in his research. Rather, it is raised to illustrate a generic caution for readers on the use of SNA in a mixed-methods approach. Even if such an error occurred in this study, the effect is likely to be minor and related to the <italic>degree</italic> of certainty. The logic of this study and the conclusions draw would remain unaffected. We offer our respect to the author for a fine piece of research and beg his indulgence as a straw man in making this important point about mixed methods.</p>
