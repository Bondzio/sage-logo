<p>Tumor metastasis is the most important cause of cancer death and various treatment strategies have targeted at preventing the occurrence of metastasis. <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> L is a popular folk medicine and has several proven biological properties, including antioxidant, antihypertension, and anti-inflammatory. This study provides molecular evidence associated with the antimetastatic effects of <italic>P urinaria</italic> L extracts (PUE), which contained polyphenols including gallic acid, methyl gallate, epicatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, gallocatechin-3-gallate, rutin, epicatechin-3-gallate, and naringin, by showing a marked inhibition on the invasion (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and migration (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) of highly metastatic A549 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. To further investigate the precise involvement of PUE in tumor metastasis, A549 and LLC cells were treated with PUE at various concentrations and results from zymography and Western blotting showed that a PUE treatment may decrease the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), MMP-9 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), urokinase plasminogen activator (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and their endogenous inhibitors, that is, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, in a concentration-dependent manner. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and MMP-2 promoter luciferase analysis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) revealed that PUE inhibits the transcription of MMP-2 mRNA. PUE also exerted an inhibitory effect on the DNA-binding activity and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and AP-1. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PUE on the metastasis and growth of LLC cells in vivo were proven. These results indicate that PUE could be applied to be a potential antimetastatic agent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural compounds, including thousands of plant secondary metabolites, are important for plant biology and human nutrition and have been applied for therapeutic purposes in folk and traditional medicine. During the past decade, it has been shown that <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> L has several beneficial biological activities that help in reducing the risks of cardiovascular disease and cancers with antihypertension, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antiangiogenetic, and chemoprotective properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411417128">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411417128"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411417128"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411417128"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411417128">5</xref></sup> <italic>P urinaria</italic> L, one of the herbal plants belonging to the genus <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> (Euphorbiaceae), is widely used as a traditional folk medicine in Asian countries such as India, China, Thailand, and Taiwan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411417128">6</xref></sup> Boiling water extracts of <italic>P urinaria</italic> have been reported to be able to exhibit antiangiogenic and antitumor effects in animal model bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411417128">7</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that the ethanolic extracts of <italic>P urinaria</italic> exhibited antioxidant and cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via upregulation of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735411417128">8</xref></sup> The 50% methanolic extracts of <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic> were reported to exhibit cytotoxic activitiy against human liver carcinoma Hep G2 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735411417128">9</xref></sup> Several natural compounds were isolated from different Phyllanthus species, including triterpenes, lignans, flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411417128">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411417128">10</xref></sup> Hippomanin A, a compound isolated from <italic>P urinaria</italic>, was reported to have anti-infection activities against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534735411417128">11</xref></sup> Geraniin and 1,3,4,6-tetra-<italic>O</italic>-galloyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucose were the major compounds isolated from <italic>P urinaria</italic> that exhibited anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 infection activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534735411417128">12</xref></sup> Ellagic acid, a flavonoid isolated from <italic>P urinaria</italic>, was able to inhibit hepatitis B virus infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534735411417128">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor and subsequent growth of secondary tumors in distant tissues and organs may complicate the clinical management and may even lead to death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534735411417128">14</xref></sup> Despite advances in cancer therapy during the past few years, most cancer mortalities result from metastatic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534735411417128">15</xref></sup> Suppression of extracellular protease activity or expression has been demonstrated to contribute to the inhibition of the invasion of various types of cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534735411417128">16</xref></sup> Considerable interest has been raised in natural compounds that inhibit the activities of proteases, such as plasminogen activator system and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby preventing cancer metastasis. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are members of a unique family of zinc-binding endopeptidases that are thought to play an essential role in the process of cancer angiogenesis, invasion, migration, and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534735411417128">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534735411417128">18</xref></sup> Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), a serine proteinase, may initiate the activation of an enzymatic cascade that involves the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn could cleave and activate MMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534735411417128">19</xref></sup> The activation of these enzymes enables the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cells, allowing their access to the vasculature, invasion into the target organ and development of tumor metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534735411417128">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534735411417128"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411417128">21</xref></sup> Moreover, u-PA or MMPs gene expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level through nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1), which are the downstream factors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K-Akt pathways. At the posttranscriptional levels, u-PA and MMPs can be further modified by their activators or inhibitors depending on their surface localization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534735411417128">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534735411417128">23</xref></sup> Hence, based on the functional importance of MMPs and u-PA in cancer metastasis, these molecules and their governing signaling pathways have been considered as primary targets for the development of therapeutic and chemopreventive agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411417128">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534735411417128">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is quite clear that <italic>P urinaria</italic> L may inhibit the growth of various cancers by inducing cancer cells toward apoptosis, limited studies are available concerning the effect of <italic>P urinaria</italic> L in antimetastasis. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of PUE on cell invasion of highly metastatic lung carcinoma cell lines. The changes of cell physiology or molecular events involved in cell invasion and the effect on tumor cell metastasis in vivo were also investigated.</p>

<title>Preparation of Phyllanthus urinaria L. Extracts</title>
<p>The <italic>P urinaria</italic> L extracts (PUE) were prepared as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534735411417128">25</xref></sup> Briefly, 100 g of air-dried leaves were boiled at 60°C for 24 hours with 500 mL of 50% ethanol. The extraction procedure was repeated twice. Then, solvent was removed from the combined extract with a vacuum rotary evaporator. The filtrate was then lyophilized and stored at −20°C. Furthermore, the chemical profile of PUE was analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–mass spectrometer. Briefly, PUE was analyzed by HPLC–mass spectrometer using a HPLC (Waters 600 with a 2998 Photodiode Array detector). Samples (10 µL) were injected into a Merck LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (4 mm × 250 mm). The analyses were carried out using the mobile phase composed of 2 solvents: solvent A (0.05% acetic acid/water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). The flow rate was 1 mL/min. The elution was carried out in a programmed gradient elution as follows: 0 to 30 minutes, with 0% to 60% B; 30 to 35 minutes, isocratic with 100% B; 35 to 40 minutes, isocratic with 100% A. Absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. The molecular masses of the peaks were determined from electrospray ionization mass spectra using multiply charged ion profile based on the modified method of Chu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534735411417128">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the main cause of cancer-related deaths in Asian and Western populations. Most deaths from lung cancer are related to metastasis, which is a complicated and currently uncontrolled process. The 5-year survival rate of all stages of lung cancer is estimated to be only approximately 15%, and non–small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534735411417128">32</xref></sup> Thus, inhibition of metastasis of lung cancer is thought to be one of the important therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcome. In the present study, we provide evidence for the antimetastatic potentials of PUE against the invasion of A549 and LLC cells, a highly metastatic non–small cell lung cancer cell line. In these cell lines, PUE could exert inhibitory actions on cell invasive capability with reduced cellular motility and activation of matrix-degrading proteases, MMPs and u-PA.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of malignant tumors is their ability to invade the surrounding tissues and then metastasize. The spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor and subsequent growth of secondary tumors in distant tissues and organs may complicate the clinical management and may even lead to death. The progression of a tumor from being in situ to invasive is a major prerequisite for cancer metastasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534735411417128">33</xref></sup> and this comprises attachment and proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane followed by migration through the ECM. Invasion of cancer cells also involves various cytophysiological changes, including loss of cell–cell adhesion along with gain of cell–matrix adhesion and increased activation and expression of extracellular proteases to degrade the ECM and allow cell invasion and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534735411417128">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534735411417128">34</xref></sup> Basically, the progression of tumor cells from in situ to invasive is correlated with increased cellular motility and proteolytic activities.</p>
<p>In previous studies, silibinin, a flavonoid from silybum marianum, could inhibit the invasion of human lung carcinoma A549 cells via decreased MMP-2 and u-PA expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534735411417128">35</xref></sup> Earlier reports have indicated that sesquiterpenes exhibit effective inhibition of cell migration of melanoma cancer B16 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534735411417128">36</xref></sup> Epigallocatechin-3-gallate has been reported to be able to inhibit the invasion of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via suppression of MMP activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534735411417128">37</xref></sup> New evidence indicated that MMPs can maintain osteoblast survival by activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534735411417128">38</xref></sup> The expression and activity of MMPs are increased in almost every type of human cancer, and this correlates with advanced tumor stage, increased invasion, and metastasis. Hence, the decrease of MMPs is a critical target for antimetastasis. In the present study, we have demonstrated that PUE could inhibit MMPs and u-PA expression of lung cancer A549 and LLC cells and further inhibit invasion property. Since several studies on different cell types have indicated that MAPKs, for example, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38<sup>MAPK</sup>, seem to play a central role in regulating the expression of u-PA or MMPs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534735411417128">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534735411417128">39</xref></sup> inhibition of the MAPK pathway might have the potential to prevent angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis for a wide range of tumors. Our present data have revealed that PUE treatment inhibited phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and concurrent reduction in the levels of MMP-2 and u-PA, indicating a possible mechanism of inhibition of MMP-2 or u-PA synthesis by PUE. Additionally, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway also played a crucial role in MMPs or u-PA gene regulation, cell survival, and tumor cell invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534735411417128">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534735411417128">40</xref></sup> In our studies, treatment of PUE inhibited phosphorylation of Akt. Our findings suggest that PUE-caused reduction of MMP-2 and u-PA activities in the culture media could possibly be through a suppression of phosphorylation of Akt. It is well known that the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, the downstream of the PI3K-Akt pathways, is associated with inflammation, angiogenesis, and cell invasion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534735411417128">41</xref></sup> and that downregulation of any of these transcription factors is potentially an effective means to block tumor invasion and metastasis, as well as blocking the factors that bind to these regulatory elements. Therefore, this represents an appropriate approach to inhibit the synthesis of MMPs or u-PA. In our studies, PUE was found to effectively suppress the expression and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1.</p>
<p>The major drawbacks of many effective cancer chemotherapeutic agents are systemic toxicity and drug resistance. In this regard, dietary supplement and phytotherapeutic agents with high anticancer activity and less toxicity to normal tissues have been suggested as possible candidates for their capability to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534735411417128">42</xref></sup> In the present study, MRC-5, a normal human fetal lung fibroblast cell, were used to demonstrate that PUE exerted no cytotoxicity on normal lung cells. In conclusion, <italic>P urinaria</italic> potently inhibits lung carcinoma invasion and metastatic potential; therefore, it might be a potentially beneficial natural component for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer.</p>
