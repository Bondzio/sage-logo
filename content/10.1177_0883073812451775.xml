<abstract>
<p>We conducted an online survey of elementary school teachers in Washtenaw County, Michigan, regarding their confidence in their knowledge of epilepsy and their preferred media or sources of information about epilepsy. Eighty-three teachers (9.3%) responded. One quarter expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to teach students with epilepsy or to respond appropriately to a seizure. Teachers most frequently (68%) cited the Internet as their primary source of information about epilepsy, with the school nurse and parents/guardians also frequently mentioned (55% and 48%, respectively). In contrast, most respondents prefer that their information come from the school nurse (74%) or a physician (73%), while only 25% cited the Internet as a preferred source. Teachers most frequently indicated EpilepsyFoundation.org (70.5%) as a trusted source of information. Future collaborative education efforts between school nurses and physicians, especially through use of the Internet, could improve teachers’ knowledge of epilepsy.</p>

<p>Apart from their seizures, children with epilepsy are at high risk for a number of psychosocial problems, including learning disabilities, academic underachievement, emotional problems, and difficulties with social interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451775">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451775"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812451775"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812451775">4</xref></sup> Many of these issues can be accentuated by incorrect perceptions of people with epilepsy, leading to stigma. A lack of knowledge about epilepsy and seizures could also result in decreased safety for students with epilepsy and sometimes unnecessary activation of emergency medical services. It is possible that improved dissemination of information about epilepsy to teachers could dispel some stigma, improve safety and appropriate utilization of medical resources, and lead to better psychosocial functioning among school-aged children with epilepsy.</p>
<p>Previous studies, both in the United States and in other countries, have surveyed school teachers about their attitudes toward epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451775">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451775"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451775"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451775">8</xref></sup> Some of this research also assessed teachers’ knowledge about epilepsy. However, studies have not specifically addressed teachers’ self-assessed confidence in their knowledge about epilepsy. Similarly, to our knowledge, no published studies to date have assessed teachers’ preferred media or other sources of information about epilepsy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to discern how confident local (Washtenaw County, Michigan) elementary school teachers are in their knowledge about seizures and epilepsy and to identify their preferred media or other sources of information about epilepsy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812451775" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>E-mail addresses for Washtenaw County, Michigan, elementary school teachers were gathered from public access school district directories. In our county, elementary school encompasses kindergarten through fifth grade. All 894 e-mail addresses were used for a brief online, anonymous survey. Two weeks after the initial contact, a reminder e-mail was sent to those who had not yet responded to the survey. Exemption from regulation was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>The survey had 16 questions and was divided into 3 sections. The first section asked for the teachers’ background information: what grade level they teach, whether they teach regular or special education, years of experience, how many students with epilepsy they have taught in their career, if they have friends or family members with epilepsy, and if they have ever witnessed either a convulsive or absence seizure. The second section used a 5-point scale for teachers to rate their degree of confidence in teaching students with epilepsy, in knowing what to do if a student has a seizure, in correctly identifying when a student has a seizure, and in their overall knowledge about epilepsy. The third section addressed teachers’ preferred sources of information about epilepsy and their use of the Internet for this purpose. We compared the responses of special education teachers to those of regular classroom teachers using Fisher exact tests. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied a Holm-Bonferroni correction, such that a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .005 was considered significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0883073812451775">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Eighty-three of 894 teachers responded to the survey (9.3% response rate), 81 of whom completed the survey in its entirety. Respondents were fairly evenly distributed across grade levels, with the lowest proportion (10%) of respondents teaching second grade and the highest (19%) teaching fifth grade. Fifty-nine respondents (72%) said they teach in a regular classroom, while 16 (20%) said they teach in a special education classroom and 2 (3%) in resource room. Most (88%) of the respondents have been teaching for more than 5 years.</p>
<p>The main data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812451775">Table 1</xref>. They are interpreted according to a Holm-Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. Nine of the 81 respondents (11%) said they currently had a student with epilepsy (19% of special education teachers). The proportion of special education compared with regular classroom teachers who reported having taught at least one student with epilepsy in their career (75% vs 58%, respectively) did not reach statistical significance. Special education teachers were, however, significantly more likely to have taught 3 or more students with epilepsy than regular classroom teachers (50% vs 14%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .0038). Over half of all respondents (n = 46, 56%) said that they had witnessed a convulsion. Special education teachers were not significantly more likely than regular classroom teachers to report having witnessed an absence seizure (69% vs 34%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .0078). Thirty percent of all respondents were not sure if they have ever witnessed an absence seizure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this survey suggest that a substantial proportion of elementary school teachers lack confidence in their knowledge about epilepsy and that they feel some apprehension when teaching students who have epilepsy. While special education teachers were somewhat more confident in their knowledge and teaching abilities than those who teach in regular classrooms, a sizable proportion still considered their knowledge about epilepsy to be inadequate. This suggests that teachers are aware that epilepsy can negatively affect a child’s day-to-day life but also implies some degree of anxiety and perhaps stigma that might be assuaged through more easily accessible and reliable information about epilepsy. Also, lack of teacher training and confidence in recognizing and responding to seizures has important implications for affecting children’s safety while they are at school.</p>
<p>The most novel and practically applicable data obtained through this survey relate to how information is disseminated to teachers and Internet use for this purpose. While other studies have addressed teachers’ attitudes toward epilepsy in detail,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451775">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451775"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451775"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451775">8</xref></sup> we specifically wanted to learn from teachers themselves their preferred sources of information about seizures and epilepsy. Interestingly, there was a discrepancy between where teachers typically obtain information (primarily the Internet) and where they would prefer to obtain information (physicians and school nurses).</p>
<p>According to this survey, the Internet is frequently used, even though teachers report that they would prefer learning about seizures and epilepsy through other sources. When given a number of Web sites to choose from, respondents recognized the Epilepsy Foundation, Web MD, and the closest academic medical center (University of Michigan) as likely reliable sources of information.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations, including the poor overall response rate. Low response rates for surveys of teachers are not without precedent. One published mailed survey of elementary and middle school teachers regarding students with epilepsy, conducted in a different state, reported a 23% response rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451775">5</xref></sup> A similar national survey published by the same primary author reported a 25.6% response rate, although only one third of those who responded (&lt;9% of survey recipients) chose to respond online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451775">6</xref></sup> Survey respondents may have participated because they were more aware of, or had more experience with, students with epilepsy. If this is the case, we would expect a higher response rate to shift the result toward less confidence surrounding epilepsy knowledge, thus emphasizing our main findings. The opposite is also possible (those who lacked confidence in their epilepsy knowledge may have been more likely to respond). Our finding that a substantial number of the 83 respondents (most of whom had more than 5 years’ teaching experience), including special education teachers, lack confidence in their knowledge about epilepsy is striking.</p>
<p>Because of the relatively small sample size, we may have lacked statistical power to determine whether there were significant differences between regular classroom and special education teachers. This, however, was not the primary purpose of the study. For many of the responses, there was a large absolute difference in the answers between special education and regular classroom teachers. Although these did not reach statistical significance, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, these trends could form important preliminary data for future studies.</p>
<p>Because our survey was conducted online, those who responded may have been more likely to report using the Internet as an information source than those who did not respond. In one study, patients with epilepsy who participated via an online survey were much more likely to report seeking health information on the Internet than those who participated via a paper survey distributed in the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451775">9</xref></sup> However, since teachers belong to a demographic category that is typically very comfortable using the Internet as a means of communication (94% of those with a college degree use the Internet as opposed to 69% of high school graduates),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812451775">10</xref></sup> we believe that this effect is likely small in our study. Lastly, because the respondents knew this study was being conducted by physicians at the University of Michigan, who provide a substantial proportion of the pediatric neurology care in the area, some degree of bias was likely introduced when they reported physicians and the University of Michigan Web site as preferred sources of information.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, it may be helpful for physicians and teachers to communicate more frequently and formally regarding students with epilepsy. More effective and efficient modes of communication should be sought. Collaboration with school nurses may be particularly beneficial because they already are identified as a trusted source of medical information and care in the school system.</p>
<p>The Internet may also be especially helpful in this regard. Since the advent of the Internet, use of this medium for dissemination of health information has rapidly expanded. In 2006, more than 80% of Internet users searched for online health information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812451775">11</xref></sup> Faced with this rapid growth, concern has been raised repeatedly by the medical community that information on the Internet may be inaccurate and even detrimental.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812451775">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812451775">13</xref></sup> It has become clear, however, that the Internet is a potentially powerful tool that is only growing in reach and content. Medical professionals may be able to fulfill the desire expressed by teachers in our survey for communication directly from local physicians by using a medium already in widespread use. Physicians may create Web sites of their own or refer others to reliable Web sites already in place to help educate a broader audience, including elementary school teachers.</p>
