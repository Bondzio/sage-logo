<p><italic>I Believe I’ll Testify: The Art of African American Preaching</italic></p>
<p>Cleophus J. LaRue</p>
<p>Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2011. 144 pp. $17.00</p>
<p>In this collection of essays, several of which have been previously published, Cleophus LaRue, the Francis Landey Patton Professor of Homiletics at Princeton Theological Seminary, combines two helpful resources in one. Although noting the diversity in African American preaching, LaRue offers a broad, concise introduction to this preaching tradition. In addition, through the lens of African American preaching, he provides an accessible and engaging homiletical textbook that covers many of the traditional topics: the calling of the preacher (through his own personal story), the purpose of preaching, the use of Scripture, the role of imagination, the language of preaching, and the preparation and delivery of the sermon. By bringing together these two strands in a single book, LaRue makes a welcome contribution to the field. The book will be a valuable resource for teachers of preaching in all traditions as well as for pastors in the church and students in preaching classes.</p>
<p>Two essays offer critical direction for the future of homiletics. In “Black Preaching and White Homiletics,” LaRue highlights the ways in which these traditions have been like “two ships passing in the night,” failing to converse with each other in substantive ways. In particular, LaRue notes the ways in which white homileticians have too often neglected the insights and practices of the African American pulpit from which they have much to learn. In addition, LaRue highlights important areas for future conversation between black preaching and white homiletics. His treatment of the role of mentoring in the training of African American preachers is particularly important, offering a model that should be considered by everyone who teaches preaching.</p>
<p>In “The Shape of Colored Preaching in the Twenty-first Century,” LaRue reminds North American homileticians that the future of preaching lies in the southern continents, where the Church is growing most rapidly. Arguing that a central characteristic of this “colored” preaching is the fluid crossing of boundaries between the empirical and spiritual worlds, LaRue suggests that African American preaching has significant common ground with this broader “colored” preaching and will have much to contribute to this homiletical dialogue. While the international homiletical conversation is currently expanding, North American and European homiletics have not yet adequately engaged this new, emerging preaching in the southern continents. In calling both for expanded conversation between white homiletics and black preaching as well as greater attention to the significant “colored” preaching around the globe, LaRue has set forth an important and constructive agenda for homiletics in North America.</p>
<p><italic>I Believe I’ll Testify</italic> is thus a concise, accessible, and suggestive book. It undoubtedly will be and should be a popular text among pastors and in preaching classes. However, this strength is also the book’s limitation. As a collection of essays, each of which can stand on its own, the book lacks the development and richness of a more integrated work. One longs for LaRue to explore more fully the diversity within African American preaching and to develop in more depth and detail the implications of his suggestive, future-oriented pieces dealing with black–white homiletical conversation and “colored” preaching. LaRue is one of our most important North American homileticians, and he has set forth an agenda that he is distinctively situated to pursue. One hopes he will continue to develop that agenda in the years ahead.</p>
