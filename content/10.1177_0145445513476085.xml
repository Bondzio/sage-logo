<abstract>
<p>A number of studies have used mindfulness-based interventions to influence the behavior of people with intellectual disabilities, to improve their quality of life, and to reduce challenging behavior. The present review critically evaluates 18 studies and assesses the clinical and academic impact of their findings. Strengths identified included replicable methodological approaches, use of multiple baseline designs, strong construct and criterion validity, and consideration of the mechanisms by which mindfulness influences behavior change. Limitations included a lack of randomized controlled trials, inclusion of qualitative data without structured analysis, limited use of statistical analyses, and problems with sampling leading to difficulties generalizing findings. There was also a paucity of research investigating the impact of “Dialectical Behavior Therapy” and “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy” and the role of mindfulness within these approaches. Further research is warranted in this regard.</p>

<body>
<p>People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) often face numerous behavioral challenges, including difficulties with communication that limit their capacity to express themselves and make their needs and preferences known. In addition, they may have physical and sensory disabilities that limit their ability to interact with those around them. Behavioral challenges can include aggression directed at others or the self, and sexualized and stereotyped behaviors. These behaviors may make community access (including day care provisions) problematic. A number of approaches are used to support caregivers to understand and manage challenging behavior in the people whom they support. Advances in theory and approach, including a move toward the support of positive behaviors, have led some practitioners to explore new interventions. Mindfulness is one such approach that can be used alongside or as an alternative to the behavioral model. This literature review aims to provide a critical narrative review of studies using mindfulness-based interventions to address behavioral challenges in people with IDs.</p>
<p>Mindfulness can be defined as “paying attention in a particular way, on purpose in the present moment and nonjudgmentally” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445513476085">Kabat-Zinn, 1994</xref>, p. 4). Another definition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445513476085">Bishop et al. (2004)</xref> states that mindfulness, originating from Buddhism, enables people to orient their attention toward experiences in the present moment, with acceptance, curiosity and openness. Mindfulness was identified as a method for promoting mental health and ameliorating psychological distress by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445513476085">Kabat-Zinn (1982)</xref> who used a mindfulness-based program to manage chronic pain. Mindfulness has been used to support people with a range of clinical issues, including managing anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145445513476085">Wright, Day, &amp; Howells, 2009</xref>), reducing substance misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445513476085">Bowen et al., 2009</xref>), stress, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445513476085">Speca, Carlson, Goodey, &amp; Angen, 2000</xref>) and improving psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445513476085">Chambers &amp; Allen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0145445513476085">
<title>Current Approaches to Challenging Behavior Among People With IDs</title>
<p>The three widely adopted criteria for defining IDs are (a) significant limitations in intellectual functioning (as measured by an individually administered fully standardized IQ test; for example, a score less than 70 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Fourth Edition), (b) significant limitations in adaptive behavior/social functioning (via assessment of conceptual/communication abilities, activities of daily living, and social skills), and (c) that the disability originates before age 18. Conditions such as dyslexia, often included under the umbrella of “learning difficulties” would not, in isolation, be classified as an ID, and although mental health problems and personality disorders can be found in people with IDs, the presence of these conditions would not warrant a diagnosis of ID without the criteria outlined above being met.</p>
<p>Current strategies designed to promote positive behavior change and reduce challenging behavior (e.g., aggression, self-harm, and property damage) among people with IDs include (a) psychopharmacological, (b) behavioral, and (c) cognitive-behavioral approaches. Psychopharmacological approaches involve the use of neuroleptic or anticonvulsant drugs to reduce challenging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445513476085">Unwin &amp; Deb, 2011</xref>). However, there are concerns around the use of pharmacological approaches alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445513476085">Unwin and Deb (2011)</xref> outline some of these, including side effects such as somnolence and weight gain. Further concerns outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445513476085">Deb, Sohanpal, Soni, Unwin, and Lenôtre (2007)</xref> include insufficient evidence to recommend specific medication for specific behavior problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445513476085">Reudrich et al. (2008)</xref> also suggest that atypical antipsychotics can work to decrease aggressive behavior, but not self-injurious behavior. In short, there are good reasons to advocate a nonpharmacological approach to reduce challenging behavior in people with IDs.</p>
<p>Behavioral approaches have also been used to reduce challenging behavior and promote positive behaviors. There is a growing support for moving beyond applied behavior analysis and toward positive behavior support, which uses systems change methods to reduce challenging behavior through the use of proactive, preemptive strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445513476085">Allen, James, Evans, Hawkins, &amp; Jenkins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445513476085">Carr et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445513476085">Hayes (2004)</xref> outlined experiential approaches that emphasized factors such as openness, acceptance, and spirituality. Experiential approaches include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445513476085">Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999</xref>), which focuses on how people with IDs can perpetuate their difficulties through their own language and understanding. The ACT approach uses mindful principles to help people to accept themselves and let go of thoughts that have previously hindered progress. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445513476085">Linehan, 1993</xref>) is an approach that was developed to enable people with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) to develop effective coping skills, including mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. Both of these approaches include mindfulness as a key component and both have been used with people with IDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445513476085">Brown &amp; Hooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445513476085">Lew, Matta, Tripp-Tebo, &amp; Watts, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Mindfulness-Based Interventions for People With IDs</title>
<p>A number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of mindfulness for promoting positive behavior change and improving the quality of life of people with IDs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2009)</xref> used a multiple baseline design to investigate how mindfulness training influences the use of physical restraints by staff working with people with moderate to severe IDs. Singh et al. found that as the mindfulness training progressed, the use of restraints decreased to almost no use at all. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2007)</xref> found that aggressive behavior decreased with training in “Meditation on the Soles of the Feet”—an exercise in which participants are asked to focus on the soles of their feet to shift their attention and awareness to a neutral part of their body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445513476085">Singh, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, effects were maintained for at least 2 years (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al., 2008</xref>). The present review aims to systematically review and critically evaluate the evidence on mindfulness-based interventions for people with IDs. The review includes studies that use mindfulness as a stand-alone intervention as well as studies that incorporate mindfulness-based approaches into other psychological interventions, such as ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445513476085">Hayes et al., 1999</xref>) and DBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445513476085">Linehan, 1993</xref>). The review also considers the impact of mindfulness, when used directly by service users and when incorporated into care by families and caregivers. The review aims to describe the current “state of the art,” as well as to provide direction for future research in this area.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Studies investigating the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for supporting people with IDs were identified by searching five online databases: Web of Knowledge, Ovid, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsycInfo. Searches were conducted in April 2010 and updated in April 2012 using combinations of the search terms: “intellect* disab*,” “learning disab*,” “developmental disab*,” “retard*,” “mindful*,” “acceptance and commitment,” and “dialectical behavior.” Reference lists in each article were also evaluated for inclusion (ancestry approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445513476085">Johnson, 1993</xref>). The review had two inclusion criteria. First, studies should include a mindfulness-based intervention designed to influence the behavior of people with a diagnosis of ID. Second, the dependent variable must be behavior change within people with IDs. These inclusion criteria were chosen so as to limit the review to the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on behavior change in people with ID.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445513476085">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of articles through the review process. A total of 464 records were identified by the searching electronic databases. An ancestry approach was then used that identified 12 potentially relevant articles in reference lists. Three further studies were suggested by an anonymous reviewer. A total of 101 full-text articles were evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Literature reviews and presentation of models were excluded. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Manikam, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>) were excluded because participants were diagnosed with Autism and Asperger syndrome. Although the presentation of these disorders may be comorbid with pervasive developmental delay, this was not explicitly stated. As the inclusion criteria specify that IDs must be diagnosed, it was deemed inappropriate to make assumptions about the participants of these studies. A number of studies focused on changes within the caregiver (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445513476085">Macdonald, Hastings, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445513476085">Noone &amp; Hastings, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445513476085">2011</xref>) rather than the patient and so were excluded. In total, 83 studies were excluded, leaving 18 for qualitative synthesis.</p>

<title>Overview of the Studies</title>
<p>Studies used mindfulness as a stand-alone intervention as well as part of interventions based on ACT or DBT. Within the studies considering mindfulness as a stand-alone intervention, five studies trained the caregivers of people with IDs in mindfulness to assess the impact of mindful caregiving on the behavior of people with IDs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al., 2006</xref>). It was notable that training caregivers seemed to be just as effective as delivering the intervention directly to participants. Eight studies used a technique called “Meditation on the Soles of the Feet” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445513476085">Singh, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>). Four studies considered the impact of therapeutic approaches (ACT and DBT) on participants with IDs. Eleven studies used a multiple baseline design using a time-lagged approach with different lengths of baseline and treatment for each participant; the other studies used pre–post designs.</p>

<title>Do Mindfulness-Based Interventions Have an Effect on the Behavior of People With IDs?</title>
<p>Many studies outlined clear clinical benefits of mindfulness-based interventions. Within the 18 studies, 10 studies recorded aggression as a dependent variable. All of these studies found that mindfulness-based interventions led to reduced aggression. Other studies found reduced levels of stress in participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins, Singh, Winton, McKeegan, &amp; Singh, 2010</xref>) and in parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2007</xref>), reduced depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin, Hutchins, &amp; Patterson, 2008</xref>), reduced obsessive thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445513476085">Brown &amp; Hooper, 2009</xref>), decreased self-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al., 2006</xref>), injury to staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh, Wahler, Adkins, &amp; Myers, 2003</xref>), weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>), smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>), reduced self-reports of deviant sexual arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>), and a decrease in staff management of aggression through restraints and medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> observed that a previous participant in a mindfulness-based intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2003</xref>) independently began to teach his peers how to use the technique of “Meditation on the Soles of the Feet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445513476085">Singh, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>) to control their anger.</p>
<p>Six studies noticed additional clinical benefits that arose through participants developing mindfulness and extending it to other areas of their lives. These included a reduction in maladaptive behaviors such as skin-picking and “temper tantrums” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2008</xref>). Another study found that care staff became more involved with the client following exposure to a mindfulness-based intervention and offered more creative, flexible, and adaptable care than at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2004</xref>). A number of other positive changes were also noted, including increased prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2007</xref>), social and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al., 2006</xref>), staff satisfaction and social validation of staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al., 2006</xref>), parenting satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2007</xref>), increased levels of happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2004</xref>), and increased social functioning and academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> also noted improved social interactions with peers, improved relationships with staff members, as well as increased feelings of calmness and hope for the future. Mindfulness-based interventions were shown to be an effective intervention for the reduction of challenging behavior (e.g., outbursts, self-injury), and studies also reported improvements in the mental health and emotional well-being of participants that were exposed to mindfulness-based interventions. In short, the reviewed studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions have a clear potential for promoting positive outcomes among people with IDs.</p>
<p>Four studies considered the impact of ACT and DBT, interventions that incorporate mindfulness principles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445513476085">Brown and Hooper (2009)</xref> presented a case study that outlined how ACT was conducted and adapted to meet participant’s needs. Further information regarding the impact of ACT on the participants’ anxiety and obsessive thoughts might, however, have been useful in terms of assessing the clinical impact of the intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445513476085">Lew et al. (2009)</xref> found an initial increase in risky behaviors (e.g., self-harm, substance misuse, sexual risk taking) as a function of DBT. However, the initial increase was followed by a subsequent decrease in these behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445513476085">Brown and Hooper (2009)</xref> and Lew et al. highlighted how the therapy might have a broader clinical impact, including using experiential mindfulness within ACT to support people with limited verbal and language abilities and using DBT to support people with IDs to manage their emotions and reduce their level of risk to themselves and to others.</p>
<p>Several studies outlined the impact of the research on the services within which the intervention took place. This included a cost-benefit analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al., 2008</xref>), which showed that staff absenteeism reduced from 310 days to 15 days and resultant costs reduced from $51,508 to $2,244 due to participants’ reduced aggression and thus lower injury-related costs for the service. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2003)</xref> also reported a reduction in staff and client injuries as a result of decreased aggression in their client.</p>

<title>Are the Effects of Mindfulness on Behavior Generalizable?</title>
<p>Of the 18 studies, 5 were case studies of single participants. Of the other studies, sample sizes ranged from 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Adkins, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>) to 34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>) with a median of 3 participants. In short, sample sizes were relatively small across most of the studies, limiting the power of the research and increasing the chance of Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis).</p>
<p>The severity of IDs within participants is another factor that may influence effect sizes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2009)</xref> provided information on the severity of IDs and psychiatric diagnoses. This additional information enables future researchers to assess whether these findings can be generalized to a wider population. Currently, the studies suggest that a mindful approach can benefit participants across the spectrum of IDs, including participants with mild IDs and Prader–Willi syndrome (e.g., developing a mindful approach to eating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2008</xref>; Singh, Lancioni, &amp; Singh, 2011) and people with profound IDs (e.g., increasing happy expressions through the impact of mindful caregiving, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another factor that may influence the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions is the experience and training of staff members who develop a mindful approach. Staff training can influence care staff members’ ability to communicate effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445513476085">Smidt, Balandin, Reed, &amp; Sigafoos, 2007</xref>) and respond to challenging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445513476085">Dowey, Toogood, Hastings, &amp; Nash, 2007</xref>). Therefore, to ensure generalizability of findings, levels of staff training should be outlined clearly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2004)</xref> considered staff members’ previous training and length of experience, to ensure that the caregivers performance in behavior management and skills training were equivalent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2007)</xref> outlined the behavior management and parent training programs that study participants had attended, providing helpful information about parental experience in terms of behavior management and other parenting training. These factors may affect the potential to confidently generalize the findings.</p>
<p>Participants’ motivation to engage with the mindfulness-based intervention could also influence the effectiveness of the intervention. A large body of research highlights the importance of motivation in terms of engagement, learning, and subsequent behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445513476085">Martin, 2008</xref>). For example, evidence suggests that autonomous motivation (where participants feel engagement in therapy is a freely made choice) is a stronger predictor of clinical outcome than is therapeutic alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145445513476085">Zuroff et al., 2007</xref>). However, measuring motivation in people with IDs can be difficult. One approach might be to use the Transtheoretical Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445513476085">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>) to conceptualize participant’s motivation to change. For example, the “Readiness to Change” questionnaire has been successfully modified to use with people with IDs who were seeking employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445513476085">Rose, Perks, Fidan, &amp; Hurst, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of the reviewed studies considered factors that might influence participants’ motivation to engage with the intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al. (2006)</xref> recruited mother–child dyads in which the mothers had specifically requested mindfulness training to support their children with autism, suggesting that the mothers were motivated to actively participate. Another seven studies outlined circumstances that might have fostered intrinsic motivation to reduce challenging behavior (motivation driven by interest or enjoyment in the task itself, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445513476085">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>), including a desire to move from a psychiatric inpatient unit to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2003</xref>), family and client concerns about health risks posed by morbid obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al., 2008</xref>), being at risk of exclusion from a group home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Adkins, et al., 2007</xref>), being unable to transition to a step-down program preceding community placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al., 2008</xref>), wishing to stop smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>), and being at risk of losing a job, a residential living placement, preferred staff, or funding for residential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2011</xref>). However, it should be noted that all of these studies inferred participants’ motivation on the basis of these factors, rather than actually measuring motivation to engage with the intervention.</p>

<title>Are Studies Considering the Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Behavior Potentially Replicable?</title>
<p>For research to be potentially replicable by other researchers, consideration needs to be given to the clarity of the methodology and the level of detail provided in the published reports. Of the 18 studies, 12 (67%) were conducted by the same group of researchers (Nirbhay Singh and colleagues) from the ONE Research Institute in Virginia, USA, and the American Health and Wellness Institute, also in Virginia, USA. These studies have similar methods, tending to use multiple baseline designs and standardized staff or parent mindfulness courses (delivered across 5 days to 12 weeks), or “Meditation on the Soles of the Feet” training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445513476085">Singh, Singh, et al, 2011</xref>). All of these articles outline their intervention clearly in terms of describing the data collection, defining the dependent variables, and detailing the mindfulness-based intervention. However, there were some differences in the level of detail provided. Neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al. (2006)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al. (2010)</xref> described the times at which data collection occurred. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al. (2006)</xref> did not provide the specific instructions that participants were given when moving into the mindful phase of the research. Finally, Adkins et al. did not outline any changes that occurred when participants moved into the follow-up phase. Future research might consult reporting guidelines (such as those developed by the CONSORT Group; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445513476085">Schulz, Altman, Moher, &amp; The CONSORT Group, 2010</xref>) to ensure that all relevant information is presented.</p>
<p>Another important factor in assessing the robustness and replicability of research is the clarity and consistency of the intervention. Each of the eight studies using the “Meditation on the Soles of the Feet” technique taught the technique to participants individually in structured training sessions. They clearly outlined this technique in terms of how it was taught and practiced by participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al. (2010)</xref> also clearly outlined the technique, although they took a more individualized approach, adapting the teaching to each participant’s needs, which may have limited the consistency of this technique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, et al. (2008)</xref> clearly outlined the amendments that they made to support their participants’ understanding, thus enhancing the clarity of their intervention. Finally, studies that considered the impact of DBT on participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445513476085">Esbensen &amp; Benson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445513476085">Lew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan, Shaw, &amp; Collier, 2010</xref>) outlined the effects of DBT in terms of reduced suicidal risk. This effect of DBT was replicated across these three studies, supporting the possibility that this effect might also be replicated in larger, more powerful studies.</p>

<title>Are the Outcome Measures Used Within Mindfulness-Based Interventions Reliable and Valid in Terms of Measuring Changes in Behavior?</title>
<p>Outcome measures included behavioral observations by staff (used by 12 of the 18 studies) and parents (used by 3 of the 18 studies). Five studies used a combination of behavioral observations and self-report measures. These included ratings of parental satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2007</xref>), work satisfaction and social validation of staff members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al., 2006</xref>), risk, strengths, and adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al. (2010)</xref> used self-reports of distress, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depression and anxiety. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, A. N. Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> used self-report measures of sexual arousal. A number of studies acknowledged limitations of the measures, including not using physiological data (e.g., penile plethysmography, or carbon monoxide measures) to corroborate self-reports.</p>
<p>Eleven studies calculated interrater reliability to ensure consistency across the individuals collecting observational data. Across these studies, interrater reliability ranged from 82% to 100%, with an average of 94.5% reliability. Three of the studies using observational measures did not calculate interrater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445513476085">Esbensen &amp; Benson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> sought to confirm the accuracy of self-reports by speaking to other people present during aggressive incidents. This had 100% accuracy, suggesting that the self-reports were reliable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> relied on observation of smoking behavior from others. This may not have been as accurate as the measures used during the experimental phase of this study as staff may not be present to observe all smoking incidents.</p>
<p>Some of the studies used self-report data alone to assess, for example, anxiety, attitude changes, social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>), acceptance and avoidance of cognitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445513476085">Brown &amp; Hooper, 2009</xref>), and measures of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445513476085">Lew et al., 2009</xref>). For the self-report measures, test–retest reliability and tests of internal consistency can indicate the reliability of these measures. Of the 18 studies, 1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>) assessed reliability and reported that their measures had “acceptable” levels of internal consistency and test–retest reliability. None of the other studies reported the internal consistency or test–retest reliability of their measures. As a result, it is not possible to evaluate the test–retest reliability and internal consistency of the measures used in these studies.</p>
<p>Validity of the measures (in terms of effectively measuring behavior change) was considered in terms of face validity, construct validity, criterion validity, and internal validity. Studies using objective measures tended to define what constituted the dependent variables. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, J. Singh, et al. (2011)</xref> defined anger and aggression as self-detected emotional arousal (defined using concepts such as heart racing, face flushing, feeling wronged, or provoked). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al. (2010)</xref> collected incident reports at baseline and across the intervention period but did not specify which behaviors led to the completion of incident reports, limiting the face and construct validity of this particular measure.</p>
<p>Face and construct validity was strong across studies using self-report measures, with the measures used seeming appropriate to the dependent variables being studied. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al. (2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al., 2007</xref>) used measures of parental satisfaction and stress levels when considering aggressive challenging behavior in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al.

However, their use of a youth measure does limit face and construct validity, in terms of whether this accurately measures risk in a sample of participants with IDs.</p>
<p>A number of the studies combined objective and self-report measures to enhance criterion validity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2007)</xref> included observational measures of the frequency of aggression and positive and negative social interactions. These observational measures were supported by self-report measures of parenting satisfaction, interaction satisfaction, perceived parental stress, and levels of mindfulness. In addition, Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. conducted informal qualitative interviews to assess the impact of the intervention, the mothers’ experiences and perceived behavioral outcomes. Strong criterion validity was demonstrated; as the aggressive behavior and negative interactions decreased, the positive interactions increased, satisfaction increased, and stress decreased. Participants also reported increased levels of mindfulness, suggesting that the changes were attributable to the intervention. In sum, a number of studies showed strong criterion validity by drawing from a range of data sources to evaluate behavioral change as a result of mindfulness-based interventions.</p>

<title>Are the Research Designs Used by Studies Evaluating Mindfulness-Based Interventions Appropriate?</title>
<p>Of the 18 studies, 11 used a multiple baseline approach. This design involves different lengths of baseline and treatment for each participant. A multiple baseline approach allows the researcher to establish whether changes (e.g., in behavior) are associated with the treatment phases of the intervention, or if other factors might influence participants. Alternating treatment phases between participants (within a residential setting) accounts for factors that might affect on all the residents. Alternating treatment phases is an effective research design when clinical sample sizes are small. However, with larger sample sizes, randomized controlled trials may be more effective as they reduce the risk of confounding factors through use of a control sample.</p>
<p>Some studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445513476085">Lew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al., 2010</xref>) used comparative pre–post designs to assess differences before and after the intervention. However, only two of these articles statistically compared the pre–post data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Curtis, et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2009)</xref> had large enough sample sizes to conduct repeated measures analyses; however, they did not use them. Of the 18 studies, 11 collected data at baseline, during treatment, and at follow-up to assess the impact of the mindfulness-based intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Singh, et al. (2007)</xref> monitored aggressive behaviors in this way and a clear decrease during mindfulness training and at follow-up is evident. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Singh, et al. (2008)</xref> also had extensive baselines and therefore were able to notice and comment on behavioral changes associated with mindfulness.</p>
<p>Participants in each study were selected through convenience sampling, and none of the studies used a comparison condition that was not exposed to the intervention. The use of convenience sampling is a substantial limitation in the current evidence base as participants who volunteer may be particularly motivated to engage with the intervention. As such, current studies may overestimate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for supporting people with IDs. Future research should also consider randomly allocating participants to intervention versus control conditions to ensure that any changes in behavior can be attributed to the active components of the intervention. The use of RCTs for testing mindfulness-based interventions for supporting people with IDs is unlikely to be easy. Most studies in this area have relatively small samples—of the 12 noncase study designs, 9 recruited less than 10 participants, thereby limiting the potential power even if a randomized controlled design had been adopted. In addition, many of the participants had been referred to the service conducting the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445513476085">Singh et al., 2003</xref>) or worked or lived in group homes that the research team had chosen to focus on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445513476085">Singh, Lancioni, Winton, Fisher, et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore randomization would have been difficult. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445513476085">Beauchemin et al. (2008)</xref> suggested that it was unethical and impractical to withhold mindfulness training from some clients for research purposes given the potential benefits. Having said this, two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445513476085">Adkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445513476085">Sakdalan et al., 2010</xref>) recommended that randomized controlled trials be conducted in the future to replicate their findings. Ethical concerns associated with RCTs (i.e., withholding interventions from some participants) could be partially resolved in future research by using a wait-list control group. In short, the literature on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions among people with IDs might best be described as being at a relatively early—proof of concept—stage, with the move to randomized controlled trials being the next logical step.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present review suggests that mindfulness-based interventions can influence the behavior of people with IDs, with consistently positive outcomes reported across all 18 studies. However, more rigorous research with improved designs (e.g., RCTs) and greater statistical power is necessary to ensure that the findings are not affected by confounding variables (e.g., relationships between carers and participants, circumstantial changes, or levels of motivation). Randomized controlled trials with larger samples would strengthen confidence in the findings. Therefore, the evidence might best be viewed as at a relatively early stage in its development, and as holding the potential for further promising findings. Addressing methodological limitations will strengthen this body of research and enhance understanding of how mindfulness-based interventions can influence the behavior of people with IDs.</p>
