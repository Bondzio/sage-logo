<abstract>
<p>Our nested case study shows how a China-based focal subsidiary of a Japanese MNC used various power bases to orchestrate a co-opetitive and diverse supplier ecosystem, and to drive cumulative cycles of collaborative capability development involving successive phases of capability gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization. All phases of capability development required the crossing of cognitive boundaries, which was facilitated by mutual engagement with boundary objects, and by common possession of generic background knowledge disseminated by the focal firm. The capability evolution phase also required the crossing of social and governance boundaries, which was supported and legitimized by shared framing assumptions about mutual benefit and continuous development, while the capability institutionalization phase also required the crossing of governance boundaries. Although the focal firm was open to suggestions for mutual benefit, it exercised unilateral control over design decisions, thereby pressurizing its suppliers to engage in capability development to meet specifications that they found arduous. Supplier diversity was a resource, and co-opetition a driving force for the discovery of solutions to manufacturability problems during the capability evolution phase, such that failure to develop requisite capabilities was uncommon.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research on organizational routines, resources and capabilities has flourished since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840612467154">Nelson and Winter’s (1982)</xref> landmark study on the evolutionary theory of the firm. Organizational capabilities have been defined as ‘the know-how that enables organizations to perform (particular) activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612467154">Dosi, Nelson &amp; Winter, 2000</xref>, p. 1), and characterized as bundles of regulatory and coordinative processes, routines and practices that serve as ‘grammars of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612467154">Pentland &amp; Rueter, 1994</xref>) to improve organizational performance over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612467154">Amit &amp; Schoemaker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840612467154">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612467154">Winter, 2000</xref>). Organizations need to engage in the constant improvement and integration of organizational capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612467154">Augier &amp; Teece, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612467154">Dosi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612467154">Eisenhardt &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840612467154">Teece, Pisano &amp; Shuen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840612467154">Vergne &amp; Durand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612467154">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>), in order to adapt to changing technologies and market demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612467154">March, 1991</xref>). Given its theorized importance for firm success, organizational capability development has become a major research focus in strategy and organization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612467154">Helfat, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612467154">Huygens, van den Bosch, Volberda &amp; Baden-Fuller, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies of capability development have examined the associated social psychological processes between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612467154">Felin &amp; Foss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612467154">Gavetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840612467154">Tripsas &amp; Gavetti, 2000</xref>), within groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612467154">Feldman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840612467154">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>), or across functions at intra-organizational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612467154">Augier &amp; Teece, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612467154">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612467154">Bingham, Eisenhardt &amp; Furr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612467154">Birkinshaw, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612467154">Birkinshaw &amp; Hood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612467154">Dosi, Faillo &amp; Marengo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612467154">Dougherty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612467154">Kale, Dyer &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612467154">Raff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840612467154">Whitley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0170840612467154">Wilkesmann, Maximiliane &amp; Virgillto, 2009</xref>). Domains for such studies have included assembly systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612467154">Fujimoto, 2000</xref>), market entry strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612467154">Holbrook, Cohen, Hounshell &amp; Kepper, 2000</xref>), and new product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612467154">Helfat &amp; Raubitschek, 2000</xref>). Some studies have adopted macro-level perspectives to develop models of social capital cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840612467154">Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998</xref>) or of deliberate learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840612467154">Teece et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612467154">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>) to overcome knowledge ‘stickiness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840612467154">Szulanski, 1996</xref>). Key variables in such models include formal integrative mechanisms at group level to facilitate frequent contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612467154">Hibbert &amp; Huxham 2010</xref>), close proximity and co-operation between diverse specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612467154">Heimeriks, Duyster &amp; Vanhaverbeke, 2007</xref>), and governance structures to regulate corporate practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612467154">Argyres &amp; Mayer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612467154">Dosi et al., 2008</xref>). Other studies have focused on the role of micro-level facilitators of capability development, including diversity in managerial cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612467154">Augier &amp; Teece, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612467154">Gavetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612467154">Hargadon &amp; Bechky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840612467154">Laamanen &amp; Wallin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840612467154">Tripsas &amp; Gavetti, 2000</xref>), requisite individual skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612467154">Dosi et al., 2000</xref>), interpersonal coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612467154">Foss &amp; Pedersen, 2004</xref>, p. 343) and suitable incentive schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612467154">Cohendet &amp; Llerena, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A comparatively smaller body of research has investigated capability development at the inter-organizational level, in contexts either of alliance partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz &amp; Hamel 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612467154">Heimeriks &amp; Duyster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612467154">Makhija &amp; Ganesh, 1997</xref>) or of supplier networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612467154">Darr &amp; Talmud, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840612467154">Lakshman &amp; Parente, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612467154">Lui, 2009</xref>). Such research has adopted a ‘knowledge integration’ perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612467154">Foss &amp; Pedersen, 2004</xref>), based on the assumptions that ‘organizational capabilities develop as a result of recombining and/or integrating knowledge within the firm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612467154">Kale et al., 2002</xref>, p. 749) and that inter-organizational collaboration is necessary for the development of key organizational capabilities. Accordingly, it has focused on the ‘institutionalized interfirm processes that are purposefully designed to facilitate knowledge exchanges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Singh, 1998</xref>, p. 665) between collaborating partners. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz and Hamel (1998)</xref> identified knowledge capture, transfer and combination as core logics for forming strategic alliances among partners ‘with strongly differentiated but highly co-specialized contributions’ (p. 13), seeking to access and develop new capabilities by internalizing their learning and governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Studies of capability development within supplier networks have typically featured Japanese manufacturers, such as Toyota, as focal firms with regular knowledge-sharing arrangements with local suppliers that serve to develop network- and relation- specific competencies for improved production performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612467154">Dyer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612467154">Dyer, Cho &amp; Chu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Hatch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>). The central theme in such studies has been the reduction of asymmetries in knowledge possession between relative experts and novices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840612467154">Simonin, 1999</xref>) through the systematic transfer of a distinctive repertoire of knowledge and organizational routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612467154">Hong, Easterby-Smith &amp; Snell, 2006</xref>), with the focal firm as the predominant knowledge provider, and ‘organizational capability as a subject <italic>taught</italic> to suppliers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>, p. 281, emphasis added). More recently, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612467154">Hong, Snell and Easterby-Smith (2009)</xref> have shown that local suppliers may play a more active role in the localizing, embedding and development of new knowledge and capabilities, through processes of boundary crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612467154">Bechky, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research drew on a nested qualitative case study to analyse the sequential processes involved in the collaborative development of new organizational capabilities by a China-based subsidiary of a Japanese multinational corporation (MNC) and its nexus of local suppliers. At the inter-organizational level, cycles or processes of new capability development have hitherto been treated as a ‘black box’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612467154">Carlile &amp; Rebentisch, 2003</xref>). One gap in the literature targeted by our research was the need to analyse how collaborating firms in an inter-organizational network engage in three sequential phases of new capability development, i.e. gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization, while navigating boundary-crossing challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612467154">Scarbrough et al., 2004</xref>) reflecting various inter-organizational differences. The research also addressed another gap in the literature, concerning the impact of asymmetrical power relationships on the development of new capabilities across an inter-organizational network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612467154">Coff, 2010</xref>). Power asymmetries are pervasive in Japanese production networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>), yet it remains unclear how focal firms exert their superior power to nurture, encourage and drive the development of new capabilities across their supplier ecosystems.</p>
<p>The paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, the next section, on theory development, identifies boundary crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612467154">Scarbrough et al., 2004</xref>) at cognitive, social and governance levels, as processes that facilitate and support inter-organizational capability development. The theory development section also envisages the use of power by the focal firm within a co-opetitive supplier ecosystem as a dynamic arrangement that drives inter-organizational capability development. The third section describes and justifies the research methodology. The fourth section presents the main study findings regarding the interplay of processes and factors involved in inter-firm collaboration in the development of new capabilities. We present conclusions and implications for practice in the final section.</p>

<title>Phases of new organizational capability development</title>
<p>We shall conceive new capability development as a system of ‘intentional, deliberate, and intermittent processes involved in skill development and deployment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612467154">Dosi et al., 2000</xref>, p. 3). For new capabilities to emerge and develop, organizations need to engage in complex and variegated forms of activities that involve articulation and codification of initial learning goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840612467154">Kale &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>), mutual adjustment and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612467154">Hargadon &amp; Bechky, 2006</xref>), along with systematization and internalization of knowledge and routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612467154">Darr &amp; Talmud, 2003</xref>), each encompassing specific challenges and difficulties. Thus, in our own view, the overall process of capability development proceeds in a cumulative fashion, comprising of three successive phases of gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization.</p>
<p>Capability gap articulation proceeds from the prior externalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840612467154">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>) and prior codification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840612467154">Kale &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>) of existing knowledge. It may involve the negotiation of ‘stretch’ performance targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612467154">Argyres &amp; Mayer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612467154">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>) or the stipulation thereof; and the identification of gaps between aspirations and current outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612467154">Winter, 2000</xref>). These processes may be driven by external pressures and incentives for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612467154">Cohendet &amp; Llerena, 2003</xref>), and are guided by cues to focus attention and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840612467154">Tripsas &amp; Gavetti, 2000</xref>). Capability gap articulation sets the overall targets and parameters that are to be achieved at the next phase of capability evolution.</p>
<p>Capability evolution entails ‘a host of predictable and interrelated actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612467154">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>, p. 341) as the firm engages in ‘exploration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612467154">March, 1991</xref>) and experiments with changes in order to bridge gaps identified at the capability gap articulation phase. It involves micro-level processes of incremental, situated and ‘mindful’ learning, oriented to the discovery of novel solutions to advance a frontier of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612467154">Hargadon &amp; Bechky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612467154">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612467154">Helfat &amp; Raubitschek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612467154">Karim &amp; Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612467154">King &amp; Ranft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840612467154">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840612467154">Levinthal &amp; Rerup, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840612467154">Lubatkin, Forin &amp; Lane, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612467154">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612467154">Sole &amp; Edmondson, 2002</xref>). The various changes that are adopted successfully to achieve overall targets during this phase feed the subsequent capability institutionalization phase.</p>
<p>Capability institutionalization entails the standardization, systematization, translation and embedding of the new knowledge that has been created during the capability evolution phase into organizational routines, procedures and systems that inform and govern ongoing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612467154">Crossan, Lane &amp; White, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612467154">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612467154">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612467154">Purvis, Sambamurthy &amp; Zmud, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840612467154">Thompson &amp; Walsham, 2004</xref>). The main purposes of this phase are to sustain the new practices that have been created during capability evolution, and to replicate and diffuse them across multiple units in diverse contexts. This involves moving from exploration to exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612467154">March, 1991</xref>), where ‘tasks are defined, actions specified and organizational mechanisms put in place to ensure that certain actions occur’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612467154">Crossan et al., 1999</xref>, p. 525). Capability requirements that are institutionalized at this stage are not static and may be escalated at the gap articulation phase of the next cycle of new capability development.</p>
<p>The model of new organizational capability development that we shall introduce and subsequently demonstrate, through our nested case study of a focal firm and its local suppliers, construes that new capability development proceeds in a cumulative fashion, with each cycle generating an incremental improvement and learning of new skills and routines over successive periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612467154">Winter, 2000</xref>). This is different from the dynamic capability perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612467154">Eisenhardt &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840612467154">Teece et al., 1997</xref>) in which a radical change of existing strategies by reconfiguring, integrating and combining both new and existing firm resources is anticipated.</p>
<p>As we shall further explain in this section, the model also incorporates boundary-crossing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>) between the focal firm and its suppliers that support the above-mentioned three cumulative phases of gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization, along with the power of the focal firm and other aspects of the supplier ecosystem that drive these three phases. Our overall research question is:</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section4-0170840612467154">
<title>Boundaries and boundary crossing</title>
<p>We shall assume that when firms collaborate in new capability development, they need to find ways to overcome barriers to communication, knowledge sharing and knowledge creation, arising from inter-firm differences in specialist expertise and institutional expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612467154">Foss &amp; Lorenzen, 2009</xref>), which may, in turn reflect differences in firm-specific business practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612467154">Kostova, 1999</xref>) and administrative heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612467154">Bartlett &amp; Ghoshal, 1989</xref>). We envisage that, while progressing along the three phases of new capability development, the collaborating firms, with their distinctive features, encounter and need to cross three types of boundary, which we shall classify into cognitive, social and governance-related boundaries.</p>
<sec id="section5-0170840612467154">
<title>Cognitive boundaries</title>
<p>Members of individual firms typically subscribe to distinctive standards and expectations that are shaped by firm-specific operational experiences and knowledge domains, which frame their assumptions about what is considered appropriate and feasible in particular situations. Cognitive boundaries involve syntactic and/or semantic forms of demarcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>) between different knowledge communities in terms of interpretative schemata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612467154">Boland &amp; Tenkasi, 1995</xref>), ‘mental worlds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612467154">Ellis &amp; Ybema, 2010</xref>) and collective mindsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612467154">Dougherty, 1992</xref>) that are unique to their own domains of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612467154">Bechky, 2003</xref>). Cognitive boundary crossing entails identifying and resolving such differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0170840612467154">
<title>Social boundaries</title>
<p>The bases of social boundaries are the classification and stratification of groups into distinct membership identities and their members’ close attachment to particular loci of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840612467154">Wenger, 1998</xref>). Crossing social boundaries requires members of different groups to develop socio-emotional bonds, and can proceed in mutually supportive fashion with the crossing of cognitive boundaries. Thus, resolving differences in semantic understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>), i.e. cognitive boundary crossing, can in turn foster social boundary crossing by encouraging members of different groups to reach out and feel more at one with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612467154">Osterlund &amp; Carlile, 2005</xref>). A shared cognitive and socio-emotional foundation enables members of different communities to engage in intimate co-operation directed at the discovery of novel solutions through deliberate and mindful joint practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840612467154">Levinthal &amp; Rerup, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612467154">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>, p. 341).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0170840612467154">
<title>Governance boundaries</title>
<p>Firms own physical and intellectual assets and may seek to restrict access by members of other organizations to information about these assets and to decision-making processes involving them. While pragmatic boundaries, reflecting different stakes, can exist within a single firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>), when different inter-firm interests are at stake governance boundaries set limits to inter-firm transparency and constitute barriers to joint decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840612467154">Santos &amp; Eisenhardt, 2005</xref>). Crossing governance boundaries by firms entails the waiving of a firm’s right to exclusive discretion about the use of its assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612467154">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>) and the assumption of inter-firm agreement to engage in co-determination on issues of common concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612467154">Ashkenas, Ulrich, Jick &amp; Kerr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612467154">O’Mahony &amp; Bechky, 2008</xref>). For example, when firms envisage collaborating with one another in capability development, they may need to set up arrangements that would entail and legitimize direct, intimate and real-time proximal access to one another’s production sites, not merely as observers and providers of feedback on production and workflow management, but also as active co-participants and co-decision-makers in problem diagnosis, problem solving and decision-making, as if being done by co-workers in one firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612467154">Nonaka &amp; Kono, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the assumption that new capability development by collaborating firms entails crossing three types of boundary, explained above, a second research question is:</p>
<list id="list2-0170840612467154" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>RQ2 What are the factors that facilitate the crossing of cognitive, social and governance boundaries throughout the process of capability development by the focal subsidiary and its local suppliers?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0170840612467154">
<title>Use of power by the focal firm within a co-opetitive supplier ecosystem</title>
<p>The focal firm can harness its power bases vis-a-vis suppliers to configure a co-opetitive supplier ecosystem, in which cooperative and competitive forces coexist in ways that induce the supplier network to operate in an ‘effective and balanced’ manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz &amp; Hamel, 1998</xref>, p. 222; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612467154">Dyer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612467154">O’Mahony &amp; Bechky, 2008</xref>), supporting and accommodating the collaborative development of new capabilities.</p>
<p>The buyer power and expert power of the focal firm can help to make this happen. If the focal firm accounts for a large proportion of its suppliers’ total sales, and is regarded by them as a major customer for the foreseeable future, suppliers are likely to regard involvement in joint capability development with the focal firm as an attractive long-term investment. By fostering long-term collaborative relationships with its suppliers, and by sharing distinctive knowledge and best practices with and among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Hatch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>), the focal firm can motivate and enable its suppliers to cross cognitive boundaries, i.e. syntactic and semantic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>), and to internalize the basic knowledge underpinning its production and quality management systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840612467154">Kennedy &amp; Fiss, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>If the focal firm anticipates that insufficient diversity and over-emphasis on unity among partners might foster ‘groupthink’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840612467154">Janis, 1972</xref>), precipitate learning inertia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612467154">Collinson &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>) and thus reduce potential for developing new capabilities, it may encourage the emergence of alternative practices, bodies of expertise and cognitive vantage points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612467154">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612467154">Fiol, 1994</xref>) across its supplier network. To this end, the focal firm may welcome the exposure of its suppliers to other firms as their clients, viewing this as another source of diversity within the supplier network. Collaborating with multiple and diverse suppliers not only facilitates process improvement through joint discovery making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612467154">Hargadon &amp; Bechky, 2006</xref>), but also confers information power to the focal firm by yielding insights about the relative strengths and weaknesses of each supplier, and by constituting a benchmarking resource when exploring novel technologies for future endeavours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612467154">March, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Sufficient redundancy and variety of parallel activities among competing, yet cooperatively linked, suppliers thus empowers and enables the focal firm to consolidate current capabilities, while enhancing the potential for developing new capabilities across the supplier network through the phases of gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization. Accordingly, we addressed a third research question:</p>

</list>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612467154">Figure 1</xref> depicts our model of the collaborative inter-firm development of new capabilities as a cycle, comprising three core phases of capability gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization, and involving the crossing of cognitive, social and governance boundaries between the focal firm and its local suppliers. The focal firm harnesses its power bases to drive capability development through the three core phases and on to the next cycle, while seeking to foster and maintain a supplier ecosystem that balances competition and cooperation. Capability institutionalization constitutes a new ‘floor’ that subsequent cycles, commencing with capability gap articulation, build upon.</p>

<p>The focal subsidiary was Toshiba Copy Machine (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd (TCOS), specializing in the component sourcing and final assembly of a full range of multifunctional photocopy machines for both worldwide and local (Chinese) markets. The predecessor of this subsidiary had been set up in the city of Shenzhen, China, in 1993, under a joint venture arrangement with a local partner firm from Hong Kong. At that time, the responsibility of the local partner had been confined to selling and distributing Toshiba’s products in the greater China region. This arrangement served to fulfil the legal requirements of the Chinese government, and had no impact on production technologies and processes. Three years later, TCOS was reconstituted in its present form under the parent Toshiba Group as the majority shareholder, with over 95% of the holdings. At the time of study, production at the subsidiary’s Shenzhen site was mainly for export (75%), but the local management envisaged that locally focused research and development (R&amp;D) activities would be initiated in the future.</p>
<p>Qualitative interviews and non-participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612467154">Lee, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840612467154">Seale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840612467154">Yeung, 1995</xref>) were employed to reveal the collaborative processes and facilitating factors for capability development that involved TCOS and some of its long-standing suppliers. A nested case study research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0170840612467154">Yin, 1989</xref>) was chosen because of its inductive power to uncover, through triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612467154">Eisenhardt &amp; Graebner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840612467154">Stake, 2005</xref>), what were anticipated to be complex but recurrent patterns of ‘purposeful and intentional action’, social dynamics and relational interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612467154">Felin and Foss, 2005</xref>, p. 445) involving the focal subsidiary and particular suppliers.</p>
<p>Four of the supplier firms providing interviews for the study had their factories located in Shenzhen. These were: Shenzhen Issin Mifuku Precision (SIM), another Toshiba-owned subsidiary, located next door to TCOS, but with no end-user product; Shenzhen Chee Yuen Plastic Products (CY), EVA Precision Hardware, Shenzhen (EVA); and Art Precision Technology, Hong Kong Ltd., (AP). The fifth was Lucky Harvest Metalwork Factory (LH), located in Dongguan, about 50 miles from Shenzhen.</p>
<p>These companies supplied various components to TCOS, including plastic moulds, printed circuit boards (PCB), precision dies and metal products, and electric cables. They varied in terms of their degree of reliance on TCOS to absorb their output. Thus TCOS consumed over 90% of the output of SIM, around 45% of that of CY, around 20% of that of EVA and LH, and 5–6% of that of AP. Although the relationship tenure with TCOS of each of these suppliers was at least four years, some had a much longer history of collaboration. This variable, along with differences in terms of the types of components supplied and the technologies required in their production (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612467154">Table 1</xref>), constituted further sources of richness in the data collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840612467154">Weick, 2007</xref>) about their respective experiences of developing new organizational capabilities in collaboration with TCOS. During such collaboration, each of these suppliers had invested considerable resources in upgrading their production technology and management processes. They indicated that working closely with TCOS to develop new practices and technical solutions had been beneficial for their overall competitiveness.</p>
<p>During 2007 and 2008, the first author conducted 29 interviews: 12 with members of TCOS, comprising the CEO and 11 middle-level managers; 3 with members of EVA, including the general manager; 3 with members of SIM, including the president; 5 with members of LH, including the president/general manager; 3 with members of CY, including the factory director; and 3 with members of AP, including the general manager. Each interview lasted between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours. Interviews were conducted in Chinese Mandarin or (in isolated cases) Cantonese, but those with Japanese interviewees (7 from TCOS, 3 from suppliers) were mediated by a company interpreter. All interviews were tape-recorded and were subsequently translated directly into English on a quasi-verbatim basis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612467154">Table 2</xref> summarizes the profile of the interviewees. In the subsequent findings section, quoted interviewees are denoted by their code numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612467154">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The interviews were guided by a prepared set of open-ended questions, supplemented by ad hoc probes to elicit detailed explanations and illustrations. The most senior interviewee in each company was asked about company history, strategic directions, business plans, and relationships with business partners. Interviews with other managers in the supplier organizations focused on the benefits, challenges and pressures of collaboration with TCOS, with particular reference to capability development. Other TCOS managers were asked to explain and illustrate perceived contributions to capability development by company headquarters and local suppliers, respectively, and to characterize the relationships between TCOS and these parties.</p>
<p>In addition, five meetings between TCOS and individual supplier organizations (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612467154">Table 3</xref>) were observed by the first author. These meetings entailed progress reviews and/or troubleshooting, and took place away from manufacturing areas. They involved CY, SIM, and three other supplier companies, namely, Japanese owned Todenko (H.K.) Ltd, Hong Kong-based Tontec International Ltd and Altas Plastics Metal Product Factory, Shenzhen. The observed meetings were conducted in Chinese Mandarin (some with Japanese translation), lasted between 40 and 90 minutes, and were not tape-recorded. Instead, the first author took notes in English under the following headings: individual participants and job titles; apparent purposes of the meeting; issues and questions raised by the client/supplier; points of agreement and how these were reached (including use of boundary objects); knowledge shared by supplier to client/client to supplier; non-verbal behaviour (posture, tone of voice, gestures, facial expression) by client/supplier (friendly vs. hostile; dominant vs. submissive); key phrases used. The first author also recorded personal reflections after each meeting, including impressions of other meetings in the hall. In the subsequent findings section, particular meetings are indicated by the codes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612467154">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Data analysis proceeded in tandem with interviews and observations, and included data coding and sorting, within-case analysis (treating each supplier–client relationship as one case) and cross-case comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612467154">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). While also performing separate analyses of interview and observation data, the authors often met together during the process of analysis to share ideas and insights and to discuss emerging theory. We chose to focus on the use of various tangible and intangible items of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612467154">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612467154">Brown &amp; Duguid, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840612467154">Lave, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612467154">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840612467154">Wenger, 1998</xref>, pp. 47–8) as common units of analysis, for the purpose of uncovering those explicit and implicit rules and meanings that had become institutionalized into participants’ processes of collective reasoning and problem solving during inter-firm collaboration. Coding of transcripts and observation notes began by using the predefined concepts of knowledge repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612467154">Hong et al., 2006</xref>), boundary objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840612467154">Star &amp; Griesemer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612467154">Swan, Bresnen, Newell &amp; Robertson, 2007</xref>), collaborative learning development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840612467154">Lubatkin et al., 2001</xref>) and capability transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612467154">Carlile &amp; Rebentisch, 2003</xref>) as conceptual foundations for practice-based units of analysis.</p>
<p>We followed a data analysis procedure that was iterative, involving constant comparisons between our emerging theoretical model and the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840612467154">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). In the early stages of data analysis, we distinguished the phases of capability gap articulation, capability evolution and capability institutionalization. As we gained a clearer and deeper understanding of TCOS’s approach to collaboratively developing new organizational capabilities with suppliers, we developed and refined additional categories and integrated them with prior theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612467154">Edmondson &amp; McManus, 2007</xref>) to characterize the interplay of factors that drove the three phases and supported the associated boundary-crossing processes. The research questions, presented in the previous section, were conducive to generating the thematic content for data coding and for identifying the recurring patterns of boundary-crossing activities. Within-case and cross-case analysis proceeded until we reached theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612467154">Eisenhardt &amp; Graebner, 2007</xref>) to develop an integrative model of how the processes of inter-firm boundary crossing support new capability development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0170840612467154">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>We shall first describe the overall context in which TCOS, the focal China-based subsidiary and assembly plant, helped its suppliers to develop capabilities to manufacture components for photocopier machines that had been designed at Toshiba’s HQ in Japan. On completion of the initial design for each new model, which typically contained around 3,000 components, the blueprints for the component configuration and for each component part would be sent to TCOS from Japan. TCOS would relay these to around 200 local firms, some already with long-term relationships with TCOS, inviting proposals and quotations for supplying specific components.</p>
<p>Although many component items in the design of a new model were identical to those in previous models, there would also be some newly specified items, reflecting market pressure for new design features, new functions, improved efficiency and cost savings. Prospective suppliers were required to develop their own mould or stamp designs, production flow charts, material sourcing plans, and procedures for manufacturing items with the new specifications, which typically targeted finer properties and enhanced functionality. Because suppliers tended to find these new specifications difficult to attain, a protracted development period was normally required prior to launching large batch assembly, during which at least one cycle of new capability development would be undertaken for each newly specified component, and the functionality of the overall configuration would be tested several times by TCOS against standards laid down by Toshiba HQ.</p>
<p>The capability development cycle began with capability gap articulation, followed, if necessary, by phases of capability evolution and capability institutionalization. Large batch production would not commence until TCOS had determined that there were sufficient capable sources of supply for all component specifications, and that any problems with the overall functionality of the assembled configuration had been resolved.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘It may take one to two years to develop a new model, but once it has been developed, the production process is very stable with few problems occurring’ (TCOS3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the rest of this section, we shall explain the interactions between the focal firm and its suppliers during capability gap articulation, capability evolution and capability institutionalization for newly specified components. We shall identify key questions and issues addressed at each phase, and during transition points. We shall explain how cognitive, social or governance boundaries were crossed, and when and why this was necessary. We shall also analyse the power bases of the focal firm that drove capability development, and how the focal firm managed the configuration and dynamics of the supplier ecosystem to support capability development.</p>
<sec id="section11-0170840612467154">
<title>Capability gap articulation</title>
<p>For each newly specified item, all prospective suppliers were required to participate in a capability gap articulation phase. During this phase, TCOS hosted bilateral meetings with suppliers and required them to conduct routine trials in order to establish shared understandings about the written specifications and their rigorous translation into the contours of the respective item. Capability gap articulation addressed three basic questions vis-a-vis each supplier. First, is this supplier’s proposed design and sample output sufficiently aligned with Toshiba HQ’s design specifications? Second, if not sufficiently aligned, what capability gaps are there and how might this supplier close them? Third, even if capability gaps persist during this phase, does this supplier have the potential to close the gaps, if given help of a more hands-on nature?</p>
<p>Prospective suppliers were expected to follow TCOS’s advice on closing capability gaps and to reveal any problems faced when attempting to do so. For a given supplier, further inspection meetings ensued, informed by evidence from trial runs, until the outputs were aligned with the blueprints, or at least demonstrated strong potential for alignment if TCOS were to instigate a phase of capability evolution. Capability gap articulation thus entailed unilateral goal setting and corrective performance feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612467154">Winter, 2000</xref>). Routine trials across the constellation of prospective suppliers helped TCOS answer a fourth question: do we need a phase of capability evolution in order to generate robust competition for production quotas? TCOS would terminate the cycle of capability development for a particular item if sufficient suppliers had already demonstrated the ability to meet the specifications without hands-on help.</p>
<sec id="section12-0170840612467154">
<title>Boundary crossing and the use of boundary objects during capability gap articulation</title>
<p>It appeared that the capability gap articulation phase required cognitive boundaries to be crossed, supported by mutual engagement with boundary objects, but did not require social or governance boundaries to be crossed.</p>
<sec id="section13-0170840612467154">
<title>Cognitive boundaries</title>
<p>The need to invest considerable effort into arriving at shared assumptions and expectations about component specifications through inter-firm sensemaking dialogue indicated that cognitive boundary crossing was part and parcel of capability gap articulation. As managers in two of the supplier firms pointed out:<disp-quote>
<p>‘The customer needs to understand the production capabilities of their suppliers, and not just pass the design drafts to us and wait for the delivery. Without careful consideration and planning, it is not possible for us to fulfill all the precision requirements’ (AP2).</p>
<p>‘Since TCOS just performs the assembly function, their understanding of stamping technology may differ from ours, so we can propose ideas that are based on our own technical expertise. Our differences are mainly about the final quality standards. They set the quality standards from the user’s viewpoint, but this is different from a supplier’s perspective, and we need to overcome some technical constraints on our side’ (LH2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the bilateral meetings, representatives of the prospective suppliers sought to explain and justify their proposed designs, operational and quality assurance procedures, material sourcing plans, and price quotations, while the TCOS representatives sought to pinpoint deviations from the blueprints and standards issued by Toshiba HQ, and to establish procedures for routine testing. To these ends, various boundary objects, such as CAD/CAM design displays, drawings, photographs, prototypes, actual specimens, manuals, flowcharts, sketches, drawings and reports served as common reference points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0170840612467154">
<title>Social boundaries</title>
<p>Observations suggested that the focal firm did not regard social boundary crossing as a priority during the capability gap articulation phase, focusing instead on clarifying the technical parameters and providing objective feedback on whether supplier performance was within the parameters. The TCOS representatives appeared to distance themselves from their supplier counterparts in terms of motives, emotions and identity during this phase, and the tone of the meetings was impersonal, resembling performance examinations or courtroom interrogations, as illustrated by the following excerpts, translated from field observation notes.</p>

<sec id="section15-0170840612467154">
<title>Governance boundaries</title>
<p>TCOS had a policy of disclosing the entire component configuration diagram of new photocopier machine models to all prospective suppliers. This arrangement was intended to encourage and enable suppliers to suggest design improvements to TCOS for mutual benefit. However, it did not necessarily entail the crossing of upstream governance boundaries, since it did not confer on suppliers the right to co-determine the configuration as a whole or the design specifications for particular components, over which TCOS’s parent company retained prerogative.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Now that we are shown, through the configuration diagram, where the component that we are supplying will fit in the final assembly, we can adjust our focus when monitoring our production activities and thereby reduce critical errors… We can now analyse salient contingencies and identify potential functionality, and we are now able to recommend structural changes to the initial product design to prevent human processing errors (by TCOS employees) during assembly’(CY3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section16-0170840612467154">
<title>Harnessing the focal firm’s power bases during capability gap articulation</title>
<p>TCOS drew on three main power bases to ‘pull’ prospective suppliers into and through the capability gap articulation phase. First, TCOS’s purchasing power as the focal firm was strong because there were generally more suppliers than competitors, and TCOS’s purchases could account for a large proportion of each supplier’s total sales. Second, suppliers recognized TCOS’s expertise and accepted as authoritative the focal firm’s assessments of their output. Third, TCOS was in a position to benchmark the performance of prospective suppliers against one another and capitalized on this information power to pressurize particular suppliers to meet specifications, informing them, for example, that other suppliers, referred to as ‘the best five’ had already achieved them. TCOS’s information power was further boosted by access to repositories of data at its sister subsidiary, SIM, which was a player in ‘taper’ vertical integration arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612467154">Harrigan, 1984</xref>) for supplying a wide range of components.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0170840612467154">
<title>Preserving supplier co-opetition and diversity during capability gap articulation</title>
<p>Since variation among suppliers constituted a resource for expanding the range of potential solutions in the event of widespread difficulties during the testing stage, TCOS sought to preserve requisite variety among suppliers during the capability gap articulation phase, as a strategy to maintain potential across the network for the subsequent evolution of new capabilities. Although TCOS vetted the operations flow charts proposed by the suppliers for evident flaws, procedures for manufacturing the newly specified components were not stipulated. Different suppliers of the same component were thus allowed to try out different operational procedures so long as each approach appeared to be a potentially viable means of meeting the specifications.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-0170840612467154">
<title>Capability evolution</title>
<p>The capability evolution phase for a newly specified component followed capability gap articulation, if the prospective suppliers had all failed to meet the specifications during the gap articulation phase, or if some had succeeded but TCOS judged that others needed further development, in order to increase the pool of capable suppliers. During capability evolution, TCOS assumed a coach–protégé relationship with selected suppliers that had not yet met the specifications but were judged to have the potential to do so. Production engineers from TCOS would visit the production site of each protégé supplier, and would check whether appropriate procedures were actually being followed. Applying experimental procedures in close collaboration with their hosts, they would jointly diagnose the root causes of any problems, explore various solution steps and options, examine the experimental output and statistical evidence, and draw inferences and conclusions. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>‘From May to July this year, a team of Japanese engineers from TCOS came to our factory and worked with our technicians to come up with proposals to solve our production problems. We tried to pool our expertise from different areas together and explored different solutions’ (AP1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Experimental trials would in some cases proceed in parallel at multiple production sites. If a stable solution for a particular component was discovered at one site, TCOS would determine whether that solution might be adopted by other protégé suppliers of the same component, and, if so, would help them try to follow suit. Conversely, if diverse approaches were being adopted across the associated constellation of protégé suppliers of the same component, satisfactory solutions could vary from site to site. In some cases, TCOS would develop a synthesized solution for multiple protégé suppliers, based on insights from near-solutions at different sites.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We learn together through collaboration since TCOS’s other suppliers may also encounter similar problems in the same situation. TCOS can compare solutions proposed by different suppliers, select the best from each one and combine them into a new solution’ (CY1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two financial questions arising during the capability evolution phase were, first, how much extra cost would the proposed solution(s) entail? Second, how would the cost be absorbed? The capability evolution phase for a newly specified component ended once the experimental solutions had been tested and confirmed and the associated financial issues had been settled. Capability development would normally progress to the institutionalization phase. However, if repeated experimental trials did not yield affordable solutions for a particular component, the capability evolution phase for that component was deemed to have failed, and TCOS would seek permission from Toshiba HQ to modify the design. This was regarded as a last resort, since revising the specifications would also necessitate changes to adjacent components within the configuration, and therefore reversion to the capability gap articulation phase for these components also:<disp-quote>
<p>‘If it turns out that the suppliers really cannot fulfil some of our requirements, we’ll try to accommodate them by changing other aspects of the product. For example, if one component part cannot be produced to match the blueprint, we’ll try to modify an adjacent part to fit what can actually be produced. But this seldom occurs. Normally, the actual results can match our expectations’ (TCOS3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section19-0170840612467154">
<title>Boundary crossing during capability evolution</title>
<p>The capability evolution phase required: the crossing of cognitive boundaries, supported by mutual engagement with boundary objects and by a shared platform of generic knowledge; and the crossing of social and governance boundaries, supported by shared framing assumptions of mutual benefit and continuous development.</p>
<sec id="section20-0170840612467154">
<title>Cognitive boundaries</title>
<p>Similarly as during capability gap articulation, the need to arrive at bilateral understandings about problems encountered, potential solutions, experimental trials procedures, and findings and implications arising from experiments required cognitive boundary crossing between the focal firm and each protégé supplier.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We’ll send our technical and production staff to the supplier’s site to help them solve problems. Based on our suggestions and their own analysis, we collaborate to try to work things out and see the effects’ (TCOS9).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In such cases, the building of shared understanding between the respective employees from TCOS and the protégé supplier firms was facilitated, in part, by mutual engagement with boundary objects that were located at the production sites of the protégé supplier, such as machinery, raw materials, finished components and databases. Cognitive boundary crossing was also supported by joint possession by TCOS and its suppliers of a shared body of standard generic methods and organizational routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612467154">Pentland &amp; Rueter, 1994</xref>). These had largely been transferred from TCOS to the suppliers in parallel to the capability development cycles, through formal training courses, routine quality inspection visits and plant demonstrations, thereby reducing knowledge asymmetries with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612467154">Hoopes &amp; Postrel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612467154">Purvis et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The training courses, often certification-backed, covered a wide range of topics, such as operations management, quality assurance, root cause analysis, waste elimination and efficiency enhancement. The quality inspection visits were intended to ensure, through advice and feedback, that suppliers were creating and implementing their own standardized output specifications, operational and quality assurance procedures, and problem diagnosis protocols. TCOS’s own production site was open to suppliers to visit for demonstration and benchmarking purposes. Accordingly, suppliers’ production sites had come to be modelled on TCOS’s plant, and close similarities between the production sites helped to reduce any disorientation for TCOS personnel during the capability evolution phase, while possession of common lexicon facilitated joint sense-making by TCOS personnel and their hosts when conducting in situ troubleshooting and experimental trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0170840612467154">
<title>Social boundaries</title>
<p>During capability evolution, the need for employees of TCOS and of supplier firms to work together with solidarity and close cooperation required open, cordial relationships, and thus the crossing of social boundaries.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I have an amicable relationship with TCOS. Everything is done by consensus and mutual understanding. TCOS have the right approach to handling workplace problems through open communication’ (CY3).</p>
<p>‘Our relationship with TCOS is very harmonious’ (LH2).</p>
<p>‘We have quite an intimate relationship with the suppliers’ (TCOS3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The recognition of shared framing assumptions of mutual benefit and continuous development facilitated the crossing of social boundaries. Suppliers trusted the motives of TCOS and welcomed their help:<disp-quote>
<p>‘TCOS has given us continuous support. Normally when problems occur, the other customers would just put the blame on us. But TCOS have a philosophy of mutual development and are always willing to help their suppliers. They will immediately send their technical and management staff to work with us on site to find out the solutions. They treat the suppliers as partners’ (E1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0170840612467154">
<title>Governance boundaries</title>
<p>High levels of transparency, entailed by TCOS’s right to examine machinery, moulds and raw materials in situ at the production sites of supplier firms, and TCOS’s legitimate core involvement in decision-making about suppliers’ operational processes for the focal component(s), as if they belonged to one team under one roof, with a shared and proximal context for joint action, entailed the crossing of governance boundaries. It appeared that, as with social boundary crossing, governance boundary crossing was facilitated and legitimized by the recognition of shared framing assumptions of mutual benefit and continuous development.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section23-0170840612467154">
<title>Harnessing the focal firm’s power bases during capability evolution</title>
<p>The capability evolution phase was driven in part by TCOS’s expert power, based on their acknowledged expertise in operations management, quality assurance and experimental design. As one supplier said:<disp-quote>
<p>‘I have learned to build up an attitude of continuous improvement by observing and working with TCOS’ (CY3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>TCOS’s purchasing power was another driving force for suppliers’ participation in capability evolution. As in other studies of supplier relationships with Japanese focal firms such as Toyota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>, p. 363), suppliers believed that success in this respect would be rewarded by substantial orders, supporting business growth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘TCOS has helped us a lot over the years. By engaging in a mutually beneficial relationship, we develop steadily together’ (LH2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another incentive for capability evolution was that, unlike Toyota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>), TCOS permitted suppliers to serve other clients and even to exploit solutions discovered through capability evolution when doing so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0170840612467154">
<title>Fostering supplier co-opetition and diversity through capability evolution</title>
<p>Motives for TCOS to take protégé suppliers through the capability evolution phase, even if other suppliers of the same component could already meet the specifications, were to instill greater competition among suppliers for market share, and to foster requisite variety among capable suppliers, thereby increasing the range of resources available for addressing future contingencies.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section25-0170840612467154">
<title>Capability institutionalization</title>
<p>During capability institutionalization, TCOS and the protégé suppliers involved in developing workable solutions during the capability evolution phase reported on the difficulties encountered and the emergent solution steps discovered. TCOS as a knowledge broker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>) disseminated the reports to the supplier network, not as mandatory procedures, but rather as representations of a shared frontier of practice, from which further advances could be made when pursuing new cycles of capability development to accommodate subsequent product designs. TCOS would arrange further rounds of capability gap articulation if prospective suppliers claimed that they could now meet specifications by adopting the recommended solutions.</p>

<title>Boundary crossing during capability institutionalization</title>
<p>Capability institutionalization entailed the crossing of both cognitive and governance boundaries.</p>
<sec id="section27-0170840612467154">
<title>Cognitive boundaries</title>
<p>Codifying the solutions discovered and lessons learnt during capability evolution required TCOS and protégé suppliers to agree on a common discourse for reporting to the network as a whole, and therefore involved cognitive boundary crossing. Mutual engagement with boundary objects during the prior capability evolution phase, along with a common platform of generic knowledge, made it possible for reports to be crafted and the solutions and lessons assimilated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0170840612467154">
<title>Governance boundaries</title>
<p>Disclosure across the supplier network of solutions that protégé suppliers had co-developed with TCOS entailed the crossing of governance boundaries, since those suppliers that had co-created breakthroughs with TCOS were de facto made to share these with ‘rival’ suppliers across the TCOS network. TCOS required this as reciprocation for the provision of hands-on help to protégé suppliers during capability evolution, and as a condition of their membership of a long-term alliance with TCOS as the focal firm.</p>

<title>Harnessing the focal firm’s power bases during capability institutionalization</title>
<p>The dissemination across the supplier network of process solutions that had been discovered during the capability evolution phase reflected TCOS’s use of buyer power to insist that this must be done and its use of expert power to enable this to get done.</p>

<sec id="section30-0170840612467154">
<title>Fostering supplier co-opetition and diversity through capability institutionalization</title>
<p>TCOS’s motive for disseminating solutions across its supplier network was to expand the pool of suppliers that were able to meet the specifications and thus increase competition among suppliers vis-a-vis particular components. A monthly forum for ‘the five worst vendors’ reflected similar motives.</p>
<p>Dissemination of solutions also helped SIM, TCOS’s sister subsidiary, to continue to operate at par with other suppliers across a wide range of components. It appeared that that there was no strategic intent for TCOS to transfer a greater share of its business to SIM, and that SIM was performing a benchmarking role vis-a-vis the pricing policies of other suppliers, and could sometimes step up to play if there was insufficient competition to supply particular items.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We belong to the same parent company, Toshiba Group. But ours is just like any normal business relationship. They are our client, and we are their supplier, responsible for supplying various parts and accessories to produce copy machines’ (SIM2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It appeared that the motive for allowing suppliers to serve other firms, even by exploiting co-evolved knowledge, was to increase potential across the supplier eco-system for capability evolution by opening space for the introduction of more diversity.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section31-0170840612467154">
<title>Vulnerabilities of TCOS’s capability development system</title>
<p>The inter-firm capability development system with TCOS as the focal firm had some vulnerabilities, arising from its arduousness for suppliers, the aloofness of the design engineers at Toshiba HQ and the dominance of TCOS over its suppliers.</p>
<p>Regarding arduousness, some interviewees from supplier firms mentioned the burdens associated with the gap articulation and evolution phases. Their frustrations signalled the risk that some suppliers, feeling insufficiently equipped to continue their relationship with TCOS, might exit, thereby eroding co-opetition and diversity within the supplier network. The aloofness of the designers at Toshiba HQ was the other side of the same coin, in that those component designs that challenged supplier firms might, without adjustment, transpire to be outside the reach of manufacturability, leading to excessively long delays during the capability evolution phase, and even culminating in the failure of that phase to generate solutions. With these issues in mind, respondents from supplier firm AP suggested that TCOS should reduce pressure on suppliers by involving them more closely and directly in decisions about component design, thereby allowing them to cross upstream governance boundaries.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘There should be more communication between their [TCOS’s] design team and our production people to discuss the technical limitations in advance, so that the client can gain better understanding about the physical constraints when designing the new models and we can have better coordination with them during the initial production trials. In other words, cooperation during the preliminary stage is very important… It is very difficult to prepare the production line set-up and conduct various kinds of trials within a short time span. Having to do that puts us under intense pressure’ (AP3).</p>
<p>‘Similar European and American MNCs have moved away from this [the approach adopted by TCOS]. Their design work used to be undertaken in isolation at their [respective] headquarters, but now their engineers visit the off-shore production sites to appreciate their technical limitations and site-specific contingencies, and they take these into consideration when revising plans before the actual production runs’ (AP2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, despite the difficulties for some firms within the TCOS supplier network, there were no signs of any concerted lobbying effort to persuade TCOS to transform its capability development system by adopting alternative arrangements, such as those suggested by AP2. Almost without exception, the system succeeded in developing capabilities for producing and assembling the necessary components. Interview data made it clear that capability development cycles were halted only in the rare cases where it transpired that no supplier had been able to close capability gaps through capability evolution, even after prolonged effort and with concerted support from TCOS. Only in these rare cases would HQ revise the design specifications for the component and its close neighbours within the overall configuration. TCOS’s determination to stretch the limits of operational capability across the supplier network and to avoid redesign was reinforced by the strategic decision to keep the designers geographically and organizationally isolated from the production sites.</p>
<p>Indeed, as illustrated in the following interview transcript segments, also involving respondents from AP, it appeared that, on balance, suppliers judged that the benefits of adhering to the current system within a long-term relationship with TCOS were compensating for any frustrations incurred.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>‘Have you encountered any cases where you have not been able to satisfy the customers’ requirements?’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AP1:</speaker>
<p>‘This is very rare. As we have other Japanese customers apart from TCOS, their requirements are similar in nature. Learning to cope with the stringent requirements of any one of them can enable us to satisfy the demands of the others.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>‘How do you see the relationship with TCOS?’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>AP3:</speaker>
<p>‘I view this as a kind of technology transfer and learning relationship. We appreciate very much the work attitudes of the Japanese and their emphasis on engineering technology and research … There are still many aspects in which they can serve as an example for us and we have been trying to catch up with their demands. For example, in the past, TCOS sourced moulds for the production of components from Japan, but over time, we have been able to prove to them that we have the same capability to produce the moulds with comparable quality standards, thus increasing our sales volume through upgrading our technology… If the production cycle is long enough, we can basically fulfil all the customers’ requirements. It is just a matter of time and trial and error.’</p>
</speech>
<p>It thus appeared that the viability of the TCOS capability development system as a whole depended on the ability of supplier firms to work effectively with TCOS engineers to close capability gaps during the evolution phase, on the willingness of the parent Toshiba organization to wait patiently for solutions to emerge, and on the configuration and component designers’ willingness to take account of feedback about manufacturability problems with existing models when designing subsequent models.</p>
<p>The other vulnerability of the capability development system reflected TCOS’s superior power vis-a-vis its suppliers, especially in terms of buyer power, and the prospect that such power asymmetry might become so pervasive that suppliers would lack sufficient argumentative force to inaugurate alternative developmental paths, resulting in missed opportunities and learning inertia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612467154">Collinson &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that interviews and observations gave many illustrations of TCOS’s strong buyer power vis-a-vis suppliers, there were also examples of TCOS actively respecting suppliers’ expertise. While not welcoming suggestions that implied the need to relax specifications, TCOS appeared to entertain suppliers’ ideas on how to evolve new capabilities in ways that the suppliers valued, so long as these also could be seen to support TCOS’s goals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘They [TCOS] have the final decision-making power. What we can do is to give them suggestions and it is up to them to accept it or not. These are their products after all and we follow a customer-oriented philosophy. Normally they like us to propose ideas and will accept most of our suggestions. Only a few have not been accepted’ (EVA 1).</p>
<p>‘We try to reach a compromise through negotiation. TCOS is better [than other clients] in this regard. As long as the proposed changes do not adversely affect the functionality of their products, they are willing to accept them, especially if they are related to materials’ (LH4).</p>
<p>‘[Suppliers] can make suggestions for improving production techniques and quality. For example, if they think the usage of different raw materials could improve quality or reduce costs, they can make use of the ‘5-1’ suggestion scheme to give us counter-proposals’ (TCOS6).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>TCOS’s openness to suggestions for mutual benefit appeared to be underpinned by culturally embedded collaborative values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>) and by organizational routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612467154">Hong et al., 2006</xref>), typical of Japanese manufacturers, predisposing TCOS to seek feedback from suppliers on how to improve its designs.</p>

The current study complements these prior studies by revealing the complex dynamics through which new capability development takes place in another manufacturing context, orchestrated by a different focal subsidiary, TCOS, which combined strategies for reducing knowledge asymmetries vis-a-vis its suppliers with strategies for jointly stretching with them to create new knowledge. We shall identify three distinct contributions that our current study makes to existing work on the collaborative dynamics of strategic capability development (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612467154">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Our first contribution is that, in contrast with prior studies of power in MNCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612467154">Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840612467154">Mudambi &amp; Navarra, 2004</xref>), which have analysed how foreign subsidiaries with limited power manoeuvre to gain influence and legitimacy vis-a-vis the HQ, our study examined the role of asymmetric power relations between a foreign subsidiary and its local suppliers. We have shown that strong buyer power over suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612467154">Dyer, 1996</xref>) can enlist their cooperation through the three phases of capability gap articulation, capability evolution and capability institutionalization.</p>
<p>This approach bears peripheral resemblance to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz and Hamel’s (1998)</xref> concept of ‘co-option’, turning potential competitors into allies and providers, but our case differs from this in three respects. First, TCOS as the focal firm treated suppliers as actual competitors of its sister subsidiary and supplier, SIM, rather than as potential competitors of itself. Second, TCOS as the focal firm used its buyer power to challenge and stretch the capabilities of its suppliers, SIM included, rather than as a means for capturing and internalizing their existing capabilities. Third, TCOS sought to foster innovation by orchestrating a balance of cooperative and competitive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612467154">O’Mahony &amp; Bechky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840612467154">Wilheim &amp; Kohlbacher, 2011</xref>) with and among its suppliers, an arrangement that could more appropriately be labelled ‘co-opetition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612467154">Nalebuff &amp; Brandenburger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840612467154">Tsai, 2002</xref>). TCOS instilled competition by engaging several different suppliers for each component during the capability gap articulation phase, but mediated indirect mutual support among suppliers during the capability evolution and capability institutionalization phases.</p>
<p>Our second contribution is to complement prior analyses of inter-firm capability development that focus on attempts by focal firms to reduce asymmetries in knowledge possession vis-a-vis suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Singh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612467154">Foss &amp; Pedersen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840612467154">Simonin, 1999</xref>) through co-specialization and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz &amp; Hamel, 1998</xref>). In co-specialization, synergy is achieved by bundling together suppliers’ existing skills with a focal firm’s existing skills, while with internalization, partners learn <italic>from</italic> one another. While not denying the existence of such processes, our study illustrates how a focal firm managed ambidexterity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612467154">Gibson &amp; Birkinshaw, 2004</xref>) by balancing the need for benchmarking and for suppliers to standardize and exploit any newly developed specifications for particular items with the need to foster requisite variety and exploratory potential among suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612467154">Lazzarini, Claro &amp; Mesquita, 2008</xref>) to enhance the joint discovery process during the capability evolution phase.</p>
<p>Our third contribution is to apply the boundary-crossing perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612467154">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840612467154">Sturdy, Clark, Fincham &amp; Handley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612467154">Scarbrough et al., 2004</xref>) at the inter-firm level. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612467154">Doz and Hamel (1998)</xref> and other mainstream strategy theorists focus on capabilities and the need to manage opportunistic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612467154">Makhija &amp; Ganesh, 1997</xref>). We build on prior work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612467154">Dyer (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612467154">Dyer and Hatch (2006)</xref> to identify factors that facilitate the crossing of social, cognitive and governance boundaries by creating shared interests and keeping options open, to enable the mutual development and dissemination of network-specific knowledge for the co-creation of new capabilities through phases of gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization.</p>
<p>From this study, we can draw four practical implications for MNC management. First, in the TCOS model of jointly developing new capabilities across a supplier network, the buyer function and buyer power of the subsidiary, which entail articulating requirements to suppliers and demanding compliance from them, remain no less important than in the traditional model of outsourcing. Second, in the TCOS model, the subsidiary continues to serve as an offshore production unit, and can therefore constitute a role model of efficiency, quality and high commitment workforce management for suppliers to emulate. Third, the TCOS model, unlike the traditional model, requires the focal subsidiary to integrate its roles as a buyer and as a production unit with its role as the coordinating centre of a complex set of cognitive, social and governance boundary-crossing relationships and collaborative activities with suppliers. Fourth, since the TCOS model features the subsidiary as a co-developer and broker of new capabilities with suppliers, it has the potential to generate knowledge for ‘reverse transfer’ to the HQ regarding new assembly techniques, supplier management and production configuration, and feedback about initial product design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0170840612467154">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>This study relied primarily on qualitative interview data with both senior and middle managers from TCOS and five of its major local suppliers, triangulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0170840612467154">Yin, 1989</xref>) with five short sessions of non-participant observation of working meetings held on TCOS’s premises involving representatives from TCOS and their suppliers. While these data sources served to reveal some micro-level processes of capability development, one limitation of the current study is that it did not involve prolonged and extensive collection of in-depth accounts and observations, in contrast with some prior ethnographic studies on boundary objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612467154">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612467154">Carlile 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612467154">2004</xref>). While data saturation was achieved at a certain level of analysis in the current study, i.e. regarding areas of emergent collaboration and consensus, more prolonged exposure to the research sites might have served to reveal important data regarding (for example) conflict behaviour and the role of various forms of conflict resolution during the capability co-development process.</p>
<p>A second limitation concerns the sampling of supplier organizations as providers of interviews. As explained in the methodology section, interviewees were selected from those suppliers that had developed sufficient operational experience with TCOS to be able to provide insights about the evolution of the supplier–client relationship and the development of associated knowledge bases. The supplier companies providing interviewees for this study comprised five of the topmost suppliers for TCOS in terms of market share, all of whom appeared to have developed close relationships with TCOS, manifest in regular, relatively cordial and intimate communications. By contrast, observation of meetings with other suppliers suggested that TCOS might, either as a consequence of power asymmetries or as a result of other factors, have developed less cordial and more confrontational patterns of interaction with relatively minor, ‘third-tier’ suppliers. Interviews with members of less-favoured suppliers would be necessary to substantiate and explain any such differences.</p>
<p>A third limitation relates to the interviewing of managerial staff only. Since a wide spectrum of people in the organizations are expected to participate in joint capability development through knowledge co-creation, focusing on the management’s perspective may somehow overlook the contributions from other communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612467154">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>), such as operational staff, who are dealing with day-to-day production issues.</p>
<p>A fourth limitation concerns the generalizability of the model of capability development that we have developed in this study. This model matched the traditional offshoring system of global production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840612467154">Jensen &amp; Pedersen, 2011</xref>) that had been adopted by the parent company, Toshiba, which had relocated manufacturing and assembling activities from the home country, Japan, to a low-cost country, China, and was imposing strict controls on final product quality and costs. The TCOS model allowed very limited scope for suppliers to participate in decisions about component configuration and design. In some other industrial and strategic contexts, where there are greater opportunities for product innovation by the subsidiary, collaborative capability development might involve more intensive knowledge input upstream in the design process by suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840612467154">Lakshman &amp; Parente, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Two directions for future research, one methodological, the other substantive, may address the above limitations. First, in terms of methodology, an organizational ethnography based on prolonged fieldwork, involving a substantial amount of participant observation, would constitute a logical extension of the current study. Such research could seek to trace in more fine-grained detail the social and organizational processes through which foreign-based subsidiaries of MNCs and their suppliers engage in the dynamic building of organizational capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612467154">Schreyogg &amp; Kliesch-Eberl, 2007</xref>), including working together to solve ‘glitches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612467154">Hoopes &amp; Postrel, 1999</xref>) and developing daily routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612467154">Pentland &amp; Rueter, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, an important area for substantive investigation concerns the nature of the power relationship, such as the balance of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612467154">Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>) between the focal buyer and its suppliers, and the impact thereof on the processes and outcomes of capability gap articulation, capability evolution and capability institutionalization. Although we did not collect interview data from those suppliers with the smallest share of TCOS’s purchases, the superiority of TCOS’s bargaining power vis-a-vis its largest suppliers and the impact thereof was evident in various comments from interviewees from supplier organizations.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we believe that it would be interesting to expand our initial framework and findings with a broader set of examples, including cases where suppliers within the MNC network possess relatively stronger bargaining power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612467154">Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>) than the focal subsidiary. It is possible also that capability co-development practices identified in our study were driven by what some commentators have claimed to be a unique philosophy among Japanese companies for developing their suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612467154">Dyer &amp; Nobeoka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612467154">Hagen &amp; Choe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612467154">Sako, 2004</xref>). Nested case studies with non-Japanese firms as focal subsidiaries and with suppliers possessing relatively strong bargaining power would permit investigation into how suppliers leverage favourable power differentials vis-a-vis the counterpart MNC subsidiary, and how such power plays affect the processes of capability articulation, capability evolution through knowledge co-creation, and capability institutionalization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have shown how the focal firm cultivated a balanced constellation of local suppliers and drove them to accommodate to its unilateral design decisions by participating in cycles of capability development involving phases of gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization, and how the crossing of cognitive, social and governance boundaries during capability development was facilitated, supported and legitimized.</p>
