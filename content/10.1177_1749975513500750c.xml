<p>Simon Weaver’s <italic>The Rhetoric of Racist Humour</italic> is a remarkable contribution to the ‘emergent field’ of ‘critical humour studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975513500750c">Lockyer &amp; Pickering, 2008</xref>: 818). The field, as also illustrated by other characteristic works (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975513500750c">Billig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975513500750c">Lockyer &amp; Pickering, 2005</xref>), which explore the interplay between the humorous and the serious, and notoriously question the assumed benignity of humour. Weaver’s self-consciously critical attitude towards humour (p. 8) stands in striking contrast to those approaches which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975513500750c">Billig (2005)</xref> has deemed – and extensively critiqued – as <italic>ideologically positivist</italic>, or to those which Weaver himself criticizes as ‘exculpatory’ and ‘positive’ (pp. 8–12).</p>
<p>While Weaver is sensitive to ethical issues concerning racist humour, he emphasizes such issues through concentrating on the <italic>rhetoricalness</italic> of racist humour and the capacity of such humour to affect serious racism. Weaver describes three types of racism – <italic>embodied, cultural</italic>, and <italic>post/liquid modern</italic> – each of which he takes as corresponding to a similar type of racist humour. He improves upon the formerly-made connection between humour and ambivalence (pp. 34–7) to argue that different forms of racist humour ‘rhetorically act upon [i.e. ‘express’/‘mediate’/‘resolve’ (p. 46)] the ambivalences and truth claims of racist discourse’ (p. 39), and can – in particular readings – reinforce racism. In developing this argument, Weaver draws upon Zygmunt Bauman’s theories of modernity and post/liquid modernity as order-building systems which necessarily cause ambivalences but also certain ambivalence-resolution mechanisms primarily based on exclusion. Various forms of serious racist discourse, Weaver demonstrates, generate binary oppositions which are reflected in, and dealt with by, racist humour. Due to the polysemicity of postmodern racism/humour, however, the above relation between humour-as-rhetoric and serious racism becomes further complicated. Also attending to the vital issue of <italic>reversed humour</italic>, Weaver argues how humour intended as anti-racist may unwittingly buttress racism. These are all vigorously and insightfully discussed regarding humour from US internet websites, US and British stand-up comedy, the Ali G. character, and the Danish Prophet Muhammad cartoons.</p>
<p>Weaver’s complex argument about racist humour as a rhetorical form affecting racism – which comes with his numerous novel conceptualizations in humour studies – anticipates important critical investigations of other types of humour. Also, while providing a comprehensible application of Bauman’s theories, Weaver modifies or improves on such theories (e.g. see pp. 41, 44, 46, 59–61), thus complementing our understanding of Bauman, too. I especially see as promising of further research, in sociology and humour studies, Weaver’s momentary yet shrewd suggestion that Bauman’s tying of ambivalence to modernity be loosened (p. 44). While it might not be implausible to see, in the frame of Bauman’s theory, of <italic>modernities</italic> as the dynamism of ever-present order-building systems in societies, Weaver’s theory of racist humour could also be extended to include other humour types and eras.</p>
<p>However, as I understand it, the basic idea in Weaver’s central argument that ‘jokes are rhetorical vehicles in and of themselves’ (p. 30) had already been touched upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975513500750c">Stephen Smith (1993)</xref>. Moreover, I find all-important Weaver’s adoption of Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of <italic>habitus</italic> to resolve the old problem of incongruity – i.e. why only certain incongruities are found funny (pp. 2–6). The attempt is a reminder of the recently developed theory, in moral psychology, of humour as the simultaneous perception of <italic>violation</italic> and <italic>benignity</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975513500750c">McGraw and Warren, 2010</xref>). I believe if considered together, the theories might contribute to each other. I found Weaver’s text fairly intelligible, but I think the theoretical chapters contain too few examples. Also, I felt frustrated by spotting numerous typos in the text. And, while I enjoyed a complimentary copy, I believe the book is relatively overpriced, even if much of the text had not previously appeared in print.</p>
<p>In an interview, Foucault mentions that ‘[c]riticism is … to show that things are not as self-evident as one believed, to see that what is accepted as self-evident will no longer be accepted as such’ (p. 155). This is what Weaver does to racist humour, through critical analysis, which he rightly deems as more constructive than censoring humour (p. 191). I am positive that Weaver’s stimulating book will be of value not only to people interested/involved in humour and/or race/ethnicity studies but to anyone concerned with social justice.</p>
