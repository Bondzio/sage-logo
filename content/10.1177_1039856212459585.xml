<sec id="section1-1039856212459585">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The use of sensory rooms (also known as comfort rooms) to reduce seclusion rates has generated a great deal of interest. This study examined the outcomes associated with the introduction of a sensory room in an acute inpatient psychiatric unit.</p>

<body>
<p>The use of sensory rooms to reduce seclusion and restraint has generated a great deal of interest in Australia in recent years. Sensory rooms are specialised rooms with various items that assist individuals to relax and perform ‘self-soothing’ routines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459585">1</xref></sup> The theoretical basis for sensory rooms has emerged from the trauma-informed care, sensory modulation, self-management and recovery literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459585">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212459585"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref></sup> This is further supported by evidence for self-soothing techniques from dialectical behaviour therapy in the management of distress for consumers with borderline personality disorder, eating disorders and addictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212459585">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212459585">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few studies have formally evaluated the effectiveness of sensory rooms. To our knowledge, only two have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212459585">6</xref></sup> Both demonstrated significant reductions in distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212459585">6</xref></sup> associated with sensory room use and in one, seclusion rates were decreased by 54%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the strong interest but limited research in the area, we sought to study outcomes following the introduction of a sensory room in a 40-bed acute psychiatric unit in inner-city Sydney. We hypothesised that the introduction of the room would: (1) reduce distress reported by consumers who used the room; (2) reduce disruptive and disturbed behaviours demonstrated by consumers who used the room; and (3) reduce rates of seclusion and aggression on the unit. We also set out to explore which items in the sensory room were most effective in reducing distress and improving behavioural disturbance.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212459585" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the hospital’s ethics committee. An existing interview room was converted into a sensory room. The design followed best practice principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459585">1</xref></sup> and included a homely environment with scenic pictures, comfortable furnishings and a range of sensory modulation items.</p>
<p>Staff were educated about the room and encouraged to offer time in the room to consumers at the first sign of distress or agitation. Over 80% of nursing and allied health staff and 40% of medical staff attended these sessions. Consumers were also routinely educated about the room and encouraged to use it when they felt distressed or needed ‘time-out.’</p>
<sec id="section6-1039856212459585">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>A sensory room assessment form was developed. Consumers rated their level of distress on a 10-point scale (1: not distressed at all; 10: extremely distressed) and clinicians rated 11 common behavioural disturbances (also on a 10-point scale) before and after room use. To prevent any delay in the use of the room, consumers were asked to report both before and after levels of distress upon exit. Data on age, diagnosis, duration of use, whether medication was used, what items were used in the room and whether seclusion was required were also collected. Monthly seclusion and aggression statistics were collated for the 12 months prior to and following implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212459585">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Changes in self-rated distress and clinician-rated behaviour and rates of seclusion and aggression were examined using paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, respectively. Repeated-measures general linear model analyses were used to examine whether use of various sensory items or other factors were associated with changes in distress or behaviour. Each model included two observations of the within-subjects factor (pre- and post-ratings for self-rated distress or clinician-rated behaviour) and one between-subjects factor (i.e. gender, medication use, diagnosis, use of weighted blanket, use of rocking chair, reading or listening to music). A significant interaction effect would indicate significantly different changes related to the between-subjects factor under analysis. As each analysis was drawn from different sub-samples, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212459585" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Seventy-five occasions of use were recorded. Each occasion was recorded separately and no information was available regarding repeated use of the room by the same person.

<p>A total of 21 repeated-measures general linear model analyses were completed. Within-subjects factors were: (1) self-rated distress; (2) anxiousness; and (3) irritability (the most commonly-rated items). Between-subjects factors were: (1) gender; (2) medication; (3) diagnosis; (4) use of weighted blanket; (5) use of rocking chair; (6) listening to music; and (7) reading.</p>
<p>There were no interaction effects for gender. There were interaction effects for the between-subjects factors of medication and diagnosis and within-subjects factor of self-rated distress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1039856212459585">Table 5</xref>), although not for within-subjects factors of anxiousness or irritability. There were significant interaction effects present for use of weighted blanket and self-rated distress and clinician-rated anxiousness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1039856212459585">Table 6</xref>). Although there were no significant interaction effects for use of rocking chair, the results for the analysis against self-rated distress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1039856212459585">Table 6</xref>) suggest that this may be worthy of examination in a larger-scale study. No interaction effects were present for listening to music or reading.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two of the three hypotheses were supported. Hypothesis 1 (use of the sensory room will reduce distress reported by consumers) was supported with a mean 2.3-point reduction on the 10-point scale. Hypothesis 2 (use of the sensory room will reduce disruptive/disturbed behaviours observed in consumers) was predominantly supported with significant improvements noted for seven of the 11 behaviours rated. Hypothesis 3 (use of the sensory room will reduce rates of seclusion and aggression) was not supported.</p>
<p>While use of the sensory room was effective in assisting individuals to self-soothe, implementation of the room did not have an overall effect on seclusion or aggression rates. As seclusion and aggression are key indicators reported to the Ministry of Health, the benefits of the sensory room were essentially ‘invisible’ at this level. Although disappointing, these results are consistent with previous assertions that both top-down and bottom-up strategies are required to effectively reduce rates of seclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459585">7</xref></sup> Although Champagne and Stromberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref></sup> reported a 54% reduction in seclusion, their study was undertaken in Massachusetts following the State Mental Health Authority’s mandate to reduce, and then eliminate, seclusion and restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212459585">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of consumers who used the room reported a decrease in distress (<italic>n</italic>=55, 78.6%) and only one consumer (1.4%) noted an increase. Effectively reducing distress has far reaching implications for empowering consumers to improve their emotional self-management and reduce the trauma of hospitalisation. The sensory room provides a ‘safe haven’ from the potentially chaotic ward environment or the consumer’s own internal turmoil. Objective ratings of consumer behaviours suggest that these reductions in distress also translated into observable improvements in behaviour. This may have a positive effect on ward milieu, supporting an environment that is more conducive to recovery. This also suggests that the use of self-soothing techniques (similar to those used in formal dialectical behavioural therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212459585">5</xref></sup>) is useful for the broader population of inpatient psychiatric consumers.</p>
<p>Results from the repeated-measures general linear models were interesting. Most notable were the positive results related to use of the weighted blanket. Previous literature supports the utility of weighted items for calming and grounding children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212459585">9</xref></sup> and our study provides initial evidence for the effectiveness of weighted blankets in the adult psychiatric inpatient population. Even where a sensory room is not available, these results would suggest that weighted blankets may be a useful resource to assist consumers to self-manage distress. Rocking motions have also been reported to be effective for soothing older persons with dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459585">10</xref></sup> and, although not significant, trends emerging from our small sample (21 occasions of rocking chair use) indicate further investigation of this self-soothing resource is warranted.</p>
<p>Seclusion was required after use of the room on four occasions, as these consumers were unable to effectively self-contain their behavioural disturbance. Despite this, the presence of the sensory room did provide a less-invasive early intervention option. This is in line with trauma-informed approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459585">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212459585"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459585">3</xref></sup> and supports a shift towards more humane methods to contain disturbed behaviour.</p>
<p>The gender disparity in room use (83% of episodes were by females) was noteworthy. This may be related to the items in the room or it may be that the room was seen as useful for distressed females but that seclusion was seen as more appropriate for disturbed males. This would also go some way to explaining the lack of effect of the introduction of the room on seclusion rates. Further work is required to ensure that the resources in the sensory room are appropriate for males and that staff are educated about the usefulness of the room for both males and females.</p>
<sec id="section10-1039856212459585">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The primary limitation of this study is that raters were not blinded. It is likely that at least some of the improvements noted are related to raters’ expectation that there should be positive effects. A blinded trial of sensory rooms would be particularly helpful in controlling for this form of measurement bias. A second limitation is that the instrument used was not validated. Although different individuals may interpret the rating scales differently, this is partially controlled in the context of this study. As before and after ratings were completed by the same individual, the rating scale would be used in the same way at both times.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Use of the sensory room appears to be valuable in the attenuation of distress and behavioural disturbance. Results also support the usefulness of weighted blankets in inpatient psychiatric settings. Sensory rooms are a humane, non-invasive and effective method to support self-management in mild to moderately disturbed consumers. These results add to the emergent knowledge base around interventions designed to reduce the use of seclusion in Australian psychiatric inpatient units.</p>
