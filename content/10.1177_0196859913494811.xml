<p>Before Dr. Todd Gitlin published his first major book, <italic>The Whole World is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the Left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859913494811">1980</xref>)</italic> (born of his PhD thesis on the impact of media on the group Students for a Democratic Society [SDS] and the New Left), he already had 20 years of experience as a social activist, including time as president of SDS.</p>
<p>His fascination with media and politics resulted in more than a dozen books, which have found audiences inside and outside of the academy. Some of these include <italic>Inside Prime Time</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913494811">1983</xref>), <italic>The Sixties: Years of Hope and Rage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913494811">1987</xref>), <italic>Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives</italic> (2002), and <italic>Occupy Nation: The Roots, the Spirit, and the Promise of Occupy Wall Street</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859913494811">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Dr. Gitlin is currently the chair of the PhD program at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in New York, and travels around the globe speaking about issues relating to politics, public policy, and journalism.</p>
<p>In April of 2013, Dr. Gitlin visited the University of Iowa as the annual McGranahan Lecturer in the Iowa School of Journalism and Mass Communication. While on campus in Iowa City, Dr. Gitlin took time out of his busy schedule to visit the office of the <italic>Journal of Communication Inquiry</italic> and talk with Reviews Editor Shawn Harmsen about his passion for a life of scholarship and activism. Below are some selected excerpts from that interview.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>We are approaching the 35th anniversary of the publication of <italic>The Whole World is Watching.</italic> Do you think it still holds up well? Does it hold up for you, three-and-a-half decades later?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>It holds up well enough. The analysis of the frames, I don’t have anything to add to. The analysis of the impact on the Movement, I would say holds up but needs supplements. The theoretical part I don’t actually pay much attention to, so I can’t judge whether it’s worthy or not. But the general angle of vision, in which the media are a component of the gestalt of the movement trajectory, remains, I think, essential. You can’t consider the work of a movement without considering how it comes into the light of media, or not. This is true in the era of social media and multipronged media, as it was in the era of mass media. It frequently delights me that I hear from people around the world that have come upon the book and find it useful. It’s been published in China East, for example.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>Since working on your dissertation, you’ve had more than 30 years to refine yourself as a scholar. Looking back, is there anything you would do differently or change; a different approach or something you would add?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>For one thing, I would do more of what I did then. I would do wider and I would do more. That is, I would have worked harder to reconstruct the part of the analysis that had to do with the impact on the Movement. I would have interviewed more people. I probably would have looked into some archives, although I’m not sure how helpful they would’ve been. But in any case, I would have looked. My original idea when I wrote my dissertation prospectus was to compare several movements along this dimension of media interaction. I never got around to the others, but I wanted to do it with Civil Rights, I wanted to do it with the Women’s [Rights] Movement, I wanted to do it with the Environmental Movement. I decided I wanted to finish my dissertation, so I didn’t pursue those.</p>
<p>There’s a certain fixity to the past, that shapes the self who looks back and contemplates how a transfer of the past would translate to a transfer of the future. Right now the trajectory of my work in media studies seems just fine. You know, it took me a lot of years after the book, <italic>The Whole World is Watching</italic>, to pull back to a larger sense of where the Student Movement was in relation to the evolving political culture of society as a whole. I did that in my later book, <italic>The Sixties</italic>, which was 6 or 7 years later. There’s probably some larger vision I was able to come to in that intervening period that I couldn’t have quite aroused and sculpted into shape when I was writing my dissertation. I was still close to the event. I haven’t gone back and read it in detail—I really can’t stand to do that, frankly. I don’t like revisiting.</p>
<p>My recollection is that there were times in the second part—let’s call this my conditional recollection—where I may have overplayed the part media played in the evolving gestalt. I know I was aware that was a pitfall, and I know that I inserted demurs in the text, but I probably would pull back further and think about what was happening to the larger political culture than I did. I would think more about the political context. I would have more of a distance from the New Left’s political trajectory. I must say, I’m still quite proud of what I was able to see at that critical juncture.</p>
<p>It’s still very interesting to me that I have turned back to the work I did in Occupy Nation, on the Occupy Movement. I was once again back to the old problem of what happens when face-to-faceness and mass mediation occupy the same space. Or go to war with each other. Or coexist. In the case of Occupy, it’s electronic communication evolving into face-to-face communication. In the paradigm as I came to it in <italic>The Whole World is Watching</italic>, the direction was the opposite. But once again, it seems to me, a theme of my intellectual life that I’m interested in the tensions between those two worlds. So that’s just a matter of interest to me that I have this—without ever thinking about it—I was sitting on top of this obsession all these decades.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>I was lucky enough to read your book <italic>The Whole World is Watching</italic> as Occupy was developing. I was struck by one of the themes in your book—the way in which the Student Movement’s leadership was identified, how that created problems and issues within the movement, and also created a target for people to discredit in the larger society. And at that time, and even still, the Occupy Movement was so dedicated to not having a leader.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>Indeed.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>In a class I was in at the time, we discussed your book and were wondering if members of the Occupy movement had read it.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know if they’ve read it, but there are a whole series of lessons that were learned that became more or less the canonical lessons from the 60s—[lessons] about leadership, about hierarchy, about being preferable to be “horizontalist” rather than “verticalist,” let’s say. I would say all told—and I said this somewhere in the Occupy book—this is the post-60s orthodoxy that evolved out of some understanding of what had proved self-limiting, and worse, in the 60s.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>You’re very clear in your book and when you speak about how your earlier activism really played a role in lighting an internal fire, of creating a passion for this topic. I think at various times you have described it as being annoyed with what you saw going on and wanting to figure that out. Does this still motivate you? What today lights that fire?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>I came into some apprehension of feeling intuitively and empirically that the world was endangered, and I’m still there. It is endangered. And so, the equivalent passions that I feel arise from my inability or unwillingness to untangle myself from the big currents that are at work in the world. So in recent years I’ve been preoccupied with the financial crisis and the way in which it was both cognitively elusive and materially overwhelming, and missed by journalists.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way: in the early 60s—my generation, and I don’t mean my entire generation, but people like me—sort of stumbled into the Universities to discover that in some ways they had been contrived to the benefit of people like me. People who had gone to the right schools, and had the right skills—we became aware that we were in a sense being conscripted into an intellectual army that had priorities which were not philosophically convenient—and were even in fact ruinous socially—and we revolted from that. I mean, I was a mathematician and I revolted from that world. What happened during the more or less 20 years in the run-up, from the beginning of the Reagan era in 1981 through the collapse of the financial system in 2007 to 2008, likewise a generation of young people had been conscripted into being the army of the composers and arrangers of derivatives. Many of the people who designed this toxic stuff that was circulated around the world were mathematicians and physicists. I had a student at Columbia who was quite a brilliant mathematician and went to work for Goldman Sachs and did this sort of thing.</p>
<p>For me, the notion of a world in danger is in some way composed by people doing the work of presenting a sort of pseudo-order—a fraudulent claim on nationality. I felt quite urgently the inability of the existing institutions to cope with the magnitude of what they’ve delivered; the intellectual magnitude, obviously the financial magnitude. I was feeling a great deal of urgency about this before Occupy erupted. I spent several months in Germany a few years ago, the spring before the Occupy movement began. I had a fellowship at the American Academy and was giving lectures in various places about American journalism. A lecture I gave several times, with variance, had to do with the failure of journalism to “get” the financial bubble. So I was already primed to feel that something deeply systemic, cultural, intellectual, journalistic was at work. I felt, and still feel, that there has been an immense dereliction of duty, of course with regulatory institutions but also with journalism. There are two other dimensions that continue to pick at me. Let’s say pick at and also “picket,” me. They are climate change and the consequences thereof. Our institutions are more enfeebled than ever, and the magnitude of the global threat is unrelenting and undiminishing. So I feel acutely the need to be called back to action, as a political activist, but also analytically. And actually, the issue that first propelled me into politics—nuclear weapons—never quite flees my own conscious mind.</p>
<p>So there it is again, I sort of grew up with some sort of bedrock awareness that the world was more fragile and contingent and jeopardized than was conventionally comfortable to take on . . . and you know, that wasn’t wrong!</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>I’ve heard people use phrases like “activist scholar” or “public scholar.” Do you see yourself as fitting that role? Is that how you are hoping to make things better? Certainly I don’t see you just publishing in academic journals for only an academic audience; your work transcends that. Is that by design?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>I am an activist and I am an intellectual. I don’t limit my intellectual life to my activist agenda; I don’t want to do that—I think I’m constitutionally incapable of it. I seem to require, or at least I’m not paralyzed by, tensions between these two, and I need to pursue both. I actually would find it objectionable to have my intellectual agenda altogether rigged to suit my political predilections. My political predilections for one thing have evolved over the years. I’ve been involved in politics for more than half a century—I’d like to think that I’m not set in stone. My scholarship has its vagaries, and I have my preoccupations. I just spent some time this morning talking with John Peters, who is one of the media theorists I admire and follow most closely. In recent years my interests have edged toward his, toward the phenomenology of communication and sort of the question of, in a way, the ontology of communication, which was much more the subject of, let’s say my third contribution to the field of media studies, my book <italic>Media Unlimited</italic>. It was much more under the sway of philosophical concerns than immediate political concerns; I don’t want to give that up. I’ve always had an aversion to narrowing. I’ve always been a dilettante—that is, a sprawler, an amateur of different obsessions. So I don’t want my political life to overshadow that, but at the same time, I have a political life—I seem to have an activist bent.</p> <p>From earlier on, when I confronted a social phenomenon, something objectionable, I had a double-reaction. The first as simply to receive it, take it in, appraise it, and try to understand it from different angles. But the second question I was always in the habit of asking myself was, “Well, what do we do about that?” Not what do <italic>I</italic> do about that, but what do <italic>we</italic> do about that. Because from early on—from the time I was 17—I fathomed that politics is done by clusters of people, by networks, by associations that appraise the situation and work out some common approach. Periodically I get thrown into a form of activity. When I finished with the <italic>Occupy Nation</italic> book, I then turned to trying to address the Occupy movement, and steer it in certain directions. Most recently I’ve gotten involved in organizing people at a number of universities, including my alma mater, Harvard, to press for divestment of fossil fuel companies by the endowment, and I suspect that will be my activist place for some time. It’s not that I think I’m undermining my intellectual interests in doing so—not at all—my motive there is primarily political. In the meantime I go on doing the other things I do.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker><p>A couple of things you said I found to be very interesting—particularly your relationship with theory, and inspiration from the Birmingham school; some of that shows in the things you’ve written. You’ve also said you are suspicious of “grand theory,” and prefer something more concrete in research. Could you delve into that a little bit? What is your relationship to theory? You certainly use interesting theories, but you use them in a particular way.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker><p>Once upon a time I was a mathematician. There is a key that plays in me that is quite abstract. I think of it as geometric. There’s a pleasure for me in abstraction. However, possibly because I was a mathematician, I know the real thing. At the same time I’m drawn to “big think,” big intellectual propositions, and hypothesis, I’m also suspicious of sloppiness and of grandiosity in theoretical claims. The world is not mathematically contrived and I’m not a Platonist. In fact, it’s been a struggle for me intellectually over many years to derive a feeling for actual process.</p>
<p>You know, I think he no longer teaches here, but one of my stimulating intellectual companions the last 15 years or so has been Antonio Damasio. He had a wonderful title for one of his neuroscience classes: “The Feeling of What Happens.” I have a certain feeling for what happens. In my case, it doesn’t have to do with synapses firing; it has to do with the texture of social life. Parenthetically, for a very long time, I used to go around saying I was more interested in texture than text. That is to say, I was more interested in the place that communications occupy in ordinary life. I had a phenomenological interest, which I didn’t indulge intellectually until <italic>Media Unlimited</italic>. I still think a lot on that plane—I am fascinated by social process as something irreducible to theoretical formulations. I’m always interested in conceptual approaches, but I read them with the old cunning mathematical eye of, “Well, what does this concept actually mean?”</p>
<p>These days the fashionable terminology has to do with networks. But what is a network? What is the natural history, the social history of networks. How does it happen that certain networks flourish and others don’t. So in this sense, I’ve become an old fashioned historian who is interested in contingencies rather than structures. Precisely because I have a mind that goes toward structure, I also have a mind that goes skeptical on structures, and I’m interested in particularities—that’s what I mean by concrete, one has to have a feeling for process. In the human world you have to have a feeling for human process, and that means that I don’t recognize any sharp distinction—roll over Emile Durkheim—I don’t recognize any sharp distinction between psychological and social facts; between historical and structural circumstances. So I poach. So I make up my own fascinations. Or they make me up as I go along.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>I think the fashionable term is “toolkit.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>I don’t like “toolkit.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>Why is that?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>Because it’s too deliberate. It implies too much conscious control of the process. To me it feels more like mental dispositions than something so hard and fast as a bunch of tools. And I often feel—and this goes to the poet in me—that the concepts we need, or the concepts I need, emerge in the immersion in something, in the concrete. I don’t know what they are going in. I think Stuart Hall once said [it is necessary to] take a long preliminary soak in the material. I believe in the long soak, whether it’s in archives or in an ethnographic encounter. I believe in getting, not just your hands dirty, but slogging in the mud up to your hips. So I never quite know what theoretical work will become valuable. For example, when I was trying to think about what has become for me the most fascinating question about media, “Why do we have so much of it?” somehow I found myself turning to Georg Simmel, as actually the most underrated of the sociological founding fathers who was interested in the texture of everyday situations. Questions of the nature of that texture, and how, as the phenomenologist would say, “life shows up and you live it,” is what interests me.</p> <p>I don’t know how it was I stumbled upon Simmel. When I was in grad school nobody read much of Simmel. I have a very strong memory of sitting down in the summer of 2000, just beginning [to write] the book <italic>Media Unlimited</italic>, and reading <italic>The Philosophy of Money</italic>, with absolute astonishment that somebody had been there to recover a sense of mental life—what had actually evolved in the 19th century as people left villages for cities, as people changed not just their religious and class orientation, but also rewired themselves. So going in I didn’t know I was going to Simmel. I knew that what I was looking for I wasn’t going to find in Marx, I wasn’t going to find in Weber, I wasn’t going to find in Durkheim, nor was I going to find it in most media theory, because media theory was overly obsessed with media. That is, there’s a lot to learn from McLuhan about features of different media, but there aren’t really any human beings. There aren’t people who are living lives while also indulging in being exposed to, making use of, being made use of, the media. The people who are doing media are also doing other things . . . they have other tensions, other limits. So around that time I was drawn to Simmel because he was interested in the whole human being and what was happening.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>It sounds like at times you make connections with theorists like Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams, perhaps. Do you still find yourself connecting with the background of cultural media studies?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>I don’t so much make contact with Birmingham. I think I still make contact with Williams, because Williams was on to the saturation of social life by media. One of my inspirations when I was writing <italic>Media Unlimited</italic> was a little essay called “Drama in a Dramatized Society,” which I think was his inaugural lecture at Cambridge. He poses—and again it’s the obviousness that’s always staring at you, unnoticed—that we live in a society and it’s not just that people tell stories, but they tell them nonstop. There’s something uncanny about this that needs to be taken seriously. Williams is a complex and seminal figure. As I judge his intellectual trajectory, he had this interest in life as it is lived, and this aligned with his political commitments on the Left. But at the same time, he had a “geometric” longing, and it comes out in his later work when I think he was trying hard, maybe too hard, to make his Marxism come out. Some of that work was important to me at a certain point because he took Gramsci seriously, and in that Marxism literature I think he explored rather well, very well, the base-superstructure role. I suppose I was reading that in the 70s; I’ve since moved on and am no longer interested in that problem.</p>
<p>To me, base/superstructure is a yin/yang interconnection, it’s a Mobius strip. The distinction doesn’t work for me analytically. Is the world of mortgage based securities base or superstructure? I mean, the base is made up what used to be called super-structural elements. Value—what is the value of what banks hold, when what they hold is paper that derives from other kinds of paper? In what sense can that be considered part of the productive apparatus? Yet, certainly it is. In any case, I’m less interested in that element of Williams than his attempt to tidy up Marxism and preserve it. But I’m very much interested in the way as a literary analyst he took the intricacy of human production seriously. Probably his greatest book on this dimension was <italic>The Country and the City</italic>, much of which consists of close readings of poetry and other texts that aim to make the problem of the great transformation in British life. He wanted to see history at work in the concrete—actual human beings, and not as some sort of interaction of structures. That remains important to me.</p> <p>I find myself drawn to Bourdieu’s notion of habitus. I don’t like it because it sounds so rarified, and yet I do find it infiltrating my thoughts. I’m interested in the way in which, in the course of social life, people live in a social world that engages them and opens up possibilities, but also confines in certain ways to a conceptual grid . . . a kind of arrangement of the mind, in which performances and actions are integrally connected to cognition. That is to say, cognition doesn’t take place in a disembodied box. I have become quite interested in recent years in phenomenology and especially Merleau-Ponty because he insists that thinking takes place within the body and the arrangement of the body . . . the alignment of the body is integral to the way in which we approach the world, the way in which the world shows up for us. To me, framing is not simply a mental act. It includes mental acts, but it also takes place at the level of understandings, of taken-for-granted understandings that may not rise to the level of consciousness, but that constitute a person’s orientation to the world.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>You used framing in <italic>The Whole World is Watching.</italic> Are you still able to draw information from framing as a guide for your own research?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>In the following sense: I think now when I look at, for example in the little book about Occupy, what I try to do when thinking about the world in general is to ask the philosophical question, the phenomenological question, “What is it like to be an ‘x’? What is it like to be a journalist covering this story? What is it like to be a certain kind of activist?” So, to me there’s an imaginative act that I try to perform and to renew and to revisit. It has the purpose of reminding me that the people who are doing things are not only doing them with words and with symbols but also are doing them in their lives, and that this how social life takes place.</p>
<p>I’m interested in making the leap to at least probing the question of how situations, or how peoples and projects and situations interact so that if you were, say, a journalist or an activist you would approach the world conceptually. And yet, at the same time, your conceptual apparatus either does or doesn’t flex as the situation becomes clearer or becomes different in some way that shows up to you. This is a cumbersome way of saying that when I look at social actors, at least when I’m sharp, I think I care to perform that imaginative act. I think that actually having written fiction helps me ask this question about forms of life which are not exactly my own, unleashing my curiosity about how they operate. This is something that’s probably come more easily with age.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>Do you still find framing to be a useful tool or concept as you look at media?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>Because my primary interest is in people and how they incorporate and work with forms of communication, to me what is going on is on a plane, which is deeper than framing. For example, if I’m thinking about people on their iPhones and so on, I’m much more interested in their emotional life than their conceptual apparatus. I’m much more interested in how their work with an iPhone or on Facebook is integrated into, or not, the rest of their life. Of course there are also questions about how certain truth claims are framed. And that can be interesting. But actually, to me, it’s sort of sunk into the obvious.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SH:</speaker>
<p>It’s become part of the background?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>TG:</speaker>
<p>Actually, it’s more like the foreground. Well, of course things show up to us as “x, y, or z” conceptually, we make choices and exclusions, of course. To me, that’s automatic and so therefore not so interesting. That’s not say it should be discarded, but for me it’s of the known world.</p>
