<title>Objective</title>
<p>Auricular melanomas are now considered less aggressive than originally thought, but those located on the conchal bowl and posterior ear can create particular challenges for reconstruction. Given the paucity of cases, no standardized recommendations exist for tumor resection.

<body>
<p>Melanoma is one of the most prevalent malignancies, as it is currently the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common in women in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812470426">1</xref></sup> The incidence continues to rise dramatically. In 2009, more than 62,400 cases were reported, whereas in 2000, the incidence was estimated at 47,700.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812470426">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812470426">3</xref></sup> Moreover, melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer, with 5-year survival rates inversely related to the tumor thickness (Breslow depth) and stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines from 2002, patients who have a lesion &gt;4 mm with ulceration have a 5-year survival rate of 45%.</p>
<p>As many as 3% to 12% of all melanomas arise in the head and neck region, but melanomas of the ear encompass approximately 1% of all cutaneous melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812470426">4</xref></sup> As a result of their low prevalence, little evidence exists regarding the nature of and best treatment for these malignancies. The unusual structural anatomy of the ear, as well as its variable lymphatic drainage, does not allow for the application of conventional melanoma treatment guidelines, which recommend resection of 2-cm margins or greater for tumors greater than 2 mm in thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812470426">5</xref></sup> For tumors between 1 and 2 mm in thickness, 1- to 2-cm margins are recommended, and for tumors less than 1 mm in thickness, a 1-cm margin will suffice. Although there are stipulations stating that modified margins may be acceptable in areas where full margins are cosmetically unacceptable or anatomically difficult to achieve, including melanomas of the face, no specific recommendations for ear melanomas exist. Thus, if these guidelines are applied without modification for ear melanomas, radical resection will be required in many cases, leading to functional loss and cosmetic deformities. This is especially true in cases of melanomas found on the posterior helix and conchal bowl.</p>
<p>The literature discussing the prognosis and management of ear melanomas is incomplete and fraught with controversy. In the 1960s, Ward and Acquarelli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812470426">6</xref></sup> suggested that melanomas arising from this region were biologically more aggressive and thus were associated with a worse prognosis. Subsequent case reports based on small sample sizes described large, ulcerated lesions and concluded that melanomas of the ear were aggressive variants of melanoma that warranted amputation and radical neck dissection in every case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812470426">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812470426">7</xref></sup> As a result of this treatment, significant cosmetic and functional morbidities were noted, including facial nerve palsies and difficulty wearing glasses and hearing aids.</p>
<p>Over time, however, larger, more representative cohorts were examined and results were dramatically different. Multifactorial analysis eventually revealed that tumor thickness was the single most important determinant of survival in all melanoma, including the ear. The first landmark article was in 1980 by Byers et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812470426">8</xref></sup> who reviewed 102 cases and published depth-specific 5-year survival rates, which dispelled the misconception about the aggressive nature of ear melanomas. In addition, the authors stated that less-than-total amputation (eg, wide local excision) was sufficient treatment, except in cases with locally disseminated disease at initial presentation or recurrence after partial amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812470426">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later, Cole et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812470426">9</xref></sup> did not find any evidence that melanoma of the ear had a poorer prognosis than other cutaneous melanomas and emphasized that as long as cartilage was not involved, there was no difference in prognosis with skin resection and graft coverage versus radical resection. In addition, Pockaj et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref></sup> reported 7 cases of melanoma treated with skin excision alone and no evidence of recurrence. This study looked at a total of 78 cases of malignant melanoma of the ear and advocated conservative skin excision in cases with no evidence of cartilage involvement, especially those involving the conchal bowl and posterior surface of the ear. Thus, in cases with no underlying cartilage invasion, excision of the skin alone with conservative margins appears to preserve form and function without compromising survival. This conservative management is being slowly adapted around the world.</p>
<p>To determine why conservative surgical resection is an acceptable management in these patients, we reevaluated the histopathology of auricular melanomas. Here, we summarize the histologic features of a series of invasive ear melanoma cases from our institution with a special emphasis on the integrity of the perichondrium. Our conclusions are solely based on the observed pathologic characteristics of auricular melanomas and not on the clinical outcome.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved with a waiver of consent by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee and Institutional Review Board and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
<p>We identified all cases of melanomas of the external ear from the archives of Dermatopathology and Surgical Pathology laboratories at the Yale–New Haven Hospital between 1987 and 2009. We reviewed the available medical records of patients who had undergone surgical resection for malignant melanoma of the ear. We chose not to include any cases of melanoma in situ, as these were already known to be noninvasive. The database search initially yielded 114 cases of invasive melanoma. Only 92 cases, however, had slides available for review. Among these 92 cases, we excluded 35 cases where the primary lesion was located on the earlobe, since this region does not contain cartilage. Of the remaining 57 cases, 6 had incomplete data. Therefore, a total of 51 cases were included in the final study. These cases include all invasive melanomas located in the cartilaginous portion of the external ear, not just those of the concha or the posterior helix.</p>
<p>The original pathology slides for the 51 cases were re-reviewed. The shortest distance between the tumor in the original biopsy or the scar base in the excision specimen and the superficial surface of the perichondrium was measured for each case as the lesion-perichondrium distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812470426"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Specifically, this was calculated by first determining the Breslow depth, which measures the distance between the top of the granular layer of the epidermis to the deepest level of tumor or scar in the dermis. At the same position, we measured the distance from the top of the granular layer down to the perichondrium and labeled that as the perichondrial distance. The lesion-perichondrium distance equaled the difference between these 2 values. All values are given as mean (standard deviation [SD]).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the 51 cases, patients’ age ranged from 26 to 94 years, with a mean (SD) of 58.9 (17.5) years. Forty-three patients were male and 8 were female, yielding a male to female ratio of 5.4:1. Distribution was similar between the right (52%) and left (48%) ears. The most common tumor location was the helix (74.5%). Locations of the 51 cases are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812470426"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. The Breslow depth ranged between 0.19 and 11 mm, with a mean (SD) of 1.64 (1.6) mm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812470426"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Forty-two of the 51 cases (82%) had a Breslow depth of 2 mm or less. Thus, the majority of our cases were relatively early stage melanomas (tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] stages T1 and T2). Six cases (12%) had a depth of 2.01 to 4 mm (TNM stage T3), and only 3 of the 51 cases (6%) had a depth greater than 4 mm (TNM stage T4).</p>

<p>Of note, the perichondrium was not invaded in any of the cases, even though the tumor edge abutted the perichondrial surface in 1 case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812470426"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The distance between the deepest edge of the tumor or scar and the perichondrium ranged from 0 to 8.12 mm, with a mean (SD) of 1.11 (1.1) mm. The correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) between tumor thickness and perichondrial distance was −0.092. Most patients were treated by partial amputation of the ear. Two patients with posterior ear melanomas had been treated conservatively, such that only the skin and perichondrium were excised. There were no documented reexcisions for any of the patients for local melanoma recurrence in the pathology archives or the available medical records.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Historically, malignant melanomas of the ear were thought of as a particularly aggressive variant of melanoma necessitating radical resection, which left patients with significant cosmetic and functional deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812470426">6</xref></sup> Today, more conservative measures are being used to approach such lesions, including wide local skin excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812470426"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812470426"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812470426">13</xref></sup> Empirically, we know that there is no difference in survival between those patients treated with radical resection compared with those treated with more conservative management strategies. In previous retrospective studies of ear melanomas, Cole et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812470426">9</xref></sup> and Pockaj et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref></sup> noted that resection of skin and subcutaneous tissue down to the perichondrium provided a reliably negative deep margin. However, no histopathologic correlations were made.</p>
<p>Our present study serves to shed some light on this issue. We found that the perichondrial layer was preserved in all 51 ear melanoma cases, irrespective of tumor depth or location. Even the deepest lesion only abutted the border of the perichondrial layer but did not invade it. The mean melanoma thickness in our case series was 1.64 mm, similar to the 1.7-mm and 1.75-mm average reported respectively by Pockaj et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref></sup> and Cole et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812470426">9</xref></sup> No relationship exists between tumor thickness and tumor-perichondrium distance, given the near-zero correlation coefficient. This is likely due to the variable skin thickness of the different regions of the external ear. Thus, tumor thickness may not serve as the only guideline for determining adequate resection margins. It is also important to identify if the perichondrium is invaded when deciding the extent of surgical resection.</p>
<p>The Cole et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812470426">9</xref></sup> study examined 31 patients with ear melanomas, in which 3 patients had tumor resected down to the perichondrium. The authors found no relationship between local surgical therapy and eventual recurrence. Only clinical stage and tumor thickness were significantly correlated with a likelihood of recurrence. The authors mentioned that full soft tissue resection sparing the perichondrium was not associated with a higher rate of local recurrence.</p>
<p>Pockaj et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref></sup> looked at a total of 78 cases of ear melanoma, in which 7 underwent skin resection with perichondrium preservation. Among the 7 patients, 1 later had regional and systemic involvement, without local recurrence. This patient also had an elective lymph node dissection done at the time of the original surgery and was found to have 2 of 32 positive lymph nodes. The authors concluded that the type of resection did not influence recurrence or prognosis. Instead, systemic recurrence was affected by melanoma thickness, lymph node status, and local recurrence.</p>
<p>The latest study on ear melanomas by Jahn et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812470426">13</xref></sup> evaluated 161 patients with stage I and II melanoma of the external ear. The authors found that tumor thickness, tumor location, and extent of excision margins (ie, reduction of excision margins below recommended guidelines) were independent risk factors for recurrence-free survival in multivariate analysis. However, narrower excision margins did not have any effect on systemic recurrence and did not significantly affect the overall disease-specific survival. Local recurrences that result from narrow excision margins should be diagnosed in follow-up exams. Thus, the authors concluded that wide excision margins were unnecessary and that the underlying cartilage should be left intact.</p>
<p>Despite these studies, it is not clear why conservative resection of melanoma with preservation of the cartilaginous frame is adequate in some cases. The specific pathologic characteristics of the ear melanomas might explain why conservative surgical resection is becoming an acceptable management in some cases of auricular melanoma. To that end, we identified all cases of invasive melanomas involving the cartilaginous portion of the auricle during a period of 22 years from our archives. Considering the fact that these are uncommon melanocytic tumors, it is not unreasonable to assume that the cases in our series might be similar to auricular melanoma cases seen in most other institutions.</p>
<p>Most of our cases were stage I and II melanomas, with considerable distance between the deepest extent of tumor or scar and the perichondrium. The fact that most of our cases were thin melanomas could explain why conservative surgical management might be a feasible solution with respect to oncologic, functional, and cosmetic results. The perichondrial integrity was never compromised regardless of tumor thickness or location. Even in the 1 case where the deep edge of the tumor bordered along the perichondrium, it was not invaded. Although this was seen in only 1 case, it is tempting to speculate that the perichondrium may be a potential barrier against melanoma invasion.</p>
<p>Needless to say, resection of malignant melanoma of the ear should be tailored to each patient, and the extent of surgery will be determined by the depth of the lesion as well as involvement of surrounding tissues, such as the auricular cartilage. The depth of a malignant melanocytic lesion cannot be estimated accurately by clinical examination alone. Often, it cannot be determined by histologic analysis of an initial shave biopsy either, since the entire lesion may not be included in the biopsy.</p>
<p>Surgical resection of melanocytic lesions along the perichondrium with or without a thin layer of the underlying cartilage resection might be an optimal first step for surgical clearance of melanomas involving the conchal bowl or the posterior aspect of the auricle, especially for thin (stage I and II) melanomas. Histologic evaluation of these specimens will probably be adequate for the pathologic staging of the tumor in most instances. The resection edges of the specimens are likely to be clear with reasonable lateral and deep margins, and the underlying perichondrium and cartilage are not likely to be involved by the melanoma in most cases, particularly with respect to thin melanomas. These margins, although narrow, might be considered acceptable by some surgeons for local resection in specific cases of ear melanomas and might provide adequate local control as supported by the reports from Cole et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812470426">9</xref></sup> Pockaj et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812470426">10</xref></sup> and Jahn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812470426">13</xref></sup> The patients should be followed regularly for local, regional recurrence or distant metastases. When the tumor extends to the margins or involves the underlying cartilage, a definitive resection including the cartilage may be performed subsequently.</p>
<p>This conservative yet “wide local resection” approach allows the framework of the ear to be preserved, which allows for easier reconstruction, enhanced cosmesis, and better functioning, in the case of hearing aids or eyeglasses. This is especially relevant for melanomas located at specific parts of the ear, including the conchal bowl and the posterior helix, where full-thickness resections essentially necessitate complete ear amputation and are unnecessarily deforming. In contrast, cartilage conservation is less of a concern for lesions located on the helix, in that composite wedge resection with primary reapproximation gives the optimal cosmetic result. In fact, the reconstructive results with a skin and perichondrium resection only (followed by a graft or flap) for helical rim lesions have been shown to be suboptimal.</p>
<p>As a retrospective case review, the present study is limited by lack of consistent surgical management and the availability of the follow-up records for the 51 melanomas included in our study. This is because several of the cases were received as consults in the pathology department for second opinion from other institutions, and information with regard to the surgical procedures and follow-up could not be obtained. Prospective studies of conservative excision of appropriate auricular melanomas with long-term follow-up will be necessary to further support the hypothesis that the perichondrium may be considered a plane for surgical resection while it may also act as a barrier to local melanoma spread.</p>
<p>The conclusions of our study have been made purely on the basis of histologic characteristics of the ear melanomas. Our results provide a pathologic basis for why conservative surgical management might be an acceptable approach with respect to oncologic, functional, and cosmetic results. In addition, the perichondrium may be considered a barrier against melanoma invasion and, therefore, a biological plane for wide local resection of melanomas of the ear.</p>
