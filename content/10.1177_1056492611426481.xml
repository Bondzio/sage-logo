<abstract>
<p>This article explores the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in sustainable development by drawing on the perspectives of four distinguished management scholars—Stuart Hart, Ans Kolk, Sanjay Sharma, and Sandra Waddock—as well as the extant literature on sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and international management. The discussions are centered around “Sustainable Global Enterprise” (SGE)—a new concept coined by Hart. Hart labels those MNEs that can generate competitive strategies that simultaneously deliver economic, social, and environmental benefits for the entire world as SGEs. Through deliberations with the above leading thinkers, this article offers insights into how MNEs can imbue the sustainability principles into their strategic framework and simultaneously contribute to sustainable development. The article also sheds light on the enormous new research opportunities yet to be tapped by international management and sustainability scholars.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last two decades, the world has become more economically integrated and “flat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611426481">Friedman, 2006</xref>). Many corporations are adopting a global business focus and drawing on global resources to operate their businesses. The globalization of world economy has ushered in a period of tremendous economic growth over the last half century. According to the World Development Indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611426481">World Bank, 2010</xref>), the world gross domestic product (GDP) grew almost fourfold during the last three decades from 11 trillion U.S. dollars in 1968 to more than 40 trillion dollars in 2008, and during the same period, the per capita GDP of the world doubled from US$3,131 to US$6,007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1056492611426481">1</xref></sup> The overall proportion of the developing world’s population living in extreme poverty decreased from 52% in 1981 to 26% in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492611426481">World Bank, 2007</xref>). The percentage of population with improved access to water increased from 76% in 1990 to about 86% in 2006. In addition, the conditions for child health also improved significantly. For example, infant mortality rate was greatly reduced from about 98 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1970 to about 46 in 2008, and the percentage of children immunized for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles went up from about 45% in 1985 to more than 92% in 2008.</p>
<p>Although these statistics impress us of the general improvement in wealth and human well-being around the globe, they present a lopsided view of the reality and do not fully mirror the perplexing and new challenges that confront us and our planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492611426481">Osland, 2003</xref>). Critics of globalization often use the lens of “sustainable development” to assess current state of global development. Sustainable development is that kind of development which can enable the present generation to meet their environmental, social, and economic needs, without inhibiting the ability of future generations to meet those needs on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1056492611426481">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>). It calls for balancing the three “Es” of environment, equity, and economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611426481">Berke &amp; Conroy, 2000</xref>) as societies and corporations aspire for financial growth and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611426481">Elkington, 1997</xref>). When seen through the lens of sustainable development, the current state of global development reveals grave inadequacies as well as enormous risks for current and future generations.</p>
<p>Despite the overall increase in financial wealth, the global environmental degradation and social inequalities between regions and nations continue to escalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492611426481">Sachs, 2005</xref>). For example, the global ecological footprint of humanity has increased almost 250% in the last 50 years (Global Footprint Network.). Nonrenewable resources, including fossil fuels, are being consumed at an unsustainable rate depleting the limited reserves. According to the World Development Indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611426481">World Bank, 2010</xref>), the global per capita energy consumption increased steadily from 1,338 kg of oil equivalent in 1971 to 1,819 kg in 2008. The world’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have also more than doubled during the last quarter century from 14.9 million kilotons in 1970 to 30.15 million kilotons in 2006. The Earth’s global average temperature has increased by 1.5°F since 1900, and it is feared that it will further increase to another 2°F to 11.5°F by 2100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1056492611426481">U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2009</xref>). Fossil records indicate that the rate of extinction of species today is 100 to 1,000 times more than what could be considered natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492611426481">Rockström et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From a socioeconomic angle, more than one quarter of the world’s population still lives in extreme poverty with less than US$1.25 a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611426481">World Bank, 2010</xref>.). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1056492611426481">World Health Organization (2009)</xref>, nearly 9 million children die below the age of 5 every year and more than 20 million children still suffer from severe acute malnutrition. One billion people still live without clean drinking water and three billion people still have no access to adequate sanitation. The financial crisis that began in 2007 has ushered in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and American households saw much of their wealth evaporate during the crisis. The total home equity in the United States dropped by about 35%, and the total retirement asset was reduced by 22%. Taken together, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611426481">Altman (2009)</xref> estimates that the total loss to American households amounts to a staggering US$8.3 trillion. In addition, it was estimated that financial institutions would incur loss of more than US$2.7 trillion between 2007 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611426481">International Monetary Fund, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the source of such gross failures and how can we reverse the course of global development for creation of a more sustainable world in the future? Today, a number of critics point to corporations, and especially multinational enterprises (MNEs), as the source of majority of the above-mentioned global problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611426481">Danaher &amp; Mark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611426481">Derber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611426481">Korten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492611426481">Perrow, 2002</xref>). There is a strong belief that while MNEs have taken a leading role in globalization and significantly contributed to economic growth of various nations, especially the developed nations, the wealth that was created was at the expense of the natural environment and the social well-being of poor nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611426481">Stiglitz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, on the social and economic front, critics blame MNEs for stoking intense consumerism and promoting cultural imperialism or “Americanization”—that is diluting traditional cultures and values of host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611426481">Friedman, 2006</xref>). MNEs have been condemned for purposefully investing in poor, corrupt, and politically unstable countries to gain access to more resources and capture new markets through active participation or support of economic, political, and social conditions that foster violence as well as bribery and corruption in those fragile states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611426481">Oetzel, Getz, &amp; Ladek, 2007</xref>). MNEs have been criticized for brazenly walking away with the profits they earned in developing countries to benefit their developed-country investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611426481">Cavanagh &amp; Mander, 2004</xref>). In their efforts to expand their operations, locally and globally, MNEs have allegedly preyed on local businesses and disenfranchized local communities, and caused economic depressions and recessions in various developing countries.</p>
<p>On the environmental front, MNEs have been criticized for their unrestrained exploitation of natural resources and aggressive efforts to commercialize almost every type of natural resource, including water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611426481">Ghoshray, 2007</xref>). MNEs have also been found to misuse their economic power to enter poorly regulated, poverty-stricken, but natural-resource rich, developing nations and stripping their wealth of natural resources. Critics accuse MNEs of harboring a “rape and run” attitude toward those countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611426481">Diamond, 2005</xref>). As an example, after methodically depleting natural resources of poverty-stricken countries—to the point of irreparably damaging their natural environment and disrupting their ecological balance—some MNEs conveniently move their production facilities to other greener pastures and resource-rich countries. Thus, even though MNEs’ investments in developing countries contribute toward their economic development to a certain degree, the GDP calculations exclude nonmonetized impairments such as depletion of natural resources and destruction of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611426481">Cavanagh &amp; Mander, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Sustainable Global Enterprise (SGE)</title>
<p>Despite the past failures and shortcomings of various MNEs, some commentators believe that MNEs, with their financial prowess and geographic reach and capabilities, can act as agents of positive change and sustainable development. MNEs can become solvers of the social, environmental, and economic crises we face and significantly help in creating a more sustainable future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611426481">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1056492611426481">Waddock, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492611426481">Waddock &amp; McIntosh, 2011</xref>). Indeed there are some MNEs that have been not only positively contributing to sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611426481">Hart &amp; Milstein, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611426481">2003</xref>) but also taking sustainable practices as a way to differentiate themselves and enhance their capabilities to achieve sustained competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611426481">Hart &amp; Sharma, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, Nike has raised its environmental and occupational health safety standards by instituting the Nike Code Leadership Standards, which its contractors have to comply with. Nike has also committed to environmental stewardship through various initiatives like the Reuse-A-Shoe and Nike Grind. Through its retail stores, Nike collects worn-out athletic shoes of any brand. The fabric, rubber, and foam from the collected shoes are then separated, purified, and ground up to produce the respective “Nike Grind” material, which is then used to make athletic field surfaces, like the basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields, and running tracks. Working with environmental nongovernment organizations (NGOs), McDonald’s has radically reduced its wastes by eliminating the use of Styrofoam clamshells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611426481">Holstein, 2006</xref>). HSBC has achieved carbon neutral status since 2005 by investing in renewable energy projects, financing clean technology, and purchasing green electricity. Having experienced the business risks and allegations of human rights violations emerging from its previous unsustainable water operations in India, Coca-Cola has now committed itself to “water stewardship.” It has been investing in innovative technologies to reduce and recycle water and to improve its water-use ratio. It has also been collaborating with communities and not-for-profit agencies like the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources Institute on various water replenishment projects.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611426481">Hart (2007)</xref> is hopeful that more MNEs can “create corporate and competitive strategies that simultaneously deliver economic, social and environmental benefits for the entire world” (p. 15). He idealizes and conceptualizes such MNEs as “SGE.” An SGE is that MNE which has successfully implemented sustainable development principles across its entire global as well as multidomestic local business models and, while doing so, has gained sustained competitive advantage in the industry.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611426481">Hart’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492611426481">2010</xref>) notion of SGE can prove useful to further understand the role of MNEs as agents of sustainable development. Arguably, it can be used as a theoretical as well as a methodological “hook” to investigate (un)sustainable business performance of MNEs. SGE can be theoretically treated as a reference framework—an ideal future destination—for MNEs aspiring to achieve sustained competitive advantage based on sustainable development principles. Being a multidimensional construct, the SGE notion can also be used to methodologically examine an MNE’s sustained competitive advantage based on its current financial, economic, environmental, and social strategies, and the impact of those strategies on local to global sustainable development. Recognizing the potency of the notion of SGE, in this article, we first explore the practicalities for MNEs attempting to tread on the SGE pathway. We then explore the theoretical and methodological viabilities of using this concept to advance scholarship that exists at the interface of international management and sustainability research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1056492611426481" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The inspiration for this article came as a result of a professional development workshop (PDW) on SGE, which we had organized at the 2010 Academy of Management Annual Meetings in Montreal. The PDW was sponsored by five divisions of the Academy of Management, including the Business Policy and Strategy, International Management, Organization and Management Theory, Organizations and the Natural Environment, and the Social Issues in Management as well as the Academy’s Critical Management Studies Interest Group. The workshop involved four leading thinkers in sustainable management, corporate social responsibility, and international management research. Those four experts are Stuart Hart (Cornell University), Ans Kolk (University of Amsterdam), Sanjay Sharma (Concordia University), and Sandra Waddock (Boston College). Following are condensed biographic information on them.</p>
<p><bold>Stuart L. Hart</bold> is the Samuel C. Johnson chair in SGE and professor of management at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Management. He is one of the world’s top authorities on the implications of sustainable development and environmentalism for business strategy. His article “Beyond Greeling: Strategies for a Sustainable World” in the <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> helped launch the movement for corporate sustainability. With C. K. Prahalad, he also wrote the path-breaking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492611426481">2002</xref> article “The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid,” which provided the first articulation of how business could profitably serve the needs of the four billion poor in the developing world. His book, <italic>Capitalism at the Crossroads</italic>, offers a provocative insight on how corporations can contribute to sustainable development, while maximizing their profits.</p>
<p><bold>Ans Kolk</bold> is full professor at the University of Amsterdam Business School, the Netherlands. She has extensively published journal articles and book chapters in the field of corporate social responsibility and sustainability, especially in relation to the strategy and management of international business firms, and international policy. Specific topics have included climate change and energy, poverty and development, bottom of the pyramid and subsistence markets, partnerships, codes of conduct and nonfinancial reporting, and stakeholders and governance. In addition, she has published <italic>Economics of Environmental Management</italic> and <italic>International Business and Global Climate Change</italic> (with Jonatan Pinkse). In 2009, she received the Aspen Institute Faculty Pioneer European Award (Lifetime Achievement Award).</p>
<p><bold>Sanjay Sharma</bold> is the dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Vermont. His research has been published in <italic>Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, Strategic Management Journal</italic>, and <italic>Journal of Marketing</italic>, among other leading journals. He has coedited seven books on corporate environmental management and sustainability. His research addresses the development of capabilities for proactive organizational sustainability strategies; the influence of stakeholder knowledge on organizational innovation for sustainable products, processes, and business models; the influence of managerial interpretations on organizational strategies; and the development of sustainable business models at the base of the economic pyramid.</p>
<p><bold>Sandra Waddock</bold> is the Galligan chair of strategy and professor of management at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. She has published innumerable articles and book chapters on corporate responsibility and citizenship, intersector collaboration, and transition to a sustainable enterprise economy. Her latest book is titled <italic>SEE Change: The Great Transformation to the Sustainable Enterprise Economy</italic> (with Malcolm McIntosh). Other recent books include <italic>The Difference Makers: How Social and Institutional Entrepreneurs Build the Corporate Responsibility Movement, Leading Corporate Citizens</italic>, and <italic>Total Responsibility Management: The Manual</italic> (with Charles Bodwell).</p>
<p>The workshop began with a highly interactive dialogue among the above panelists. It was followed by a question-and-answers session engaging more than 35 attendants of the workshop. The workshop lasted for 2 hr. Keeping a note of the deliberations that were taking place during the PDW, we continued to discuss the issues raised, in depth, even after the workshop. In the meantime, we also began to receive several requests from the audience and other members of the Academy who were not able to attend the PDW for summary of the PDW deliberations. Some members requested that we develop an article on the topic. Inspired by the PDW experience and the members’ requests, we carried out an extensive literature review on the topic of role of MNEs in sustainable development governance. Despite the importance of the subject matter, there seems a dearth of research that integrates international management and sustainability topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611426481">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010</xref>). Recognizing the gap, we were motivated to develop this article as a platform for scholarly dialogue on MNE’s role in sustainable development and stimulate new ideas that would help advance related research and practice.</p>
<p>We, therefore, reengaged with the panelists. Through electronic interviews, we probed deeper into the meaning and implications of SGE. We asked the panelists to clearly formulate their positions on 12 questions that were drafted on the basis of the deliberations among the panelists and the audience at the PDW. For example, we asked them to articulate the concept of SGE, the performance of MNEs, and motivation for MNEs to become SGEs. The panelists highlighted their views on the current practices of MNEs. They recognized the problems in current business models and provided recommendations on why and how MNEs can/should adopt sustainable development principles in their business model. They also discussed the role of management scholars in advancing research and practice on SGE. Each panelist sent their individual responses on the questions only to the authors.</p>
<p>We then compiled all the data and carried out an interpretive analysis of the interviews. We identified prominent themes that were commonly emerging in all the four interviews. Within each of those themes, we identified points of agreements and disagreements among the four scholars. We also questioned some of the ideological assumptions and arguments put forth by them, some of which have also been challenged by other scholars skeptical of MNEs’ involvement in sustainable development. Accordingly, we developed a discussion section. We summarized some of the complimentary and contradictory arguments, supporting and/or opposing the scholarly and practical debates relevant to the notion of SGE. The draft of the article, including the four interviews, was then shared with the four panelists. They were invited to review others’ interview responses as well as our discussion section. Their critiques and feedback were then incorporated in the final version of the article.</p>

<title>What Does the Term <italic>Sustainable Global Enterprise</italic> Mean to You?</title>
<sec id="section6-1056492611426481">
<title>Hart</title>
<p>Sustainable global enterprise represents the potential for a new private-sector-based approach to development that creates profitable businesses that simultaneously raise the quality of life for the world’s poor, respect cultural diversity, inspire employees, build communities, and conserve the ecological integrity of the planet for future generations. Making such a societal contribution while simultaneously creating shareholder value will take real imagination and a fresh approach to business strategy. I believe that the transformation to a sustainable form of enterprise that is occurring now is no less momentous than the transformation from the small, owner-operator style of “free market” capitalism advocated by Adam Smith to the industrial corporate model in the 19th century—the model that still predominates today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1056492611426481">
<title>Kolk</title>
<p>Sustainability or sustainable development is often an umbrella term involving a range of things, environmental, social, ethical, and economic, not only for a multinational company and its direct business partners and stakeholders but also the communities and wider societies in which it is active. So one would expect a sustainable global enterprise to take these different aspects into account properly and make the best out of it. Also in case of dilemmas, tensions or trade-offs between the various elements, there will be openness about the way in which those dilemmas have been considered and a sound reasoning on how and why decisions were eventually taken, and also, how possible negative side effects are addressed. This means responsibility, transparency, and accountability. But for a company that operates in a range of countries, with often divergent expectations, cultural traditions, levels of development etc., this is highly complex, not only because the issues and the contexts differ, but also because the very term <italic>sustainable</italic> may be subject to different interpretations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1056492611426481">
<title>Sharma</title>
<p>Each organization has a global value chain whether it chooses or not to operate in, or enter, global arenas. Due to the complexity of global value chains of organizations, it is impractical and extremely difficult for a single organization to be truly sustainable from cradle to grave, that is, in terms of a zero or positive environmental and social footprint in its value chain. Even if an organization completely redefines its business to deliver a service instead of physical goods or digitized electrons instead of stuff, it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to generate a zero or positive social and environmental footprint throughout its global value chain. Even the substitution of services or electrons for material goods generates massive carbon emissions and material impacts in the supply chains as giant servers consume massive amounts of energy to generate the electrons.</p>
<p>Each SGE is therefore a multiorganization, multistakeholder enterprise where its negative social/environmental footprints can potentially be offset by the positive social/environmental footprints of others. For example, an SGE may be embedded within a grouping of other organizations located in one or more regions based on principles of industrial ecology. This would mean that while an individual organization may generate emissions and wastes, these would be absorbed by other organizations, and so on, until there are zero wastes and emissions leaving the grouping. Similarly, an SGE may be embedded within a network of partnerships with NGOs, microcredit organizations, self-help groups, communities, and local governments to generate positive social and environmental impacts in the upstream and downstream value chains of these groupings.</p>

<title>Waddock</title>
<p>By definition, the word <italic>sustainable</italic> means no growth—sustaining or keeping what already is. Sustainable enterprises focus on developing a prescription for profitable, human-scale business enterprises that, by connecting with all stakeholders and the natural environment, operate in tune with social progress and in harmony with planetary boundaries (Waddock &amp; McIntosh, <italic>SEE Change: Making the Transition to a Sustainable Enterprise Economy</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492611426481">2011</xref>). Focusing on reasonable returns and profits, rather than constant growth, they inherently have a multiple (environmental, social, governance, and financial) bottom-line orientation. They understand and work within resource and human limitations, providing “decent” and stable, reasonably paid work. They pay their taxes, and developing strategies, policies, and practices that contribute to the well-being of their stakeholders, societies, and the natural environment, rather than detracting from them or destroying them. And since no global enterprise is remotely sustainable today, a shift toward sustainable global enterprise means a radical system change. In this change, global enterprises would necessarily incorporate a “do no harm” mentality into their production of goods and services with respect to the natural environment and within the societies and communities where they operate.</p>

<title>Is SGE an Achievable Goal or an Unattainable Ideal? Why Do You Think So?</title>

<p>I don’t believe it is either. Instead, it is simply an imperative. If we do not figure out how to make this transition in the next two to three decades, our society, as we currently know it, will collapse. The clock is ticking. Luckily, the institutions of entrepreneurial capitalism are ideally suited for the sort of experimentation, creative destruction, and scaling that will be needed to make this dramatic shift.</p>

<p>This depends of course on one’s definition of an SGE, but as I said in response to the first question, even for the approach that I described (which is a different ideal type than others may have), this is pretty difficult. Multinational firms are complex entities, usually spread over a large number of countries, with a range of business units/lines of business. And “sustainability” also encompasses many different aspects and subaspects—environmental, social (employee and/or community based, but can also be human rights more broadly), ethical, and even economic (in the sense of generating employment and poverty alleviation). So some companies can have a positive impact on one or more aspect, at a certain moment at a certain location, but that may be different for another time/place/issue. For example, Wal-Mart was chosen as the best employer in China while being under attack on this same issue in the US and simultaneously developing rather far-reaching corporate environmental policies.</p>

<sec id="section13-1056492611426481">

<p>Well, in many ways, SGE seems like an unattainable ideal, given the momentum and powerful forces, including the financial system and powerful political forces, behind the current economic model. The current economic model fosters linear growth, excessive consumption and materialism, and an inherent unsustainability. There is, however, evidence that some large enterprises are moving in the direction, and faster than most governments, of sustainability—or what they are calling sustainability—because their leaders recognize the imperative that the world faces.</p>

<p>Existing MNEs are a long way away from realizing the vision of sustainable enterprise. As I have argued elsewhere, most MNEs have engaged in “greening” reforms to make current products and processes less bad (as Bill McDonough would say), but few have made significant headway yet in leaping to the clean technologies of tomorrow or the business models of the future that will be needed to include the 4 billion plus at the base of the income pyramid in the capitalist dream.

<p>A generic assessment is difficult. It is undoubtedly true that sustainability issues have become important for multinationals. There is awareness and some degree of accountability, as demonstrated by the multitude of sustainability/ CSR reports published—I have followed and examined this trend myself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611426481">Kolk, 2010c</xref>). However, this is a largely voluntary exercise and companies can expose whatever they prefer. Still, there is a lot of activity, although one company can be active on climate change but not on human rights, or a leader in one location but not in another, or have a great corporate policy but lacking implementation, etc. So even for one MNE it is often very hard to establish their “performance,” and the broader you take the concept, the more difficult it becomes. Let alone that we can assess this for MNEs from different developed, emerging, and developing countries and cover the range of locations where they are active. This also points at a large research agenda.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced MNEs are at very early stages of beginning to understand how to develop business models that can generate an economic return while generating positive environmental and social impacts. Global enterprises have just yet begun to understand and measure their social and environmental footprint along the entire value chain. Some such as Wal-Mart have begun to address the sustainability footprint of its hundreds of thousands of suppliers. However, Wal-Mart has not even begun to understand the sustainability impacts of the second-stage or third-stage suppliers (that is, its suppliers’ suppliers, and so on). Others such as P&amp;G have been active in examining the life cycle of their products but have not addressed their vast global supply chains. Similarly, while several MNEs have entered the base of the pyramid markets where people earn less than a dollar a day, there are yet no viable examples of sustainable MNEs or truly sustainable business models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1056492611426481">
<title>Waddock</title>
<p>Today’s MNEs are operating in a business-as-usual mode that relies simply on linear growth, continued fostering of ever-more consumption, and a purported belief in the maximization of shareholder wealth. They have given much less attention to the contributions, investments, and inputs of other stakeholders, who also, in reality, are necessary for a successful business. Efficiency and cost control are central values, while as many costs as possible are externalized into the social, economic, and ecological environments. Competition is the heart and soul of many companies’ philosophies, with the idea that they will, as Dr. Seuss’s <italic>The Lorax</italic> says “bigger and bigger and bigger” themselves endlessly. Because of these attributes, the current model on which companies are based is inherently unsustainable in a world whose limits are becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>In contrast, an SGE would be based on a different model, one that is oriented to cyclical, and sustainable production and service cycles. It would be based on a holistic assessment of the needs and interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and oriented toward balance and equilibrium, health and well-being at the individual, company, societal, and ecological levels. In a sustainable enterprise the definition of wealth is equated more with well-being than just money or profits, and costs would be internalized through process of life cycle or full cost accounting, so that the real costs of producing goods and service are accounted for. Further, goods would be produced with longevity and reuse in mind, and companies would orient themselves toward servicing those goods already produced, rather than attempting to sell more “new and updated” products constantly. Company purposes would be prosocial and proecological, and hence public as well as private, and oriented toward preservation of a future. In that future, all of humanity and the other creatures and ecosystems of the world can survive and even thrive.</p>

<p>I believe long-run survival is at stake. Those MNEs that “crack the code” on sustainable enterprise will become the icons of 21st-century capitalism (along with the new entrants that will be revealed to us).

<p>There is an abundant literature that shows a mix of drivers for firms’ social and environmental strategies, performance, and (disclosure) practices, partly firm-specific, industry-specific and country-specific aspects: thus, individual, organizational, institutional (local, national, international) as far as the firm is concerned and with a whole set of stakeholder influences potentially playing a role. The exact balance depends on the specific situation of the MNE and the issue at hand. Reputation and visibility are important factors for MNEs—so there is the danger that those outside the public eye feel less pressure to do something. This applies, for example, to companies that do not sell directly to end consumers but are in business to business, or those originating from countries where domestic stakeholders are less sustainability oriented. In both cases supply-chain pressures from visible MNEs may have an impact, but this is much more indirect, thus representing a different mix (and perhaps even a relative absence) of drivers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1056492611426481">
<title>Sharma</title>
<p>It is possible that some MNEs are driven by the leadership’s personal values of creating a sustainable world. Business leaders such as Ray Anderson of Interface and Yvonne Chouinard of Patagonia are examples of such leaders. However, in most likelihood, MNEs are searching for growth in nonsaturated and less competitive markets as developed economies mature, slow down, or become stagnant. These include markets at the base of the pyramid. They realize that conventional paths of industrial development will not work in markets that are culturally very different and hence present very different environmental and social issues as compared to developed markets. For example, developing-country markets are characterized by major social problems such as massive poverty, lack of women’s rights and human freedom, and child labor, etc.</p>
<p>There is another form of SGE which did not start as an MNE: organizations that started with a social mission and subsequently became profitable and global. A famous example is Grameen bank that launched Grameen Bank USA recently and has plans to take its Grameen Bank and Grameen Phone model global while putting all its profits in a trust for reinvestment in socially oriented ventures. It is worth exploring whether this is the right model for developing an SGE rather than a for-profit MNE struggling to reduce its social and environmental footprint.</p>

<p>For a multinational to take social and environmental issues into account properly, this needs to be embedded overall at all levels and all locations, supported and often initiated from the top. But this is not without complexities, especially when MNEs are involved that have a large number of subsidiaries in many different countries and a range of activities that have social and environmental impacts—there are many dilemmas to be considered. And transparency and accountability, which can be seen as crucial components, also require courage as it may not be possible to please everybody.

<p>The MNE has to begin with a clear vision of a sustainable business model and how to reconfigure its current businesses and strategies toward that model. For example, DuPont has adopted “life sciences” as a sustainable business model and has been selling its chemical and plastics businesses after reducing their environmental impacts by adopting eco-efficiency strategies. All future investments, developments, acquisitions, and partnerships are focused around the sustainable vision. At the same time, the MNE has to understand, identify, and measure the social and environmental impacts for each element of the value chain and design/redesign its activities and configure/reconfigure its capabilities to generate positive economic, social, and environmental impacts. This is a long-term complex process and requires a stable enduring vision from the top management team. The MNE has to make a decision to focus on the long-term versus reacting to the vagaries of short-term performance demands of its stakeholders. This is not impossible and some MNEs such as DuPont have set upon this path. However, it takes tremendous leadership.</p>

<p>An MNE can become an SGE by understanding resource limitations, by operating in accord with ecological principles like those of the Natural Step, by restoring or renewing local environs when they need to use renewable resources, and by avoiding the use of nonrenewable resources. They would foster well-being among their employees and their employees’ families, communities, investors, suppliers, and customers by making useful and necessary products with long life cycles and internalizing their costs. They would improve their offerings through “servicization” models that enhance the usability, longevity, and appeal of products rather than fostering consumption and materialism. They would market products and services honestly and with integrity, and keep integrity as a core value with respect to all of their stakeholders. They would value competition and they would also equally value collaboration and cooperation, both with other business enterprises and with enterprises in other social sectors, including governments and civil society enterprises. They would also value the natural environment and people as ends in themselves.</p>
<p>It would be more likely to be a systemic change process that happens from the “bottom-up” through the process of, what Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction,” than from any kind of top-down change. That is, it is likely that new enterprises carrying some of the values articulated above will form and start to grow. Examples of these new forms of enterprises are B Corporations, Conscious Capitalism, social entrepreneurship and enterprise, and hybrid organizations.

<p>I am not sure what sustainable development governance exactly means, this is a very contested terrain and as complex as the issues faced by multinationals. There are local, regional, and international policy processes, on several topics, and very often protracted—climate change is a case in point. In addition to policy makers, other stakeholders, particularly NGOs are involved as well. Besides the variety of sustainability issues and diverging perceptions about concepts, and distribution of costs and benefits, an MNE need to decide in which forum(s) or issue arenas to participate and in what way—i.e., individual or via industry groups, and what position to take (e.g., merely following, setting its own policies in an active way, etc.). Policy makers and NGOs can try to involve MNEs—and already do so, in a variety of partnerships and other collaborative settings—but there are many potential sources of tensions here as well.</p>

<p>Becoming an SGE requires partnerships. This inevitably requires negotiation and compromise to avoid conflict and a breakdown of the partnerships. Generating profits, while creating positive social and environmental footprints, requires patient capital and a long-term orientation. Organizations have to change decision rules in order to evaluate performance over longer periods of time and to value natural capital and social welfare.</p>
<p>Moreover, social inequity breeds environmental damage, especially in BOP markets. For example, the poorest cut trees and vegetation for firewood and fuel due to lack of access to, and adorability of, any other form of fuel. Countries such as India compound the environmental problem by providing subsidized kerosene as a cooking fuel to the poor, generating higher levels of GHGs. Within such a context, a SGE needs to develop a business model that addresses poverty while ensuring that the poor have access to cheap affordable and reliable renewable energy.</p>

<p>Transforming into sustainable global enterprise requires a significant mind-set shift as well as systemic change to bring about new forms of enterprise that inherently think about the multiple bottom lines of business profits, society, equity, and nature. The “growth” mentality of the current system is out of line with the concept of sustainability—and even of thrivability, a capacity to thrive using current or fewer resources. Both the economic system as a whole and the fundamental underpinning of corporations need to emphasize thriving, thrivability, or well-being rather than growth.</p>
<p>Companies and their leaders are going to have to learn to focus on balance, equity, and sustainability for all of their stakeholders rather than the (ostensible) focus on shareholders alone. Decision making in this system will be more complex because it will be systems-, stakeholder-, and needs based, rather than oriented simply toward financial returns. Governance leaders, that is, directors, will need significant training and education in areas of sustainability, climate change, social justice and equity, and multiple bottom lines to even begin thinking about making this change toward balance, equity, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Peculiar to MNEs is the debate on whether, on the one hand, to adapt and be responsive to local circumstances, given divergent stakeholder pressures, markets and customer preferences, and cultural differences. Or, on the other hand, whether to standardize across locations to reap economies of scale and scope, and rely on global brands, assuming that buyer behaviors become more homogeneous and markets integrated. This global integration versus local responsiveness, or standardization versus adaptation, has been examined for environmental, social, and ethical issues as well. Within the broad local–global continuum, there is a large variety in norms and stakeholder expectations, that MNEs need to balance: those originating from international agreements, those that are part of a so-called “market morality” (usually part of an industry initiative), and those applicable in home and host countries.

As mentioned above, the social and environmental issues relevant in any context are determined by society which is represented by the various stakeholders of any MNE. Therefore, in order to understand and address sustainability issues in any country, region, or jurisdiction, the SGE has to establish partnerships with multiple stakeholders.

On the other hand, companies are used to operating in fast-paced, constantly shifting, and dynamic environments; therefore they may well be able to “lead” governments and their business coalitions toward necessary change if leaders can be developed inside companies who understand the imperatives that the world is facing.</p>

<p>Stakeholder pressure and norms in emerging countries differ from those in developed countries.

When operating abroad, these MNEs have been confronted with host-country social, ethnic, religious, community, and/or environmental conflicts, with MNEs’ home-country constituents also exerting pressure to accommodate these concerns properly and adhere to similar norms abroad. For MNEs from emerging countries, although their home-country context is highly idiosyncratic, this has been different. Home-country societal pressure has been absent or focused more on the domestic setting and its problems, so reputational effects that might harm their activities abroad have been limited. They seem to have more room for maneuver, given the absence of home-country constituents that worry about their international sustainability behavior; ownership (e.g., by the state, private nationals, or foreign investors) may play a role as well though. If emerging-market MNEs internationalize to developed countries, adapting to stakeholder-mandated requirements may not be easy given unfamiliarity.</p>

However, it is important to look at the rapidly accelerating trend of MNEs from developing countries building global enterprises. Based on this trend and the significantly faster economic development rates of countries such as India, China, and Brazil, this trend will accelerate further and a decade from now, companies from developed countries could well be a minority in a list of the world’s top 100 MNEs. While MNEs from developed countries have more advanced environmental practices primarily due to the negative impacts of climate, water bodies, and habitats of the large quantities of wastes and emissions of harmful substances and chemicals that they generate, these MNEs are struggling to understand how to integrate social equity into their decision-making criteria. Base of pyramid contexts are very alien for these companies and the learning curve is very steep and long. MNEs from developing countries, such as India’s TATA group were founded on the principles of social equity for communities and employees. These MNEs have evolved based on more labor-intensive operational methods and have not developed advanced environmental practices due to a lower negative impact. However, adoption of advanced Western technologies and chemicals and the rapid rate of economic development is creating a looming environmental crisis of gigantic proportions as China has overtaken the US as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.

One is a demand for a more eco- and human-sensitive approach premised on what already exists in many of these locals.

Big problem is the lack of large-scale databases, and primary data collection is very difficult and time-consuming. This may explain the focus on the U.S. and some European countries, and on topics such as corruption and environmental standards (e.g., ISO 14001) for which rankings, adoption rates, or other information can be obtained. Settings where doing research is complex, for cultural, political, linguistic, or security reasons, tend to be avoided, leading to studies characterized by lack of local knowledge and context-rich approaches. Such absence is understandable in terms of a publication strategy because risks are higher from that perspective as well.

There is some empirical work that focuses on a narrow range of environmental practices of MNEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611426481">Christmann &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611426481">Dowell, Hart, &amp; Yeung, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611426481">Nehrt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492611426481">1998</xref>)</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some pioneering more practitioner oriented rather than theoretical articles:</p>

</list>
<p>At best, these articles develop midrange theories. In addition, there are several descriptive case studies. The concept of SGE needs clear definition and theoretical perspectives that explains the logic for becoming a SGE and the factors contributing to success of SGEs.</p>

<title>Waddock</title>
<p>There is a beginning literature on SGE, but it is not necessarily theoretically framed at this point. Most of our theories are quite limited in that they are not systemic in their orientation (see some exceptions in work on sustainability put forward by Hart and other ecologists). Unfortunately, the discipline-based orientation fosters a narrow conception of what needs to be done, whereas the reality is that more holistic, systems-based approaches (e.g., like the one offered originally by Peter Senge in <italic>The Fifth Discipline</italic>, 1990, rev. 2006) are what is needed—but they are not theoretically easy to develop in the narrowly constrained way that theory is conceived today, so are less likely to be academically acceptable than are many more narrowly conceived framings.</p>

<title>Hart</title>
<p>I’ll show my clear bias by saying that I’m still pretty high on the “natural-resource-based view of the firm.” I think we have only scratched the surface in testing and developing this theoretical framework, as I suggest above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section52-1056492611426481">
<title>Kolk</title>
<p>In my view, theoretical frameworks from the field of international business should be used much more, as this is where a large body of knowledge on all aspects related to MNEs have been built up. I have referred to some of this in my answers to earlier questions, and recent articles in special issues of international business/management journals have laid some good foundations for follow-up research. In this context, it is also important to keep in mind that there are hardly truly “global” firms: research has shown that most multinational firms are regional, with the majority of their sales and assets concentrated in one region (e.g., Europe), or two at best, rather than spread across the Triad, let alone covering the “globe,” including the South as a whole. The number of truly global firms is very small. This has clear implications for sustainability issues as well, as I have explained in more detail in a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492611426481">Kolk, 2010b</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section53-1056492611426481">

<p>There is no extant theoretical framework. The multistakeholder, interorganization collaboration and RBV literature offer the greatest promise for future theoretical development.</p>

<p>As noted in the response above, holistic systems approaches like that of Peter Senge’s Fifth Discipline, the Natural Step’s systems constraints, modeling similar to but broader than Michael Porter’s five forces model, Fritjof Capra’s <italic>Web of Life</italic> and <italic>Turning Point</italic>, some of Stuart Hart’s work, and my own <italic>Leading Corporate Citizens</italic>, offer some prospect for framing how we need to understand business going forward.</p>

<sec id="section56-1056492611426481">
<title>Hart</title>
<p>You cannot take it all on simultaneously. I am afraid it is important to take a more focused and targeted approach, especially to empirical works in this domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section57-1056492611426481">
<title>Kolk</title>
<p>Important I think is a clear focus and a good research design. It is impossible to cover everything in a single study, or even a series of studies. So we need to specify what we are talking about exactly, and make sure to have a clear focus in the research undertaken so that studies build on one another and reckon with the complexities of international business.</p>
<p>Thus, a focused research question, for example, on a specific issue and/or sets of companies and/or particular countries/regions, and then selecting a good sample that may allow for subsequent generalization, are good first steps. It is also important to consider what type of data can be collected, and how and where. Especially in view of the difficulties that I mentioned in my response to an earlier question, on the state of the field and data availability problems, this is crucial for not only determining the feasibility of the study but also its added value and the “so what.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section58-1056492611426481">
<title>Sharma</title>
<p>I would suggest that we develop deep explanatory guiding theories first before we jump into research design and methodological issues. Organizational performance, even within a single market context, is also very complex and may result from interactions between the industry structure, internal capabilities, strategic alliances, operational strategies, human resource strategies, emerging external contingencies, changing consumer preferences, etc. This does not prevent researchers from biting off a chunk of the complexity, developing an effective research design, and developing explanations to shed light on a piece of the puzzle. The SGE literature will have to develop one piece of the puzzle at a time and this is an exciting area of research rich with promise and potential, not only for research but also for its potential impact on helping understand how to create a more sustainable world.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a research project that is just beginning under the direction of Maurizio Zollo of Bocconi University called the GOLDEN (Global Organization Learning and Development Network) Project for Sustainability, which attempts to deal with the complexities of system change with a pre–post/intervention design, with participation expected by research centers from around the world. It is research of this scale and scope that will be needed, with systemic approaches that both quantitatively and qualitatively tap into what companies are and might be doing, how what they are doing effects (or does not affect) change, and what the performance and other outcomes are.</p>

<p>We are looking for answers to a range of questions, including how MNEs perform, how this differs for those from different sectors and countries of origin, and how it works out in different host countries. And then for the various dimensions of sustainability—how these interact and influence each other or not; how do MNEs organize this (internally, in their supply chains), and what works best. How do they address the diversity of norms; are there reputational/performance implications; and what role do consumers play in all of this? Dynamics over time, and herd behavior (follow-the-leader type of mechanisms) are also interesting issues to know more about. The interaction between MNEs and stakeholders (including governments), and who influences which firms most, and under which conditions are also important questions. It is also important to pay more attention to “uncharted territory” regarding geographic locations despite the difficulties of doing research there. From a more normative perspective, everybody will be interested in knowing what works best to help solve the crucial problems that we face.</p>

<p>Much bigger and less narrowly constrained questions than we have been dealing with for most of the past 20-plus years will need to be addressed. We need to find ways to ask and then answer the big questions with the “so what?” appendages, to make our work both practical and understandable by other academics and by managers and policy leaders. Questions like How do companies move a sustainability agenda forward? What types of practices and strategies will be successful in a thrivability (or resource constrained) context? How can companies learn to simultaneously compete and cooperate? What economic and social systems will serve the needs of the 21st century? How do we develop “thrivability” that allows human and other creatures to thrive in a way that does not further damage—and even begins to repair the earth? These questions and similar ones oriented toward the future are much harder to answer than questions based on what happened in the past, but the future is calling to us in ways that neither humanity nor academics have faced before. We need to find new ways to answer that call.</p>

<title>Institutional Pressures and Opportunities on the SGE Pathway</title>
<p>MNEs are subject to various heterogeneities emerging from multidimensionalities of financial, economic, social, and environmental issues, and geographic boundaries that they confront in their businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611426481">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1056492611426481">Van Tulder &amp; Kolk, 2001</xref>). MNEs also must conform to different regulative, normative, and cultural requirements associated with the economy, society, and the natural environment of its parent and host nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611426481">Doz &amp; Prahalad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492611426481">Kolk, 2010b</xref>). For example, they not only have to be responsive to global market forces and globally integrate their business practices within their multinational network but also have to simultaneously adjust to the various local sociocultural, economic, and natural environmental climates in which they operate their businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611426481">Rosenzweig &amp; Singh, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, they need to comply with regulations at five distinguished levels—multilateral (like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization), regional (like the North American Free Trade Agreement/European Union), national, subnational, and municipal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1056492611426481">Rugman &amp; Verbeke, 1998</xref>). As such, the scale and scope of MNEs’ business operations is becoming ever more daunting and complex.</p>
<p>Today, MNEs even need to reckon with nontraditional social forces. For example, Waddock points out how global civil societies and activists (e.g., those promoting fair trade and local entrepreneurship, or opposing genetically modified products, child labor, and environmental degradation) have become the driving forces or “sources of legitimation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611426481">Deephouse &amp; Suchman, 2008</xref>, p. 54) of MNEs’ practices. These external stakeholders have been closely scrutinizing the performance of MNEs and questioning and demanding greater corporate accountability from them on environmental, social, and economic fronts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611426481">Dunning &amp; Fortanier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492611426481">Kolk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611426481">Rondinelli, 2007</xref>). They have also been deploying alternate, nongovernmental methods such as media campaign and shareholder activism to punish and curb irresponsible behaviors of MNEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611426481">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492611426481">Lee &amp; Lounsbury, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that legal battles, boycotts, and anticorporate publicity campaigns can negatively affect MNEs’ cash flow, brand image, and reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1056492611426481">Shipp, 1987</xref>). Nike and Coca-Cola are examples of MNEs that have had to invest tremendous amounts of money and other resources to repair their damaged public image from their unsustainable practices, surrounding international labor and water use, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492611426481">Vogel, 2005</xref>). In addition, wrongful practices on socioeconomic and environmental fronts may also carry risks of regulatory penalties and economic sanctions. Recognizing the gravity of potential socioeconomic and environmental damages from unsustainable business practices by MNEs, governments of different nations have been increasing their regulatory standards and enforcement activities.</p>
<p>Thus, as MNEs expand their supply chain and use natural and human resources, locally and globally, their risks of regulatory, social, and economic sanctions dramatically increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492611426481">Hart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611426481">Kolk &amp; Pinkse, 2008</xref>). Larger MNEs that have higher visibility and reputation are subject to even more stringent expectations of environmental, social, and economic responsibility and transparency that they face disproportionately greater risks than smaller firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611426481">Eweje, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1056492611426481">Zyglidopoulous, 2002</xref>). MNEs also face normative pressures from their competitors, who by investing in environmental, social, and economic sustainability efforts, are raising the standards in their industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611426481">Barnett &amp; King, 2008</xref>). Taking note of the multitude of opportunities emerging from sustainable business models, socially responsible corporations and investors are also using sustainability criteria to make their investment and contractual decisions.</p>
<p>Indeed, as both Kolk and Waddock mention, by exhibiting corporate ecological responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611426481">Bansal &amp; Roth, 2000</xref>) or corporate social responsibility, MNEs can reduce their business risks and create new opportunities. For example, using their superior environmental management and relational capabilities, MNEs can discover, evaluate, and exploit economic opportunities that are present in environmentally and socially relevant market failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611426481">Dean &amp; McMullen, 2007</xref>). Sustainable behaviors can result in better relationships with bankers and investors, giving the MNE easy and stable access to capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611426481">Lydenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1056492611426481">Waddock &amp; Graves, 1997</xref>). Sustainable innovations can also be used to improve the brand image and gain first mover advantages in the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492611426481">Hoffman, 2005</xref>), and to attract better employees, earn their goodwill, and retain them over a long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492611426481">Turban &amp; Greening, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As the four panelists emphasize, an MNE pursuing the SGE pathway has the ability to enhance the well-being of its core and fringe stakeholders, in its parent as well as host countries, and in the present and the future. In the process, it can gain greater stakeholder acceptance within its local as well as global communities. Consequently, the MNE will be able to increase its “global sustainable value”—long-term wealth for its shareholders as well as its stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611426481">Hart &amp; Milstein, 2003</xref>). In turn, the increase in global stakeholder value will enhance the MNEs’ chances of achieving sustained competitive advantage.</p>

<sec id="section67-1056492611426481">
<title>Resources and Capabilities for the SGE Pathway</title>
<p>The SGE vision, as Sharma emphasizes, cannot be achieved by an MNE unilaterally—it requires involvement of multiple organizations. In general, any MNE can be considered an “interorganizational network”: a network that is made up of “multinational network” and “external network” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611426481">Ghoshal &amp; Bartlett, 1990</xref>). On one hand, an MNE’s multinational network is its internal network involving relationships among its headquarters and its subsidiaries around the globe. On the other hand, its external network involves relationships with external stakeholders such as suppliers, customers, government, and local communities in various countries. Those external networks may also involve strategic interorganizational relationships like mergers, acquisitions, alliances, and joint ventures with other domestic or international firms within the same industry or from other industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611426481">Nohria &amp; Carlos, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>An MNE aspiring for the SGE status must strive to reduce its negative global environmental, economic, and social footprints in all its internal and external networks and across the entire supply chain from raw material procurement to production and disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492611426481">Laszlo, 2008</xref>). It has to engage in interorganizational and multistakeholder partnerships on sustainable business practices across national borders. The MNE also has to reassure the host governments and various stakeholders of its long-term commitment to stay and contribute to the nations’ sustainable development. It has to offer assistance to enhance the long-term political, economic, and social stability in the host country through its corporate practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611426481">Oetzel et al., 2007</xref>). Citing the example of Grameen Bank, Sharma highlights that an MNE can promote development of microenterprises and simultaneously empower the poor.</p>
<p>Kolk emphasizes that the defining characteristics of an SGE are not just what the firm does but also how it carries out those activities. She posits that MNEs on an SGE pathway must be more open in their decision-making process and embody transparency and accountability. Hart and Waddock contend that full-scale top-down approach to implement sustainable business practices within and across its networks in different nations may not be feasible.Instead, they propose an entrepreneurial approach, based on Schumpeterian vision of creative destruction, and small-scale, local-level innovations. The SC Johnson Company demonstrated such an approach when it started a business venture in collaboration with few young entrepreneurs in Nairobi. The venture “Community Cleaning Services” aimed at mutual value creation for the company and the local entrepreneurs as well as the community. The venture uses SC Johnson’s products while offering toilet cleaning services to multiple households that share toilets in poor neighborhoods of Nairobi. SC Johnson has also been offering awareness programs on malaria and dengue prevention within South African and Indian communities. These collaborations create mutual value and offer win–win opportunities for both the MNE and its local stakeholders, including those at the base of the pyramid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611426481">Peredo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Sharma and Waddock stress that creation of SGE is dependent on transformational leadership of the MNE. Individuals who recognize that they have a moral and momentous responsibility to simultaneously create a sustainable corporation and sustainable world would be required to lead the MNEs treading the SGE pathway. They would have to radically realign the organizational processes and structures of their organization that satisfies the needs of the entire spectrum of the corporation’s stakeholders. Those individuals would also have the courage to confront complexities emerging from multiple dimensions of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. They would have to develop the tenacity to effectively resolve tensions arising from the various institutional heterogeneities that their organization might confront because of its commitment to sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1056492611426481">Sweet, Roome, &amp; Sweet, 2003</xref>). In order to achieve greater profits and efficiency and minimize their ecological footprint, MNEs would have to encourage creativity and imagination, and investments in “disruptive” social and technological innovations, clean and more sustainable means of operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611426481">Hart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611426481">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>). The MNE leaders would also have to embrace inclusive forms of capitalism that address needs of the poor, build the poors’ capacity, and offer them opportunities to overcome their poverty through creative market-based solutions. Recent interview of five sustainability leaders in entertainment industry by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611426481">Kurland and Zell (2010)</xref> attest the importance of personal values, commitment, and vision of leaders in moving a large firm on the road to sustainability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section68-1056492611426481">
<title>Roadblocks on the SGE Pathway</title>
<p>Despite the enormous opportunities that sustainable development principles can offer to MNEs, one needs to recognize that the SGE pathway is laden with challenges. When Philips Lighting Company invented low-mercury fluorescent lamps called ALTO in 1995, it was the only product that satisfied Environmental Protection Agency’s stringent toxic disposal rule. The innovation and environmental leadership, however, did not translate to competitive advantage for Philips. Instead of pursuing similar innovations, its competitors lobbied the Congress to gain conditional exclusion from the disposal rule. In the end, Philips had to share the technology with its competitors to achieve its environmental objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611426481">Baron, 2006</xref>.).</p>
<p>As such, current cultural and regulatory institutional structures, and market incentives may possibly present disadvantages for MNEs on the SGE pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611426481">Lee, 2008</xref>). There are several arguments to support this claim. First, there is no widespread social consensus on what is sustainable. The meaning of sustainability is socially constructed and constantly evolving and being molded according to different social, economic, and environmental contexts in which a firm operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611426481">Carolan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492611426481">Niven, 2005</xref>). Second, achieving high standards of sustainable performance across the entire scale and scope of any MNE’s business performance may not be fully possible. Sharma also doubts if any MNE can “be truly sustainable from cradle to grave.” Third, extant regulatory institutions primarily follow command and control mechanisms and are mostly directed toward minimizing violation of regulations. As there is yet to be a mature market for virtue as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492611426481">Vogel (2005)</xref> argues, MNEs on the SGE pathway may not even earn any direct financial rewards from the government for being “proactive” toward sustainable development. Fourth, there exist no mandatory regulations on sustainable development that legally bind all nations of the world. There are no globally accepted legal criteria on which MNEs’ unsustainable performance can be reviewed and sanctioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492611426481">Taylor, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Kolk seems doubtful whether any MNE can ever achieve the SGE status. She clarifies that an MNE may exhibit strong attributes of sustainable business performance in one strategic area of its operations or in one country. However, due to the heterogeneities and complexities in regulations, norms, or cultures, the same MNE may be ineffective in developing its capabilities on other facets of sustainable development and/or in other countries. MNE’s interorganizational collaborations for sustainability, both within its internal as well as external works, may also not be perfect. Collaborations for sustainability are laden with many challenges because of ideological, organizational mission-based or national differences on sustainability among the partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1056492611426481">Sharma &amp; Kearins, 2011</xref>). Gaining local legitimacy with the collaborators as well as with the community is also difficult to achieve, as Sharma argues.</p>
<p>In fact, some scholars bluntly disapprove corporations’ involvement in sustainable development governance. For example, Milton Friedman repeatedly argued that corporations’ primary responsibility is to generate profits for its shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611426481">Friedman, 1962</xref>). According to Karnani, it is the responsibility of the state, not corporations, to improve the well-being of communities, including the lives of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611426481">Karnani, 2011</xref>). He argues that the popular management slogan of “doing well by doing good” is propagating a myth than a reality. It is not possible for an MNE to offer socially virtuous product to the poor, without compromising on its profits. MNE activities aimed for the bottom of the pyramid are “either profitable but not socially beneficial, or socially virtuous but not profitable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611426481">Garrett &amp; Karnani, 2010</xref>, p. 29).</p>
<p>Indeed, investments in environment-friendly technologies and creating distribution networks that reach rural households and address needs of poor consumers can be resource intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611426481">Bansal, 2002</xref>). Moreover, MNEs are often unfamiliar with the host country markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611426481">Garrett &amp; Karnani, 2010</xref>). Inadequate organizational knowledge and expertise, and lack of broader cultural capacity to understand and develop locally sensitive products and processes, can further induce delays, inefficiencies, and losses. Lack of clarity around decisions related to whether and when home or host country norms on sustainable behavior have to be followed can lead to confusions in the MNE’s networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611426481">Kolk, 2010a</xref>).</p>

<title>Future Directions for SGE Research</title>
<p>While the above ideological debates favoring and opposing the role of MNEs in sustainable development will most likely continue into the future, we need to creatively exploit various strands of the debates to carve out new understanding on SGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611426481">Mars &amp; Lounsbury, 2009</xref>). The four panelists believe that we need more research that investigates the business threats and opportunities for MNEs operating under the context of (un)sustainable development. They note that the current SGE research is still nascent and theoretically fragmented. To be sure, scholars have investigated social and environmental performance of MNEs by drawing on a range of different theoretical approaches, including stakeholder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1056492611426481">London &amp; Hart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611426481">Radin &amp; Calkins, 2006</xref>), value-belief-norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611426481">Andersson, Shivarajan, &amp; Blau, 2005</xref>), resource-based view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1056492611426481">Strike, Gao, &amp; Bansal, 2006</xref>), institutional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611426481">Christmann &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>), international management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611426481">Christman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611426481">Kolk &amp; Pinkse, 2008</xref>), or a combination of strategic and institutional approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611426481">Husted &amp; Allen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, all four panelists agree that we still have a long way to go. Hart and Sharma point out that a majority of scholars in the field have primarily studied pollution prevention and eco-efficiency measures of firms. Kolk raises concerns around the lack of studies on MNEs in the poorest countries. Although some pioneering research on SGE has emerged in recent years, Waddock and Sharma worry that most of those works are too practitioner oriented. The four panelists also point out that scholars have primarily focused on the past practices of MNEs. They invite scholars to expand their focus beyond “hypothesis testing” and initiate SGE research that is future oriented. Hart suggests that while taking into account valuable insights from the past, “future-creative research” that imaginatively explores and recommends “sustainable enterprise practices of tomorrow” is needed.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are numerous gaps in the field. But, it is also important to recognize that initiating research on SGEs can be very challenging and set realistic research expectations. All four scholars point out that there is no MNE that can be categorized as an SGE today, and therefore, one cannot practically study an SGE to develop a holistic theoretical model. Moreover, there is no one overarching theory that can enable scholars to investigate all the environmental, social, and economic performance dimensions of an MNE’s performance in both developed- and developing-country contexts. Kolk cautions the use of term <italic>global</italic> in this kind of research. She notes that there are hardly any MNEs that are truly global. Kolk also points out that there are no reliable, large-scale, and longitudinal data sets that we can use to analyze past practices of MNEs and test a wide range of theoretical hypotheses along financial, economic, social, and environmental sustainability dimensions (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611426481">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611426481">Lee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The above limitations, however, can be addressed to some extent, opine the four panelists. For example, Hart, Sharma, and Kolk encourage scholars to initiate small-scale studies—for example, using sustainability management theory like the “natural-resource-based view of the firm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492611426481">Hart, 1995</xref>)—that can help investigate various elements of sustainability performance of MNEs. Waddock takes a slightly different approach and suggests using “holistic, systems-based approaches,” such as those adopted by Peter Senge or Fritjof Capra. Holistic system approaches may help to uncover the interdependencies between an MNE and its network of organizations and the various contexts of its engagement as that MNE attempts to become an SGE. Sharma advises that targeted research that bites off a chunk of the MNE’s complexity can be helpful in generating in-depth knowledge of how a specific sustainability issue confronting an MNE can be addressed in the broader organizational or national context. Kolk recommends that the closest methodological approximation to studying an SGE may be investigating sustainability performance of an MNE along a triad or a geographic region (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611426481">Rugman &amp; Oh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The four panelists also provoke us to question our taken-for-granted assumptions on business–society relationships. Hart advocates the need for scholars to challenge the basic assumptions of the existing growth paradigm on which modern capitalism is based. Rather than accepting the status quo of continued expansion of unsustainable industries, he offers “creative destruction” and “beyond greening” as a new raison d’etre for businesses. On a similar vein, Waddock believes that a sustainable enterprise is one that is not predicated on the assumption of continued growth but on societal well-being and its ability to “thrive” using limited resources.</p>
<p>Waddock’s expression “The future is calling to us in ways that neither humanity nor academics have faced before. We need to find new ways to answer that call” is a deep reminder of the many challenges that we confront. Hart challenges us to accept that SGE is “simply an imperative”—an imperative for MNEs to proactively act as agents of global sustainable development. This imperative also comes with enormous opportunities for academics. Scholars can proactively explore problem areas and develop new lines of futuristic research: research that influences MNEs’ understandings of sustainable business models and help them achieve the status of an SGE and research that helps to create a sustainable world for current and future generations of living beings in our planet. This article is a small step in that direction.</p>
