<p>Andrei Sakharov was undoubtedly one of the most interesting and inspiring individuals of the late Soviet period. After spending the 1950s and much of the 1960s designing thermo-nuclear weapons for the Soviet regime, Sakharov grew increasingly disillusioned with the system’s failings and gradually became one of the loudest voices defending human rights in the USSR. He attracted huge global support and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, but he also spent much of the Brezhnev era being hounded by the KGB, pilloried in the Soviet media and waseventually exiled from Moscow to the closed city of Gorky in 1980. Then, in the mid-1980s, Sakharov was summoned back to Moscow by Mikhail Gorbachev and again played a prominent role in pushing for further liberalization of the Soviet system until his death in 1989.</p>
<p>As perhaps the most famous of all Soviet dissidents, and a celebrated physicist to boot, Sakharov has already generated a considerable body of literature. He left lengthy memoirs, wrote pamphlets, articles, speeches and petitions, and has been the subject of well-received biographies by the likes of Richard Lourie and Gennady Gorelik, as well as a volume of KGB materials, compiled by Joshua Rubenstein and Alexander Gribanov. Jay Bergman’s work, however, is presented as an intellectual biography, examining the evolution of Sakharov’s political beliefs, his dissident activity and his impact on the USSR and the wider world. These are, of course, prominent themes in all works on Andrei Sakharov, but Bergman has produced a worthwhile addition to the existing material.</p>
<p>From the outset the author presents Sakharov as the product of values and ideals from a bygone age: a descendant of the pre-revolutionary liberal intelligentsia. Like many other citizens, Sakharov’s belief in the Soviet regime, and ultimately in socialism more widely, waned throughout the post-Stalin era. Bergman makes a particularly good job of elucidating Sakharov’s belief in the eventual convergence of capitalism and socialism, where the positive aspects of both systems would combine, and of his argument that the domestic observance of human rights is a key factor in global stability. Chapter 15, which sets forth the philosophical debates and divisions between Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, is another of the outstanding aspects of the book. Bergman has clearly taken pains to understand the nature of Sakharov’s scientific work, and for the most part is able to convey key facets of it in layman’s terms.</p>
<p>Among the most fascinating aspects of <italic>Meeting the Demands of Reason</italic> are the snapshots that it presents of the post-Stalin USSR, and of the political and scientific elite in particular. For example, it has long been known that the authorities’ reliance on top-level scientists meant that those few individuals had to be granted a degree of autonomy that existed nowhere else in society, yet Bergman provides numerous concrete instances that help to fill out this picture. We learn that the physicists at Arzamas-16, the secret installation where Sakharov worked for 18 years, freely read banned literature such as George Orwell’s <italic>1984</italic> and talked openly about highly controversial issues, like the purges of the 1930s. Sakharov himself had a direct line to the very highest members of the political leadership and was even able to use his influence to protect others who had fallen into disfavour or been arrested. Details such as these make a valuable contribution to our understanding of the complex relationship between state and society in the USSR once mass terror had been abandoned.</p>
<p>Aside from interviews with Sakharov’s family and friends, the sources on which Bergman draws are, for the most part, ones that have been available for some time, meaning that the reader is mostly presented with re-evaluations, rather than fresh revelations. Sakharov’s own memoirs are cited particularly frequently and not always with consideration of their strengths and weaknesses as a historical source. What one occasionally encounters, therefore, is an overly simplistic picture of good (Sakharov and the West) against bad (the Soviet state, the unresponsive Soviet public and even fellow dissidents who disagreed with Sakharov). Similarly, while there is unquestionably a great deal to be celebrated about Andrei Sakharov, the author is entirely unequivocal in his admiration for his subject and at times shows a tendency to overplay the significance of Sakharov’s role in Soviet history, and he largely shies away from less positive aspects of his life, such as his enduring estrangement from the children of his first marriage.</p>
<p>While <italic>Meeting the Demands of Reason</italic> does not make previous works on Sakharov obsolete, it does have considerable strengths. The balance of coverage between Sakharov’s deeply intertwined personal, professional and political lives is perhaps the best available so far, as is the coverage of his role in <italic>perestroika</italic> during the late 1980s and the moving public response to his sudden death in December 1989. Bergman has not dramatically shifted the literary landscape on Andrei Sakharov, but has produced a well-researched and well-written work that stands well among its rivals.</p>
