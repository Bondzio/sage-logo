<p>The title of the note may sound provocative but the note is not. The proposed discussion forum in the journal intends to begin a sincere conversation on themes related to teaching and learning political science in India and this introductory note to the section thus tries to simply engage in a stock checking exercise to flag off the issues and challenges in the field.</p>
<p>The challenges are far too many since the field of discussion is dotted with a lot of absences. Many of these absences are about the systemic flaws and about policy inadequacies in the arena of higher education in India and therefore may be beyond the immediate scope of this note. And yet, these larger inadequacies mark both, an essential backdrop and an important arena for long term interventions by academic practitioners. The other kind of absence that again mainly results from a disjointed policy discourse is a criminal neglect of pedagogic issues in Indian educational sphere. The teacher training programmes in the country are in a pathetic state and the structuring of academic discipline of education is skewed. That creates a serious impediment to healthy discussions on teaching learning activities. The situation worsens as every year thousands of ill equipped educationists enter the job market. The third lack is about public recognition of the importance and role of social sciences. The educational system in India is unfairly tilted in favour of the natural and the ‘applied’ sciences and considers doing social sciences as a worthless exercise.</p>
<p>In the context of all these more general challenges perhaps the most immediate concern for the current conversation is a near complete absence of discussion on pedagogic issues within the realms of Indian political science. It is a near complete absence that was only occasionally stirred by a few efforts in the past. In the post emergency context, the Delhi Political Science Association launched a journal called <italic>Teaching Politics</italic> that continued throughout the 1980s. That journal was an ambitious attempt on the part of political science teachers to ‘promote a grass root level movement for third world orientation in the study of political science’ (<italic>Teaching Politics</italic>, 1978). The journal was not entirely devoted to pedagogic issues but provided an important platform for these discussions along with its publication of research based articles. Around the same time, a few political scientists led by the Political Science department at MS University Vadodra came up with a detailed plan of curricular development in Indian political science. More recently, the NCERT textbooks of Political Science published during 2006–2007 must be seen as yet another important intervention of conscientious political scientists in re-imagining the discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2321023013482790">1</xref></sup>The NCERT textbooks tried to develop a new understanding of politics for school children and also tried to free them from the ‘passive learning’ processes at least to a certain extent. All these efforts were remarkable but rare and thus only underline the need to institutionalize a more routine conversation on issues of teaching/learning political science in general and Indian politics in particular. In this section of the journal, we welcome short notes how we can take such initiatives forward.</p>
<p>Pedagogic discussions in political science cannot take place without a reference to the overall structuring of political science both as an academic discipline and as an intellectual pursuit. The connection between these two aspects of Indian political science was discussed in detail by Ghanshyam Shah in one of his public lectures more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482790">Shah, 2001</xref>). He states how, as a discipline, political science in India has remained reformist at the best and status quoist at the worst for a long time since its arrival. Under the oft quoted influence of the colonial British, American behavioural and the post-second world war liberal political/structural functional frameworks political science in India mainly focused on the formal aspects of institutional arrangements and of people’s political participation and therefore remained descriptive and dull. The contentious dynamics of political processes and the urge to explain and analyze the contestations were never properly articulated in the mainstream political science. The skew was reflected in the research agenda as well as in political science curriculum.</p>
<p>With the maturing of India’s democracy, research in India’s political science has definitely acquired several new dimensions and can be said to be at its most vibrant stage currently. The attempts to contextualize the Indian democratic experience without simply labelling it as unique and the enquiries into Indian traditions of thought without dichotomizing them into binaries have all contributed towards a new understanding of social and political reality in India. The vibrancy is severely compromised at three levels though. First, most of the new research takes place outside the disciplinary and institutional boundaries of political science. Second, it happens mostly around the metropolitan research centres leaving out the vast academic hinterlands untouched. And third, there is still a profound disconnect between research and curriculum in political science.</p>
<p>The idea that research and training in a discipline always complement each other seems to be missing and worse still there are no institutional mechanisms in place where these complementarities can be discussed. Failing this, the design of courses for both undergraduate and the post graduate students remains lopsided. This is true of courses on political theory as well as on political processes. Theory is often equated with thought of individual thinkers which finally takes the form of their biographies. Most of the courses in this area still entertain the dichotomy of the east and the west and are not aware of the changing conceptualizations of the world today. Similarly, the courses in other areas like international relations and comparative politics fail to challenge conventional wisdom and are also not very keen to use the Indian case as a vantage point to understand and to relate to the conceptual themes in their respective sub disciplinary fields. Courses on Indian politics are heavily biased towards explaining institutional mechanisms and fail to enthuse students for an informed, sympathetic and yet critical reading of the democratic politics in the country.</p>
<p>There are two related issues regarding the internal structuring of the discipline of political science and of its disciplinary boundaries. Often there is an internal imbalance in the structuring of the sub fields in political science. These sub disciplines also often do not speak to each other and this lack of conversation adds to the internal imbalances. Political theory looks down upon the processual studies. The area of international relations on the other hand claims to have its own, distinct version of theory. The area of public administration may be seen as a case of disciplinary chaos. Many Indian universities treat it as a sub field of the discipline of political science, whereas, many others run a full-fledged degree course in public administration. The University Grants Commission (UGC) adds its own share to this confusion as it recognizes public administration as a separate discipline for National Eligibility Test (NET) for teachers and researchers and at the same time considers candidates clearing NET in public administration as on par with those with political science. The ambiguous status of public administration as a sub discipline of political science does not merely create technical hurdles. It reinforces the conventional understanding of politics as mainly about formal institutional structures. Besides, bulk of the public administration taught in Indian universities is outdated in content and does not sensitize students regarding the new frameworks of governance, policy discourses and, most importantly, regarding the politics-policy interface.</p>
<p>In other words, a lot needs to be done in terms of the ‘what’ of politics that is taught in the Indian universities. It requires a substantial redesigning of syllabi with a critical awareness of the recent theoretical advances in the field as well as of the indigenous context in which politics is discussed in the classroom. The UGC, as an apex body in the field of education, has not contributed to this exercise in any major way so far. Long back the UGC came up with the idea of a model curriculum for each discipline and expected the universities to use it in framing their courses. Given the uneven nature of the existing university system the idea of a model curriculum may be seen as a useful step although it compromises with the idea of framing context specific syllabi. However, at least as far as political science syllabus is concerned the model curriculum developed by the UGC can not be exactly seen as very useful. It is for two reasons—one, this model curriculum was prepared in 2003 and has not been revisited since then. Second, the model curriculum does not much integrate in it the new insights in the field but instead tries to accommodate them only at a cosmetic level. And thus, therefore, in every course of the model curriculum one finds token inclusion of women in the last topic as an appendage rather than including the issues of gender inequality and of feminist theorizations in the disciplinary imagining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482790">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UGC’s role in teacher recruitment also has important implications for the quality of teaching in political science. However, so far the UGC’s policies in this field have been patchy and are devoid of any long term plan towards creating a critical mass of good educators. The NET of the UGC attempts to simultaneously assess teaching and research orientations of the aspiring teachers and yet in practice fails to gauge both because of its internal inconsistencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482790">Deshpande, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2321023013482790">2011</xref>). UGC’s norms regarding recruitment and promotions of teachers change every now and then and lead to a chaotic situation in terms of setting up teaching and research priorities for the teachers. These issues have serious implications for the overall structuring of the higher educational system. But more specifically they seriously hamper the quality of teaching especially in social sciences. In the absence of efficient mechanisms of teacher recruitment and of their effective in-service training the learning process in Indian classrooms largely remains passive and dull.</p>
<p>Active and intense student–teacher interaction remains a very important aspect, especially of social science training, since the learning in social sciences is mainly about developing a critical perspective. This makes it all the more urgent that the community of political science teachers actively intervenes in this dull scenario at least at two levels. First, it must establish forums where a dialogue on teaching process may begin and would eventually get institutionalized. The teaching learning conferences organized by the American Political Science Association (APSA) can be seen as a good example of one such forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2321023013482790">Mealy, 2012</xref>, pp. 521–540). Second, the community should also engage itself in the production of quality textbooks for political science students.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are only a few good textbooks of political science available in the Indian market and they cover only select subfields of the discipline. There is an urgent requirement to create a large pool of useful, cutting edge and student-friendly reading material for Indian students of political science. These textbooks can lead to effective reimagining of the discipline of political science, can at least partially compensate for the absence of motivated teachers and can also prove to be great equalizers in the otherwise unequal Indian system of education. If the NCERT project mentioned earlier marked a good beginning towards this we need many more such efforts at the undergraduate and post graduate levels.</p>
<p>More importantly, the need is to produce political science textbooks in Indian languages. This is not only about translating books from English. At a more profound level, the issue is about creating and strengthening multiple, context specific discourses of political science at the regional level. And in that sense the issue is also about recognizing the fast changing face of political science classrooms in India. Over the past few decades, political science classrooms in particular and those of social sciences and humanities in general have become diverse in nature. Many of these students come from the socially and economically marginal sections of the society and are first generation entrants in the field of higher education. Although English remains the official medium of instruction in most of the Indian universities, the classroom teaching is mostly bilingual and a majority of students take up exams in regional languages. The existing channels of knowledge production and dissemination do not seem to acknowledge this reality and therefore there is a dearth of good quality reading material in Indian languages.</p>
<p>The changing profile of the classrooms poses another important question with regard to the pedagogic practices in Indian political science. It is a question about the exact nature of outcome of the whole exercise of teaching and learning political science. Every year a few thousand students acquire degrees in political science from a few hundred Indian universities. Why do these students offer political science for their studies? What happens to them after they exit the system with a degree? What is the exact use of their political science degrees in the existing job market? And what kind of orientations do they get from their formal learning of the discipline as they enter the public realm as politically active citizens? These are some of the crucial, intriguing and yet completely neglected questions that the community of political science teachers need to attend on an urgent basis. At a more practical level, collective reflections on these questions may help us design a few ‘intelligent’ courses in political science that would make our students confident entrants in the job market. The current educational system is often criticized as dishing out only job-oriented education and losing sight of the larger visions of attainment of knowledge. However, for social sciences in general and for political science in particular, the reality is even more complicated and dire. The current state of training in social sciences does not help students much in engaging conscientiously in the social realm nor does it provide them with adequate and proper skills for the new kind of jobs emerging in the social sector—in the voluntary sector, media, market research agencies, research institutes etc. Framing of new kind of courses that would help our students in entering these fields of operations with a critical social vision is therefore an urgent necessity. But more seriously, these questions would take us a long way in reimagining the teaching/learning agenda of the discipline.</p>
<p>The set of issues discussed above may sound too daunting and the agenda of the conversation too ambitious. As stated initially, many of these issues are part of the overall systemic pathologies and may remain unresolved for a long time. Perhaps it is also a part of the predicament of a post colonial society that needs to simultaneously address and resolve several tricky issues before it. While being aware of these larger constraints the proposed discussion forum in this journal hopes to widen the existing spaces and open up new spaces of active conversation and intervention on the part of political science community. We hope that this section in <italic>SIP</italic> will provide a useful platform for discussions pertaining to pedagogic issues in political science but more particularly about the teaching and learning processes in political science in India—on the structuring of courses and syllabi, on the textbooks and reading material, on the institutional infrastructure and policies etc. that would contribute in the long run towards reimagining the discipline of political science in India.</p>
