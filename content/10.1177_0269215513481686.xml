<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enhanced recovery programmes have been developed to reduce length of hospital stay after arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513481686">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513481686"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513481686">3</xref></sup> However, recent evidence suggests that stay can be shortened without additional peri-operative intervention. In primary hip arthroplasty patients six weeks postoperatively, patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life, mental state and physical function, were all at least as good in a unit with accelerated discharge as in two units with longer stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> For shorter stay to be adopted more widely it needs to be shown to be acceptable to patients, whose evaluations of care have become important in health policy. The aim of this study was to compare patients’ evaluation of hip arthroplasty between a unit with accelerated discharge and two comparison units representing different models of care in the UK. One was a conventional surgical unit; the other was a recently established specialised orthopaedic surgery treatment centre.</p>
<p>Currently-available questionnaires that assess patients’ evaluation of arthroplasty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513481686">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513481686"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513481686">7</xref></sup> have several limitations. They emphasise the immediate peri-operative period in hospital whereas recovery continues after discharge. They also emphasise interpersonal aspects of care, such as staff responsiveness or information-giving; functional recovery and longer-term outcomes have been relatively neglected. Whereas one questionnaire was shaped by focus group discussions with patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513481686">6</xref></sup> none have been based on the prior systematic qualitative analysis of patient perspectives, which can ensure that a questionnaire measures what matters to patients rather than what experts think matters.</p>
<p>We therefore developed a psychometrically robust and clinically specific self-report questionnaire to quantify patients’ evaluation of this procedure six weeks postoperatively, when they had a perspective on the totality of their hospital care and subsequent recovery. Using a non-inferiority design, we tested the prediction that patients’ evaluation in the unit with accelerated discharge would be unimpaired by comparison with the other sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215513481686">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The three study centres deliver high volumes of hip and knee arthroplasties (exceeding 2000 annually) to National Health Service patients in their – predominantly urban – geographical areas. One (Belfast) was chosen because of its rapid discharge policy, developed over the previous decade by one author (DB). The comparison centres represented conventional perioperative management in a large regional centre (Liverpool) and a service delivery model, relatively new to the UK, whereby a specialised orthopaedic surgery treatment centre provides elective arthroplasty for a large population, replacing five local surgical units (South-West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre).</p>
<p>After ethical committee approval (ref 05/Q1505/78) consecutive patients attending preoperative assessment clinics for unilateral primary hip arthroplasty by participating surgeons over 12 months from July 2006 were invited by a practitioner to participate. Those who agreed saw the researcher who explained the study, gained informed written consent and arranged to meet the patient when attending for six-week follow-up. We previously reported on recovery of physical function in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> To increase the sample at Liverpool, where fewer patients were available, we recruited additional consecutive patients in hospital two to five days postoperatively, whom we had not been able to approach preoperatively because they attended for preoperative assessment before the study began (these patients were not included in our report of recovery of physical function because they did not provide baseline information). Patients were then asked, by the same researcher who had recruited them, to complete the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire (see below) at six-week follow-up. Patients were also asked to complete three additional questionnaires in order to provide convergent and divergent validation of the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire. To indicate hip function, patients completed the 12-item Oxford Hip Score (OHS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513481686">9</xref></sup> To indicate quality of life, patients completed the Euroqol 5D (EQ5D-Index) on which five items measure mobility, self-care, performance of normal activities, pain and emotional state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513481686">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513481686">11</xref></sup> An overall self-evaluation of health was provided by the EuroQol 5D visual analogue scale (Euro Qol VAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513481686">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical management is described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> Briefly, Belfast patients were operated on in the lateral position using a posterior approach, and received a cementless Corail<sup>®</sup>Total Hip System and Pinnacle™ acetabular cup system prosthesis (dePuy Orthopaedics). Spinal analgesia with sedation was used intra-operatively and also provided postoperative analgesia. Liverpool patients were operated on in the supine position using a lateral approach, and received a cemented Charnley<sup>®</sup> Total Hip System prosthesis (dePuy Orthopaedics) under standardised general anaesthesia, with postoperative pain relief provided by patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. South-West London Orthopaedic Centre patients were operated on in the lateral position using a posterior approach and a variety of mainly cementless prostheses were used. Epidural or spinal analgesia with sedation was used for anaesthesia. Patient-controlled analgesia was not routinely provided after surgery. Postoperatively, Belfast patients were admitted to a high-dependency unit for one night, Liverpool patients were admitted directly to a general orthopaedic ward and South-West London Orthopaedic Centre patients were admitted to a postanaesthesia care unit or high-dependency unit for one night. Postoperative physiotherapy was provided in each centre until discharge, but no physiotherapy or occupational therapy was provided routinely after discharge. Belfast patients were reviewed by telephone five days after discharge.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269215513481686">
<title>Development and validation of the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire</title>
<p>To ensure content validity of the measurement of patients’ evaluation, questionnaire items had to reflect how patients normally think about their experience of arthroplasty. We therefore wrote items to reflect recurring experiences described by 35 hip arthroplasty patients from two of the study units and previously analysed qualitatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513481686">12</xref></sup> This produced 67 items concerning stages from preparation before surgery to recovery after leaving hospital. After pilot testing with further patients across all sites, ambiguous or redundant items were removed or clarified, leading to a final list of 62 items. To avoid the response set of acquiescence, each item was written as a bipolar item and given a five-point scale placed between the two poles (completely agree, partly agree, uncertain, partly agree, completely agree; scored 0–4). The positive evaluative pole was randomly on the left or right across the questionnaire to minimise positional response bias.</p>
<p>After screening of item scores for skewness and multicollinearity, principal components analysis was applied to the correlation matrix formed by the remaining items. This method, widely used in questionnaire development, identifies a small number of underlying dimensions (called ‘components’) that explain much of the variability in item scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513481686">13</xref></sup> These components are independent; i.e. how positive patients are on one is unrelated to how positive or negative they are on another. The items that are most associated with those components can be used to construct scales to measure each component of a patients’ evaluation. The number of components retained for Varimax rotation was chosen with the aid of a scree test. The association of each item with each component is indicated by the respective ‘loading’, which can vary from 0 to 1. The criterion for significant loading was 0.60. We formed scales to measure each component by summing scores for items loading on the relevant component (after reversing scores for items with negative loadings). Internal consistency of the scales was measured by Cronbach’s alpha; values exceeding 0.7 demonstrate adequate reliability. Because scores on each Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire scale were, as is typical when measuring patient evaluations of care, highly skewed, values corresponding to completely positive evaluation were recoded to 0, all others being recoded to 1. A score of 1 on a scale therefore indicates that the patient perceived one or more problems in the aspect of care measured by that scale. To assess convergent and divergent validity, we used Spearman rank-order correlations to test whether each evaluation scale was associated with OHS, EQ5D-Index and EQ-VAS.</p>

<sec id="section10-0269215513481686">
<title>Comparison of the centres</title>
<p>After confirming that postoperative stay was shorter in Belfast than in the comparison sites (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>), we compared patients’ responses on each of the two binary scales that emerged from the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire (see below) between the three sites. We calculated odds ratios and 90% two-sided confidence intervals comparing numbers of patients reporting poor experience of care on each scale in Belfast with each comparison site in turn, so that the null hypothesis of inferiority would be rejected at a 5% significance level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513481686">14</xref></sup> The margin of equivalence for testing non-inferiority (δ<sub>OR</sub>) was set at 0.55, corresponding to a maximum difference in proportions, depending on the proportion with problems in the comparison sites, of 0.15.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513481686">15</xref></sup> Our null hypothesis was that patients’ experience in Belfast was inferior to each comparison site (the null hypothesis of difference rather than no difference arising from our non-inferiority design).</p>

<title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>Of 318 patients whom we asked for consent at Belfast, 316 consented, all of whom received surgery as planned and all of whom completed postoperative assessment. Of 177 approached at Liverpool, 160 consented of whom 135 received surgery as planned within the study period, one dying postoperatively; 125 completed postoperative assessment. Of 145 approached at South-West London Orthopaedic Centre, 141 consented, 125 received surgery as planned and 119 completed postoperative assessment. Age and gender of the patients studied were similar in the three centres (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215513481686">Table 1</xref>). Nearly all patients (97%) were discharged to their usual home, 1% were discharged to a carer’s home and 2% to rehabilitation facilities. All units differed from each other in duration of postoperative stay (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which was shortest in Belfast and longest in Liverpool (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215513481686">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Development and validation of the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire</title>
<p>Screening of responses led to discarding 16 items: three were too highly skewed (<underline>&gt;</underline>10% at one scale point); 12 had no correlation exceeding 0.3 with any other item and were therefore unsuitable for principal components analysis; one had a high correlation (<underline>&gt;</underline> 0.70) with another item and was therefore regarded as synonymous. Principal components analysis was applied to the remaining 46 items (Appendix 1, available online). Responses are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215513481686">Table 2</xref>. A scree test indicated two components, accounting for 29% of the variance across all the items, and describing two distinct aspects of patients’ evaluation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215513481686">Table 2</xref>). One, labelled ‘Recovery Problems’, described patients’ perceptions of difficulties with recovery, including problems with comfort and mobility. The other, labelled ‘Care Problems’ described their experience of problems with care by staff. Seven and five items loaded on Recovery Problems and Care Problems, respectively. Scores on these items were summed (after reversing scores for items with negative loadings) to form scales to measure these components of patients’ evaluation and to compare the centres. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for each scale exceeded 0.70, demonstrating adequate reliability. Each scale correlated significantly with the measures of hip function and quality of life, but correlations with Care Problems were modest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215513481686">Table 3</xref>). For both Recovery Problems and Care Problems, we transformed scores to binary variables distinguishing those patients who identified one or more problems from those who identified none; 71 (13%) and 310 (55%) patients scoring zero for Recovery Problems and Care Problems, respectively. That is, 87% of patients identified one or more respect in which physical recovery felt problematic, and 45% identified one or more respect in which staff care was problematic.</p>

<title>Comparison of the three centres</title>
<p>We compared the three sites on the two binary scales of the Experience of Hip Arthroplasty Questionnaire: Recovery Problems and Care Problems. Proportions of patients reporting problems on each scale in Belfast and the comparison sites are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513481686">Table 4</xref>, and the comparison of Belfast with other centres is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513481686">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215513481686">Figure 1</xref>. For Recovery Problems, the confidence interval for comparison with South-West London Orthopaedic Centre approached the margin of equivalence, δ<sub>OR</sub>, of 0.55, whereas the comparison with Liverpool clearly did not approach it. Therefore, the hypothesis of inferiority in Belfast was rejected for this outcome. For Care Problems, the confidence intervals were all clearly above δ<sub>OR</sub>, and the hypothesis of inferiority in Belfast is therefore clearly rejected for this outcome also. Indeed, rather than inferiority, the findings suggested less experience of Care Problems in Belfast.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a questionnaire developed specifically to assess the totality of patients’ experience of hip arthroplasty, we showed convincingly that patients treated in a unit with median stay of three days were just as positive about their experience as were those treated in units with median stay of five or six days. Indeed, our data suggest that accelerated discharge can be associated with a more positive experience, particularly in relation to care given by staff.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. The questionnaire is specific to hip arthroplasty. Detailed qualitative study of patients’ accounts of other procedures would be necessary before it can be adapted for use beyond hip arthroplasty. We measured patients’ evaluation only at six weeks, although some aspects of quality of life continue to improve to six months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513481686">16</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our design encompassed the totality of patients’ experience from preoperative preparation to postdischarge care at home and therefore contrasts with previous studies of satisfaction after arthroplasty that emphasised the peri-operative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513481686">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513481686"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513481686">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215513481686">17</xref></sup> Despite the lower numbers recruited in each comparison site, which reflected local surgical practice during the 12-month period that we studied, the non-inferiority of patients’ evaluation in Belfast was clear. The main limitation is that the study was a non-randomized comparison, in which patients, procedures and the care delivered by staff may have differed between sites in ways that we have not detected. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that shortening postoperative stay in the comparison sites, or in any others, would achieve the results seen in Belfast. However, patients in Belfast were more functionally impaired preoperatively by comparison with the other centres and had more comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> The key strength of this observational study is that it shows what can be achieved in routine surgical practice, using existing resources and in unselected patients.</p>
<p>Intensive preoperative education and postoperative rehabilitation or postdischarge care (‘hospital-at-home’) have been used to decrease postoperative stay from 10.5 to 6.5 days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513481686">3</xref></sup> from 11.9 to 8.1 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215513481686">18</xref></sup> and from 11.9 to 7.0 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513481686">2</xref></sup> in hip and knee arthroplasty patients. Therefore, intensive intervention has been endorsed as a way to shorten hospital stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215513481686">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215513481686">20</xref></sup> However, recent reports suggest that intensive intervention is of no benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215513481686">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513481686">22</xref></sup> and a systematic review of randomized controlled trials found no clear evidence that preoperative physiotherapy programmes improved outcome after hip arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513481686">23</xref></sup> A previous report showed that median stay of three days can be achieved with no more rehabilitation input than routine in-hospital physiotherapy, with no impairment to clinical outcomes and without cost-shifting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> The present report shows that this median stay can be achieved with no detriment to patient experience and, by contrast, with indications of improved experience. The evidence therefore shows no benefit of prolonging patients’ hospital stay beyond a median of three days after this procedure.</p>
<p>We ensured the content validity of our questionnaire by basing it on prior qualitative analysis of patients’ accounts of their experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513481686">12</xref></sup> Therefore the items reflect what matters to patients rather than to practitioners. In contrast to a recently described questionnaire that was based on patient accounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513481686">6</xref></sup> we measured patients’ experience of functional recovery, not just interpersonal aspects of care, and we assessed their experience after six weeks so that they had a perspective on the immediate peri-operative period and home care. Moreover, items were carefully worded in the language that patients used when describing their experience; therefore, the questionnaire was readily accepted and easily completed. The subscales that arose from the principal components analysis provide summary indicators of two components of patients’ experience that are independent: physical recovery and interpersonal aspects of care. That is, whether patients are positive about the interpersonal aspects of care is unrelated to their evaluation of their physical recovery. The pattern of correlations with other questionnaires on which patients self-reported functional status and quality of life indicated convergent and divergent validity for these subscales. As expected, Recovery Problems correlated positively with the Oxford Hip Score and negatively with quality of life indices. Care Problems correlated only modestly with these scales, confirming that it measures an aspect of care that is largely independent of functional recovery.</p>
<p>The two subscales can be used to compare surgical units or to evaluate service improvements. Individual items provide a detailed profile of patients’ evaluation of the totality of their care in hospital and postdischarge. Specific items where a large proportion of patients reported difficulty indicate targets for intervention to improve patient care. For instance, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215513481686">Table 1</xref> many items suggest a need for patients to have more detailed information about what they should expect: around two-thirds worried that they might damage their hip or did not know if they were progressing quickly enough, and around half felt unsure how they should move around. Similarly, over half felt low or tearful to some degree, indicating need for more emotional support.</p>
<p>Patient evaluation is used increasingly as an indicator of quality of care. We have provided a tool that allows hip arthroplasty to be evaluated from a patients’ perspective. We have shown that a very short duration of postoperative hospital stay can be achieved without any detriment to patients’ experience. In conjunction with previous evidence that showed no detriment to functional recovery or health-care costs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481686">4</xref></sup> the present findings add further weight to the case for shortening duration of stay after hip arthroplasty without enhanced recovery programmes.</p>
