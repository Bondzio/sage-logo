<p>Working on teaching as a collective practice—understanding it, specifying it, and improving it—is crucially important and too often ignored. But setting up a choice between improving teaching and improving teachers is problematic for several reasons. To begin with, it seems that the very methods Hiebert and Morris outline for improving teaching necessarily imply the simultaneous improvement of teachers. Improvement as they describe it suggests a “generative dance” between the organizational knowledge embedded in artifacts and the individuals who learn how to use and continuously improve those artifacts. Looking at teaching through the lens of practice theory has two important consequences: it challenges the dichotomy between individual and collective learning, and it focuses attention on the systematization of resources in the organizational setting as an important component of competence building.</p>

<body>
<p>At the beginning of their article, “Teaching, Rather Than Teachers, As a Path Toward Improving Classroom Instruction,” James Hiebert and Anne Morris make the argument that the most productive option for improving classroom instruction is to work directly on <italic>teaching—</italic>on the methods used to interact with students around content—rather than on <italic>teachers</italic>. They recognize that this will not be easy, but they provide several reasons why it may be worth trying. They
<disp-quote>
<p>do not believe that making progress in improving teachers by building and continuously refining instructional products is easier that training teachers to acquire skills and knowledge to use in the classroom . . . [but] that working directly on improving teaching is a more productive approach because as parts of this problem get solved, teaching necessarily improves. (Hiebert &amp; Morris, 2012, p. 99)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I agree that working on teaching as a collective practice—understanding it, specifying it, and improving it—is crucially important and too often ignored. But setting up a choice between improving teaching and improving teachers is problematic for several reasons, which I will outline here. To begin with, it seems that the very methods Hiebert and Morris outline for improving <italic>teaching</italic> necessarily imply the simultaneous improvement of <italic>teachers</italic>. Improvement as they describe it suggests a “generative dance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112447111">Cook &amp; Brown, 1999</xref>) between the organizational knowledge embedded in artifacts and the individuals who learn how to use and continuously improve those artifacts.</p>
<p>My linking of the improvement of teaching with the improvement of teachers grows out of my own effort to imagine what would happen if the sort of project that Hiebert and Morris propose were actually to get underway. If lesson plans and accompanying assessments were produced, they would have to be <italic>used</italic> by teachers to become a resource for improving teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112447111">Cohen, Raudenbush, &amp; Ball, 2003</xref>). How would that use come about if teachers did not learn?</p>
<sec id="section1-0022487112447111">
<title>Alternative Scenarios for Using Well-Designed Artifacts</title>
<p>It is not hard to imagine one scenario actually embedded in Hiebert and Morris’s project, that is, that the teachers who produce the lesson plans and assessments would use them, and in using them, they would not only improve their teaching but also improve the artifacts themselves, adding annotations for reference in the next round of use. This could happen simultaneously in a number of schools whose staffs may or may not communicate across buildings. Teaching would be improved, carefully and deliberately, on a school-by-school basis. In each school, the project would be dependent on a visionary instructional leader and an institutional structure organized to allow teachers the time to do the kind of work Hiebert and Morris describe. Such improvement currently happens in some schools in the form of lesson study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487112447111">Lewis, Perry, &amp; Murata, 2006</xref>), inquiry groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487112447111">Gallimore, Ermeling, Saunders, &amp; Goldenberg, 2009</xref>), and several other kinds of “teacher research” initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022487112447111">Zeichner, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>But what other scenarios might be imagined? Rollout of the Hiebert and Morris project could follow the current pattern of federal, state, or district “mandates” for the use of particular textbooks or for instructional designs for working with special education students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487112447111">Cohen &amp; Moffitt, 2009</xref>). In this scenario, collections of lessons and assessments would be issued to teachers who would be told to use them, perhaps with a few hours of “staff development” in preparation. If we can learn anything from the multiple materials that have been created by textbook publishers to help teachers independently implement new curricula and instructional models, the lessons and assessments are unlikely to be used appropriately if the teacher-audience continues to operate autonomously behind their individual classroom doors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112447111">Coburn &amp; Stein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022487112447111">Stein &amp; Coburn, 2008</xref>). In the best of cases, some individual teachers would be motivated to study the annotations created by the teacher-designers and improve their mathematics teaching.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Hiebert, together with his colleagues Ron Gallimore and James Stigler, suggested that resources like the ones he describes in the “improving teaching” project, developed with Morris, could be part of an electronic database and shared widely among practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487112447111">Hiebert, Gallimore, &amp; Stigler, 2002</xref>). But what would get such resources used in classrooms where teachers are content with what they are doing? What would be the incentives for individual teachers, inventing their own approaches to instruction from a multiplicity of mandates and glitzy ideas that come their way across the Internet, to put other things aside and take up these well-designed more ambitious lessons and assessments?</p>
<p>Another scenario that could be imagined is one in which the lessons and assessments designed in the Hiebert and Morris project could become the curriculum for teacher preparation and professional development on a large scale. They could become the basis for the mathematical complement of a literacy reform like America’s Choice, where they would be a part of a comprehensive design for change that would include reorganizing schools so that the lessons would be part of an instructional system that was coherent and continuous across grade levels. In such a system, teachers would meet together regularly with coaches to work on lessons and learn what it would take to do them well. Formative and summative assessments would be used across the school to collect evidence about how the lessons were working, and the continuous improvement of instruction would be a schoolwide responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112447111">Cohen, Gates, Glazer, Goldin, &amp; Peurach, in press</xref>). Such an approach has shown to improve learning, even in high-poverty schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022487112447111">Rowan, Correnti, Miller, &amp; Camburn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a third scenario, the lessons produced in the Hiebert and Morris project could become “containers” for the practices and principles and subject matter knowledge that novices need to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487112447111">Lampert et al., 2011</xref>). In designed school settings, new teachers’ work could be scaffolded by clinical teacher educators, where novices could see the lessons modeled by proficient users and plan to teach them to students. Novices could rehearse and be coached to represent and explain the mathematics while engaging students as sense makers in the intellectual work the lesson would demand. They could then record their teaching of the lesson and analyze their practice collaboratively with teacher educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487112447111">Kazemi, Franke, &amp; Lampert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487112447111">Lampert, Beasley, Ghousseini, Kazemi, &amp; Franke, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Which of these scenarios will follow the kind of project that Hiebert and Morris propose cannot be predicted. How and whether the current turmoil in the political and economic spheres gets resolved might have a lot to do with what happens. But in the sphere of ideas, there are several considerations that bear on the possibilities and suggest that working on teaching and teachers simultaneously might be inevitable.</p>

<title>Teaching as a Practice</title>
<p>What does it mean to regard teaching as a practice? And to work toward improvement at that level? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487112447111">Dan Lortie (1975)</xref> argued, it is the “technical culture” of skills, knowledge, and common resources that are used by member practitioners that distinguishes an occupation as a practice. Lortie suggested that the lack of a technical culture in teaching—allowing each teacher to invent his or her own definitions of what works and why based on individual experience—might be an explanation for the “reflexive conservatism” that characterizes autonomous work in classrooms. Working privately, and unable to transcend their own experiences, teachers continually revisit and cement the relationship between their beliefs and what they do with students. What Hiebert and Morris propose instead is a collective approach to knowledge building, where knowledge is tested in action not by teachers one-by-one but by groups of teachers working together with researchers in design teams, and collectively making sense of what happened to further annotate plans for richer use in the future. This approach could develop the kind of technical culture that Lortie found missing, embedding knowledge for teaching in the tools commonly used among practitioners.</p>
<p>The practice-based approach to understanding human knowledge building has developed exponentially in the last 50 years, and we would benefit from seeing Hiebert and Morris’s proposal through this lens.</p> <p>In social practices, individual knowing persons do not disappear; they are the physical generators of the collective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487112447111">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>). The knowledge, skills, and values of the practice are made or “embodied” as persons act together in settings to accomplish their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022487112447111">Rose, 1999</xref>). Taking this perspective breaks down many of the dichotomies that have hindered our understanding of how people know how to do what they do in settings where accomplishing goals is complex and fundamentally social.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022487112447111">
<title>Improving Teaching in Communities of Practice</title>
<p>Since Lortie wrote about the missing “technical culture” of teaching in 1975, there has been a great deal of reform talk and even some research on “communities of practice.” Such communities have been conceived as the places where all kinds of practices are improved and learned by novices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487112447111">Lave, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022487112447111">Rogoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022487112447111">Wenger, 2003</xref>). They have been examined by a number of researchers as a site for teacher learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112447111">Bryk, Camburn, &amp; Louis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487112447111">Coburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112447111">Coburn &amp; Stein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112447111">Horn, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487112447111">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487112447111">Kruse, Louis, &amp; Bryk, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487112447111">Little, 2003</xref>). In communities of practice, teacher members not only work on common teaching problems, but in doing so, they also develop common definitions of what counts as a problem and what counts as an appropriate solution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022487112447111">1</xref></sup> They bring the nonroutine difficulties that arise in their work to others doing similar work for analysis and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487112447111">Little &amp; Horn, 2007</xref>). They construct explanations of what is causing the difficulty and jointly negotiate what might be done about it.</p>
<p>This view of individual teacher learning implies that knowledge of teaching is social and cultural, that it is not created or enacted by individuals but by the community of practice with which they work to understand and create their practice. It is not only knowledge that develops in these ways but also the tools that scaffold the skills individuals need to get their work done productively, and the commitment to use those tools to work on what have been defined as important problems. What would it take for this kind of work to focus on the improvement of teaching as conceived by Hiebert and Morris?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022487112447111">
<title>Instruction and the Design of Instructional Guidance Systems (IGSs)</title>
<p>Instruction is a set of social and intellectual structures within which teachers relate with students, and both relate with content, to produce learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112447111">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). Instructional resources are used within that web of relationships to improve the success of the joint endeavor. Such resources can be created by researchers or commercial providers, or by teachers themselves. They detail the participation structures that engage students productively with materials to result in academic learning. And they specify <italic>teaching</italic> in terms of what teachers need to do with content and with students to make learning likely to happen. They can be fragmented, as in the case where teachers draw from multiple reform tools simultaneously, or they can be systematically coherent.</p>
<p>Examples of systematically coherent instructional systems can be found in Montessori education or the Reading Recovery approach to literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487112447111">Bryk, 2009</xref>). Specific systems like these support the improvement of teaching in a community of practice within a comprehensive structure that includes designs for assessment, materials, participation structures around content, and teacher development, all systematized in a way that enables <italic>teachers</italic> to figure out what to do with particular students and why.</p>
<p>Recent arguments about the need for “Instructional Guidance Systems” (IGSs), within which teaching practice can develop and improve consistently and efficiently, began with observations of such systems in such countries as Japan, Singapore, and France by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112447111">David Cohen and James Spillane (1992)</xref>. The term <italic>IGS</italic> and the need for such guidance continues to be prominent in recent research by Steve Raudenbush and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487112447111">Raudenbush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487112447111">Hassrick, Raudenbush, &amp; Rosen, 2012</xref>), Brian Rowan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022487112447111">Rowan et al., 2009</xref>), David Cohen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112447111">Cohen et al., in press</xref>), Anthony Bryk and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487112447111">Bryk, Sebring, Allensworth, Luppescu, &amp; Easton, 2010</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022487112447111">Lauren Resnick (2010)</xref>. All of these leading scholars of reform provide evidence for the argument that designing systemically coherent structures in which teachers and students interact with content is a baseline for doing the work that will enable teachers, policy makers, and researchers to learn in, from, and for practice how to improve teaching and learning.</p>
<p>By beginning with designs for everything from daily lessons to long-range assessments of student gains over time, an IGS could enable everyone to learn and improve by trying something out and keeping careful track of how it works, refining the design, and trying again. By aligning instructional designs with frameworks like the Common Core State Standards, assessments of teacher and student performance, and requirements of teacher education and licensure, these researchers argue, we will begin to understand how variations in teaching practice matter in impacting student learning. With an IGS in place in schools, teacher educators would be able to prepare novices for practice, rather than simply giving them some general principles and hoping for the best when they get to their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487112447111">Lampert &amp; Graziani, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022487112447111">
<title>Teaching Is Relational Work</title>
<p>These systemic arguments are powerful, and they are consistent with the Hiebert and Morris proposal to improve teaching rather than teachers. But the work of teaching presents us with a fundamental conundrum. Teaching is relational work, in which the relations between the people engaged in the “instructional triangle” matter greatly to success. During instruction, these interpersonal relations must be mobilized to influence students’ commitment to their own learning, for without such commitment, teachers cannot be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487112447111">Lampert, 2001</xref>). In analyzing the social resources of teaching and the predicaments they present to practitioners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112447111">David Cohen (2011)</xref> observed, “Students depend on teachers for help but teachers’ success depends on students learning. Each is the others’ path to success, so <italic>good work requires unusual commitment to the work, to each other, and to each others’ success</italic>” (p. 50, emphasis added). Unlike knowledge and skill, commitment cannot be contained in artifacts; it must be mustered and maintained by each individual teacher and student as they are interactively engaged in classroom activity.</p>
<p>Good lesson plans and assessments will scaffold teaching and student learning so that it can be successful, but lesson plans and assessments, even when they are part of a well-designed IGS, cannot succeed on their own to muster the responsibility for mutual effort that individual teachers and their particular students need to improve teaching and learning. This needs to be done in the myriad specific interactions they have across a year of work together. Even within well–laid out and carefully specified lesson plans, teachers must know how to do what it takes to build relationships with each and every one of their different students so that they will engage in the activities that the lesson plan is designed around. These relationships need to be built in ways that will engage each student in wanting to do the kind of work that will result in their learning.</p>
<p>Ambitious and well-designed curricular materials are rejected when teachers have low expectations for their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112447111">Cohen &amp; Spillane, 1992</xref>). Teachers who use such materials may begin with cognitively ambitious goals, but in classroom interaction, cognitive demand is lowered when students become resistant to the different and more difficult challenges of unfamiliar tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487112447111">Henningsen &amp; Stein, 1997</xref>). It is likely that well-specified instructional guidance could result in the same kind of simplification unless teachers have the will to keep their expectations high even when students complain and struggle.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to build productive relationships with students, individual teachers must have the will to enact a difficult and challenging lesson, to use the resources that are available to them in the way their designers intended them to be used. Both teachers and students need incentives to engage personally with one another in the kinds of relationships with content that will enable students to learn what they need to know. Making resources available guarantees nothing about whether or how they will be used. Such opportunities are features of ongoing relationships between people who care about one another, and they are as important to fixing teaching as good lesson plans.</p>
<p>Individual relationships between teachers and students are needed to build the kind of trust that will convince students that it is worth the risk of trying something that is not easy in order to accomplish more ambitious goals. And to make this happen, <italic>teachers</italic> as well as <italic>teaching</italic> will need improvement. One aspect of that improvement is building teachers’ will and commitment and another is building the interpersonal skills that support positive interaction. Knowing what teaching moves will turn reluctant or bored or hostile students into academically ambitious risk takers, and knowing how to do those moves, is part of the work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487112447111">Lampert, 2010</xref>). But being willing to make those moves, even when risky, is equally important. Getting people into teaching who want to face the challenge of building students’ academic character is a beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487112447111">Farr, 2010</xref>), but keeping them in teaching is a different kind of challenge. Demonstrating to those who are already in teaching and are skeptical about whether all students ought to be asked to do academically ambitious work that they <italic>can do that work</italic> will also be required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022487112447111">
<title>Developing Teachers’ Will to Do Good Teaching</title>
<p>For a particular teacher to use a well-developed lesson plan successfully with a particular group of students is a matter of having the plan and having the skill, knowledge, and will to enact it. Unlike individual skills and knowledge, will does not develop through the training of independent individuals. Will is not an individual trait but a cultural one, having to do with the enacting norms and values of one’s reference group, norms that identify what is important to care about, and given alternatives, what should be a priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112447111">Cook &amp; Yanow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022487112447111">Rogoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022487112447111">Weick &amp; McDaniel, 1989</xref>). In addition to developing teaching, in the way that Hiebert and Morris propose, it seems we must also develop teachers’ collective will to enact lesson plans and assessments that may likely engage them and their students in more difficult and challenging work than they might otherwise chose to undertake.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, several researchers examined the effect that teachers working together on teaching would have on the will to enact ambitious instruction and on student learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112447111">Bryk and Driscoll (1988)</xref>, for example, found that schools where teachers developed shared values through common work on how to successfully use a common curriculum, and where an ethos of “caring” for students was present, had lower dropout rates and higher gains in mathematics achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112447111">Lee, Smith, and Croninger (1995)</xref> found even more relevant results in their study of Chicago schools: Schools that channeled teacher work into a common curriculum increased the amount of work that students did in common and tended to reduce the achievement gap, over time, raising performance of minority students considerably. This research suggests two things: first, that working together on lessons in the way Hiebert and Morris propose will change teachers as well as teaching, and secondly that a common lesson bank will have the potential to amplify student performance through introducing more consistency onto instructional interactions across classrooms, a consistency which is likely to add to student performance gains.</p>
<p>We know from research in organizational psychology that the social use of resources in common activities like planning and evaluation is sustained by—and at the same time sustains—the social construction of norms and ideas and the collaborative construction, interpretation, and use of material artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112447111">Cook &amp; Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112447111">Cook &amp; Yanow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487112447111">Miettinen &amp; Virkkunen, 2005</xref>). The intellectual, social, and material resources an organization makes available in a given time and space shape the kind of work that can be done on problems of practice, which in turn shapes agreements about goals and how to achieve them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487112447111">Nicolini, Gherardi, &amp; Yanow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487112447111">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022487112447111">Weick &amp; McDaniel, 1989</xref>). In such social practice work, it is not only what people are <italic>able to do</italic> but also what they are <italic>willing to do</italic> that is jointly accomplished.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe, based on this work, that a personal and collective commitment to a different kind of mathematics teaching is likely to result from the sort of work that Hiebert and Morris propose. Indeed, they make this link explicitly:

<p>As teachers (and researchers) work together to study and improve annotated lessons plans from which they will teach, they have the opportunity to acquire new knowledge of both content and pedagogy (Huang &amp; Boa, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487112447111">Lampert &amp; Graziani, 2009</xref>; Lewis &amp; Tsuchida, 1998; Ma, 1999). An important feature of this knowledge is that it is developed in the exact context in which it will be used. By studying particular lessons, teachers can acquire (and are likely to feel some urgency to acquire) knowledge and skills that help them implement just those lessons. There is no distance between the context in which teachers’ knowledge and skills for teaching are developed and the context in which they are used. (Hiebert &amp; Morris, 2012, p. 95)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Hiebert and Morris present us with an image of groups of teachers working together to build, test, and refine lessons over time. Theories of practice suggest such common activity underlies the culture building that supports work founded on common values and beliefs. These values and beliefs are negotiated in and for practice as individual teachers do the instructional work that is at the heart of their jobs, and then report back to the group on what happened.</p>
<p>The kind of improvements in teaching that Hiebert and Morris envision will develop if reformers can support an ongoing generative dance among school culture and organization that supports high expectations, the artifacts needed to achieve those expectations, and the individual teachers and students who will do the necessary teaching and learning that makes it all happen.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the definitions and solutions that arise out of teacher communities do not always align with reform agendas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487112447111">McLaughlin &amp; Talbert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022487112447111">Rosenholtz, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>About the Author</title>
<p><bold>Magdalene Lampert</bold> is a researcher on teaching, a teacher educator, and a designer of settings for teacher education. She is currently a senior advisor to the Boston Teacher Residency on their efforts to redesign the practice of teacher education in relation to school improvement. She holds the George Herbert Mead Collegiate Chair in the School of Education at the University of Michigan. She is the coordinator of the Learning Teaching in, from, and for Practice Project, a joint effort of mathematics teacher educators at University of Michigan, University of Washington, University of California Los Angeles, and the University of Wisconsin to design pedagogies and practices of teacher education that prepare novices to do and learn from ambitious mathematics teaching. She taught mathematics at the upper elementary level from 1982 until 1990. She is the author of <italic>Teaching Problems and the Problems in Teaching</italic>, an analysis of the elements of the work of teaching mathematics with problems. She has written numerous articles about mathematics teaching drawing on her own work in designing and implementing ambitious practice. More recently, she has written about the relationship between school organization and ambitious teaching and alternative structures for preparing novices to be able to teach ambitiously.</p>
