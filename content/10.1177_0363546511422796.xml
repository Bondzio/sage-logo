<p>Stress fracture in athletes is a well-described condition that generally affects the tension side of long bones. These injuries were first described by a German military surgeon, Briethaupt, in 1855 and were initially seen in radiographs in 1897.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511422796">8</xref></sup> The cause of a stress fracture is repetitive, subthreshold loading of a bone, resulting in a partial or complete fracture. While stress fractures of the lower extremity have been well described, the first description of a stress fracture of the olecranon was in javelin throwers by Waris.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511422796">21</xref></sup> In baseball pitchers, this entity was not described until 1968, when Slocum described an olecranon process fracture associated with extension overload.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511422796">16</xref></sup> Tullos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511422796">19</xref></sup> were the first to describe this as a true stress fracture. In this patient, nonoperative treatment resulted in a nonunion, which ultimately required bone grafting.

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>An otherwise healthy 21-year-old right hand–dominant pitcher sustained an olecranon stress fracture in his right elbow in the spring of his redshirt-sophomore year. His medical history was significant for an initial diagnosis of an olecranon stress reaction a year earlier while at a community college. His initial injury had been treated nonoperatively. He sat out that season and refrained from throwing for 3 months and then returned to activity afterward. He transferred to our university, and his preparticipation physical examination findings were normal. Radiographs were taken at that time, and they did not demonstrate any evidence of stress fracture. He was allowed to play during the fall practice season and did so without difficulty.</p>
<p>When the regular season began, he was again throwing without pain. But in March, he felt a sharp pain in his right elbow while throwing a pitch. He denied hearing or feeling a pop. He subsequently threw one additional pitch with less intense pain. At this point, he removed himself from the game, and he underwent evaluation by the athletic training staff. His physical examination demonstrated point tenderness over the posteromedial olecranon. He had full flexion and extension of the elbow with pain but mild pain with pronation and supination. In the training room, there was pain with valgus stress testing at both 0° and 30°, and the patient was referred to our office.</p>
<p>In the office, he had similar physical examination results. We repeated radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The lateral radiograph showed a stress fracture of the olecranon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511422796">Figure 1</xref>). This was confirmed on MRI, showing an incomplete olecranon stress fracture with moderate joint effusion with a normal ulnar collateral ligament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511422796">Figure 2</xref>). These findings were discussed with the player, and the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention.</p>

<p>The patient underwent surgery performed by the senior author (S.D.M.), and the fracture was compressed with a 6.5 × 70-mm intramedullary cannulated screw (Synthes, West Chester, Pennsylvania). The surgery was uneventful, and the patient’s arm was placed in a posterior splint. He wore the splint for 5 days and then began gentle range of motion exercises. At postoperative week 2, he began isometric strengthening exercises. At 7 weeks, he was advanced to resistance-band strength training under the guidance of the team’s athletic trainer (G.G.G.). He was allowed to begin an interval throwing program 12 weeks after surgery. He progressed through the throwing program without difficulty, and we allowed him to return to flat ground pitching at 16 weeks after surgery. Bullpen work was initiated at postoperative week 22.</p>
<p>He was seen monthly through the remainder of the season with serial radiographs demonstrating healing and operative fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511422796">Figure 3</xref>). During this interval, serial examination findings were benign, and radiographic follow-up results were negative. Early the next season, 7 months after the index procedure, the athlete began to experience pain with bullpen activity. He was seen again at this time, with normal-appearing radiographs and an examination consistent with posterior medial impingement/valgus overload. He was held from throwing activities for 2 weeks and prescribed anti-inflammatory medications.</p>

</fig>
<p>When he was asymptomatic, he was cleared to begin throwing again. He did well for 6 weeks, when he began to experience pain with throwing. At this time, his constellation of symptoms were more consistent with a strain of the flexor-pronator mass. The athlete was allowed to return to throwing after another week of rest. He began to have the same type of pain while playing catch, and radiographs now revealed a recurrence of the stress fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511422796">Figure 4</xref>). Because of the recurrence of the same injury, a metabolic work-up ensued.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient had an array of laboratory results sent on consultation with an endocrinologist. Of note, his vitamin D, 25-hydroxy level was 30 ng/mL (normal, 30-80 ng/mL), but no other endocrine or hormonal abnormalities were detected. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was also performed, and the results were also within normal limits for bone density. As a result of this work-up, he was prescribed vitamin D therapy and calcium supplementation.</p>
<p>The decision made at this point was to revise the previous surgery. The screw from the previous surgery was removed. A 4.5-mm drill was utilized to reream the canal, and a 6.5 × 85-mm partially threaded solid screw was then placed partially in the canal. A 2.7 × 45-mm screw was placed along the medial aspect of the ulna perpendicular to the fracture, using a lag technique, to compress the fracture medially. After compressing the medial side, the intramedullary screw was fully seated and compressed. He used a posterior splint for 1 week and then allowed to begin range of motion exercises. He was also continued on his vitamin D therapy, and a bone stimulator (Exogen 4000+ Bone Healing System, Smith and Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee) was utilized. Postoperative radiographs are shown with both the medial compression screw and the intramedullary screw in position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511422796">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Eight weeks after surgery, the athlete began a throwing program under the supervision of the athletic training staff. He progressed through this without difficulty and was allowed to progress to throwing off the mound 14 weeks after surgery. He completed the season and had no recurrence of symptoms.</p>
<p>The patient was seen at 17 months’ follow-up and is continuing to pitch without symptoms. Radiographs show no recurrence of the stress fracture.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recurrent stress fractures of the olecranon process are a rare occurrence, particularly after operative intervention. This unique case was discussed in personal communications with physicians from several high-volume practices that see a large number of pitchers. None of these individuals had seen a recurrence after fixation. In our operative planning, we had discussed that the stress fracture pattern tends to begin medially and progress laterally with the repetitive microstress of throwing. As such, the belief was that compressing the medial aspect of the proximal ulna with an additional screw would likely be of benefit.</p>
<p>To date, there are no large published studies of stress fractures of the olecranon and no reports of any patients who had experienced recurrence after operative intervention. In a relatively large unpublished case series by Paci et al, there were no recurrences among 19 throwers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422796">10</xref></sup> These authors reported that 85% of athletes were able to return to previous participation levels or better.</p>
<p>Given the limited data on this injury, the decision was made to address the biomechanical forces that would contribute to failure and any other factors. Any time that there is a concern with nonhealing of a fracture, one must look at both the biomechanics and the biology that may have been inadequate to allow full recovery. It is likely that the fracture never completely healed initially, and we could have considered a computed tomography scan to assess the degree of healing before allowing him to return to play. However, this route was not pursued as the patient was asymptomatic, and there were no irregularities on the plain films to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>There are many reasons that a fracture may not heal. These are grossly divided into biological and mechanical factors. It is possible that mechanical factors, such as inadequate fixation, could have played a role. In our initial procedure, the screw was cannulated, and a larger screw may have been desirable. The purchase we were able to obtain was excellent, and generally cannulated screws can perform quite well in the face of stress fractures, as is seen in the fixation of femoral neck and fifth metatarsal stress fractures. Another potential problem is that an intramedullary screw does not specifically compress the anteromedial aspect of the olecranon. The use of an intramedullary screw is the accepted mode of fixation and usually provides good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422796">10</xref></sup> As such, in the revision surgery, we added a second screw under the assumption that lack of anteromedial compression was a contributing factor in the failure. We also could have taken a more prolonged rehabilitation course, but the one we used is established as acceptable.</p>
<p>There are other technical considerations that could have been made at the time of revision. Nonunion treatment for fractures of long bones often entails compression plating and autogenous bone grafting. However, with a stress fracture recurrence rather than a documented nonunion in a throwing athlete about to begin his season, this would be a much larger surgery. With a more involved surgery, there would also be prolonged recovery that could have resulted in a third consecutive missed season and likely the end of the athlete’s career. There was also concern that a prominent implant such as a plate or washer would be a potential source of future symptoms.</p>
<p>Biological considerations included our concern for an underlying metabolic abnormality. Our work-up included a DEXA scan and endocrine markers that would affect bone density and bone turnover. This was to ensure that there was no underlying injury that would continue to put the patient at risk. In a recent study, vitamin D deficiency was seen in 36% of 165 young adults aged 18 to 29 years living in Boston at the end of winter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422796">18</xref></sup> In a study of vitamin D levels in healthy patients with nonspecific musculoskeletal pain syndromes, 93% had some degree of vitamin D deficiency, and 28% had severe deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511422796">11</xref></sup> Vitamin D levels are often monitored for levels with concern for rickets (20-29 nmol/L), but optimal health and disease prevention require much higher levels (at least 75-80 nmol/L).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511422796">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422796">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511422796">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422796">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511422796">23</xref></sup> Little is known about the effects of vitamin D levels in athletic populations, but data suggest that vitamin D synthesis and metabolism in athletes may play a role in the development of stress fractures. This may be of particular importance for athletes who spend the winter in cooler climates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511422796">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In summary, we present a case of recurrence of an olecranon stress fracture in a Division I collegiate baseball pitcher, first with nonoperative management and again after operative fixation. After the fixation was revised and the patient supplemented his calcium and vitamin D intake, the fracture has healed, and the patient has returned to pitching.</p>
