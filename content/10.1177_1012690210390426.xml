<p>Global commodity chain research has become an important dimension of sociological research on globalization. Viewed from an anthropological perspective, however, it seems to be missing a critical orientation, one that is rooted in anthropology’s tradition of ‘studying down’. This study of Dominican baseball as a global commodity chain is an excellent pathway to understanding the ways in which neoliberal forces are altered as they articulate with local institutions and events in the developing world. The study also argues for injecting global commodity chain models with a more critical component to gain their full benefits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The following study of Dominican baseball attempts to extend the reach of studies in the globalization of sport by bringing together two research designs: global commodity chains (from sociology) and neoliberal exception (from anthropology).</p>
<p>Cultural anthropology has been especially active in contributing to the growing globalization literature. With its emphasis upon studying non-Western contexts, anthropologists have viewed globalization ‘from below’, witnessing the impact of globalizing forces among those most vulnerable. Additionally, because ethnography lies at the epicenter of anthropological research, the discipline has produced a large corpus of work looking at detailed global–local encounters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690210390426">1</xref></sup> The outcome, in most of these cases, has shown globalization taking unusual turns. In a globalized world where no one has escaped neoliberal economic policies and where the power of the state to control transnational events has been questioned, anthropological contributions have come to be sought after.</p>
<p>Judged by the number of symposia, chapters, articles and dissertations on globalization – and not withstanding the contributions of such notables as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210390426">Castells (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690210390426">Robinson (2004)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690210390426">Sassen (1998)</xref> – sociological contributions have lagged behind those of anthropology. However, one area of research within sociology that has the potential to impact anthropological thinking is that of global commodity chains (GCC). By privileging the transnational nature of production as <italic>the</italic> key structural unit studied, GCC research has given us a kind of seamless, solitary macro-entity – the commodity chain – that can structure our view of global production, distribution and consumption as it stretches across nations, time and space. This kind of sociological research represents a potentially important way of studying globalization, yet its emphasis on where the researcher is embedded theoretically and practically differs from that of anthropology. While GCC research looks at globalization from above via the globalizing entity, anthropology’s emphasis is at the source of the chain. Perhaps because of where its interests are located, anthropological research in this area tends to be critical, while sociological examinations of global commodity chains tends to adopt a position that legitimizes the process of production from the top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690210390426">Gereffi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690210390426">Gereffi and Korzeniewiewicz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690210390426">Gibbon and Ponte, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The following study borrows the structure of the GCC model but fuses it to the critical orientation found in political economy and anthropology. In this examination, particular attention is paid to the articulation between those controlling the chain via a cocktail of neoliberal strategies (i.e. Major League Baseball) and the local (i.e. Dominican) response to it. The system of Dominican baseball talent production that has evolved over the past quarter of a century has intermittently pitted local Dominican interests against the global Major League Baseball (MLB), with the latter exerting its dominance at almost every turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690210390426">Klein, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690210390426">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210390426">2006a</xref>). The past decade, however, has brought changes to the way baseball affairs are transacted in the Dominican Republic (DR). These changes have made for a more contested arena in player production, unwittingly enabling Dominicans to enter areas of the commodity chain that had been off limits to them earlier. The dynamic nature of globalization may seek to promote established hegemonic domains by, for instance limiting government interference, but it is always subject to roadblocks caused by internal contradictions and external relations that can derail the process.</p>

<sec id="section2-1012690210390426">
<title>The neoliberal exception</title>
<p>It is out of ethnographically grounded research on global–local interactions that studies documenting deviations from standard neoliberal operations, what Aihwa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690210390426">Ong (2006)</xref> has called ‘neoliberalism as exception’, have been reported. Ong studied the manner in which Asian states have responded to neoliberalism, presenting convincing evidence for the manner in which the state is actively engaged in altering neoliberal policy to accommodate local requirements while continuing its engagement with it. She details a range of ways in which, for instance, China redefines citizenship, economic policy and sovereignty. Specifically, China divided its economic system into special capitalist market zones that stand alongside communist spheres, replete with differing rights granted to those employed in each sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690210390426">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A certain amount of confusion can result in talking about ‘neoliberalism as exception’ as opposed to outright ‘exceptions to neoliberalism’. Examples of economic systems or states completely rejecting neoliberalism in a post-Communist economic world can be found (e.g. North Korea), but are shrinking. Ong’s work examines situations in which engagement with neoliberalism occurs but capitulation does not; and in so doing references earlier studies of colonialism and economic development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690210390426">3</xref></sup> Another way in which neoliberal exception should be understood has to do with the unintended consequences resulting from the political and economic articulation of different regimes. This is clearly the case in the production of Dominican baseball players for Major League Baseball and, I suspect, in most such cases. Fusing anthropological approaches to transnational neoliberal economic policies with global commodity chain research can provide us with a perspective that will prove useful in sport research, especially as regards production of talent (see below).</p>

<sec id="section3-1012690210390426">
<title>The global commodity chain</title>
<p>The concept of a global production has been in existence at least since the time of Karl Marx. Even before he published <italic>Capital</italic>, Marx already understood the adverse impact of global capitalist production on colonial nations like India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690210390426">Marx, 1886</xref>). Anthropologists began studying various forms of transnational production early in the 20th century. Notable among them were the ethnohistorians of the 1940s that examined the North American fur trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690210390426">Goldfrank, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690210390426">Lewis, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690210390426">Mishkin, 1940</xref>). Post-Second World War social historians such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210390426">Braudel (1949)</xref> and the Annales School in France also examined macro-schemes of production. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690210390426">Hopkins and Wallerstein (1986)</xref> introduced the concept of ‘global commodity chain’ they were really only repackaging earlier Marxist views to fit into their notion of World Systems thinking. Sociology jumped on the bandwagon late – through the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690210390426">Gereffi and Korzeniewicz (1994)</xref> – seeking to ride the coat tails of World Systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1012690210390426">4</xref></sup> By folding it into the literature on rural sociology and development, Gereffi and Korzeniewicz mainstreamed global commodity chains, ridding it of any critical orientation.</p>
<p>GCC’s simplicity is both a strength and weakness. Because the model proceeds by keying in on how production moves between nations and cultures, it has the capacity to alter the view of production as occurring between sovereign nations in favor of seeing it as a single enterprise. On the other hand, the GCC model has taken a corporate-centered direction in which global production (and consumption) is approached from the top-down. In this sense, GCC thinking is more closely aligned with neoliberalism’s private enterprise orientation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690210390426">Humphrey and Schmitz’s (2003)</xref> governance model, for instance, perpetrates a view in which dominant corporations called ‘lead firms’ characterize their relations with local entities by terms such as ‘captive’ and ‘hierarchy’ to describe its relationship with producers further down the commodity chain in the developing nations. Dolan and Humphreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690210390426">2000</xref>: 161) further point out that, ‘… governance requirements increase when developing country producers have difficulty meeting the requirements of developed country’s markets’. The term, ‘governing the chain’, used widely in their circles, assumes a justification for controlling local levels of the chain as much as it refers to the ability to order production around the globe. Even talk of local entities with the capability of occasionally successfully competing is considered as ‘upgrading’. At the very least, this use of jargon suggests ethnocentrism, at worst, a neo-colonial mindset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1012690210390426">
<title>GCC in sport studies</title>
<p>The GCC model used in commodity analyses (e.g. agriculture or light manufacturing) works well in sport, with one glaring exception. In sport, the commodity being produced is labor – human, self-reflexive and dynamic. Labor is, in this case, not merely what produces the commodity; it <italic>is</italic> the commodity being produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690210390426">Klein, in preparation</xref>). The reliance of sporting industries upon athletic labor changes the political and economic calculus of the commodity chain. Insofar as global commodity chain models look at the manufacture of inert products such as agricultural produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690210390426">Hughes, 2001</xref>), apparel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690210390426">Gereffi et al., 2002</xref>) or electronics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210390426">Gereffi, 2001</xref>), the emphasis has been upon the structural factors such as what goes into the production at each phase. In examining labor as a commodity, however, the way one goes about analyzing production includes a greater role for social and cultural features. This is as true for Dominican athletes becoming Major League players, as it is for Ghanaians moving up the chain to European football leagues.</p>
<p>The manner by which sport industries seek to globalize their operations also varies greatly, but with a few exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690210390426">Giulianotti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690210390426">Sugden and Tomlinson, 1998</xref>) they have not been subject to serious long-term examination. My current research – of which the present case is one component – examines the Dominican player chain beginning in impoverished Dominican communities from which they come; tracking them through the different rungs in the ladder or chain until they arrive at the highest level of play; and then back again to the DR. In so doing we add an extra level of examination – one typically beyond the scope of GCC studies.</p>

<title>Dominican–MLB commodity chain</title>
<p>The production of foreign players for Major League Baseball (MLB) has accelerated over the past two decades from a handful of players in the late 1980s, to roughly 28 percent of today’s Major League rosters. More striking, the percentage of professional foreign Minor League players (those playing their way up to the Major League level) has grown to almost 48 percent of all players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690210390426">MLB.com, 2009</xref>). Clearly the sport of baseball is poised to become predominantly international during the 21st century; but what model will it follow? Is it neo-colonial, international or global? And, if it is the latter, what kind of globalization is it?</p>
<p>The ethnographic research for this study has been intermittent and ongoing since the late 1980s. Following a hiatus of 11 years, the current round resumed in 2002. It involves two to three field trips a year for periods of time ranging from one to three weeks. The current round of research includes ethnographic fieldwork with both big and small market Major League teams and their Dominican academies as field sites. The Major League Baseball Commissioner’s Santo Domingo office is also part of my fieldwork. Additionally, I have a sample of <italic>buscónes</italic> who I interview and observe.</p>
<p>I begin by outlining the commodity chain, moving on to examine institutional relations and governance structures that characterize the initial phases of it (i.e. that taking place within the Dominican Republic). This is followed, by looking at how unintended consequences of the chain come into play. The outline below provides a complete view of the commodity chain, of which I concern myself only with the initial Dominican part of it. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which MLB attempts to govern the chain and the response on the part of Dominicans to it. This results in a combination of expected and unexpected turns.</p>
<sec id="section6-1012690210390426">
<title>External features affecting the chain</title>
<p>Five structural factors strongly influence the MLB–DR commodity chain, giving MLB an almost uncontested political and economic control over the production process. First and foremost, Major League Baseball represents the world’s <italic>most advanced sector</italic> of the sport. It is the richest market and center of excellence, making it the natural magnet for players from all over the world. The second feature is that MLB is a <italic>self-regulating monopoly</italic> – a structural arrangement that negates the possibility of serious competition with other leagues around the world for access to and control over talent. This is magnified by a third condition: the presence of relatively few <italic>advanced baseball-playing nations</italic>. Other than the Dominican Republic, only Venezuela, Japan and Mexico (and Cuba in post-Castro stage) produce any number of players that can make it to the Major Leagues. This results in a relatively small worldwide labor pool. The fourth factor intrinsic to the industry has been the expansion of the number of Major League franchises (from 16 to 30) during the past four decades that has resulted in the <italic>increased demand for labor</italic> at both Major League and Minor League levels. And finally, the need for more talented players occurs at the same time that the domestic US <italic>playing base has begun to seriously decline</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210390426">Klein, 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>The interplay of these industry features has resulted in MLB’s increased emphasis on securing foreign talent – overwhelmingly from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. By way of illustration: through the first nine months of 2008, MLB teams spent a record $45,064,000 to sign 108 elite international amateur players (elite is defined by being signed for $100,000 or more) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690210390426">Bader, 2008</xref>). Of the nine countries from which players were signed, the Dominican Republic accounted for 56 percent of the total expenditure and 51 percent of all top international players signed (Venezuela is a distant second with about half of these numbers). If we include players signed for less than $100,000 the picture is even more one-sided. Quite simply, the Dominican Republic is the world’s most intensively mined source for foreign players. This is so because: the Dominican Republic is a center of an abundant supply highly talented players; the absence of other sports competing with baseball; and also because the DR has been a compliant partner in all of this.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690210390426">Figure 1</xref> is a linear scheme that begins with the first stage of player development and moves on from that. Note that the first entry is termed the ‘<italic>Buscón</italic> stage’, but has no number in front of it. This is to distinguish it from the other pieces of the chain that are formally part of the MLB-structured chain. Described below, the <italic>Buscón</italic> stage is part of the informal economy that sits on the edges of this commodity chain but which impacts it heavily. It is discussed as an ‘Unintended consequence’ of the chain (below). I now proceed to the formal properties of the chain that seek to forge the ways in which the chain will operate.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-1012690210390426">
<title>Governance of the Dominican end of the chain</title>
<p>The GCC view of production concerns the ways in which hegemony (orderly production) is maintained and reproduced. All institutions assist in this process. Within the Dominican end of the chain they are twofold: the Commissioner’s Office and the academies.</p>
<sec id="section8-1012690210390426">
<title>MLB Commissioner’s Office</title>
<p>In opening up its Dominican office in 2001, MLB had finally decided that regulation was unavoidable since teams were doing little to safeguard excesses or travesties committed by rogue elements.</p>
<p>Typically, when a foreign enterprise as large as MLB has decided to forcefully intervene into another nation’s affairs it is confronted head on by the government; but the Dominican baseball establishment has shown no inclination to assert sovereignty in any matters. The MLB Office oversees and regulates all Major League team operations in the country by creating uniform standards that all teams must live by. Teams were instructed to upgrade their facilities to meet MLB’s new, more exacting standards. All signings are directly overseen by the Commissioner’s Office. Additionally, the Office has worked hard at curbing violations in the use of performance enhancing drugs, and in signing and mishandling of Dominican players.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1012690210390426">
<title>The academy system</title>
<p>For professional baseball players’ the commodity chain consists of a relatively lengthy series of graded stations. In the Dominican case, formal evaluation of players begins when they enter the team’s Dominican academy. Having signed professional baseball contracts they are considered rookies just like their North American counterparts who entered the same chain via the baseball draft system. Signing a professional contract in the Dominican Republic is based upon a tryout. These are typically several hours of showcasing one’s skills (running, batting, throwing, fielding) capped by a scrimmage or game situation. If successful, negotiations ensue and a contract (with a signing bonus) is offered. They then enter the academy where they may stay as long as three years.</p>
<p>Prior to the mid-1990s, teams would generally get wind of a prospective player by a local who had seen him playing in the amateur leagues, at which point they would send one of their scouts down to look at him. Or, they might send a scouting director down to the capital to hold a tryout. An acquaintance would gather prospects for examination. It was not until the academy system became entrenched that players began to be systematically produced. Begun by famed Los Angeles Dodger scouting director Ralph Avila in the late 1970s, the Dodger academy evolved over the next 20 years to become the structural backbone of baseball operations in the Dominican Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690210390426">Klein, 1991</xref>). Avila’s Dodger academy was decades ahead of anyone else’s. Initially a makeshift dorm where he could better train the players he had signed for the Dodgers, Avila’s experiment by 1987, matured into a state of the art facility called Campo Las Palmas. It was completely self-sufficient in that it could manage every phase of player development within its borders. This included eating, sleeping, exercising, playing, educating and recreation. Campo Las Palmas was the template for the modern academy, but it wasn’t until the early 2000s that other clubs followed suit.</p>
<p>Ideally, their stay at the academy should offer them the development that can get them promoted to the next rung in the US baseball system. Every aspect of care is provided: room and board, medical, instruction of all sorts. Capping this intensive training is the Dominican Summer League, an excellent caliber of play with a 72-game season that each player competes in on behalf of his team. This extended training period also includes a good deal of cultural remediation (see below). Ralph Avila concluded that, ‘These boys, a lot of times can’t even write in their own language. They come from such poor homes, that they don’t even know how to use the toilets we have here or brush their teeth.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1012690210390426">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1012690210390426">
<title>The academy as governance</title>
<p>Ralph Avila realized over three decades ago, that if one could create an insular baseball environment in the DR, a more focused, developed and mature player who would find the transition to North America that much easier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1012690210390426">6</xref></sup> This would be the template of the modern Dominican academy.</p>
<p>Despite being highly skilled laborers when they sign, Dominican baseball players must nevertheless be molded into what the particular organization considers its preferred player. They need to inculcate the playing style of the team and they must develop the kind of professionalism that is valued. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210390426">Foucault’s (1995)</xref> notions of ‘discipline and punishment’ (the ways dominant institutions go about forging conformity of both body and mind) come to mind. Discipline is not only external, but also internalized through socialization as something highly desirable. For Dominican rookies (newly signed) the lessons learned at the academy are a combination of desirable instruction (eagerly internalized) and those considered onerous – even objectionable. For instance, players pay close attention to instruction that directly helps them perform better (e.g. pitching instruction that increases their velocity). Attempts to formally educate them in class settings, however, are often resisted. I saw this one afternoon at the New York Mets academy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I saw Reyes (their coach) grab two of the rookies by the scruff of the neck and shove them on the team bus headed for classes. ‘Get the fuck on the bus and don’t give me any trouble!’ he bellowed. The players didn’t resist him directly, but they shot him several dirty looks when they thought he wasn’t watching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1012690210390426">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Players understand that they are being evaluated on the basis of a range of things, even if they try to minimize the importance of certain of the instruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1012690210390426">
<title>Governing on the field</title>
<p>Coaches routinely characterize players coming into the academy as undisciplined using their own terms: ‘<italic>rusticos</italic>’ (rubes or country bumpkins), or ‘<italic>tigres</italic>’ (little tigers or street toughs). They must be re-socialized to resemble the kind of player and person worthy of being sent on to the US to play and represent the team. The daily schedules at the academies are stringent and getting players to follow it is not easy. They receive daily instruction tailored to their positions and to their level of sophistication, both of the academy staff as well as the regulars who come in from the US. Regular conferences take place, during which the players are evaluated on the basis of notions such as ‘coachability’, a loose term that grades a player’s ability and willingness to follow instruction for on-field performance.</p>
<p>Performance on the field also creates objective criteria of worthiness. For professional athletes that boils down to the player’s statistics. Playing in the Dominican Summer League (DSL) marks the first time that these players produce playing statistics, and these contribute heavily toward creating a Dominican player’s resume that can be used to argue for his promotion or demotion. This is the closest to a purely rational system in which the skills manifest under real game conditions can assist the players’ effort to move up the chain. Additionally, while the DSL team competes as a collective against other Major League teams, the players on the team are also competing against each other. Dominican players realize what is at stake and the importance of surviving another round of evaluation, which is why they refer to the DSL as ‘<italic>como Viet Nam</italic>’ (‘like Vietnam’). Because this represents the beginning of a ‘paper trail’; the initiation of his professional career dovetails with the attempt to govern, or to ‘domesticate’ the Dominican ball player.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1012690210390426">
<title>Governing outside the lines</title>
<p>For Dominicans, non-playing variables also deeply influence the perception of a player’s worth to the organization. For instance, ‘makeup’ refers to how open the player is to input of any sort from staff and coaches. Written evaluations regularly refer to their ‘character’, a trait that extends beyond the physical capabilities of the athlete to include his willingness to alter his behavior and attitude so as to become more like the kind of player the team demands.</p>
<p>Resocialization pertains to remediation. Since players growing up in extreme poverty often have learned a different sense of how to structure their lives and a sense of responsibility that is at odds with the academy staff, this is a core area of the resocialization effort. One Academy Director explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It sounds silly because they should know these things but they don’t. Every day they have to make their beds. We teach them about time – when to get up and to be on time for lunch. If they come in a few minutes late they miss it altogether. They also have to clean the table after eating. Another thing we do is take them to a Mall.

<p>Because the organization governs the chain, careers are ever at risk of being short-circuited by behavior or attitude that doesn’t comply with the organization or is misinterpreted by them. Poverty fosters an aggressive exterior, which while serving them well on the street, might hamper their promotion up the chain. One player, having arrived to his Florida rookie league team only a short time before was part of an unfortunate incident that derailed his career:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A theft occurred from one of the player’s lockers and the team’s manager insisted on inspecting every player’s locker in order to find the stolen object. As he came down the line, Carlos, the young Dominican (who, by the way was innocent) felt increasingly threatened; so that as the manager got to him he grabbed a bat and stood blocking his locker and vowing to bash the manager if he touched the locker. His street senses overtook his ability to function within the context of a group, and this response was deemed sufficiently threatening and he was temporarily sent back to the DR. (Field notes, 20 January 1989)</p>

<p>The importance of cultural remediation (which includes language acquisition) cannot be overstated as a key factor in a player’s success. Remediation is layered. Former Los Angeles Dodger Director of Latin American Operations, Ralph Avila regularly encountered this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t tell you how many of these guys don’t know how to use a toilet! They want to step on the toilet seat (straddle it the way you do the pit in an outhouse) when they go to the bathroom. They don’t know how to flush. They need to learn about their own culture before we teach them about what goes on in the States!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1012690210390426">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some academies go beyond teaching hygiene and seek to give players some of the education they have missed. Sending them to school is rare, but on occasion, done. More essential is getting them to master the structure and routine that accompanies life in professional baseball and the US, which is why academies emphasize the minutiae of showing up on time, dealing with equipment, and listening to coaches. ‘The last thing these guys need is a coach who is a friend. They’ll walk all over him. We fired our manager because he just didn’t have the respect (read: distance) from the players. He wouldn’t discipline them!’, complained one International Academy Director.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1012690210390426">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Teaching about life in the US and what it will take to succeed in moving up the chain makes up much of the off the field training. Language acquisition is easily the most immediate and powerful barrier to cultural competence. The inability to do the most simple of things, such as ordering food at a restaurant or negotiating simple exchanges can make day-to-day existence in a host country quite alienating. The stories told by players are uniform in this regard. Latin American players will order the same dish for months on end because it is the only one that they can be certain of, ‘I ate chicken wings three times a day every day for months. I was too scared to try ordering something else. It’s now five years later and I still can’t eat chicken wings!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1012690210390426">11</xref></sup> So, too, are the accounts of players who look dumbly at police officers or clerks who ask them the most simple of questions. Team efforts to teach players English have met with somewhat limited success because of the overall low level of education of most players.</p>
<p>Sadly, it also serves to diminish their effectiveness on the field. Being able to communicate with your teammates (especially at certain positions) or the coaching staff is critical. Reporting and treating injuries, for instance, can seriously set back players if they do not deal with it in a timely manner. Yet, language barriers can not only aggravate injury, but fuel misunderstanding of the player. In trying to answer his manager’s question, ‘Can you pitch tonight?’ an injured Dominican pitcher wanted to say, ‘I can’t’ and let him know that he was hurt. Because of his too-limited command of English he mistakenly said, ‘I don’t want to.’ The manager interpreted this as a refusal to pitch, an unforgivable attitude that found its way into reports on the player.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1012690210390426">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Anthropologizing the chain</title>
<p>With any act of production there exists the possibility of introducing factors and/or interactions that can change the conditions under which production takes place and possibly alter the larger political-economic equation. As noted above, this awareness has been for the most part missing in the global commodity chain research; and the Dominican case seeks to reintroduce that element.</p>
<sec id="section14-1012690210390426">
<title>Unanticipated changes to the chain’s base</title>
<p>The reactions occurring between local and global entities are not always predictive. That <italic>buscónes</italic> have come to occupy such a powerful position in the chain was certainly not considered by MLB. As Dominican academies grew in numbers between 1987 and 1997, they began to draw ever-larger numbers of amateurs hoping to tryout and sign. In time, the tryout – rather than playing amateur ball – became the goal of young players. This, in turn had the effect of weakening amateur leagues around the country and hampering the production of new players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690210390426">Klein, 1991</xref>). Into this void stepped the <italic>buscón</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1012690210390426">
<title>Rise of the buscón</title>
<p>At present, <italic>buscónes</italic> (derived from the Spanish verb <italic>buscar</italic> – to seek, or seekers) locate and take over the development of younger players until they are old enough to seek a professional contract. <italic>Buscónes</italic> guide them through the tryout phase until they sign, at which point the <italic>buscón</italic> receives a share of the signing bonus (see below). Until the mid-1990s, however, <italic>buscónes</italic> played a very limited and marginal role as ‘bird dogs’ loosely affiliated with Major Leagues clubs who were paid a nominal sum ($50 or $100) for spotting talent and setting up a tryout. From these humble origins, <italic>buscónes</italic> evolved to become the most important brokers in the entire talent-productive scheme. It is solely <italic>buscónes</italic> who locate and initiate the manufacture the raw material that makes up the modern Dominican player. As such, <italic>buscónes</italic> function as gatekeepers and agents vis-à-vis the Major League Baseball establishment, but they must be understood more fully as trainers, surrogate parents, mentors and operators of academies as well.</p>
<p>The <italic>buscón</italic> must be able to find superior young players to groom. To that end, they make it their business to know where all of the best players are by developing a nationwide web of informants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1012690210390426">13</xref></sup> In the course of their scouring the island in search of talent they also have to negotiate with the families of prospects they bring into their programs. Considering that most Dominicans are economically hard-pressed, the possibility of having a son who may earn a relatively large sum from playing baseball is something that they readily embrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1012690210390426">14</xref></sup> Still, a <italic>buscón</italic>’s reputation is something that parents consider. Some, like Astín Jacobo of San Pedro de Macoris who has had over 40 players signed to professional contracts, are well known for their success and are sought out. A strong social bond forms between <italic>buscónes</italic> and families. It is not uncommon to have these bonds act as an extension of family and community ties; something that MLB has never fully understood.</p>
<p>Once the boy has committed to a <italic>buscón</italic>, he enters into a lengthy training period of anywhere from two to four or more years. The conditions will vary widely, but he will train daily; be fed (occasionally housed); and be supplied with equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1012690210390426">15</xref></sup> If the boy is talented, he will be showcased in Major League academies as soon as he is of age. The <italic>buscón</italic> oversees these tryouts and negotiates directly with the club. If and when a signing bonus figure is arrived at, the <italic>buscón</italic> concludes his relationship with the boy – taking his agreed upon percentage – and the player then enters the academy and the ranks of professional baseball.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1012690210390426">
<title>Buscón–MLB relations: Neoliberal as exception</title>
<p>Because they didn’t see it coming, the rise of the <italic>buscón</italic> has been something of an embarrassment for MLB. As it became apparent that the numbers of <italic>buscónes</italic> were swelling, MLB teams engaged in a campaign of slander, referring to them in the lowest possible terms, for example, ‘pimps’ and ‘thieves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1012690210390426">16</xref></sup> Failing to drive them out, the Commissioner’s Office tried to regulate them (govern them) in various ways (i.e. licensing them, or organizing them), also to no avail. The position of <italic>buscónes</italic> in the chain gives them leverage over all development. No one wants to, or knows how to do the work that is involved in this early stage of player development. <italic>Buscónes</italic> are also politically savvy, knowing how to play the nationalism card with Dominican media. MLB Santo Domingo Director, Ronaldo Peralta referred to this,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Remember, baseball goes with nationalism and is very important to Dominicans. If you try to regulate and affect their [<italic>buscónes</italic>’] economic interests, they will go to the press and say that you are against those who want to develop the next Sammy Sosa and David Ortiz. For you as a public official it would be devastating for your career if you didn’t protect them [<italic>buscónes</italic>].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1012690210390426">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence, in contrast to general US–Dominican relations, <italic>buscónes</italic>’ relations to MLB are markedly counter-hegemonic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1012690210390426">
<title>A greyer shade of pale</title>
<p>If the <italic>buscón</italic> represents a form of resistance to MLB dominance, it does so within the overarching continuation of MLB dominance. So while they do not derail or stall the process, they do represent a very important proviso: namely a precedent-setting development in which Dominicans have inserted themselves into the global commodity chain.</p>
<p>To understand the success of <italic>buscónes</italic> is to acknowledge the importance of the informal economy in developing economies: that is a vast grey area where governmental views of legitimacy and policy meet commoner’s social practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210390426">Klein, 2006b</xref>). Even those working in the MLB Commissioner’s Office in Santo Domingo understand that local governments are incapable of doing what we assume all governments should do. Commenting on the Dominican office that should oversee Dominican baseball, Ronaldo Peralta who heads MLB’s Office in the country comments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Dominican Baseball Commissioner should by law be regulating <italic>buscónes</italic>, but the reality is that they have never been willing or able to move on it. What the <italic>buscónes</italic> are doing is defending the informal way of doing business here. It is the most profitable way for most people to operate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1012690210390426">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When it comes to the production of elite labor such as professional athletes, the GCC is much more than a series of objective production steps. In the Dominican case, attempts at ‘governing the chain’ also reflect culturally contested notions of legitimacy and lead to counter-moves on the part of subalterns such as <italic>buscónes</italic> and players. The working strategy employed by MLB has been concerned with training a successful player – a wide-ranging series of efforts that center on altering the Dominican player through teaching him how to adopt North American notions of professionalism. We have seen, that if a player is to be successful and rewarded with both career and the trappings of legitimacy he must be malleable both on and off of the field. Yet, blindly following formal rules set down by the hegemonic power is, often times, not practicable for subordinates. The poor within a country like the Dominican Republic, who desperately need official access to basic resources to live a subsistence-level life, are generally denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690210390426">World Bank, 2006</xref>). This results in the establishment of the ‘informal economy’, a set of practices and institutions that form a shadowy system allowing those in need access to resources and other things. Often, practices in the informal economy wind up characterizing people as deviant, criminal or borderline by foreign standards, but is really a localized rational response to a foreign-based institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690210390426">Portes, 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1012690210390426">
<title>Identity fraud as optimizing opportunity</title>
<p>The contest between neoliberal efforts to govern the chain and Dominicans attempt to maximize their own interests continues a discussion that is referred to as the ‘anthropology of legality’. Within the world of MLB–Dominican relations altering birth certificates (making oneself younger by changing the date or taking the identity of someone younger) is fairly widespread among young prospective signees. A typical example is that of Jonathan Corporán, who signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2002 for $930,000. The Dodger scouting staff loved his size and throwing motion. Plus, he was 17 years old and could already throw a ball in the 92–93 mile per hour range which is already up to Major League standards (he would only get faster they reasoned). They needed only to confirm his age to complete the deal. The Dodgers spent months sifting through documents, even going so far as to hire a private investigator in an effort to verify his age. Eventually discrepancies surfaced, and the US embassy collected enough evidence to determine that fraud had been committed. Seventeen-year-old Jonathan Corporán suddenly became 21-year-old Reyes Soto. He still threw hard, however, so the Dodgers still wanted to sign him, but not for the $930,000 they originally discussed with what they thought was a 16-year-old. Rather, the 21-year-old was offered and signed for $150,000. Special Assistant to the Dodgers General Manager, Jeff Shugel was moved to quip, ‘I’m glad we have closure. He’s the same guy we thought was Jonathan Corporán. He just wasn’t Jonathan Corporán’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210390426">Klein, 2006b</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>A major effort in the Commissioner’s Office in the DR has sought to detect and punish those using false names and ages. In the months following the 9/11 attacks, the US State Department began closely screening documents of foreigners seeking entry into the US, and in that dragnet, some 325 Dominican players were discovered to have committed identity fraud of some sort. Currently, any player who is tentatively signed must have his identity and age confirmed. Only then can he receive his signing bonus and begin his time at the academy. In the face of stronger sanctions and increased likelihood of being caught, it would seem irrational for identity fraud to continue, but that is precisely what is happening (to the tune of as many as 20 percent of prospects being signed).</p>
<p>So, why would Major League Baseball push so hard to find 16½-year-olds in the Dominican Republic when they don’t sign Americans until they graduate high school? And, why would Dominicans persist in risking so much to appear as younger? If the drive to be signed as a 16½-year-old borders on obsessive, its origins are to be found in MLB’s economic policies. MLB fuels the system with its desire to pay handsomely for 16-year-olds Dominicans, while devaluing them as they age (a practice that is not followed in North America).</p>
<p>The following factors underwrite the desire to sign Dominicans at a younger age than their North American counterparts. Ralph Avila long ago observed that Dominican players require more time to physically and culturally develop.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1012690210390426">19</xref></sup> Since Latin American players do not have the luxury of playing in high school and college, statistics attesting to their skill level do not exist. Major League teams are, then, forced to rely upon two imprecise and risky forms of evaluation to sign a player: the tryout and physical projections of what they might play like once they mature. To offset the monetary risk, younger players are preferred.</p>
<p>Since many people in the DR do not get birth certificates until sometime after they are born, the system is easily manipulated to gain a document claiming that one is younger or a different person altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1012690210390426">20</xref></sup> Overall, while many cases are detected, many others still get through. Getting around regulations is part of an established and informal practice that many Dominican learn to do. Since the chain requires and pays for ‘youth’, Dominicans respond by providing it. Neoliberal agencies view this as a corrupt practice that must be rooted out and punished, but one that also paints Dominicans with that same brush; that is, as unethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690210390426">Klein, 2008</xref>). Hence, legality is used as part of the arsenal available to MLB to govern the chain.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Dominican case presents us with something that straddles Ong’s two views of neoliberal exceptions. The absence of the Dominican state in this global commodity chain allows for a powerful presence of MLB on the ground. Still, the chain has been modified, in this instance through the informal sector of Dominican society. What is important here is that Dominicans have both adapted to the chain and adapted the chain to their requirements.</p>
<p>A completely Dominican layer – the <italic>buscón</italic> – has been fashioned that serves in the capacity of gate keeping by being situated at the beginning of the chain. It is unregulated by MLB (or the Dominican government), and has withstood efforts to eradicate it and regulate/co-opt it. It evolved as an effort by Dominicans to accommodate the neoliberal presence of MLB, but required its unique properties so that it would allow for locals to engage in a meaningful way. Hence, the <italic>buscón</italic> player–production stratum is not an exception to neoliberalism, but it has changed the terms of business. Its informality – its relentlessness and malleability are its cardinal features and reasons for success, but it was not created outside of the neoliberal establishment that MLB represents.</p>
<p>The commodity chain model looks at the production of elite talent taking place internationally, yet as a single entity. Production is built around a centralized system that allows us to focus upon ‘governance’ as the key structural category. Adding a more critical examination has revealed the ways in which Dominican elements and practices compromise efforts at governance.</p>
