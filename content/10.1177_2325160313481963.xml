<p>As a diabetes educator you may not think of yourself as a researcher. You might even think of research as something beyond the scope of your abilities. However, you likely appreciate that there is a lot of research going on out there, and you may be interested in knowing what research findings might be used to enhance the work that you do.</p>
<p>Two types of research are prominently featured in national health care reform efforts aimed to improve patient decision making and health care outcomes, both of which are particularly relevant to diabetes self-management education (DSME). These are known as comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research. Each can give you important information on the value of DSME. Both share DSME’s focus on individualized and patient-centered care.</p>

<title>Comparative Effectiveness Research</title>
<p>Comparative effectiveness research (CER) is defined as a study that compares the results of 1 treatment to another for managing a problem. Studies usually compare 2 or more types of treatment, such as different drugs being used to manage the same disease. But CER can also compare 2 ways of delivering a treatment or service. It may even include information about the impact of not undergoing treatment at all.</p>
<p>CER can provide information about effectiveness, benefits, and harms of different treatment options. By design, the results are useful for making decisions about treatment because findings add very relevant information to the evidence base about treatment options. For example, several approaches might be taken to treat people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin. The impact of the various treatment options on postprandial glucose levels, A1C level, and incidence of hypoglycemia, for example, are all important factors to be considered. CER on this topic will take the highest quality research on this topic and distill the results down so that it is possible to see how the treatment options compare. Armed with this insight, you are in a strong position to work effectively with patients to determine the best individual treatment options.</p>

<title>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research</title>
<p>The Affordable Care Act created the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to conduct research that provides evidence-based information to support health decisions. The PCORI definition of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) is research that “helps people and their caregivers communicate and make informed health care decisions, allowing their voices to be heard in assessing the value of health care options.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The diabetes educator can use the information that PCOR and CER can provide for insight needed to inform patients about the risks and benefits of various approaches to treatment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To a certain extent, there is overlap between outcomes found in CER and PCOR. However, the aim of PCOR may be thought of as more focused on the patient. It strives to answer patient-centered questions such as:
<list id="list1-2325160313481963" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Given my personal characteristics, conditions, and preferences, what should I expect will happen to me?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are my options, and what are the potential benefits and harms of those options?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What can I do to improve the outcomes that are most important to me?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can clinicians and the care delivery systems they work in help me make the best decisions about my health and health care?</p></list-item>
</list></p>

</fig>
<p>Studies defined as PCOR address issues that are particularly important for treatment individualization. To a person with diabetes, this can be highly relevant, as evidenced by the recent joint position statement issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) on hyperglycemia treatment. This position statement concluded that several treatment algorithms are required to meet the diverse needs of people with diabetes. To put this into practice, an important first step is to help individuals understand that there are choices to be made. This is likely second nature to you because as a diabetes educator, you routinely engage with patients and work with them to make choices and set goals. PCOR findings can help you provide specific answers to patient questions rather than speaking in generalities, which can enhance your patient interactions and assist patient decision making.</p>

<title>Applications in Practice</title>
<p>The diabetes educator can use the information that PCOR and CER can provide for insight needed to inform patients about the risks and benefits of various approaches to treatment. The results from PCOR and CER can provide you with background to inform your practice, and then you can take it to the next level by helping patients articulate their preferences and needs through the use of motivational interviewing. This patient-centric approach is invaluable for determining what is right for the patient you may encounter.</p>
<p>One example is a comparative effectiveness review of current modes of intensive insulin therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily injections) and modes of blood glucose monitoring (real-time continuous glucose monitoring vs self-monitoring of blood glucose). Understanding the outcomes associated with each method can assist in explaining options to patients and in customizing treatment options for patients based on the evidence and on patients’ values and preferences.</p>
<p>You as a diabetes educator are well positioned to help patients understand the range of treatment options available and which is medically appropriate for them. The point of CER and PCOR is to provide the insight you need to be knowledgeable about the various interventions and strategies available. Combining this information with the needs of each individual allows you to more effectively work with the patient in determining the approach to treatment that is right for them.</p>
