<p>I am honored to represent you as President of New York State Council of Health-system Pharmacists. It is with great pride and humility that I accept the responsibility to lead this great organization.</p>
<p>First, let me start with a brief story of my professional journey. My professional life started in the early ’70s, at a time when finding a job in an institutional pharmacy setting was very difficult. I started as a full-time pharmacist at St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn, which later became Interfaith Medical Center. Maybe some of you remember Ralph DePalma, Jr., who was my Director at the time and the first elected President of Royal Counties. Mr. ‘D’, as I used to call him, gave me the opportunity to learn about institutional pharmacy practice and mentored me to become the Director of the pharmacy. He is the one who introduced me to the New York State Council of Health-system Pharmacists (NYSCHP). In 1993, I joined Brookdale Hospital under the Directorship of Seymour Katz, a name familiar to most. Seymour was a past President of NYSCHP and former State Board of Pharmacy member and encouraged me to take a leadership role in Royal Counties Society of Health-system Pharmacists. These two gentlemen were responsible for what I am today, for both my professional growth and leadership role in this professional organization. Unfortunately, neither is among us today, but their legacy will continue.</p>
<p>The pharmacy profession and health care in general are changing, creating new opportunities for pharmacists to focus on providing better patient care. Given the increasing number of medications, our aging population, and the growing cost of drugs, pharmacists play a key role in optimizing medication use and enhancing patient outcomes. It is a golden opportunity for pharmacists to expand their roles as patient care providers and create a new practice environment. </p>
<p>NYSCHP plays an important role in this practice transformation. During the last few years NYSCHP has made significant strides in a number of different projects. I will discuss our current status, goal and mission for each of these projects.</p>
<sec id="section1-0897190013490563">
<title>CDTM Bill</title>
<p>As you know, NYS CDTM bill finally passed in 2011, after a number of years of hard work. NYSCHP in collaboration with GNYHA and State Board of Pharmacy is working to implement the bill in practice settings. Clinical pharmacy practices have already been in existence for years, including at Brookdale, a recipient of last year’s ASHP Best Practice Award for Heart Failure Medication Management Clinic. Now is the time for institutions to transform these practices into a CDTM model. As we discussed at the last Summit, even institutions without a formal CDTM agreement, but with practices falling under the guidelines of CDTM, are encouraged to submit convincing data for presentation to the Board of Regents by January of 2014. Our goal is to practice CDTM beyond the sunset deadline, and also to expand the scope of the current practice. </p>

<sec id="section2-0897190013490563">
<title>Pharmacy Technician Bill</title>
<p>The pharmacy technician role is more important now than ever, with the changing scope of practice for the pharmacists and more emphasis on clinical roles. Safe medication use in this evolving climate requires qualified technicians for distributive functions in order to relieve pharmacists for clinical pharmacy activities. Unfortunately, in the state of New York, pharmacy technicians are classified as unlicensed personnel and are mostly trained on the job. To promote the practice of pharmacy, especially in institutions, there is a need for accepted standards for pharmacy technicians (eg, registration and certification and minimum required education). Both the New York State Assembly and Senate are considering a bill for pharmacy technician registration and certification. NYSCHP, GNHYA, and the State Board of Pharmacy are diligently working for the passage of this bill. NYSCHP will continue to work to seek the support of 1199 and PSSNY in this endeavor. Mandatory registration of all pharmacy technicians and certification through Pharmacy Technician Certification Board will promote safe pharmacy practice and protect the public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190013490563">
<title>PPMI</title>
<p>The ASHP Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative is a top priority to promote clinical pharmacy practices. Dr. Mark Sinnett is playing a key role in its implementation effort and has provided numerous lectures on PPMI. NYSCHP will continue to work with ASHP efforts in PPMI implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190013490563">
<title>Leadership Program</title>
<p>Customarily NYSCHP has offered an annual leadership program to prospective leaders. Greater emphasis on clinical practice evidenced by pharmacy school curricular changes, residency training, and board certification, position pharmacy professionals to interact more with other members of the health care team. Under Dr. Sinnett’s leadership, the council spent a lot of time improving the quality of its leadership training programs and also plans to offer longitudinal programs. If the younger generation of clinical pharmacists do not acquire proper leadership skills along with clinical skills, in 15-20 years, the pharmacy department in institutions will be administratively run by nonpharmacists. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190013490563">
<title>Educational Programs</title>
<p>NYSCHP developed a number of unique programs and courses to help pharmacists stay current and gain confidence to practice. NYSCHP membership gives pharmacists access to a wide variety of tools and resources to support their everyday practice. In 2006, under the leadership of Dr. Elizabeth Shlom, Director of Education, NYSCHP started to offer clinical skill workshop development programs. These programs are well attended and the demand is growing. NYSCHP plans to offer clinical skill programs regionally to facilitate participant access. The Council will look at the feasibility of implementing online courses as well. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190013490563">
<title>Strategic Planning</title>
<p>For any organization, proper strategic planning is a key to success. Stakeholders including past presidents of the council will be invited to a strategic planning retreat to prioritize the future direction and focus of the NYSCHP. Dr. Mark Sinnett has agreed to lead this project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0897190013490563">
<title>Membership-Championship Program</title>
<p>NYSCHP, like other ASHP affiliates, is concerned with membership enrollment. This was an important topic for discussion at the ASHP presidential retreat in Chicago last October. Last year, NYSCHP’s Championship program led by Frances Jordan was a great success. The Championship program has been extended to July 1st of this year. In order to increase enrollment, we look into the possibility of offering extended new practitioner membership for pharmacists who have held a NYS Pharmacists license for 5 years or less. We need to reach out to students and also seek faculty support to encourage students in NYSCHP activities. We plan to hold a retreat to reach out to pharmacy school deans for a formal meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>NYSCHP works in partnership with national and regional professional organizations and regulatory agencies to address contemporary pharmacy practice issues to advance the pharmacy profession. NYSCHP advocacy efforts with regulatory agencies ensure that pharmacist voices are heard when decisions are being made about the future of health professions in New York.</p>

<sec id="section8-0897190013490563">
<title>Drug Shortages</title>
<p>More than 2 years of shortages of critical medications have impaired the ability of health care providers to render essential patient care. Health care facilities, especially hospitals, are adversely affected by these shortages. The FDA, ASHP, State Board of Pharmacy, and GNYHA are all working to resolve this problem. Hospitals are having a hard time maintaining lifesaving drugs, such as crash cart medications. Most of the drugs, especially the prefilled syringes, are returned to the pharmacy unused and expired. The FDA needs to issue an emergency waiver for an extended expiration date of at least 6 months. Manufacturers should be mandated to conduct tests to validate these extended expiration dates. Even though the FDA and State Board of Pharmacy actions leading to recent closure of the IV compounding company NECC and suspension of the Ameridose facility were justified, this has further complicated the drug shortage crisis. NYSCHP in collaboration with ASHP, GNHYA and the State Board of Pharmacy will continue to advocate for an immediate solution to alleviate the drug shortage crisis and minimize the potential for patient harm. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0897190013490563">
<title>State Board of Pharmacy Regulations for Institutional Practices</title>
<p>As I mentioned before, the scope of practice of pharmacy has changed significantly for the last 30 years in the institutional setting, from routine prescription compounding and dispensing to providing more clinical services. Pharmacists are now involved in automated dispensing, robot IV admixture compounding, infusion pump libraries, and medication therapy management, all of which require specific guidelines. Questions posted through the NYSCHP Pharmacy Director’s listserv day to day provide evidence of the evolving practice of pharmacy. </p>
<p>With the support of 3 of our past presidents, Frank Sosnowski, Leigh Briscoe- Dwyer, and Kimberly Zammit, who are serving as members of the NYS State Board of Pharmacy along with Larry Mokhiber, Executive Secretary, also a friend of NYSCHP, we now have a unique opportunity to explore the possibility of having separate rules and regulations for the practice of pharmacy in institutional settings. </p>

<title>Our Partner, Industry Friends</title>
<p>NYSCHP appreciates the pharmaceutical vendors for providing us with their financial assistance. Without your active participation, it would be impossible to run this organization. Also, we must recognize the assistance from NYSCHP REF, under the leadership of Dr. John Manzo. We look forward to your continued support.</p>
<p>During my speech tonight, you have heard a number of times the word “patients.” My pharmacist colleagues, I cannot emphasize enough that in order to further our profession, like doctors and other health care givers, when pharmacists interact with a patient, they must think of them as “my patient.” We as pharmacists need to establish this bonding relationship if we are to move our profession forward. </p>
<p>I am very thankful to my Brookdale pharmacy family and the leadership at Brookdale Hospital for their support and encouragement to play an active role in professional organizations. Last year, around this time, Brookdale Hospital was going through turmoil and Brookdale’s identity was very much in doubt. Tonight, I am relieved, happy, and honored to lead this organization as a representative of the Brookdale family. </p>
<p>I would like to thank Vickie Powell, the chair of the nominating committee and her team for their confidence and trust in me to lead this great organization. They have not realized that in the history of NYSCHP, they have installed the oldest President. </p>
<p>I would like to thank our immediate past President Dr. Mark Sinnett for his leadership, especially in critical areas like CDTM, PPMI, and pharmacy technician development. There is lot to learn from his leadership style and it will be hard to match his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, let me recognize my wife Monu and our son Ashfu, daughter Sadia and daughter-in-law Easha for their support and understanding and allowing me to invest time in my professional growth. I would also like to thank my relatives and friends who are with us tonight for their support. </p>
<p>Our mission is to take NYSCHP to new heights. With your help, and with the steady leadership of the board and assistance from the council office led by Debra Feinberg, Executive Director, we will continue to further NYSCHP as a respected professional organization.</p>
