<abstract>
<p>What role do folk beliefs about human genetic variation play in racial categorization and evaluation? In two studies, the authors assessed or manipulated participants' estimates of the percentage of genetic material that human beings have in common and examined whether this variable would predict categorization (Study 1) and evaluation (Study 2) of faces that varied monotonically in Black–White racial composition. In both studies, participants with low (vs. high) genetic overlap beliefs implicitly perceived the boundary between races to be more discrete. These results remained significant even when controlling for such variables as Need for Cognition, political ideology, essentialist beliefs, and “entity” beliefs. These findings suggest that believing that all people possess similar (vs. different) genetic makeup may serve as a key assumption that shapes racial categorization.</p>

<p>For centuries, scholars and laypeople have used ancestral origins as a basis for classifying people into a small number of distinct racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611408118">Frederickson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611408118">Molnar, 1998</xref>). In contrast to this view, modern genomic science has indicated that people share all but a minuscule portion of their genetic information with everyone else on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611408118">Feldman, Lewontin, &amp; King, 2003</xref>). Moreover, when comparing across groups of people who self-identify with a particular race, researchers have found that the genetic variability that does exist tends to be greater <italic>within</italic> than <italic>between</italic> groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611408118">Marks, 2002</xref>). While contentious debates have raged in biomedicine as to whether the between-group differences that do exist indicate that “race” is a meaningful biological concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611408118">Risch, Burchard, Ziv, &amp; Tang, 2003</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611408118">Feldman et al., 2003</xref>), it is fair to say that laypeople’s use of the concept of race tends to extend beyond what is warranted by the genomic evidence.</p>
<p>In general, people treat racial categories as “natural kinds” that are good predictors of group members' personality and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611408118">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1948550611408118">Yzerbyt, Corneille, &amp; Estrada, 2001</xref>). This tendency is associated with stereotyping and prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611408118">Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611408118">Condit, 2008</xref>). Indeed, two of the primary cognitive hallmarks of stereotyping are an exaggerated tendency to perceive between-group heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611408118">Tajfel, 1978</xref>) and within-group homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611408118">Park &amp; Judd, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>If perceivers tend to view racial groups as natural kinds, what biological processes do they believe account for racial differences? Although considerable research has documented how such nonbiological concepts as “essence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611408118">Haslam &amp; Whelan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611408118">Keller, 2005</xref>) and “entitativity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611408118">Lickel et al., 2000</xref>) are related to racial bias, surprisingly little research has attempted to identify specific beliefs about human biology that might underlie the perceived naturalness of racial categories. The closest examples we have found are studies indicating that belief in race as a generally biological (vs. socially constructed) concept predicts greater prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611408118">No et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611408118">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>People may have more specific beliefs, however, about the biology of race. Research on essentialism has indicated that the “inductive potency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611408118">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>) of a social category is associated with the perception that it is <italic>biologically based</italic> and possesses <italic>discrete boundaries</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611408118">Haslam, Rothschild, &amp; Ernst, 2000</xref>). We suggest that, in people’s minds, DNA may be precisely the biological element that causes a racial group to have discrete boundaries and high inductive potential. Although shared genetic material is by no means the sole basis that people use to classify populations (e.g., culture, occupation, age), there is good reason to believe that people consider genetics to be a particularly compelling basis for group differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611408118">Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, in press</xref>). In particular, people appear to ascribe greater immutability and less control to genetic causes than to situational or behavioral causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611408118">Monterosso, Royzman, &amp; Schwartz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611408118">Schnittker, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611408118">Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2006)</xref> found that women who were provided with a genetic explanation for sex differences in math achievement exhibited stronger stereotype threat effects than those who were provided with an experience-based explanation. Presumably, the perceived immutability of genetic (vs. experiential) causes contributed to this phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1948550611408118">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We assumed that people possess widely differing beliefs about what the genomic record actually says about human differences. A “low genetic overlap” perspective holds that although people with different ancestral origins may share enough DNA to qualify as members of the same species, they also possess significant genetic differences. These differences are presumably expressed across a broad range of physical traits (e.g., skin and hair color) and psychological traits (e.g., intelligence and aggression). Others, however, may hold the “high genetic overlap” perspective that all humans possess highly similar genetic profiles. According to a strong version of this perspective, similarity at the individual level is already so close to 100% that any added effect of group membership is negligible. Thus, those who adopt this perspective would consider traditional race categories to be less useful when it comes to identifying and understanding specific individuals.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611408118">
<title>Effects on Discrete Versus Continuous Implicit Categorization</title>
<p>The purpose of the present studies was to examine whether such beliefs predict differences in the encoding of human faces. Because race-phenotypic features vary continuously between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611408118">Marks, 2002</xref>), many individuals appear racially ambiguous. Just as the mind efficiently disambiguates stimuli that are perceptually ambiguous (e.g., a Necker cube), perceivers often categorize ambiguous-race faces into discrete categories with little effort or awareness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611408118">Halberstadt, Sherman, &amp; Sherman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611408118">Peery &amp; Bodenhausen, 2008</xref>). The accumulated data also suggest, however, that there are individual differences associated with this tendency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611408118">Eberhardt, Dasgupta, &amp; Banaszynski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611408118">Malahy, Sedlins, Plaks, &amp; Shoda, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In Study 1, we tested whether beliefs about genetic overlap would predict degree of continuous versus discrete racial categorization. We did so by presenting participants with a series of faces that had been digitally morphed to vary continuously between Black and White and then measuring the degree to which subjective racial categorization conformed to the objective change in racial composition.</p>
<p>Why might different a priori assumptions about genetic overlap predict differences in the racial categorization of faces? Building on the long tradition of research indicating that stored assumptions and expectancies help perceivers to disambiguate ambiguous stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408118">Bruner &amp; Minturn, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611408118">Palmer, 1975</xref>), we suggest that the assumption that races are genetically distinct creates an expectancy of clear between-category boundaries. This, in turn, should establish a comparatively firm perceptual threshold where one category ends and the other category begins. The “either/or” nature of this threshold should encourage the assimilation of racially ambiguous targets into one category or the other.</p>
<p>In contrast, perceivers with a high overlap belief consider racial categories to be comparatively fuzzy and indistinct. (Consider that if there is 99% overlap between two categories of any kind, the category labels become relatively nondiagnostic.) Thus, high overlap participants should be less inclined to “shoehorn” ambiguous faces into a specific racial category.</p>
<p>In Study 2, we examined whether these differences in encoding would extend to evaluative bias. While believing in greater between-race differences need not necessarily translate into evaluative bias (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611408118">Park &amp; Judd, 2005</xref>), we assumed, based on the literature on Social Identity Theory, that a belief in significant Black–White distinctiveness would lead people to feel more entitled to express anti-Black bias. We develop this hypothesis further in the introduction to Study 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1948550611408118">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>To measure discrete versus continuous implicit race categorization, we used a modified version of the “two-back,” short-term memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611408118">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). (For validation information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611408118">Sedlins, Malahy, &amp; Shoda, 2010</xref>.) This task assumes that once a face has been subjectively categorized into one race, it becomes more easily confusable with same-race faces than with other-race faces (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611408118">Taylor et al., 1978</xref>). From participants' pattern of confusion rates, one may infer which faces were mentally grouped into the same racial category.</p>
<sec id="section3-1948550611408118">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Eighty-four undergraduate participants (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 19.91, 39 females, 61% White, 22% Asian, 9% Latino, 4% Black, 4% “Other”) participated in exchange for course credit.</p>
<sec id="section4-1948550611408118">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>To create the morphed faces, we selected nine Black and White face pairs from a standardized set of face photographs (cropped from the eyebrows to the upper lip; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611408118">Goff, Eberhardt, Williams, &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>). These faces were digitally combined (using the program FantaMorph) to generate three continua of faces ranging from prototypically Black to prototypically White. Each continuum was comprised of seven face types: 0% Black–100% White, 16.67% Black–83.33% White, 33.33% Black–66.67% White, 50% Black–50% White, 66.67% Black–33.33% White, 83.33% Black–16.67% White, and 100% Black–0% White. (From here on, for ease of exposition, percentages will be reported only in terms of percentage of Blackness. Thus, “33.3% Black” stands for “33.3% Black–66.7% White.) Pilot testing indicated that the faces were viewed as equivalent in age, realism, and attractiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1948550611408118">
<title>Two-Back Task</title>
<p>Participants were presented with two types of stimuli, faces and numbers between 1 and 7. On the first trial, a randomly selected stimulus of one type (e.g., a 33.3% Black face) was presented for 1,000 ms followed by a blank screen for 500 ms. On the second trial, a randomly selected stimulus of the other type (e.g., the number 3) was presented for 1,000 ms. This alternating sequence continued for the rest of the session. On each subsequent trial, the target (either a number or a face) remained on the screen until the participant indicated whether it was the same as the last stimulus of that type. For example, if the stimulus on a given trial was a face, participants indicated if it was identical to the last face presented. On each trial involving faces, the computer drew from the seven-face continuum randomly assigned to each participant. Participants were encouraged to respond quickly; if their average RT across any three trials exceeded 1,500 ms, a prompt appeared on the screen asking them to respond faster. After each trial, a blank screen was presented for 500 ms. The procedure continued until participants were presented with all of the 49 possible sequences of faces at least once. Participants completed an average of 93.13 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.24) trials. Confusion rates were calculated for each of the six neighboring pairs on the racial percentage continuum (e.g., confusions between 100% Black and 83.33% Black, 83.33% Black and 66.67% Black, and so on.).</p>
<p>In theory, strict categorical perception suggests a threshold point where all faces on one side of the threshold are considered White and all faces on the other side are considered Black. For example, if a person perceived all faces with 50% or more Blackness as “Black,” then confusion between a 33% Black face and a 50% Black face should be low because they would be perceived as belonging to separate categories. On the other hand, a 50% Black face and a 66.7% Black face should be highly confusable with each other because they should be grouped into the same category. Put differently, two faces with percentages near the middle of the continuum (50% Black vs. 33% Black) should be less confusable with each other than two clearly Black faces (100% Black vs. 83% Black) or two clearly White faces (100% White vs. 83% White). This would result in a V-shaped curve.</p>
<p>Because a belief in genetic distinctiveness implies an expectation of clear phenotypic differences, low genetic overlap participants should display exactly this sort of strict perceptual threshold. In comparison, the confusion rates of the high overlap participants should be less influenced by the racial composition of the faces. This is because, as noted, an assumption of high overlap between races renders the category labels less meaningful. Presumably, for these participants, memory for a given face would be driven less by perceived category membership (“That was a Black face”) and more by its idiosyncratic features (“That face had high cheekbones”). Note that the prediction involves a relative difference; we did not expect high overlap participants to be oblivious to racial composition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1948550611408118">
<title>Assessment of Genetic Overlap Beliefs</title>
<p>At the end of the session, participants completed a battery of questionnaires, some of which were relevant to the present study. Our critical measure assessed beliefs about human genetic overlap by asking: “If you were to choose two people at random from the entire world, what percentage of genetic material would they have in common? (0–100%).” Participants also completed the Need for Cognition Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611408118">Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982</xref>), the Need for Closure scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611408118">Webster &amp; Kruglanski, 1994</xref>), and a political orientation item (1 = <italic>very liberal</italic> to 7 = <italic>very conservative</italic>). We included these measures to investigate whether beliefs about genetic variation would predict differences in implicit racial categorization independently of these variables known to predict processes related to stereotyping and prejudice.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section9-1948550611408118">
<title>Genetic overlap beliefs</title>
<p>Overall, participants' mean estimate of genetic overlap was 56.01% (<italic>SD</italic> = 41.62). (Four participants did not complete the item, leaving a total of 80 participants.) This item was not significantly correlated with the covariate measures, although the correlation with the Need for Cognition scale approached significance (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>

<title>Memory Confusions</title>
<p>To assess whether confusion rates across the racial percentage continuum varied as a function of belief in genetic overlap, we followed the method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611408118">Van Breukelen and Van Dijk (2007)</xref> for assessing within-subjects effects with a continuous independent variable. Participants' confusion rates were submitted to repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the six face-pairs as the within-subjects variable and genetic overlap belief (continuous, centered) entered as a covariate. The benefit of this analysis is that it allows a continuous variable to be used as a predictor in a repeated-measures analysis. Political orientation, Need for Cognition, and Need for Closure were also included as covariates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611408118">2</xref></sup> The only significant effect was the genetic overlap belief × face pairs interaction, <italic>F</italic>(5, 425) = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .03. There were no significant effects involving any of the other covariates.</p>
<p>For the purpose of examining the effect within each group, we conducted a median split on the genetic overlap scores. As is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611408118">Figure 1</xref>, the two groups displayed divergent patterns. The error rate of the low overlap group was highly influenced by the racial composition of the faces, <italic>F</italic>(5, 185) = 17.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .32. This effect was significantly smaller for the high overlap group, <italic>F</italic>(5, 205) = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .07.</p>

<p>For the low overlap participants, simple effects comparisons revealed that the error rate decreased between pair #1 and pair #2, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 7.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and again between pair #2 and pair #3, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 2.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. There were no differences in error rate between pair #3 and pair #4, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 0.40, <italic>p</italic> = .21, and a slight further decrease between pair #4 and pair #5, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The error rate <italic>increased</italic> significantly between pair #6 and pair #7, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 5.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>In contrast, for the high overlap group, error rates decreased between pair #1 and pair #2, <italic>t</italic>(390) = 4.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but for each of the remaining adjacent pairs, the error rates were equivalent (all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1.44).</p>
<p>This pattern provided initial evidence that beliefs about the percentage of shared genetic material predict implicit racial categorization. The pronounced V-shaped pattern displayed by low overlap participants may be taken to reflect a more dichotomous representation of the categories Black and White. That is, low overlap participants frequently confused perceived Blacks with other perceived Blacks and perceived Whites with other perceived Whites. They were less likely to confuse perceived Blacks with perceived Whites. This suggests that their memory for a given face was significantly guided by racial cues. In contrast, high overlap participants' confusion rates were not appreciably affected by racial percentage. This suggests that their memory for each face was less guided by racial cues and based more on idiosyncratic features. That these results were not explained by a relationship between the genetic beliefs item and the other predictors of stereotyping suggests that such beliefs represent an independent influence on race categorization.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>In Study 2, we examined whether the categorization effects found in Study 1 would extend to evaluative bias. In theory, an individual may believe that two racial groups are distinct but evaluatively equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611408118">Park &amp; Judd, 2005</xref>). However, the considerable literature on Social Identity Theory and Social Categorization Theory suggests that the very act of cognitive grouping––even based on trivial differences––produces differences in the evaluation of ingroups versus outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611408118">Tajfel, 1978</xref>). People with a low overlap belief do not consider genetic differences trivial. Thus, a belief in low genetic overlap may represent a particularly strong justification for prejudice and encourage the association of Blacks with negative concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611408118">No et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611408118">Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, in Study 2 we sought to manipulate beliefs about shared genetic material for two reasons. First, doing so would provide evidence that these beliefs cause the hypothesized patterns. Second, if those randomly assigned to the high genetic overlap condition showed weaker implicit associations between Black targets and negative concepts than did those in the low genetic overlap condition, this could have noteworthy practical implications for prejudice reduction programs (a topic we return to in the General Discussion).</p>
<sec id="section13-1948550611408118">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Study 2 was conducted over two sessions held 1 to 4 weeks apart. In Session 1, 95 participants (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 19.0, 71 females, self-identified ethnicity: East Asian 41%, Middle Eastern 24%, White 19%, Latino 9%, Black 4%, and “Other” 3%) completed a battery of questionnaires relevant to group perception which included: (a) political orientation, (b) the Genetic Determinism Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611408118">Keller, 2005</xref>), which assesses the degree to which individuals believe that humans have “essences” that are biologically determined, and (c) the Implicit Theories Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611408118">Dweck, 1999</xref>), which assesses the degree to which individuals view human personality as fixed versus malleable.</p>
<p>In Session 2, participants were randomly assigned to one of two belief conditions. In the high overlap condition, participants read a page-long passage, adapted from an actual <italic>American Psychologist</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611408118">Ossorio &amp; Duster, 2005</xref>), indicating that humans share 99.9% of their genetic material. The analogy was made between races and social clubs. In the low overlap condition, the passage was kept as similar as possible but certain words and numbers were modified to indicate that genetic overlap is low (21.4%). The analogy was made between races and families. (See Supplemental Appendix found online at http://spp.sagepub.com/supplemental for the complete text.) After reading their assigned passage, participants completed several manipulation check items including “In your estimation, if you drew two people at random from the entire world, what percentage of genetic material would they have in common? (Please indicate a percentage from 0% to 100%.).”</p>
<p>Following the manipulation, we assessed implicit racial bias with the evaluative priming technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611408118">Fazio, Dunton, Jackson, &amp; Williams, 1995</xref>). The procedure unfolded in three blocks, comprising 385 total trials. On the first block, the computer presented a randomized series of positive and negative words from a list of words that had been previously pretested for positivity or negativity (e.g., “delightful” and “disgusting”). Participants' task was to categorize as quickly as possible each word as positive or negative. On the second block, participants were presented with a randomized series of faces. In this study, we used a five-face continuum (0% Black, 25% Black, 50% Black, 75% Black, and 100% Black) in the interest of time. Participants' task in this block was to classify each face as Black or White.</p>
<p>On the critical third block, on each trial, the computer drew randomly from the entire pool of faces to present a <italic>face prime</italic> for 315 ms, followed by a 135 ms interval before the presentation of one of 12 positive or 12 negative <italic>target words</italic>. A 2.5 s interval separated each trial. After an initial 10-trial practice block, participants completed four blocks of 60 trials. Thus, over the course of the 240 total trials, each of the five types of faces in the continuum was paired with a total of 48 target words––approximately 24 positive words (each of the 12 positive words twice) and 24 negative words (each of the 12 negative words twice).</p>
<p>Participants' task was to categorize the target word as positive or negative by pressing one of two keys. In general, people exhibit greater facilitation for negative words when preceded by a Black face than by a White face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611408118">Fazio et al., 1995</xref>). Given the findings of Study 1, we hypothesized that participants in the low overlap condition would display a clear discontinuity such that faces up to a certain percentage of Blackness would be evaluated as White, but beyond that point would be treated as Black. This would be reflected by a discrete “jump” in response latencies to negative target words at a specific point on the racial percentage continuum. In contrast, we expected that the implicit evaluations of those in the high overlap condition would remain relatively constant and uninfluenced by the racial composition of the face primes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section15-1948550611408118">
<title>Genetic belief manipulation</title>
<p>Computerized randomization led 53 participants to receive the high overlap passage and 42 to receive the low overlap passage. The manipulation check items indicated that the manipulation was successful: High overlap subjects' estimates of the percentage of genetic material people have in common (<italic>M</italic> = 88.43) were significantly higher than those of low overlap subjects (<italic>M</italic> = 37.27), <italic>t</italic>(93) = 8.48, <italic>p &lt; .</italic>001.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1948550611408118">
<title>Calculation of facilitation or inhibition</title>
<p>From participants' log-transformed response times, we calculated facilitation/inhibition scores for each of the five face types. First, baseline RTs were averaged from trials in which participants were asked to categorize words without seeing any face primes. Next, the effect of each face prime on classification of positive and negative words was indexed by a facilitation or inhibition score calculated by subtracting RTs to words following the presentation of a face prime from baseline RTs for those words. Thus, scores greater than zero meant that a face prime resulted in faster categorization of a word relative to baseline (i.e., when no face prime was presented). Latencies for any trials on which the participant made an error (i.e., labeling a negative word as positive) were not included in the calculations (2.31%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1948550611408118">
<title>Implicit evaluation</title>
<p>To examine how racial composition of face primes influenced response times to positive and negative target words, we conducted an ANCOVA with the following independent variables: (a) genetic overlap condition (between-subjects, high vs. low), (b) face prime (within-subjects, 5 levels ranging from 0% Black to 100% Black), and (c) target word valence (within-subjects, positive vs. negative). Scores on the political orientation, the Genetic Determinism, and Implicit Theories measures were included as covariates. This analysis yielded the predicted three-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4, 292) = 2.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .03.</p>
<p>To examine the nature of this interaction, we assessed positive and negative words separately. For positive words, there were no significant effects, all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.02, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .40. For negative words, however, there was a marginally significant genetic overlap condition × face prime interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4, 408) = 1.80, <italic>p</italic> = .07. Thus, the remaining analyses focus on the negative words.</p>
<p>Examining each genetic belief condition separately, the low overlap group exhibited a significant overall effect of face prime on response times to negative words, <italic>F</italic>(4, 164) = 3.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .10, whereas the high overlap group did not, <italic>F</italic>(4, 208) = 0.22, <italic>ns</italic>. For those in the low genetic overlap condition, response times to negative words were significantly faster when preceded by the 25% Black face than when preceded by the 0% Black face, <italic>t</italic>(372) = 3.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. However, there was no additional facilitation for negative words when preceded by faces with Black composition over 25%, all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 0.49, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .63. That is, these participants made no distinction between a 25% Black face and a 100% Black face. This pattern may be taken as evidence of dichotomous racial categorization; at some point before 25% Black, the faces were categorized as Black, perhaps reflecting the “one drop rule” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611408118">Halberstadt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611408118">Peery &amp; Bodenhausen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The pattern differed for the high overlap participants. Each increase in percentage of Blackness produced no change in facilitation for negative words, all <italic>t</italic>s &lt; 0.77, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .43.</p>
<p>In sum, only participants in the low overlap condition displayed a discrete “jump and plateau”; at some point between 0% Black and 25% Black they began to treat the faces as “Black.” Participants in the high genetic overlap group maintained a constant level of facilitation, regardless of racial percentage.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Traditionally, laypeople have tended to assume that races possess clear either/or boundaries. Our data suggest that (a) there are individual differences in this tendency and (b) a relatively straightforward manipulation may override such individual difference and generally induce participants to view race in a less dichotomous manner. In particular, participants who believed that there is low (vs. high) genetic overlap implicitly categorized (Study 1) and evaluated (Study 2) a continuously varying array of Black and White faces in a more dichotomous fashion.</p>
<p>These findings advance the literature on race perception in three principal ways. First, in Study 1, by asking participants to provide a numeric estimation of genetic overlap, we have begun to operationalize more concretely––in terms of shared genes––how people mentally represent the “natural” or “biological” aspect of race. Second, these studies represent the first time researchers have used a monotonic race continuum to test whether assumptions about genetic variation influence perceptual thresholds for racial categories.</p>
<p>Third and perhaps most important, the finding that genetic overlap beliefs may be manipulated in the laboratory suggests that people’s intuitions about genetics and race are not firmly held. Thus, interventions that teach principles and findings of population genetics may represent a novel and effective approach to reducing racial bias. For example, typically, when human genetics is discussed in the media, the focus is on interindividual or intergroup <italic>differences</italic>. These differences occur, however, within the minute spectrum of genetic material that is nonoverlapping. Thus an intervention that focuses participants on the high degree of genetic overlap, rather than the small degree of difference, may promote the tendency to group all humans in the same biological category.</p>
<p>Previous findings have suggested that any variable that draws perceivers' attention to group differences amplifies processes associated with stereotyping (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979) while any variable that draws attention to between-group commonalities attenuates such processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611408118">Crisp &amp; Hewstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611408118">Hong et al., 2004</xref>). The present findings add to this literature by isolating a particularly compelling basis for perceived sameness or difference: genes. While a direct comparison of the relative persuasiveness of messages advocating group differences due to genes versus social factors is beyond the scope of the present paper, there is, as we have noted, good reason to believe that genetic differences are viewed by perceivers as especially relevant to perceptions of group essence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611408118">Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, in press</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>First, given that the world’s population is becoming increasingly multiracial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611408118">Lee &amp; Bean, 2004</xref>), it will be essential for researchers to use methods such as those used here to look beyond the categories Black and White and assess the extent to which people’s lay beliefs about race apply across a wider range of racial categories. Moreover, these ideas may be extended to the sexes: to what extent do beliefs about the genetics of sex differences contribute to sexism?</p>
<p>Second, the dependent measures in these two studies focused on cognitive and evaluative processes. Current studies in our laboratory are examining the relationship between genetic beliefs and a wider range of behavioral measures, including shooting decisions on a policing stimulation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611408118">Correll et al., 2007</xref>) and readiness to initiate cross-race friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611408118">Page-Gould, Mendoza-Denton, &amp; Tropp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, a belief about the <italic>amount</italic> of between-group genetic variation is only one of several relevant beliefs about race and genetics one could assess. Future research should examine, for example, beliefs about the degree of covariation among multiple traits (i.e., “concordant variation” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611408118">Ossorio &amp; Duster, 2005</xref>) and beliefs about the historical transmission of genetic traits over geographical space (i.e., “clinal variation,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611408118">Marks, 2002</xref>). In so doing, one might gain a clearer and more precise sense of what people believe about the intersection of race and genetics.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to stress that our focus on “cold” cognitive structures like folk beliefs is not intended to deny that stereotyping and prejudice often have ideological and/or motivational roots (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611408118">Henry &amp; Sears 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611408118">Kay &amp; Jost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611408118">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>). However, people without a strong motivation for prejudice––and even those with professed egalitarian ideals––frequently display signs of racial stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611408118">Amodio, Devine, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611408118">Myrdal, 1944</xref>). We suggest that people with egalitarian ideals may still exhibit stereotyping at least partly because they harbor particular assumptions about genetic variation. Future research should examine whether people with more ideologically rooted forms of racism may be comparatively resistant to messages claiming that all people are, genetically speaking, nearly identical.</p>
