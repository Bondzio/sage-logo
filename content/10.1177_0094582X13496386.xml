<abstract>
<p>The stability of the Mexican state in comparison with the rest of the Latin American nations paradoxically contrasts with the recurrent emergence of guerrilla organizations. The activities of the Ejército Popular Revolucionario (Popular Revolutionary Army) are part of this paradox, representing what has been called a “recurrent guerrilla war” that takes advantage of the cracks in the hegemony of the state. What is new about this situation is that today the hegemonic crisis is not merely regional but nationwide.</p>

<p>Analysis of the twentieth-century Mexican state reveals a remarkable difference from the majority of states in Latin America. While Central and South America show a pattern of fragile democracies followed by military regimes and a high frequency of coups, Mexico has had an authoritarian but remarkably stable regime based on broad consensus. There have always, however, been social sectors and regions in which there was discontent. Beyond the setbacks suffered by the hegemonic Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party—PRI), some of which, such as that of the popular student movement of 1968, opened important cycles, the governments that inherited the Mexican Revolution seem to have enjoyed good health until 1988, when the rupture of the historical pact established by the revolution inspired a regime-shaking schism.</p>
<p>The historical pact of the revolution rested on a sui generis version of the welfare state and authoritarian control of the labor and peasant movements and on the growth of the urban middle class—in sum, on a distribution of wealth that had its ups and downs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13496386">Tello, 2010</xref>). This pact was observed unevenly throughout the country; there were areas in which the pact was replaced by bossism, violence, and the most extreme forms of despoliation. Perhaps for this reason, a study of one of Mexico’s most important guerrilla groups, the Ejército Popular Revolucionario (Popular Revolutionary Army—EPR), traces its origins not to 1996, when it first appeared, but to the Villista, Zapatista, and Jaramillista struggles. The EPR sees itself as heir to many of the Mexican guerrilla movements that preceded it (EPR, August 30, 1997; June 30, 1999; December 31, 2000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13496386">1</xref></sup> While the postrevolutionary Mexican state managed to establish the hegemony required to consolidate a strong nation-state, there were areas in which that hegemony was challenged, causing fractures in the legitimacy of the state in which guerrillas carried on their struggles.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13496386">
<title>Unequal Hegemony</title>
<p>In speaking of hegemony we are referring to domination by a ruling class that is not just a matter of coercion but one of the dual path pointed to by Machiavelli (the Prince as a centaur, half-human, half-beast) and taken up by Gramsci in his <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic>. Hegemony is coercion plus consensus but mostly consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13496386">Bobbio and Bovero, 1986</xref>: 88; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13496386">Gramsci, 1975</xref>). It takes place when a ruling class manages to present its interests as those of the nation as a whole and the subaltern classes adopt those interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13496386">Gramsci, 1975</xref>: 25–124; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13496386">Gutiérrez, 2009</xref>: 3). Hegemony is simply the incorporation of the rage of the oppressed into a reactionary program that constructs the “social optimum” as a fluid relationship between the state and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13496386">Zavaleta, 1986</xref>: 63–74). We start from the idea of an expanded state, the union of political and civil societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13496386">Gramsci, 1975</xref>: 25–124). In contrast to other Latin American states, which were for significant periods of time founded on repression, the Mexican state created the ideological and material bases for a remarkable hegemony based on the ideology of the Mexican Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13496386">Córdova, 1985</xref>) and a political system that combined repression with prebendalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13496386">Bartra, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13496386">Córdova, 1972</xref>). To be able to consolidate itself as a state, the postrevolutionary elite built a new legal structure that provided it support and legitimacy. It undertook negotiations with subaltern groups, offering privileges to the peasant and working classes. A massive agrarian reform that acknowledged peasants’ right to own the land and the recognition of labor unions and labor rights such as the minimum wage, regulated working hours, and the right to strike and to assemble were established in the 1917 Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13496386">Roux, 2005</xref>: 114, 142).</p>
<p>During the six years of Lázaro Cárdenas’s administration (1934–1940), 20 million hectares (25 percent of the total) of land were distributed. Beyond this, the agrarian reform involved a revolution in forms of land ownership. The land was distributed as ejidos, which meant that the recipients could use it and pass it on but not sell it. The proportion of agricultural land in ejidos increased from 13 percent in 1930 to 40 percent in 1940, while the proportion of agricultural production represented by ejidos increased from 13 percent to 51 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13496386">Tello, 2010</xref>: 160). Although the pace of land reform decreased as the Mexican Revolution wound down, by 1982, when neoliberalism was established, PRI governments had handed out another 60 million hectares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13496386">Tello, 2010</xref>: 213). Agrarian reform was the material foundation of political control in the countryside—hegemony expressed as consensus among millions of Mexican peasants.</p>
<p>The governments of the Mexican Revolution (as PRI administrations called themselves) also attended to the material bases of hegemony among the working class. The evolution of the minimum wage shows the preservation of the purchasing power of real wages between 1941 and 1956. In addition to land reform, one of the pillars of the social contract that gave great stability to the Mexican political regime was a stable quality of life for the working class. The proportion of nonagricultural income represented by wages was maintained and even increased over time before declining with the introduction of neoliberalism and economic crisis to its 1952 level. The reforms brought about by the Mexican Revolution also had social effects: between 1940 and 1980, the illiteracy rate declined from 53.9 to 16.6 percent and the number of years of schooling for individuals over 15 years of age increased from 1.7 to 5.4, while infant mortality dropped from 159.5 to 53.0 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy increased from 41.5 to 70.0 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13496386">Tello, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The hegemony of the postrevolutionary elite was organized through the consolidation of corporate control devices including the PRI, the Confederación de Trabajadores de México (Workers’ Confederation of Mexico—CTM), the Confederación Nacional Campesina (National Peasant Confederation—CNC), and the Confederación de Organizaciones Populares (Confederation of Popular Organizations—CNOP). These state institutions served to unify local and regional parties and provided a hierarchical organization for bosses and leaders across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13496386">Bartra, Huerta, et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13496386">Monsiváis, 2000</xref>: 959–962). With these elements the postrevolutionary elite built an image of a nation that contained the promise of a just society, one that allowed the reproduction and maintenance of economic and citizen equality. The construction of Mexican revolutionary nationalism was ideologically based on humanism, the cult of heroes, the recovery of the past, and the return to roots as an element of civic pride, on the confrontation of the new with the old, on modernity, on the recovery of popular art, and on the pursuit of progress as a national goal. Progress, the ruling elite pointed out, required national unification. Revolutionary nationalism was constructed and reproduced through culture, music, the visual arts, literature, and state-provided basic education that sought to reduce the illiteracy rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13496386">Monsiváis, 1984</xref>: 721; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13496386">2000</xref>: 1048–1049; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13496386">Vizcaino, 2002</xref>: 268).</p>
<p>The hegemony of the Mexican state was not, however, homogeneous. This highly regionalized country consists of many Mexicos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13496386">Gledhill, 2003</xref>: 210), and state hegemony was constructed in different ways and to varying degrees in different areas. There were areas that the dominant power did not fully reach—in which unequal conditions of development and the presence of the state created local hegemonies that allowed the perpetuation of the ruling elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13496386">Maldonado, 2001</xref>: 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13496386">Rubín, 2003</xref>: 129, 132, 134).A central element in the maintenance of these regional hegemonies was the consolidation of local political bosses who served as agents of domination and aided in the construction and consolidation of the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13496386">Maldonado, 2003</xref>: 81). These bosses established relations with national elites through the consolidation of networks that allowed them control of national and local political posts; they remained regional expressions of power and mediated in favor of the communities they represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13496386">Bartra, 1978</xref>: 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13496386">Maldonado, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This inequality in the presence of the state across regions explains the existence of niches in which there was a hegemonic crisis; a state that was not quite hegemonic was plagued by authoritarian abuses that caused guerrilla outbreaks against regional powers. Not all the armed revolutionary movements in the country were local or regional, however; the October 2, 1968, massacre led to the rise of guerrilla groups that spurred a national movement.</p>

<title>Guerrilla Movements Against the Postrevolutionary State</title>
<p>The emergence of the EPR on June 28, 1996, was not an isolated event. The history of the postrevolutionary state was characterized by the emergence of guerrilla movements seeking regional and/or national transformation via armed struggle. Revolutionary armed movements in Mexico can be divided into three cycles. The first gave rise to Jaramillismo in the state of Morelos, which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s as an offshoot of the Mexican Revolution (its members having belonged to Emiliano Zapata’s army). A second came as the victory of the Cuban rebels against the Fulgencio Batista regime in 1959 spread the revolutionary spirit across Mexico and Latin America. These first two guerrilla cycles took place in the context of postrevolutionary regimes with hegemonic gaps across various regions of the country that, from a leftist viewpoint, can be seen as an expression of the end of the Mexican Revolution. The third cycle emerged during the 1980s, with the dismantling of the welfare state and the establishment of neoliberalism. Mexican guerrillas no longer occupied the hegemonic cracks of postrevolutionary governments; now they arose in the context of a general hegemonic crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra, 2010</xref>). This crisis allowed for the development of the Partido Revolucionario Obrero Campesino Unión del Pueblo–Partido de los Pobres (Revolutionary Workers’ and Peasant People’s Union Party–Party of the Poor—PROCUP-PDLP) and the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista Army of National Liberation—EZLN). The economic crisis of the period contributed to the EPR’s operational capacity and growth.</p>

<title>Hegemonic Fracture After the Introduction of Neoliberalism</title>
<p>The PRI’s hegemony was based on a state ideology, a system of social control, mediation through prebendalism, and repression. National hegemony was linked to local and regional hegemonies or the absence thereof and, in that regard, involved bossism, violence, and despoliation. This situation began to change substantially in 1982, when the Miguel de la Madrid administration (1982–1988) broke the historical pact. From this point on, as is epitomized by Carlos Salinas de Gortari’s 1988 fraudulent victory, the PRI’s national hegemony quickly declined. This process ended with the triumph of Vicente Fox of the Partido de Acción Nacional (National Action Party—PAN) in the 2000 presidential election. The PRI’s hegemonic crisis was followed by that of neoliberalism, which became evident with the electoral fraud of 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra and Sosa, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the Mexican state was immersed in a series of economic and political changes that transformed it from a welfare state into a neoliberal one. The days when the state organized and promoted national development were left behind. Development-oriented policy entered a period of imbalance framed by the 1973 international oil crisis, which exacerbated Mexico’s social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13496386">Français, 2000</xref>). In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X13496386">Raymond Vernon (1969)</xref> warned, the economic model that sustained the golden age of the PRI was showing signs of stagnation in the 1960s. The economic crises of 1976 and 1982 bore out his claims and led to the rupture of the historical pact that had given so much stability to the postrevolutionary regime. The implementation of neoliberalism changed the role of the state, previously a promoter, planner, and guarantor of social welfare. It no longer generated jobs, distributed revenue, or led the country’s development but consolidated an international elite with the introduction of foreign capital. Working conditions became precarious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13496386">Français, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13496386">Tello, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The hegemonic crisis of the neoliberal system was a result of its inability to guarantee economic well-being and political stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra, 2010</xref>). The growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) during the neoliberal period was 2 percent compared with the 6 percent attained during the period of state-based development. Unemployment rates had risen; in 2006, 3.5 percent of the economically active population were unemployed, and this increased to 4 percent in 2007 and 5.43 percent in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13496386">INEGI, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the rates of development and promotion of education in Mexico were very low, since the state allocated only 0.5 percent of the GDP to science and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13496386">Rombiola, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The hegemonic crisis facing the state was evidenced by the decline of the postrevolutionary PRI elite, the consolidation of the PAN elite, and the emergence of guerrilla movements such as the EZLN and the EPR. Beyond this, it led to the 2004 emergence of the movement headed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13496386">Acéves and Figueroa Ibarra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra and Martino, 2008</xref>). In this context, the celebrated Mexican transition to democracy after the defeat of the PRI and the rise of the PAN to the presidency soon began to show its limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13496386">Anguiano, 2001</xref>). In fact, the democratic transition was tested during the 2006 elections and found wanting, given the electoral fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13496386">Figueroa Ibarra and Sosa, 2010</xref>). Some analysts have observed that Mexico has “an entrenched authoritarian regime that refuses to disappear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13496386">Anguiano, 2010</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>During the golden age of the PRI and its predecessors, national hegemony was articulated with local and regional hegemonies or the absence thereof. During neoliberal times, the national hegemonic crisis reached every corner of the nation and increased the regional possibilities for guerrilla movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0094582X13496386">
<title>The Impact of the EPR</title>
<p>The EPR is a classic guerrilla movement that upholds Marxism-Leninism, the contributions of popular war, and the republican ideals of equality, justice, and democracy. Its Marxist-Leninist stance promotes a party composed of militants with theoretical and military training whose role is to lead the revolutionary process. Its political-military strategy is based on military actions against the state, the police, and the army and on ideological proselytizing. Its military actions have a moral/ethical foundation in the defense of public safety (EPR, December 2, 1996; January 1, 2001).</p>
<p>In the beginning, the EPR’s actions were continuous, and it established committees in other states. After 1997, as a result of an internal crisis regarding methodological, tactical, and ideological differences that led to a split between militants, its operational capability diminished. After its first national congress in 2000, it was able to rethink its struggle, initiating a period of political press releases and dissemination of information. In 2008 it managed a reactivation on a national and international level, but since then its military activity has again declined and its political activity has consisted of press releases and, probably, clandestine work to consolidate support bases.</p>
<p>The EPR has pointed out that its priority is to open up political arenas. The military actions of the early 1990s were an essential element, since harassment of the military is a feature of guerrilla strategy. The armed movement was initially able to generate a series of linked actions, but these diminished after its internal crisis and were never recovered. This is important because reduced military activity may indicate structural weakness, possibly as a result of state violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13496386">Gilberto López y Rivas (1999)</xref> has noted that “the federal government and the armed forces [in Guerrero and Oaxaca] maintain a counterinsurgency strategy the main objective of which is the neutralization or the extermination of the EPR and the ERPI [Ejército Revolucionario Popular Insurgente (Insurgent People’s Revolutionary Army)].”</p>
<p>The rise and decline of the EPR’s operations are attributable to both external and internal factors. Its vast operational capacity in 1996 was the result of a social environment that favored its growth, since the PRI elite was undergoing internal conflict. This fracture of the elite contributed to the economic crisis that deepened the precariousness and misery of the population and the state’s inability to deal with the political conflict generated by the Zapatista uprising. The growth achieved by the EPR in 1996 was, however, limited by internal conflict and by its inability to join forces with other subversive groups.</p>
<p>The disputes among the various guerrilla movements across the country have to do with rigid and narrow views of the way the struggle should be carried out. Movements such as the EPR, the EZLN, the ERPI, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias del Pueblo (People’s Revolutionary Armed Forces—FARP), the Ejército Villista Revolucionario del Pueblo (People’s Villista Revolutionary Army—EVRP), the Comité Clandestino Revolucionario de los Pobres–Comando Justiciero 28 de Junio (Clandestine Revolutionary Committee of the Poor–June 28 Righteous Command—CCRP-CJ28J), and the Tendencia Democrática Revolucionaria–Ejército del Pueblo (Democratic Revolutionary Tendency–People’s Army—TDR-EP) often see themselves as the sole bastions of the truth and judge actions that differ from their views on struggle wrong. While the EPR is a hierarchical, rigid, and authoritarian movement and therefore has seen the departure of militants who disagree with its methods, tactics, and strategy, it has recognized the need to establish alliances with other rebel groups in the country and the world. It was itself the result of the unification of militants from other organizations disabled by the state.</p>
<p>As far as EPR doctrine is concerned, there is an apparent ideological contradiction in the fact that it calls, on the one hand, for a radical socialist transformation and, on the other, for a national project with a number of reformist political, economic, social, educational, cultural, and environmental features. It fights for a democratic republic with popular sovereignty in which the country’s wealth is exploited for the benefit of the people. However, it proposes the coexistence of private property with cooperative property rather than its dissolution. Similarly, it seeks not to eliminate wage labor but to establish a new source of employment offering fair wages. This apparent ideological contradiction is due to its conception of the transformation process, which it sees as a matter of stages. It seeks to establish a socialist society and, later, communism (aspects on which it touches only briefly), but this transition is seen as a gradual process following a stage consisting of the establishment of a welfare state (EPR, June 3, 1994; June 28, 1996; December 2, 1996).</p>
<p>The EPR has created committees in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoacán, Tabasco, Chiapas, Hidalgo, the Valley of Mexico, Veracruz, Puebla, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato. The committees’ capacities for action vary; for example, the Tabasco EPR operated only in 1996, and those of Chihuahua and Guanajuato have seen very little activity. While the committees are primarily in the South, they still constitute a limited movement that has failed to become a repository and a guide for social discontent.</p>
<p>The EPR had a significant social impact in Guerrero during the 1990s, and this provided it with national influence. Its substantial presence in Guerrero and Oaxaca shows that although it is national in approach it has mostly blossomed regionally. The decline of its operational capacity as a result of the internal crisis indicates that it has failed to generate the influence that would consolidate it nationally. The existence of EPR committees in different states does not add up to a momentous impact on society. This is partially due to the fact that it emerged differently in the various regions, not always articulating local struggles with its national political project. Most state committees were sponsored by militants from outside who saw political opportunities for growth, but this did not ensure that growth. This was very evident in Tabasco, where the movement noted favorable elements for the revolutionary struggle but these did not guarantee its expansion.</p>
<p>Despite its limited social presence, the EPR has had an impact on national politics via harassment actions that have affected national and foreign capital such as the explosions in the Petróleos Mexicanos pipelines. Its political impact is based on the ideological and military training of its militants, allowing it to perform planned actions that damage the interests of the ruling elite without affecting the population. Nowadays it prioritizes the political route over the military one in response to the country’s social and political condition. Given the violence and repression caused by the state’s war on drugs, the EPR has opted for the construction of political routes that will help it to survive the nation’s gradual militarization. Violence has become a problem affecting not only the rebels but the general public and has led to peaceful and legal protests such as the one headed by the poet Javier Sicilia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13496386">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>For a number of reasons, the hegemonic crisis has not turned the EPR into a broad movement with strong national growth and presence. First, the Mexican state has managed to contain the various active guerrilla groups in the country through its security measures. Secondly, neoliberalism still generates strong consensus among the population. Thirdly, the PRI elite still has effective control in certain regions of the country, and these areas still have the structures of domination set up at the end of the 1910 revolution. Fourthly, the power gaps in some states have been occupied by drug cartels and paramilitary groups. Finally, social discontent has also been concentrated by the EZLN, the movement of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and the electoral process.</p>
<p>Although the EPR has had its ups and downs, it is not dead. The state has been unable to dismantle it because it exploits available opportunities to cement its struggle such as the declining legitimacy, often to the point of ungovernability, of the state. The ruling elite, unable to consolidate its hegemony through consensus, has sought to resolve the crisis through militarization. This has led to the emergence of popular expressions that seek to create democratic spaces of social demand. The presence of protest movements in Guerrero and Oaxaca makes these regions key areas for the EPR.</p>

<title>Regional Cracks: the Paths of the EPR</title>
<p>Where there is hegemony, individuals feel reflected in the state, and introjection of the dominant discourse makes them guarantors and perpetuators of its power. The Mexican state’s dominance has always had significant regional fissures. Guerrero has been a palpable example of this and therefore an important breeding ground for rebellion, and it was in Aguas Blancas, Guerrero, that the EPR appeared. The revolution failed to provide land and freedom in Guerrero. The <italic>porfirista</italic> authorities were replaced by regional bosses whose policies benefited the ruling elite while oppressing the people. The elite was unable to establish itself as a ruling power, and rebellious popular movements emerged. During the 1950s and 1960s, a teachers’ movement managed to assemble workers, peasants, and students in an attempt to overthrow governor Raúl Caballero Aburto (1957–1961). The Guerrero elite responded with violence and repression that led to the radicalization of certain sectors of the population. During the 1960s and 1970s, Génaro Vázquez’s Asociación Cívica Nacional Revolucionaria (Revolutionary National Civic Association—ACNR) and Lucio Cabañas’s Partido de los Pobres (Poor People’s Party—PDLP) played an important role. The state managed to disable both movements, but the survivors formed the PROCUP-PDLP during the 1980s and the EPR in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The reasons Guerrero poses such a problem for the Mexican state are as follows: First, there are few legal avenues for the expression of popular demands for social, economic, and political improvements; the state government has repressed popular protests and manipulated the electoral process. Secondly, most of the population lives in poverty and marginalization. These two features create a breeding ground for rebellion. A relationship of political forces has become consolidated among indigenous peoples that the federal government has failed to integrate into its hegemonic project on terms of equality, respect, and cultural tolerance. Guerrero is inhabited by indigenous groups with a strong communal worldview that generates organizational capacity and has led to movements seeking to defend their traditions, forms of organization, cultures, languages, and hierarchical structures.</p>
<p>Given the state’s inability to solve Guerrero’s economic, social, political, and environmental problems, residents have created alternatives to state institutions. Community police forces, indigenous radio stations, and peasant organizations such as the Organización Campesina de la Sierra del Sur (Peasant Organization of the Southern Sierra) have become sites of popular demand and struggle. They play an essential role in the consolidation of a democratic society in that they nurture the people’s role as a political actor—as a source of power. The existence of these movements is important for the EPR, although it is not their source. Mainly, guerrillas have greater opportunities in rebellious areas with unresponsive governments. Although the operational capacity of the EPR in Guerrero declined considerably after its internal crisis of 1997–1998, conditions in the state are conducive to its reactivation.</p>
<p>Oaxaca is another key area in the EPR struggle and has an important genealogy of rebellion. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13496386">Hannah Arendt (1970</xref>: 39), the support of the people gives national institutions their power, and that support is simply a continuation of the agreement that initially allowed the promulgation of the laws in question. In Oaxaca the social bond between leaders and those they govern has been fractured. A gradual process of institutional exhaustion has led to a popular struggle against the regional authorities. Popular movements have repeatedly fought against state leaders. In 1947 students, market vendors, and businesspeople carried out demonstrations with the aim of preventing tax increases, but these demands changed during the process and came to include the deposition of Governor Edmundo Sánchez Cano (1944–1947). During the 1970s sectors of the population demanded the dismissal of Governor Manuel Zárate Aquino (1974–1977), who tried to remain in power through the use of force. In 2006 a teachers’ movement managed to concentrate the dissatisfaction of various sectors of Oaxacan society, leading to a struggle for the dismissal of Governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz (2004–2010). The movement crystallized around the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca Popular (Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca—APPO), a key element in the political-military life of the EPR.</p>
<p>In 1996 the Oaxacan EPR was almost as strong as the Guerrero committee. Its capacity for action significantly increased in 2006 with the emergence of the APPO. The APPO was socially, politically, and ideologically heterogeneous, and it would be nonsense to claim that it was a cover for the political action of the EPR. Although the APPO failed to achieve its main goal (the removal of Ruiz Ortiz), it undoubtedly generated the social and political conditions for the emergence of opposition struggles. It created political consciousness in a broad sector of the population that strengthened the teachers’ role as subjects of social struggle. The APPO movement was a sort of barometer that allowed the EPR to investigate the political and social situation and determine whether Oaxaca could accommodate an insurrection (EPR, June 4, June 12, and June 14, 2006; August 22, 2006; October 1, 2006).</p>
<p>Since the EPR is a work in progress, it would be inappropriate to try to assess whether it has been successful. It has been weakened as a guerrilla force, but this has not led to its demise. It still has life in it and political opportunities to strengthen its struggle. It and other guerrilla movements in Mexico constitute a form of resistance that, where there is popular support, will persist until the economic, social, political, and cultural conditions that generate them change.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13496386">Carlos Montemayor (2007)</xref> has pointed out that guerrilla warfare in Mexico has been recurrent. For almost half a century it has generated knowledge of struggle and rebellion in social sectors that have experienced violence and state repression. This history of rebellion is an important part of the construction and operation of the EPR. It is not the result of a sudden or ephemeral process but part of a social and historical one. It is the result of the reconfiguration of guerrilla movements that the state had gradually disabled and militants who had managed to survive but were left without operational capacity. These earlier guerrilla movements contributed to some extent to a gradual erosion of the legitimacy of the Mexican state. The revolutionary process of 1910 managed to establish an institutional and ideology-based power that was able to consolidate a nation-state. This hegemony was, however, unevenly implemented across the country, leading to national and regional hegemonies that sustained each other.</p>
<p>The guerrilla groups that emerged from the 1940s to the 1970s were local movements in rebellion against regional powers. In contrast to this, the emergence of the EZLN and the EPR in the 1990s and that of other currently active guerrilla groups evidences a national hegemonic crisis, one resulting from the neoliberal project’s failure to satisfy the economic and political needs of the population. Neoliberalism weakened the state by substantially weakening its capacity for hegemony. Mexican guerrillas today operate in a different context from that of the past. In the past guerrillas that had a social base (and were not just the ideological product of urban, usually middle-class groups) were local or regional insurgencies. Now they confront a state that has been significantly fractured by neoliberalism. Although hegemony has unexpected avenues such as the electoral manipulation of poverty, the EPR and other Mexican insurgencies enjoy more fertile ground than in the golden times of enviable stability of the Mexican political regime.</p>
