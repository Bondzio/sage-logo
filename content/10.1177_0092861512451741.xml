               <italic>Objectives:</italic> The objective of this study was to evaluate the linguistic validity of the French Canadian Work Productivity and Activity Impairment–General Health questionnaire (WPAI-GH). When ill, employees may take a sick day (absenteeism) or work despite the illness and experience a loss of efficiency (presenteeism), which may then result in organizational productivity loss. The WPAI-GH, a leading measure of work productivity indicators, was not previously tested among French Canadians for clarity of translation and item comprehension. Before using a French translation of an available US-English questionnaire, the linguistic validity must be established to ensure its conceptual equivalence to the original as well as establishing cultural appropriateness. <italic>Methods:</italic> A French Canadian translation of the US-English WPAI-GH was produced through a reiterative process in which harmonized forward and back translations were created by independent translators. French-speaking subjects residing in Canada self-administered the WPAI-GH and were subsequently debriefed by a bilingual (French-English) interviewer. <italic>Results:</italic>Thirty French Canadian subjects were interviewed, all of whom were employed at the time. The group was stratified by educational level, including an equal number of participants with and without a high school degree. Responses to hypothetical scenarios indicated that the French Canadian version adequately differentiates between sick time taken for health and non-health reasons as well as differentiations between absenteeism and presenteeism. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> The linguistic validity of the French Canadian translation of the WPAI-GH was established among a diverse French Canadian population, including those with minimal education.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>To establish comprehensive health-related patient measures, it is important to assess health-related work productivity loss, including both absenteeism (when an employee takes a sick day from work for health reasons) and presenteeism (when an employee attends work while ill and experiences decreased work efficiency). Although a number of instruments exist that are helpful in categorizing the effect of illness and efficacy of treatment on work productivity,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512451741">1</xref>

            </sup> there are no reports of linguistic validation for use among French-speaking workers in Canada within the existing body of literature. Moreover, there are no reports in the literature on the validation of general health measures used to assess the health-related work productivity losses among this population.</p>
         <p>In Canada, both the French and English languages share official status. As of mid-2009, there were an estimated 7.2 million French speakers in Canada, roughly 21.6% of the population.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512451741">5</xref>
            </sup> According to the 2006 Canadian census, 6.6 million Canadians speak French as the primary language within the home; less than 100,000 use both English and French predominantly within the home.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512451741">6</xref>
            </sup> Developing a valid measure of work productivity loss for the sizable French-only (or French-dominant) population is essential to conducting health economic studies that are representative of Canada’s entire workforce.</p>
         <p>A majority of patient-reported outcome measures are developed in an English US setting; this is the case for the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire–General Health version (WPAI-GH) and all of its derivatives. The WPAI-GH is a patient-reported outcomes instrument created to measure the amount of work time that is lost and a decline in productivity resulting from health issues.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512451741">7</xref>
            </sup> Although Canada’s demographic structure is similar to that of the US, there are many notable differences, such as a slightly older population, a substantially higher migration rate, a higher unemployment rate, and less disposable income.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512451741">8</xref>
            </sup> The Joint Canada/US Survey of Health conducted by Statistics Canada and the US Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics revealed several key differences in health status, risk factor distributions, and access to medical care between adults in Canada and those of the United States. A lower level of satisfaction with health care among Canadians, longer wait times as an obstacle to receiving care, a higher incidence of daily smoking, a lower proportion of obese adults, and a lower usage of prescription drugs among the middle-aged all contribute to a health scene in Canada that is distinctive from the situation in the United States.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512451741">9</xref>
            </sup> These structural and medical differences, compounded with the sociolinguistic differences present among French speakers in Canada, make linguistic validation through cognitive debriefing vital.</p>
         <p>Ideally, results from work productivity questionnaires for French-speaking Canadians can be pooled with those from English-speaking Canadians, since a Canadian English translation of the WPAI-GH was developed in 2006 and linguistically validated for widespread use in 2007. To achieve this, it is important that both translations closely follow the concepts outlined in the source instrument (US-English). Accordingly, linguistic validity must be established through a reiterative process involving the creation of a harmonized forward translation as well as a back translation. The forward translation is completed by two translators, who each independently translate the questionnaire. Following their independent translation, the translators discuss each item of the translation until they reach consensus on a single harmonized translation. A third and independent translator, with no knowledge of the English source text, will then “back translate” the questionnaire into English on their own. This back translation is then reviewed by a team consisting of a project manager and survey research expert. During review, the team will “reconcile” the forward and back translation in order to achieve conceptual equivalency with the source text. The project manager, survey research expert, and translators then work to reach consensus and agree on a final translation of the document. Once a comprehensive translation is confirmed, cognitive debriefing interviews are conducted among a diverse pool of subjects to confirm their comprehension of the individual survey items, the cultural appropriateness of all concepts, and their comfort with the flow of the questionnaire in the target language.<sup>

            </sup> Finally, psychometric testing of the translation is needed to establish the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the measures in the translation.</p>
         <p>Psychometric testing of French Canadian questionnaires is frequently reported,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512451741">14</xref>

            </sup> but less attention has been paid to the crucial intermediate step of cognitive debriefing. When the cognitive debriefing of new translations is conducted for only a handful of subjects,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512451741">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512451741">21</xref>
            </sup> the resulting information may be useful for improving the translation, but the effect of pertinent demographic characteristics, such as educational level and regional variations in the target population, cannot be evaluated.</p>
         <p>To test a means by which to assess work productivity in Canada’s French-speaking population, we selected the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, which assesses time missed from work as well as work and activity impairment due to general health problems (WPAI-GH) or a specified health problem (WPAI-SHP) during the past 7 days.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512451741">22</xref>

            <title>Linguistic Validation</title>
            <p>Linguistic validation is a process that is conducted to confirm that a translated version of a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaire is acceptable for use in a different cultural context. Without this careful translation development and subsequent cognitive debriefing, there is no reasonable certainty that the adapted instrument is conceptually equivalent to the original and can also be understood by any individual entering a clinical trial.</p>
            <p>The linguistic validation process begins with a harmonized translation created by two separate translators; the harmonized translation subsequently is provided to a third translator who translates the text back into English. Both the harmonized translation and the English back translation are reviewed by a project manager, a survey research expert, and an in-country clinician, taking into consideration comments from all translators; adaptations to the translation are made as needed. Once the final translation has been approved, it is discussed during a series of cognitive debriefing interviews held in-country, with native speakers of the language of varying demographic and educational backgrounds, to check for conceptual equivalence, clarity, and cultural appropriateness.</p>

            <title>Subject Enrollment and Study Design</title>
            <p>Persons who were currently employed, living in Canada, fluent in French for Canada, and at least 21 years of age were eligible to participate in this study. Subjects were recruited by a bilingual interviewer who ascertained that French was the primary language of the subject. Subjects were stratified by education (less than 12 years of academic education vs 12 or more years of academic education); one-third of the sample had less than a high school education. Furthermore, subjects were selected to be diverse with regard to age, gender, occupation (white collar vs blue collar), and self-reporting having/not having a health problem interfere with activities during the past 7 days. No personal information, such as names or addresses, was collected in order to maintain anonymity.</p>
            <p>Qualified subjects self-administered the WPAI-GH and answered additional demographic questions as part of the study protocol. Following completion of the questionnaire, a trained bilingual interviewer debriefed subjects on the phone, or in person, to assess the subjects’ ability to paraphrase the WPAI-GH instructions and questions. Any misinterpreted item, incorrectly paraphrased item, or incorrect response identified by subjects during the debriefing interview was recorded by the interviewer. A hypothetical question was inserted to test the subjects’ understanding of the need to decipher between sick day absences for non-health reasons and absenteeism for health reasons. Subjects who could not understand the task presented in the hypothetical scenarios after minimal probing were excluded from the analyses of these questions.</p>

            <title>Questionnaire</title>
            <p>The WPAI-GH consists of 6 questions that elicit the following information: employment status, hours missed due to health problems, hours missed due to other reasons, hours actually worked, and the degree to which health problems affected productivity while working (presenteeism) and regular daily activities, on a scale from 0 to 10. Scores for absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work productivity loss (combined absenteeism plus presenteeism), and impairment in regular daily (nonwork) activities, such as work around the house, shopping, child care, exercising, studying, and so on, are derived from the 7-day period preceding administration of the questionnaire. Scores are expressed as a percentage of impairment/productivity loss, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. As described earlier, the French Canadian version was created from the English US version using standard translation procedures for questionnaires.<sup>

            <p>After the subject paraphrased the question (“During the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of your health problems?”), the interviewer posed the following hypothetical question: “If you took a sick day, that is, called in sick, but weren’t really sick, how would you have answered this question about hours missed due to health?” Subjects that indicated they would include sick time taken that is not the result of health problems failed to grasp this hypothetical scenario and were excluded from the resulting analysis.

A total of 30 subjects, who declared French as their primary language, were enrolled in the study. The majority was female (70%); the mean age was 43.3 years. The mean level of educational attainment was 13.7 years (with a range of 11 to 18 years of education). Slightly more than half of the subjects worked in a white-collar occupation (53%). Female subjects had a lower average education level (13.4) than male subjects (14.3). However, both were equally likely to have less than 12 years of education (33% for both groups).</p>

               <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512451741">Table 3</xref> shows these results as split by occupational level. It is apparent that blue-collar workers reported higher rates for absenteeism and presenteeism, while both groups reported similar scores in the categories of work productivity loss and activity impairment. This finding reconfirms reports in the literature of higher absenteeism and presenteeism rates among blue-collar workers than among white-collar workers.<sup>

If you took a sick day, that is, called in sick, but weren’t really sick, how would you have answered this question about hours missed due to health?” Interestingly, all 5 of the subjects that responded incorrectly were college educated and had 14 to 16 years of education. Four of the 5 subjects were white-collar employees who worked in the professional job category, and 1 was a blue-collar employee who worked as a precision production and crafts worker.

            <p>Although this is a relatively new area for research, the authors have been investigating the linguistic validity of patient-reported outcomes research for a number of years, with several ongoing projects in related areas. In 2004, Corporate Translations began performing linguistic validations of the WPAI-GH questionnaire in various language-country pairs. The first phase of the project was the validation of the US Spanish translation, resulting in a study published in 2006.<sup>

               </sup> During this same period of time, we also collected data on the English US WPAI-GH as a control. Predictably, the results of the Spanish study mirrored those of the validation of the French Canadian WPAI-GH, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512451741">Table 4</xref>. This similarity suggests that the questionnaire was well understood by subjects in all three language settings that were explored and that the WPAI-GH employs concepts that are valid across language and cultural borders.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>To date, there are no reports of linguistic validation for use among French-speaking workers in Canada within the existing body of literature. Moreover, there are no reports in the literature on the validation of general health measures used to assess the health-related work productivity losses among this population. To evaluate the usefulness of the WPAI-GH in this population, we conducted cognitive debriefing interviews among a diverse sample of employed subjects after self-administration of the French Canadian version of the WPAI-GH. We found that concepts in the French Canadian WPAI-GH questionnaire were readily understood by French-speaking subjects, even among those with minimal education.</p>
         <p>The comprehension rate was comparable to the rate for English subjects who were debriefed as a control in a previous study involving the US Spanish version of the WPAI-GH. No errors were revealed in the French Canadian translation. Subjects confirmed their answers to the self-administered questionnaire during follow-up interviews. Though they were given an opportunity to revise their responses as necessary, no subject elected to exercise this option.</p>
         <p>Subjects were given the opportunity to review their self-administered responses during the follow-up interview; both language groups displayed a very low response revision rate, independent of the subject’s level of education. The limited number of revised responses seems to be a result of random error, rather than any educational or linguistic effect. These results are in line with the assertion of Reilly et al that the interviewer-administered WPAI yields more valid results than self-administered questionnaires.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512451741">16</xref>
            </sup> They also suggest that the random error rate could be pushed even lower and the comprehension rate elevated even higher with interviewer-administered questionnaires in those cases where the additional effort and expense can be justified.</p>
         <p>As an additional test of comparability between the French Canadian and the English US versions of the WPAI-GH, a hypothetical question was posed to subjects regarding work time missed and productivity at work. Nearly all subjects stated that they would exclude sick time taken for non-health reasons despite the fact that by answering this question about work time missed for health reasons, they were admitting to an inconsistency. This attitude suggests that WPAI-GH self-reported sick time provides a more accurate and responsive metric of health-related absenteeism among both French Canadian and English US subjects than do data obtained from employment records, which often tabulate non-health absences as health related. These findings are consistent with research conducted on the WPAI for irritable bowel syndrome (WPAI-IBS) that found support for 99.5% of hours missed due to IBS during debriefing.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092861512451741">26</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Responses to hypothetical questions about productivity at work indicate that some subjects in both language groups integrated absenteeism in their tabulations of presenteeism, while others included non-health factors in their tabulations of absenteeism. Since the latter group originally paraphrased the presenteeism question correctly, we speculate that this may be, at least in part, an artifact of the ambiguities inherent in the hypothetical scenario and that such subjects did in fact understand the underlying concept of excluding absenteeism.</p>
         <p>Additional insight into the subjects’ understanding of the key concepts of absenteeism and presenteeism was gleaned through the inclusion of a hypothetical scenario, which leads us to believe that this approach could represent a useful methodology when determining the linguistic validity of other health outcome questionnaires.</p>
         <p>Accordingly, the linguistic validation of the French Canadian WPAI-GH provides a promising tool for measuring absenteeism and presenteeism in the large and economically significant French-speaking population of Canada.</p>
