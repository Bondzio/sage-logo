<abstract>
<p>Recent advances in social neuroscience show that many social phenomena can be traced back to neural processes. Major limitations and contributions of social neuroscience for a better understanding of social phenomena are considered. Social neuroscience is currently guided primarily by psychological notions and theories, thus making it inappropriate for solving sociological problems. Brain research for sociology can be increasingly useful within a branch we call neurosociology. Incorporation of data from cognitive and neuroscience may clarify the low-level structure of social phenomena and contribute to our understanding of social mechanisms. The notion of social status/role is taken as a possible subject of neurosociological research. A number of low-level brain structures and processes are shown to be relevant for the sociological notion of status/role. Examples include findings concerning the possible role of mirror neurons and oxytocin in social cognition and behavior. The idea of modularity is considered as a source of particular neurosociological hypothesis. It is also argued that the study of the neural system may contribute to a better understanding of social categorization, stratification and other macrosociological questions.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Les avancées récentes en neuroscience sociale montrent que l’on peut chercher l’origine de plusieurs phénomènes sociaux dans des processus neurologiques. L’article s’intéresse aux principaux apports de la neuroscience pour une meilleure compréhension des phénomènes sociaux. La neuroscience sociale est à l’heure actuelle principalement guidée par des notions psychologiques et des théories qui la rendent inapte à la résolution de problèmes sociologiques. Le recours de plus en plus fréquent aux recherches sur le cerveau est cependant possible dans un domaine que nous appelons neurosociologie. L’utilisation des données des sciences cognitives et neurologiques peut éclairer la structure des phénomènes sociaux et permettre de mieux comprendre l’action des mécanismes sociaux. La notion de statut/rôle est envisagée ici comme sujet de recherche neurosociologique. L’auteur montre qu’un certain nombre de structures et de processus du cerveau sont pertinents pour cette notion. Le rôle des neurones miroir et de l’oxytocine dans la cognition et le comportement social est donné en exemple. L'idée de modularité est examinée en tant que source possible des hypothèses neurosociologiques. L’auteur défend aussi la thèse que le système neuronal puisse contribuer à une meilleure compréhension des catégories sociales, de la stratification sociale et d’autres questions macrosociologiques.</p>

<p>Recent advances in neuroscience have prompted only a weak response in the social sciences, which could be due to its highly ambitious claims. A number of fast-growing fields such as social neuroscience and neuroeconomics are getting to the heart of psychology, economics and, inter alia, sociology. These fields deal with problems common in social sciences, such as stereotypes and prejudices, interpreting and reconstructing the Other’s position and intentions, as well as values and reward-orienting behavior. However, social scientists do not seem very interested in brain research, despite the fact that, for example, authors submitting manuscripts to the journal SCAN (<italic>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</italic>) are instructed to present their studies ‘in language that makes their implications for the social sciences clear’.</p>
<p>Of course, this issue can be seen as another chapter in the long-standing debates around the relations between social and natural sciences. In the general discussion around the subjects and methods of social sciences, the introduction of social neuroscience does not change the situation drastically. Attempts to bridge the gap between social and natural sciences are undertaken repeatedly and form a paradigm of naturalism – one of the four sociological paradigms in a well-known classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018412441751">Alexander (1982)</xref>. The most contemporary and relevant version of naturalism for our discussion is that which attempts to link social and cultural studies with cognitive science. Works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0539018412441751">Sperber (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0539018412441751">Kaufmann &amp; Clément (2007)</xref> are good examples.</p>
<p>Cognitive science and neuroscience are now closely related and interdependent. At the same time, there is an important difference between them. While the first deals with logical models of mind, which are essentially compatible with the core sociological notion of actor, the latter studies the brain, a more ‘natural’ object than any in the social sciences. While it seems theoretically and conceptually possible to discuss the relation between an abstract decision-maker in rational-choice theory and the social system, the link between the social system and the brain is less obvious. Yet it is the brain that makes decisions in real life, while the cognitive actor is a model. To be sure, the brain is presented as a model within neuroscience as well, but there is still the difference between models of mind and models of the brain. Given the pace of advance in brain research, we find it timely to update the debates surrounding the link between social and natural sciences. Our aim is not to contribute to the general methodological and philosophical discussion but rather to see how we can pragmatically use particular findings of current research in neuroscience to gain a better understanding of social issues and to make suggestions about what findings would be desirable. We focus on neuroscience rather than cognitive science in order to avoid additional superficiality while clearly understanding its ‘mediating’ role in the linkages we are discussing.</p>
<p>Among social scientists, interest in contemporary neuroscience has been shown by social psychologists (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018412441751">Dovidio, Pearson &amp; Orr, 2008</xref>) and economists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018412441751">Camerer, Loewenstein &amp; Prelec, 2005</xref>). Attempts to integrate neuroscience with social psychology and economics gave rise to two important new fields of research: social neuroscience and neuroeconomics. Yet both remain peripheral to these older scientific disciplines. An interest in neuroscience has been demonstrated in other social sciences as well, especially in political science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0539018412441751">McDermott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0539018412441751">Tingley, 2006</xref>). Some sociologists too have recognized its importance. As S Turner has put it, ‘social theory ought to be physically and computationally realistic and cognitively realistic…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0539018412441751">Turner, 2007</xref>: 369). The present article is in line with this modest claim.</p>
<p>Here we use the term ‘sociology’ in a broad sense, designating fields describing collective forms of social life at both micro- and macrolevels. This active role of sociology could be performed within a field of research we call neurosociology. This term has been used by some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0539018412441751">TenHouten, 1997</xref>) and was recently promoted in DD Franks’s fascinating book <italic>Neurosociology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018412441751">Franks, 2010</xref>). However, the subtitle of this book – <italic>The nexus between neuroscience and social psychology</italic> – was rather confusing. Although this important book covers a range of topics, from emotions to free will, it focuses on including neuroscience in an agenda of symbolic-interaction theory, one of the theories closest to social psychology. We argue instead that the study of the brain can and should be a part of <italic>any</italic> sociological approach. By this insistence on ‘sociological’ neuroscience, we mean not only the possibility of extending the link we discuss from microsociology (social interaction, individual behavior) to macrosociology (institutions, social structure, social changes), an issue now successfully investigated within analytical sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018412441751">Hedström &amp; Swedberg, 1998</xref>), but also to the conceptual language as well. Both sociology and social psychology often deal with the same or very closely related problems and work on one level of analysis. Take, for example, a problem of stereotypes and prejudices, so intensively studied within social psychology and social neuroscience. If we were to look at definitions of stereotypes as consensual social knowledge about the groups to which an individual belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0539018412441751">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>: 594), we would see that in sociology this set of phenomena would be named ‘role expectations’. So, what within social psychology is studied as stereotypes would within sociology be part of a more general aspect of social behavior, with different theoretical interpretations and connections. Our argument is that it is possible to use not only a sociological scope of analysis, but conceptual and theoretical devices as well.</p>
<p>First, we embark on a brief overview of social neuroscience, including its key problems and findings. We then consider its current limitations and possible contributions to sociology. A special <italic>neurosociological</italic> kind of social research is illustrated with an example of role behavior, a notion that can be reasonably included in various social theories.</p>
<sec id="section1-0539018412441751">
<title>Social neuroscience and sociology: Limitations and contributions</title>
<p>Social neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that seeks to find neural correlates of social cognition, emotions, decision-making and behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018412441751">Adolphs, 2009</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0539018412441751">Lieberman, 2007</xref>, for reviews). Using lesion studies and subtle techniques such as functional neuroimaging, it attempts to reveal the deepest processes underlying our social life and to determine the origin of social abnormalities such as autism. Social neuroscience is a very young but fast-growing field of research that is now well institutionalized. Its findings are presented in a number of conferences and scholarly journals such as <italic>Social Affective and Cognitive Neuroscience</italic> or <italic>Social Neuroscience</italic>. It is closely related to the field of neuroeconomics, which can be defined as the neurobiology of decision-making; and it converts the economic theory of expected utility into the study of relevant brain processes. We use the term ‘social neuroscience’ to designate both these fields.</p>
<p>Surely, there are good psychological and intellectual reasons for sociologists to avoid talking about brains, bodies and the like, including different educational backgrounds and competences necessary for dealing with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, or strong anti-reductionist traditions. However, there are quite rational reasons for this as well. Brain scientists are engaged in a very different field, and their research is typically driven by very different cognitive interests. Neuroscience, including social neuroscience, does not try to solve sociological problems. And it should not. To make use of neuroscience is a sociological task, and it is a sociologist who should think how class relations or societal evolution are driven by and/or are implemented in brain processes.</p>
<p>In effect, all the social phenomena we can talk about are implemented in motor reactions of the body, be it changing where you live, making voting decisions or shifting from an industrial to postindustrial society. If this is the case, someone has to explain how global societal structures and changes rule the cerebellum. It is doubtful that neuroscientists will be – or should be – such a ‘someone’. They have their own agenda. To see how sociology should actively use brain research to solve sociological problems, let’s start with the limitations of current social neuroscience. To avoid general talk about the mind–body problem and the nature of different ‘emergences’, we focus on the more pragmatic approach to sociological interpretations of neuroscience data. The most important problems entailed in social neuroscience are as follows.</p>
<p><italic>The search for neural correlates as a goal</italic>. Working within a dualistic framework, social neuroscience seeks to associate psychological and social phenomena such as trust, rewards, social categories or biases with neural processes and systems. This is usually done without attempts to build causal chains. Information about brain localization of subjective states is, in itself, sociologically useless. Even if we know that action selection is strongly associated with the basal ganglia, it does not help us understand why a course of action was chosen or why some agents in the population face such a situation.</p>
<p><italic>The scope of analysis</italic>. It is frequently noted that, focusing on brain processes, social neuroscience loses perspective and cannot see the wood for the trees. Indeed, most sociologically interesting phenomena such as social structure or institutions step onto the stage only when we see many individuals repeatedly performing complementary actions.</p>
<p><italic>Different time scales</italic>. This point is closely related to the previous one. Social neuroscience typically deals with processes lasting from milliseconds to seconds. This does not allow us to see patterns of activities with a duration of days, years and centuries.</p>
<p><italic>The statistical nature of neuroscience conclusions</italic>. Most of what we know about brain processes is gained through statistical data analysis. This means no strong causal chain is established between social functions and brain processes. In addition, we know that neural resources can be reallocated when some brain areas are damaged. We must also add the use of small and often-uncontrollable samples in many studies, which thus restricts their ability for generalization. Yet for social neuroscience, the representativeness of samples is a more important issue than in other fields of brain research because social cognition and behavior are more sensitive to group and cultural differences.</p>
<p><italic>Circular explanations and definitions</italic>. To reveal the deepest nature of mental states, neuroscientists use fMRI scanners and other tools to look for neural correlates of stereotypes, fear or risk evaluations. But in order to say that some neural activity is a sign of, say, prejudice, we must first be able to identify something as a prejudice at the behavioral level. Our understanding of brain processes is thus dependent on psychological notions. Needless to say, these notions themselves function as theoretical biases toward confirming our initial conceptions. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why neuroscience is of limited interest for sociology. Current research in social neuroscience is usually guided by psychological notions, theories and problems, not by sociological ones.</p>
<p><italic>Lack of interest in personal differences, development and change</italic>. This is a direct consequence of the search for neural correlates. Many laboratory experiments in neuroscience do not try to find out how brain processes change when important shifts in circumstances or social relations take place.</p>
<p><italic>Encapsulation in the skull</italic>. Neuroscience is, by definition, interested in brain processes. However, there’s a rapidly growing framework in cognitive science and other fields that argues for externalization of the processes typically associated with an actor’s inner world, namely: perception, cognition and action. This framework encompasses a number of approaches, such as distributed cognition, situated cognition, ecological psychology, embodied embedded cognition and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018412441751">Chandrasekharan &amp; Osbeck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0539018412441751">Osbeck, Malone &amp; Nersessian, 2007</xref>). They conclude that, in order to understand human activity, we must include the body (not only the brain!), environment, artifacts, and even social and cultural entities in the very process of cognition. This means that the brain alone does not enable us to understand an individual’s inner life.</p>
<p><italic>Brain data are not detailed enough yet to satisfy the needs of sociology</italic>. We can find brain processes associated with different activities but they are still very crude compared to sociological or anthropological problems, which deal with very subtle differences. However, this is the least important obstacle, taking into account the pace of advance in neuroimaging and other techniques.</p>
<p>Of course, many of the above-mentioned issues have already been recognized and articulated both outside and within social neuroscience (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018412441751">Adolphs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018412441751">Dovidio, Pearson &amp; Orr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0539018412441751">Huettel, 2010</xref>). At the same time, brain research has made at least four general contributions to sociology and other social sciences.</p>
<p><italic>Clarification of the structure of action</italic>. The very idea of neuroscience is that every mental state and personal behavior has its neural correlates. The implicit idea of sociology is that every social phenomenon somehow corresponds to an actor’s mind and behavior. Taking these ideas together, let us suppose that every social phenomenon can be traced to specific neural processes. This modest conclusion (in the sense that we say nothing about causal chains and reductionism) is based upon philosophical monism and is sufficient to justify using neurophysiological data in clarifying sociological questions.</p>
<p>Knowledge of low-level operations underlying social cognition and behavior can contribute to our understanding of social mechanisms. A social mechanism is considered as a putative device linking observable events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018412441751">Hedström &amp; Swedberg, 1998</xref>). If two or more events can be tied to such a general device, this can be considered an explanation. In principle, these ‘events’ need not be facts of a special social theory. If it is possible to invent a device linking facts of different scientific disciplines, we can consider it to be an explanation as well. Such a device can even contain ontological disruptions, say unresolved mind–body problems, and still be explanatory. We can make our understanding of a causal mechanism linking social or other events as deep as possible according to our practical needs and possibilities. A case involving oxytocin illustrates this contribution of neuroscience (see below). A detailed knowledge of mechanisms underlying social behavior is an end in itself, but, at the same time, it contributes to an understanding of more traditional sociological issues.</p>
<p>Neuroscience can inform sociology about the spectrum of possible variations in human biology related to social organization and behavior. Since many features of societies depend on limitations and capabilities of the human body and the human mind, we can use neuroscience and other natural sciences to define which societies are possible and which are plausible. For example, humans, like all the other species with a nervous system, demonstrate reward-orienting behavior. This means that a society in which most behaviors go unrewarded is impossible.</p>
<p><italic>Neuroscience provides sociology with new and more objective measures of social phenomena</italic>. Many objects of interest, such as values, attitudes or efforts, can be identified and measured in a much more reliable and universal way than has been done until now.</p>
<p>To see how neuroscience can contribute to a better understanding of sociological problems in the field we call neurosociology, we next take an example of status/role as one of the most important objects of sociological interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0539018412441751">
<title>Decomposition of role behavior</title>
<p>The notions of statuses and roles are widely presented across social theories. Let us focus on definitions commonly found in sociology textbooks: status as a position in social structure, associated with specific expectations, and role as a corresponding mode of behavior. It is important to note that social structures function as a kind of categorization process, i.e. a cognitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018412441751">Bourdieu, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0539018412441751">Jenkins, 2000</xref>). Even if we consider social structure as an objective supraindividual entity, we must remember that it is only through human activity that it can be manifested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018412441751">Harré, 2002</xref>). If so, even the most abstractly defined social structure must somehow operate as a cause of human role behavior. Network analysis may well reveal the formal features of social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018412441751">Freeman, 2008</xref>), but to explain how taking a position within it corresponds with an individual’s behavior demands additional knowledge. Such an explanation is possible either via individuals’ perception and knowledge of their positions and roles, or via their responding to environmental constraints and opportunities. In any event, a causal mechanism is needed and it certainly includes brain processes.</p>
<p>Although there are important differences in the way notions of social structures, statuses and roles are interpreted, taking social positions is usually associated with the following.</p>
<p><italic>Specific activities</italic>. It is something often ignored, especially in relational sociology, that different positions in social structure usually imply different tasks and activities. When we speak of a mother’s or an employer’s position, we do not simply mean this is a special position defined by its relation to the positions of children or employees; we also mean their typical activities. A typical mother cooks meals, buys toys, sings a lullaby, asks about their children’s homework, and so on. Perceiving activities like these is included in the system of status recognition and evaluation by others. Every role is a pattern of behavioral activities, not just a node in the network.</p>
<p><italic>Focus of attention and relevancy criteria</italic>. Each active position makes an individual focus on a highly specified subject-matter, strongly narrowing his current interest and information search according to the needs of role performance. For an individual who is taking the mother position, information on infant disease or school reform is much more relevant than information on traffic regulation, which is important for the same individual when she takes the position of a car-driver. A social position imposes relevancy structure upon the perceiving of social being and the world around.</p>
<p><italic>Specific perceptions, evaluations, judgments and preferences in choice situations</italic>. Sociologists are especially interested in how different positions correlate with perception and evaluation of social objects, be they neighbors or political parties. When relations between employers and employees are being discussed, sociologists attempt to trace them in cultural, ethnic, gender and other differences. Multiple social differences must be correlated somehow; this is the key idea of sociology. Different positions value different things and prefer different choices in similar situations.</p>
<p><italic>Mobilization of effort</italic>. Social positions may differ in the amount of personal time and effort invested in role behavior. Individuals occupying high positions may be expected to work hard compared to those in lower positions (the opposite can take place as well). Roles composing the role-set of a status, or different statuses, may require more or less effort because of their relative significance.</p>
<p>When we speak of statuses and roles, we can also mean different stages of role functioning. These dynamic aspects of roles include:</p>
<list id="list1-0539018412441751" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– role construction and internalization;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– role activation (when a role is being activated due to its relevance in a particular situation);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– role implementation or performance;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– role termination and role switching (when we finish our role behavior or switch to another role);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– role interference or composition (when we are in a situation inducing simultaneous activation of different roles);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– role conflict resolution.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We must also add processes relating to the roles of others: social categorization, status identification (what is the status of a counter-agent?) and role evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018412441751">
<title>Clarifying the low-level structure of role behavior using social neuroscience</title>
<p>Thinking about statuses and roles, we can pose a number of theoretical and research questions, for example: Why are there stable roles in societies? Why do they differ in number, properties and distribution? Why are some statuses and roles more significant than others? Which statuses and roles are these? How does an individual make the decision as to which role to perform here and now? How and why does social position affect individuals’ reasoning and values? And so on.</p>
<p>We suggest that a detailed knowledge of low-level processes underlying role behavior can shed light on sociological questions like these. To give a low-level interpretation of roles, statuses and social structure is a task for neurosociology. However, as this field of research is only a project, we could start with some findings of social neuroscience. Because this field is driven primarily by psychological and neurophysiological interests, we are forced to use terms borrowed from cognitive science and psychology in this list of role-related brain functions. However, it is possible to make use of its findings both to clarify the very nature of roles and to answer particular questions of the kind we mentioned above.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0539018412441751">Table 1</xref> lists a number of foci of attention in brain research relevant to our purposes (though not necessarily composing roles as such). Examples of research mentioned cover role-behavior components only partially, leaving numerous ‘sociological’ lacunae. Note that we mentioned only neural structures, not physiological, cognitive or psychological mechanisms (these can serve as associated functions, however). Note also that we <italic>do not</italic> consider this list to be an objective structure of role behavior, a kind of mapping of social function onto the brain. After all, we are dealing with a field where knowledge is changing so rapidly that this list may very soon be outdated. This, however, does not invalidate our main argument. The relation between social and natural sciences is not that the former are simply consumers and the latter producers. There is no sense in waiting until ‘everything is clear’ in neuroscience to use its knowledge as building-blocks of explanation. Almost any social theory can propose to look for ‘neural correlates’ of something and to produce a new list of brain functions. Unfortunately, for now such a ‘sociological’ list of brain functions and structures would be empty. We thus summarize superficially relevant areas of <italic>current</italic> research as a preliminary step. A quantitative meta-analysis is needed to propose a more accurate description of currently available brain data. Nevertheless, we can make some useful suggestions even now.</p>

<p>(1) Although fragmentary, listed research focuses on issues most of which are quite relevant and interesting for social science. Almost all the components of role behavior studied by sociologists are in some way or other reflected in neuroscience. This means that every brain structure or process mentioned is a possible candidate for inclusion in the explanatory mechanism of social research concerning role behavior.</p>
<p>(2) Current research delineates role-related processes in a very fragmentary and inconsistent manner. This means that nobody is trying to convert status/roles or other sociological notions into neural processes. And nobody has to do it in fact. We must clearly realize that initial role-behavior decomposition, as well as integration and interpretation of research findings, are purely sociological tasks. It would be interesting to speculate on how social scientists could make use of fMRI scanners and other experimental equipment of neuroscience if they were rich and bold enough, but the most realistic scenario for including brain studies in <italic>empirical</italic> research in social sciences is that of a meta-analysis guided by the theories and hypotheses of sociology, political science or culture studies.</p>
<p>(3) On the other hand, we can see how many brain regions and structures are involved in processing roles. Such an analytical approach is common and useful in cognitive science but seldom in sociological work. The decomposition of role-related phenomena into the set of the deepest functions and operations is necessary in order to see if they are merely parts of a complex, well-structured and orchestrated system, or if they can, instead, be processed quite independently of each other. Looking at this multitude of brain functions, can we say they work together to compose status/role/habitus as a unit of analysis? Or, instead, are there many separate processes whose independent effects we assign to a status? The current state of affairs in neuroscience gives us no answer, partially because of the circular definitions we mentioned above. However, it seems that role-related brain systems are not localized somewhere in the brain as a unity.</p>
<p>(4) Evidence that there are different processes and structures performing seemingly similar or close components of roles can make us change our understanding of their inner structure. For example, this seems plausible in the case of social perception or biases. The converse is also the case. If seemingly different role-related phenomena engage the same neural systems, this can be the sign of a common mechanism at work. An important example is the role of dopamine in reward-processing, learning, control of behavior and taking high positions in the social structure. A much more detailed examination of data is needed to come to final conclusions, though.</p>
<p>The question remains: Is such information really relevant and useful for sociology? Why should we be interested in these low-level processes? First of all, in attempting to reveal the detailed mechanism of social behavior, the linking of high-level phenomena such as class conflicts or institutional functioning, to low-level processes <italic>is a task in its own right</italic>. But we can use it to deepen our understanding of these high-level phenomena as well. To see why this can be done, let’s take a closer look at some of the above-mentioned role components.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0539018412441751">
<title>Shared circuits, mentalizing and role expectations</title>
<p>Predicting human behavior is crucial for social interaction and social organization. Seizing intentions and the sense of Other’s actions is often associated with the ability to construct mental representation of Other’s mind, i.e. theory of mind. The idea that social understanding can be reduced to a single mechanism of mentalizing is now challenged.</p>
<p>There are numerous findings concerning theory of mind construction and related effects. We focus on only one intriguing discovery made by contemporary neuroscience, namely mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are neural cells in the brain of humans and other primates that are activated both when performing and when observing an action or emotional reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441751">Gallese et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, according to this theory, when we watch the Other smile or pick up a glass, we simulate his reactions with our own, without building any cognitive pictures of Other’s mind. This is supposed to be a kind of direct perception and interpretation of Other’s inner states. Mirror neurons were later considered as a part of the brain mechanism called shared circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0539018412441751">Keysers &amp; Gazzola, 2006</xref>). Some populations of neurons are more broadly tuned to a class of situations, whereas others respond very selectively to specific actions, sensations and emotions. Shared circuits are thus considered as a means of effortlessly sharing the experience of others, making social interaction more effective.</p>
<p>The question of how shared circuits are connected with theories of mind is discussed elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018412441751">Adolphs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018412441751">Decety, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0539018412441751">Keysers &amp; Gazzola, 2006</xref>). Even the very nature of mirror neurons is under discussion. An interesting analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018412441751">Csibra (2007)</xref> shows that mirror neurons can better be described as top-down emulation of action, and not as bottom-up imitation. Taking into account the hierarchical nature of action (main goals are divided into subgoals, tasks and low-level operations), the idea that mirror neurons can directly respond to the most subtle kinematics of the Other, initiating simulation and thus understanding intentions, is not supported by empirical data. Instead, the author proposes the model wherein the actor makes hypotheses about Other’s intentions, and triggers a simulation process to verify them and anticipate future actions. However, it is important to note that, denying ‘direct-matching’ interpretation of mirror neurons, Csibra does not argue that the mirror-neurons system is governed by a mentalizing process. The author emphasizes that ‘extracting the content of an intention (the goal) does not necessarily imply representing it <italic>as</italic> the content of a mental state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018412441751">Csibra, 2007</xref>: 447).</p>
<p>Whether mirror neurons provide us with direct perception of Other’s actions and emotions or not, it is doubtful they can embrace all the phenomena involved in understanding an Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441751">Jacob &amp; Jeannerod, 2005</xref>). We can make a rational reconstruction of Other’s goals and expectations without ever seeing him/her. Simulation of Other’s movements is useless for understanding his/her deepest motives and ultimate goals. Shared circuits must be crucial for socialization but they are surely not the answer to why we ascribe intentions every time we do. It seems that shared circuits and mentalizing are not parts of a single mechanism of understanding other people. Moreover, although theory of mind construction is repeatedly associated with several brain structures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0539018412441751">Table 1</xref>), it is not at all clear whether or not they compose a separate and specific system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0539018412441751">Stone &amp; Gerrans, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>But what about roles? Their relation to social cognition is twofold. First, sociologists claim that perception and evaluation of other people are part of the habitus associated with a social position. Consequently, different positions must manifest themselves in different predictions of Other’s behavior and in different theories of mind. Second, we are able to make predictions about the behavior of other people by simple identification of <italic>their</italic> status (Asian man, poor student, etc.). These role expectations are very stable and are applicable to many different people. Thus, they are neither a kind of mentalizing nor direct perception. They are a <italic>third</italic> way to understand and predict behavior. Its distinctiveness and independence from mentalizing is partially supported by evidence from developmental psychology. In a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018412441751">Clément, Bernard &amp; Kaufmann (2011)</xref>, children engaged in a false-belief task demonstrated a clear difference between predictions of the behavior of others based on mentalizing and predictions based on understanding social norms. Since normative components of role expectations are quite obvious, the existence of a specialized mechanism for processing role information seems possible.</p>
<p>The very idea that there can be <italic>at least</italic> three different cognitive mechanisms for grasping Other’s intentions is an important sociological hypothesis because it leads us to the following questions: How are shared circuits tied and how do they interfere with role expectations and mentalizing when we come to ascribe intentions? How do <italic>different</italic> social positions interfere with a shared circuit system in face-to-face interactions? And do they interfere at all? It seems clear that, if shared circuits are really direct, then they must function in the social situation <italic>completely independently</italic> of any possible group identities and expectations. We can also pose more specific questions, for example: How do public understanding and evaluation of politicians change with the introduction of information and communication technologies, allowing visual perception of their behavior. A much more detailed and accurate explanation can be arrived at if we know about shared circuits and other special neural mechanisms.</p>
<p>Taking into account what has been said above, we could advance some specific neurosociological hypotheses. For example, if it is really possible to distinguish between different neural systems underlying some sort of behavior, we would suppose that:</p>
<list id="list2-0539018412441751" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>If perception via shared circuits matches role expectations, then reaction time for responding behavior should be less than in contradictory cases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The final outcome of comprehension and evaluation tasks in face-to-face interaction is determined by the relative strength of different neural systems, associated, possibly, with shared circuits, role expectations and mentalizing. This, in turn, can be determined by other variables such as time available to the actor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If a situation induces conflicting role expectations, e.g. because of mixed social categorization, then shared circuits can become more significant for understanding the behavior of others.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0539018412441751">
<title>Oxytocin and social bonding</title>
<p>Another example is oxytocin (OT), a hot topic in social neuroscience. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide traditionally associated with parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0539018412441751">Mitchell &amp; Schmid, 2001</xref>), which has recently been associated with important prosocial effects as well. These include social memory, attachment and trust behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441751">Campbell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0539018412441751">Norman et al., 2010</xref>). Its social effects are so obvious that oxytocin is being used to induce unconditional trust in psychological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018412441751">Boone, Declerck &amp; Kiyonari, 2010</xref>). Although causal chains in the secretion of oxytocin as well as of another similar neuropeptide, vasopressin, are not understood yet, it is clear that oxytocin level is at least partially determined by purely physiological and genetic factors.</p>
<p>Should we include oxytocin in explaining, say, maternal behavior? We know that in most cultures mother is a social status associated with caregiving and strong emotional attachment toward a child. If there is indeed an evolutionary pressure toward the selection of OT-related genes and systems, how should we consider these role expectations? Are they sedimentations of intrinsic behavioral triggers of human behavior? The functionalist explanation that role expectations for maternal behavior become fixed because of their functional contribution to social integrity is definitely not the case. Neither functions nor dysfunctions can operate fast enough to select genetic variants. The interpretativist view that maternal behavior is one of a range of child-bearing <italic>strategies</italic> is not the case either. This is because oxytocin regulation in parturition and lactation operates independently of any contextual or institutional social effects. It is part of an evolutionary mechanism that can be traced down to reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018412441751">Bell, 2001</xref>). If this is the case, we should think of social norms and role expectations as realized via additional and quite separate neural mechanisms interacting with the OT-secretion system. This, again, leads us to very specific predictions and hypotheses. If there really are different neural systems influencing maternal behavior, then the outcome should be considered as a function dependent on their relative strength and interaction. As this strength is an absolute, not a relative, value, we can expect, for example, that, when different systems are contradictory, are equally strong and the magnitudes are high, this will induce greater stress compared to situations in which they are contradictory, equally strong and their magnitudes are low.</p>
<p>Another example of the social effects of oxytocin is its role in behavioral changes induced by a popular club drug, Ecstasy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441751">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0539018412441751">Johansen &amp; Crebs, 2009</xref>). To see how findings of neuroscience could be included in an explanatory mechanism connecting social events, suppose that a social theory has to explain such observable events as the ‘emergence of clubbing culture’ and ‘growth of Ecstasy consumption’. It is quite possible to give such an explanation by referring to availability of leisure time, entrepreneurs’ motivations for illegal-drug distribution or youth subculture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018412441751">Hunt, Moloney &amp; Evans, 2010</xref>, as an example of this type of research). But if we knew that Ecstasy increases oxytocin concentration, which reduces amygdala activity, which reduces fear, which stimulates social attachment and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441751">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>), we would add to the knowledge of our mechanism by saying that oxytocin helps people meet needs of social bonding, thus inducing them to visit clubs. Whatever we thought about methodological and ontological issues, whatever we thought about what is ‘social’ in this case, we would know more.</p>
<p>A more interesting situation arises if introducing causal chains revealed by neuroscience not simply deepens our understanding of a social mechanism but forces us to change it. Social research might explain drug consumption in clubs by referring to role expectations and social norms of the sort: ‘If you are in, just have a good time’ or ‘If you are in the club and do not use Ecstasy, then maybe something is wrong with you’. We can even see Ecstasy consumption as a part of clubbing culture. At the same time, a detailed consideration of drug effects themselves could probably lead us to a more interesting explanation. Ecstasy administrates oxytocin release. This, in turn, reduces fear and distrust toward others thus increasing probability of behavior directed to establishing and maintaining social relations. Oxytocin-related effects of Ecstasy consumption are time-dependent, they peak at 1–2 hours after drug intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441751">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>). For this period of time, the only social objects a typical clubber meets are other clubbers. The increased bonding-seeking behavior thus tends to foster the formation of social relations primarily among clubbers. The club becomes a place strongly associated with positive social relations. To establish such relations outside the club is, ceteris paribus (i.e. for the same period of time and for the same number of persons available for social bonding), <italic>less probable</italic>. The bonding-related effects of oxytocin in this case would contribute to group identity and the very formation of clubbing culture. This conclusion is something very different from the initial explanation.</p>
<p>This example is speculation. Yet it shows the possible logic of the neurosociological explanation. It produces a testable hypothesis. For example, we could compare clubbing cultures and clubbers’ social relations in clubs with or without intensive Ecstasy consumption; or clubs with Ecstasy and those with cocaine. This kind of causal chain would hardly be produced by social science or neuropharmacology.</p>

<title>Role behavior and modularity</title>
<p>The questions discussed here relate to very old debates about the nature versus nurture dilemma. What is new in current science is that we can answer the questions not in a general form but in a very detailed, specific and elaborate manner. Even more importantly, we can see how the interaction between factors typically attributed to the ‘biological’ and the ‘social’ can be analyzed in an ontologically homogeneous manner. When the nature/nurture question arises, it is often concluded that there are two (or more) different groups of factors affecting the human mind and behavior both of which contribute to our understanding of social phenomena but quite independently of each other. There are biological <italic>and</italic> social factors of social life. This conclusion often takes the ‘we are not reductionists’ form among those scholars who accept the importance of ’biological’ arguments in social science (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018412441751">Franks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018412441751">Hibbing &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0539018412441751">Kaufmann &amp; Clément, 2007</xref>). However, this ‘modest’ conclusion can lead to an inappropriate dualistic position, thus raising an inconvenient question: How can ontologically distinct phenomena interact? Understanding this problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0539018412441751">Kaufmann &amp; Clément (2007)</xref> attempt to invent an ‘intermediary’ language and introduce the term ‘social forms’ to reflect ecological relations between agents and environment. This useful contribution does not, however, help us to solve the interaction questions we mentioned above. When we discussed the interaction of role expectations with shared circuits or the oxytocin system, we tried to show their commonality as well as their distinctiveness. If we agree that social positions must be somehow realized at the neural level, then we can reasonably discuss their interaction with other factors at the same neural level. In no way are we going to say that status/role is a kind of neural system. Simply, even if it is defined as a relational entity in an abstract theoretical consideration, an explanatory mechanism linking such events as ‘taking a social position’ and ‘performing a particular action’ must include neural processes as parts of the mechanism. Alternatively, we could take special neural events as units of analysis while trying to reveal the causal chain linking neural representations across agents and environments in a way similar to the ‘epidemiological’ approach proposed by Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0539018412441751">Sperber (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>The idea of the interaction of ontologically homogeneous elements of a causal mechanism of social behavior can be easily connected with a vivid discussion within contemporary cognitive and neuroscience, namely: modularity. Modularity implies that different neural systems exist in the mind and in the brain. They differ in functions and they differ in the neural pathways they use (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018412441751">Barrett &amp; Kurzban, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0539018412441751">Kurzban &amp; Aktipis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0539018412441751">Sperber &amp; Hirschfeld, 2004</xref>). They are considered to evolve in response to various environmental challenges and tasks. These different systems can be interconnected and they can be in competition with each other. Different systems can perform different functions or they can perform one function in different ways. Although modularity is typically associated with functional specialization, cases in which modules perform behaviorally and cognitively similar or closely related outcomes are of especial interest for us. A short list of supporting findings from neuroscience includes:</p>
<list id="list3-0539018412441751" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– separate neural systems for processing immediate and delayed rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0539018412441751">McClure, Laibson et al., 2004</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– different processes underlying categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441751">Ashby &amp; Spiering, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0539018412441751">Smith &amp; Grossman, 2008</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– different mechanisms involved in attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0539018412441751">Wood, 2003</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– autonomous systems for goal setting and goal implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0539018412441751">Öztürk, 2009</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– interacting but quite independent processes in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018412441751">Fellows, 2004</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What is important is that these systems are more or less autonomous: none can be seen as a governor. In addition, behavioral or cognitive outcome is the result of the interplay between different systems. Modularity of mind challenges the very notion of self: If the mind is composed of modules, then who is the actor? We say actor when we need to point to the source of a particular behavioral or cognitive outcome. But what exactly is the source of action if different systems interact to produce the outcome? Different modules can be triggered by different cues: for example, the mirror-neuron systems can be triggered by the observed kinematics of Other’s body, while role expectations are activated by status identification. Isn’t it reasonable to suppose that the resultant outcome, say ascribed intention, is a function of the relative strength of different cognitive/neural systems and the triggering cues (the notion of strength needs clarification in this context but it seems appropriate). Suppose then that the mirror-neurons’ cue happens to be stronger than the status ascribed. Can’t we say that the outcome is <italic>caused</italic> by the kinematics of Other’s body? At least in this case, environment is a much better predictor of an individual’s actions and cognitions – some psychologists call it ‘the strong situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018412441751">Cooper &amp; Withey, 2009</xref>) – while the mediating system is the mirror-neurons system and not social position.</p>
<p>Social scientists believe that social and cultural phenomena can arise from the interaction of individual agents. There is no logical jump in suggesting that they arise from the interaction of even smaller units like modules. The fact that we have become accustomed to see ourselves as holistic entities is not the question. Our consciousness may be just one more module among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0539018412441751">Kurzban &amp; Aktipis, 2007</xref>). Modularity is a hypothesis. However, it is a useful hypothesis since it puts different factors of behavior on the same level. The current discussion about modularity within cognitive science is not about the idea itself but rather about the exact list of functions and interconnections between modules. For example, when questioning the idea of a specialized ‘theory of mind’ module, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0539018412441751">Stone &amp; Gerrans (2006)</xref> do not so much reject the modular view as such but rather replace one set of modules with a different one.</p>
<p>The relation of modularity to role behavior is twofold. First, we can ask if there are special modules for processing social roles; second, we can wonder if there are different systems for processing different statuses/roles. Although the latter question does not necessarily imply the modular approach (see below), the former one definitely does. The existence of specialized ‘social’ modules has been argued by some scholars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0539018412441751">Kurzban &amp; Atkipis (2007)</xref> propose the existence of a social cognitive interface, a module responsible for manipulation of others through effective self-presentation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441751">Conein (2007)</xref> discusses two means engaged in the existence of social groups, namely skills for maintenance of group cohesion and monitoring of relations (albeit abstaining from calling them modules directly). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018412441751">Clément, Bernard &amp; Kaufmann (2011)</xref> assumes a module for processing social norms. Important work by Lawrence Hirschfeld on ‘folk sociology’ points to another candidate for a specialized social module designed for producing hypotheses about social affiliations and the group structure of social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018412441751">Hirschfeld, 2001</xref>). This idea is of special interest for us as it hypothesizes the existence of a social-cognition system completely independent from socialization. For sociologists, it is taken for granted that socialization is a one-way process translating existing social structures into newcomers’ minds. The fact that children can independently produce hypotheses about boundaries and relations of social groups while using information from the socialization process to verify them means that status/role information is not a single unit of transferred social knowledge but rather a composite cognitive inference.</p>
<p>These findings point to the possibility that status/role is an epiphenomenon of several mechanisms dealing with different aspects of social categorization and role-related behavior. Whether the components of role behavior listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0539018412441751">Table 1</xref> are served by specialized modules or not is a matter for empirical research. The modular hypothesis would receive support in the event systems responsible for various components of statuses/roles, say encoding role-related activities and ascribing emotions and cognitions, were shown to be processed not simply by distinct, but by <italic>independent</italic> neural mechanisms. Again, whether this hypothesis is confirmed or not, this would be a kind of research we could call neurosociological.</p>

<title>A few role-related sociological questions for neurosociology</title>
<p>It can be said that the above-mentioned examples are more relevant for social psychology than for sociology. This is true. However, it is quite possible to make interesting hypotheses concerning even purely sociological, macroscopic problems. We conclude with a brief examination of some possible neurosociological lines of research concerning social structure and role-related activities in a more traditional way.</p>
<sec id="section8-0539018412441751">
<title>1 What is the difference between statuses?</title>
<p>Every sociology textbook tells us that numerous statuses exist in society: kinship, professional, economic, gender, ethnic, political, and so on. We usually introduce them in sociological research to see how they correlate with differences in behaviors and evaluations. But how and why should we differentiate between statuses? And what determines their differences and significance? We could use social neuroscience to find out how different statuses are processed in our neural system. Do different systems process different statuses? We could use information about differences in status processing to compare statuses themselves. Imagine that status X is processed in a similar manner to status Y, while processing status Z involves different neural systems. We might then conclude that the nature of X and Y is similar, or even they are one and the same thing. Though, it is sometimes noted that evidence of different systems is more persuasive than evidence of similar systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018412441751">Barrett &amp; Kurzban, 2006</xref>). If statuses use different neural systems, this can help us understand why they differ in behavioral or cognitive effects. It is reasonable to suppose that we must process gender statuses in a different way from professional ones. Social neuroscience is now trying to understand the neural basis of status processing. Till now, however, it has concentrated primarily on race and gender (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018412441751">Dickter &amp; Bartholow., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0539018412441751">Ito &amp; Bartholow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0539018412441751">Marsh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0539018412441751">Wright et al., 2008</xref>). This is partially because the discussion about the so-called ‘primary’ social categories within social and evolutionary psychology concentrates on age, sex and race (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0539018412441751">Kinzler, Shutts &amp; Correll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0539018412441751">Kurzban, Tooby &amp; Cosmides., 2001</xref>). However, ‘primary’ does not mean ‘most important’. Sociology may well contribute to the discussion by focusing attention on the social categorizations actually organizing social life in contemporary societies. Rapid changes in the status priorities underlying the social structure of a given society, or political manipulations of categorizations are processes sociologists are well aware of but which are almost completely ignored by social neuroscientists.</p>
<p>Sociologically, status categories are homogeneous: roles associated with gender are logically and structurally similar to roles associated with race, occupation or income. They may differ in their significance, stability, contents, etc., but <italic>logically</italic> they are similar. This is reflected in the very notion of status/role. They all function as mechanisms of social differentiation and ordering principles. However, this view could be challenged if we knew that some statuses were processed by distinct cognitive/neural devices. In a well-known study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0539018412441751">Kurzban, Tooby &amp; Cosmides (2001)</xref>, there is evidence that what we know as race categorization is a manifestation of a more general mechanism of coalition detection (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018412441751">Hirschfeld, 2001</xref>), and, more interestingly, that this mechanism is essentially different and independent from the gender-encoding system. The idea that some kinds of statuses are manifestations of a general form of social categorization (coalitions or even more general such as ingroup/outgroup distinction) while other statuses have their own essence is of huge importance for sociology and other social sciences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0539018412441751">
<title>2 Are all social structures hierarchical?</title>
<p>This is another theoretically important question. The evolution of societies leads to higher levels of differentiation. Are all these differentiations organized hierarchically? Or, in other words, do we perceive all <italic>significant</italic> social differences as differences in domination and power? Sociologists often advance such hypotheses without trying to test them empirically or to make them empirically testable. For example, Bourdieu articulates this idea very clearly, arguing that the structure of social space is inevitably hierarchized since it is structured by unequal capital distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441751">1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441751">1984b</xref>). But is this really so? It seems possible to test this hypothesis with social neuroscience. Hierarchy of dominance is a focus of attention in all psychological and biological sciences. The processing of high and low statuses entails clear physiological and neural marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018412441751">Gianaros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0539018412441751">Marsh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0539018412441751">Martinez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0539018412441751">Zink et al., 2008</xref>). Why not use these signs to learn if they are really present in people’s brains when processing status information? If we get evidence that this dominance-related neural system is constantly being activated in status processing (i.e. is strongly associated with social categorization), then indeed we will be able to conclude that the structure of dominance organizes all other social structures. To be honest, however, we must admit that such neural marks of domination can only be applied to <italic>representations</italic> of social structure. They are not directly applicable to situations where social stratification is extracted according to principles that ignore the agent’s social knowledge. These findings may nevertheless explain parts of the stratification mechanism that establishes and maintains social hierarchy and inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0539018412441751">
<title>3 Why do various groups value different things?</title>
<p>The underlying reason is the intriguing evidence of the existence of common ‘neural currency’ in the human brain for various rewards. It is widely recognized throughout social and behavioral sciences that human behavior is reward driven. Research in social neuroscience and neuroeconomics shows that there is a common and very universal neural mechanism underlying reward processing independently of the nature of the stimuli. Different values, be they food, money, social attachment or something else, activate the dopaminergic system and brain areas such as the ventral striatum in a very similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441751">Brosch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0539018412441751">McClure, York &amp; Montague, 2004</xref>). If this is true, what does it mean for sociology? It seems we all seek one and the same thing – in the sense of an inner state of reward and satisfaction. But we know that people value different things. Why is this the case? Some neuroscientists suppose this is a matter of individual or cultural differences in value priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441751">Brosch et al., 2011</xref>). For sociology, this seems to be an inappropriate explanation since the differences correlate with group and institutional constitution. Why do scientists seek recognition; businessmen, money; politicians, power; and housewives a cozy home?</p>
<p>There are good sociological reasons for such a mechanism. Social differentiation produces new institutions. Institutions differ in their functions and media: money, power, reputation. Yet they all need one common resource: agents’ motivation. It would not be surprising if the evolution of society managed to connect these different rewards with the same motivational devices. The existence of a common neural currency is thus sociologically plausible. But a more subtle question can be clarified with reference to social neuroscience. Even if stimuli such as food, money or reputation engage one and the same reward system, there is an objective cognitive and/or physiological difference between them. To be rewarded by food when hungry and to be rewarded by subtle flattery are not the same since they engage different cognitive skills and neural pathways. These pathways connecting stimulus with a putative common reward system (be it short term or long term if indeed such a distinction exists) may differ in their ability to produce the reward effect. These differences then should be included in the explanation of motivation within various social contexts.</p>

<sec id="section11-0539018412441751">
<title>4 What variations of social structures and role behaviors are possible?</title>
<p>It is clear that our biological organization imposes limitations upon social relations and society design. But what exactly are these limitations? This question is of special interest since technological advances and institutional conditions make it both possible and probable to change this biological organization. Neurosociology can clarify the question. The first step is to define the space of all possible variations of social structures. There is a direct way to revise sociological attempts to construe such a space. Perhaps the most prominent of these are Parsons’s pattern variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0539018412441751">1937</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0539018412441751">1960</xref>). Now almost forgotten, this was an impressive attempt to classify both role expectations (and behaviors) and societies. Although pattern variables were invented in a purely deductive way, we could use neuroscience to place the notion on solid grounds, and to translate them from intuitive nominal scales to objective interval ones. If it were possible to measure affectivity/neutrality at a neural level, we could find out what values of pattern variables were possible in principle, and what values were more probable under given circumstances. Neuroscience of emotion, for example, insists that there is no such thing as emotional neutrality. We’re constantly in an emotional state, primarily that of enthusiasm or discouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018412441751">Damasio, 1995</xref>). How, then, should we treat affective neutrality as role expectation if no one can satisfy it? Further, can’t we say that a mother’s role is more affective <italic>by nature</italic> than a son’s role, because of the oxytocin secretion system? Doesn’t this lead us to a conclusion of intrinsic asymmetry in mother–son relations? Among pattern variables, the most important is universalism/particularity. Taking into account what has been said previously, is universalism possible in human societies at all? Is it provided through reflexive control exclusively, or are there conditions under which it can be realized at the group-identity level? This would be a promising line of research for neurosociology.</p>
<p>The question of ‘possible societies’ has an inverse form. Just as the set of all logically possible societies is constrained by our cognitive and neural architecture, there must be social constraints for cognitive systems. The question then is: Which cognitive systems and mechanisms must exist in order to make social organization possible? A small provocation: What kind of brain is needed to live in a progressive society without violence and injustice?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The intellectual development of social and natural sciences makes it necessary to constantly update the long-standing debates about their conceptual, methodological and theoretical interconnections. One of the most recent occasions to do this is the emergence of social neuroscience. We argue that the connection between sociology and social neuroscience is not simply a point of philosophical debate of little interest for the majority of researchers. We maintain that sociology can pragmatically use neuroscience to pose and answer particular sociological questions, deepen its understanding of social mechanisms, and revise notions and theories of social science. That’s why we speak of <italic>neurosociology</italic>. Social neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that studies social perception and behavior. Neurosociology is a branch of sociology that studies the brain. We took as an example of such neurosociological investigation the notion of status/role. Taking into account relevant neuroscience findings, we can advance several hypotheses. Controversial and challengeable as they may be, they are appropriate enough for discussions in sociology as well as in cognitive and neuroscience. One of the most intriguing hypotheses we discussed is the possibility that status/role/habitus is not a unity or a social phenomenon sui generis, but rather a set of more or less independent processes we very arbitrarily put together in sociological explanation. This, however, needs further research.</p>
