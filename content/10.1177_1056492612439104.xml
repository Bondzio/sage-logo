<p>This article explores normative control in a culture of friendship. In-depth qualitative data gathered at a management consultancy firm reveal how management seeks to foster informal, intimate, and apparently egalitarian relations with employees. This is conceptualized as a culture of friendship, indicative of broader trends toward individuality, choice, and antiauthoritarianism. Through a comparison with family culture, the paper develops how in a culture of friendship, despite the emphasis on freedom, openness, and spontaneity, normative control is accentuated and extended, involving certain paradoxes and reinforcing control circles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the present article, normative control is investigated in a culture of friendship. This research interest in culture and control is prompted by a 4-month case study at a management consultancy firm. Like in the widely studied family culture (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612439104">Casey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492612439104">Garsten, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492612439104">Kerfoot &amp; Knights, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492612439104">Knights &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612439104">Parker, 1995</xref>), closeness and intimacy are here stressed, and hierarchy and depersonalization are downplayed. Yet the way in which this occurs appears different. Neither are the relations between management and employees culturally configured along the lines of parental caretakers and children in need of protection and security nor is there an emphasis on unity and togetherness-something that is central for the functioning of normative control, that is, the managerial attempt to regulate organizational members’ thoughts, values, and emotions, in family cultures. By contrast, the culture of the organization empirically investigated seems more open, casual, and individualistic. This motivates the article to pursue the following research question: How does normative control operate when management fosters what I suggest to represent a friendship culture that also emphasizes close, intimate, and personal relationships, but which, in contrast to the family culture, appears more open, egalitarian, and individualistic?</p>
<p>This question is worth addressing for at least two reasons. First, exploring a friendship culture is important for advancing our understanding of normative control. A friendship culture is more open and fluid but also less protective and stable than a family culture. At first sight, normative control appears more absent in such a setting, celebrating individuality, choice, and egalitarianism, when compared with a family culture, where management is still placed in the position of authority. One contribution of this article is to develop how a culture of friendship accentuates and extends management control in four distinct ways that entail certain paradoxes and reinforcing control circles.</p>
<p>Second, sociological studies have noted how our contemporary <italic>zeitgeist</italic> places great emphasis on individuality, freedom of choice, and spontaneity as well as entails an antiauthoritarian stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492612439104">King &amp; Devere, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492612439104">Pahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492612439104">Vernon, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612439104">Boltanski and Chiapello (2005)</xref>, this spirit is reflected in contemporary management discourse and practice so that a family imagery, associated with something “hierarchical, repressive, paternalistic, and deferential to higher external authorities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612439104">Casey, 1999</xref>, p. 162), is not apposite. Although I do not seek to make any grand historiographical claims, I propose that in organizations, such as knowledge-intensive firms, which stress autonomy and individual choice, culture management programs might embrace a friendship instead of family imagery, given the latter’s negative connotations of authority and dependence. A further contribution of the article is therefore to move beyond the research focus on family culture and shed light on a culture of friendship, its distinct features, and ways of operating, which are indicative of our current zeitgeist.</p>
<p>The structure of the article is as follows: I introduce extant research on normative control in family cultures, as this provides the platform to later develop the nuanced ways how normative control operates in a friendship culture when compared with a family culture. This is the aim of the empirical analysis, which, after methodological discussions, explores how a management consultancy firm displays a culture of friendship and how this brings about certain forms of normative control. The discussion theoretically develops how a culture of friendship extends and accentuates control, as it involves certain paradoxes and reinforcing control circles.</p>

<title>Family Culture and Normative Control</title>
<p>Over the past decades, a growing body of research has investigated how culture management seeks to shape, influence, and control employees’ “hearts and minds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492612439104">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492612439104">Barley &amp; Kunda, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612439104">Casey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492612439104">Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492612439104">Ray, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492612439104">Van Maanen, 1991</xref>). Control is concerned with the orchestration and mobilization of resources, outputs, and individuals toward certain ends. What is specific to control through culture management is how it tries to indirectly mold employee selves through instilling certain norms, values, and beliefs. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492612439104">Etzioni (1964)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> defines this as <italic>normative control</italic>, namely, as “the attempt to elicit and direct the required efforts of [organizational] members by controlling the underlying experience, thoughts, and feelings that guide their actions” (p. 11). Normative control targets the “inside” of organizational actors and does not require force from “outside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 2008</xref>, p. 55). Its aim is that members internalize and behave in accordance with the values and norms underlying a corporate culture, as they identify with and define themselves through the organization.</p>
<p>A number of studies have shown how normative control is exercised in cultures that draw on various metaphors, such as those relating to teams or family (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492612439104">Barker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612439104">Casey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>). In this article, I focus on the family metaphor as, much like the notion of friendship, it carries certain emotional connotations (in contrast to the team metaphor, which is more narrowly associated with group work, tasks, and decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492612439104">Sinclair, 1992</xref>]). Much research has highlighted the significance of family cultures, where culture management discourses and practices seek to depict the company through the imagery of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492612439104">Garsten, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492612439104">Knights &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612439104">Parker, 1995</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> notes, “The notion of ‘family’ . . . suggests that members have strong emotional ties to [the company] to the point where they become ‘inextricably connected’ to the company” (p. 79). The family metaphor is typically used to refer to a group of individuals forming a unity on the basis of given characteristics entailing authority relations along the lines of parents and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>). In the context of organizations, family cultures are characterized by an emphasis on emotional group relations of unity and paternalistic management styles. I will refer to the specific characteristics of family culture in more detail below (when comparing it with the culture of friendship), but for now, I want to outline how normative control operates in family cultures.</p>
<p>A family culture involves the promise of security and protection, in light of a caring paternal management, against the backdrop of a seemingly uncertain world (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492612439104">Ouchi, 1980</xref>). The ensuing associations of warmth, care, and protection serve “securing workers’ loyalty, and promoting identification with the firm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>, p. 204). Portrayed as something good, caring, and protective, managerial authority is also legitimized—something that produces particular gender effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492612439104">Kerfoot &amp; Knights, 1993</xref>). In family cultures, employees are placed in the position of children who are in “dependence on the moral judgments of others and how they define the prevailing social situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>, p. 1470). The family imagery can, furthermore, suppress and conceal conflict and tensions, as these contradict the idea of a “happy family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612439104">Casey, 1999</xref>) and are not understood within the political arena of industrial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492612439104">Casey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>). Given the emphasis on unity, individuals failing to participate in the family in the appropriate ways are sanctioned by the authorities and other employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612439104">Casey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Toward Friendship Culture</title>
<p>This article suggests that research needs to move beyond the focus on the family metaphor, as corporate cultures evoking the imagery of friendship might have become common. A friendship culture shares with the family culture the emphasis on informality, closeness, and intimacy, yet it celebrates individualism and egalitarianism instead of unity and parental authority. Such a friendship culture and its implications for normative control have not been empirically or theoretically investigated so far. Thus, we do not understand yet how a friendship culture operates, what its features are, and how it relates to normative control—this is the focus of the present article. In the following, I outline why cultures of friendship rather than those of family might be significant today.</p>
<p>The studies cited above have pointed out how family cultures can bring about tensions, ambiguities, and forms of resistance given the normative control effects involved. Most importantly, for my purposes, they have noted how the cultural emphasis on family can greatly conflict with subjects’ understanding of selfhood, particularly relating to independence and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612439104">Casey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492612439104">O’Leary, 2003</xref>). This is the case, as it places employees in the position of childlike dependency and requires them to adjust to uniform group norms, values, and attitudes. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612439104">Boltanski and Chiapello (2005)</xref>, for this reason, family cultures might no longer be apposite today; workplace cultures, resembling the “domestic world,” that is, the family, are “becoming unacceptable to the various actors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612439104">Boltanski &amp; Chiapello, 2005</xref>, p. 135), given increasing wider cultural demands for liberation from forms of authoritarianism associated with the family, church, and so on (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492612439104">Ross, 2004</xref>, p. 93). This parallels observations of various sociological and psychoanalytic studies that refer to the demise of family values, among other things, due to their negative evocations of paternalism and authority, and the increasing cultural significance placed on individuality, freedom of choice, and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492612439104">King &amp; Devere, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492612439104">Pahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1056492612439104">Salecl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492612439104">Vernon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492612439104">Žižek, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>That the imagery of family in corporate cultures might have somewhat lost its appeal is, indeed, pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref>. Referring to wider cultural changes, in the more recently written epilogue to his well-cited ethnographic study of culture and normative control at the engineering company “Tech,” he remarks,
<disp-quote>
<p>Instead of the powerful images of love, marriage, family, indeed, even religion, used by proponents of the cultural paradigm to justify strong and long-lasting connections between employers and employees, we find an imagery of hedonistic and self-serving individualism resting . . . on mutually beneficial, yet nonbinding one-night stands. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>, pp. 230-231)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What Kunda seems to suggest here is that cultures emphasizing metaphors, such as those of family, are being replaced by more informal, open, and what I will argue friendship-oriented ones. In other words, rather than invoking the family imagery with its connotations of security, unity, and authority, corporate cultures seem to have moved toward an emphasis on individuality, choice, and openness. But how do such emerging cultures beyond the family metaphor operate? How can we conceptualize them? And what happens to normative control in an apparently more open and “nonbinding” cultural setting?</p>
<sec id="section4-1056492612439104">
<title>Introducing the Notion of Friendship</title>
<p>In the present article, I seek to answer these important, yet still neglected questions on the basis of an empirical case. This demonstrates how the notion of friendship can usefully capture the relationships, values, experiences, norms, and behaviors, fostered within organizational cultural arrangements beyond the family metaphor. The notions of family and friendship overlap but carry distinct connotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612439104">Allan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492612439104">French, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492612439104">Pahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492612439104">Silver, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492612439104">Vernon, 2007</xref>). In terms of similarity, both notions refer to private, intimate, and informal relations. In terms of difference, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer and Pahl (2006)</xref> point out that friendships are commonly understood to be chosen, whereas familial relations are predetermined as captured in the phrase that “you can choose your friends, but you cannot choose your family” (p. 109). This has significant implications for the nature of the bond and interaction.</p>
<p>In the following, we will see that in the context of corporate culture and normative control, it is central how the imagery of family is associated with unity and paternalistic authority and thus security and protection, whereas that of friendship—given that it is understood to be “freely” chosen—carries connotations of individualism, choice, and equality. In particular, I will show that despite its image of spontaneity, openness, and individuality, friendship can give rise to forms of normative control. This is the case, as management actively tries to build a culture around friendship, whereby friendship simultaneously resides in the formal and informal organizational realm—an insight that extant management research has largely neglected so far. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492612439104">Grey and Sturdy (2007)</xref> have recently pointed out that the phenomenon of friendship has not only received “little, if any, direct attention” (pp. 157-158) but also that when studied, it is dominantly treated as “the ‘other’ of formal organization” (p. 160). By contrast, in this article, I will demonstrate how there can be an interplay of formality and informality, as friendship is appropriated by culture management.</p>

<title>Empirical Study at ZOI Consulting</title>
<p>The empirical data stem from a research project exploring the relationship of work versus nonwork identities, culture, and control at a management consultancy firm termed ZOI Consulting. A case study approach was chosen with the aim of developing an in-depth understanding of organizational culture and of exploratory theory building. In line with the interpretive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492612439104">Van Maanen, 1979</xref>), qualitative data were gathered to gain access into the complex and varied ways in which actors understand, construct, and experience organizational reality.</p>
<sec id="section6-1056492612439104">
<title>The Case of ZOI Consulting</title>
<p>ZOI Consulting constitutes a large, global professional services firm. This study focuses on its “human competences” (HC) consulting team in the United Kingdom. The firm represents an attractive site for studying culture, as this constitutes a central management concern. As one human resource (HR) manager remarks, “It is all about the culture and the people . . . the people make the firm.” Such a focus on culture is typical for knowledge-intensive firms, as employees, their knowledge, problem-solving ability, and creativity are regarded as their main asset. For these to flourish, a supporting, informal and nonhierarchical culture is said to be required. Given the nature of their work, knowledge workers are granted high levels of autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492612439104">Newell, Roberston, Scarbrough, &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>), which “calls for some degree of influence on cultural orientation and identity in order to make people inclined to do the right thing voluntarily, and in the absence of monitoring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492612439104">Alvesson, 2004</xref>, p. 130). Thus, normative control is especially relevant in the context of knowledge-intensive firms, such as ZOI Consulting.</p>
<p>In addition, given the accent on autonomy in knowledge-intensive firms, cultural arrangements that move beyond the metaphor of the family emphasizing authority and uniformity might be particularly prevalent here. Furthermore, management consultancy firms are typically characterized by a high volatility of organizational members at all levels so that one can expect what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006</xref>, pp. 230-231) refers to as “one-night stands” instead of “long-lasting connections,” namely, a culture with seemingly more open and fluid rather than enclosed, set, and binding relations. The case of a management consultancy firm, and specifically such a “top” firm like ZOI, is, moreover, fruitful in providing insights on dominant ideals of corporate culture. Such firms are regarded as archetypical apprehensions of contemporary organizations, as they represent central actors in the distribution and representation of management discourse and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492612439104">Furusten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492612439104">Whittle, 2005</xref>). Hence, certain themes, indicative of the current management zeitgeist, are likely to be especially apparent here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1056492612439104">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The contact to ZOI Consulting was established through a former student of the university. The research proposal was framed around the topic of “work–life balance issues,” particularly concerning employees’ perceptions of their work and nonwork self and corporate culture. During 4 months in 2007 interview, participant observation and documentary data were gathered. The largest amount of data was generated in 42 interviews with consultants from the HC team, ranging from analyst to director level and 1 interview with a HR manager (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492612439104">Table 1</xref>). The job responsibilities differ between hierarchy levels, in that client interactions and management duties increase the higher one moves up the hierarchy: analysts and consultants conduct more back-office work (including calculations, analysis, and preparations of presentations), whereas senior consultants, managers, and senior managers engage more directly with clients and lead the consulting teams. From senior management level onward, individuals are responsible for project acquisition. Within the HC team, the directors and partners are “sponsors” of internal initiatives, such as days away, team exercises, and so forth, whereby consultants from a range of hierarchy levels are responsible for their planning and organization. Moreover, individuals from manager to partner level evaluate the consultants and make decisions regarding career advance and project allocations.</p>

<p>One HR manager was interviewed to gain a deeper understanding of the official HR discourse, the kind of person recruited, and culture management. The sample of the interview represents 25% of the total members of the HC team. Its distribution regarding hierarchy and tenure (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492612439104">Table 2</xref>) roughly follows that of the overall team. The sample was based on self-selection. A personal assistant sent out e-mails, asking people to volunteer to participate in the study. This may have meant that employees who are particularly committed to the firm or those who want to express their grievances about work might have been especially prone to sign up for an interview. However, such a bias in one direction or another could not be found in the interview responses. Thus, the self-selection does not seem to have influenced the study’s findings. To ensure that the sample is representative, toward the end of the study, individuals from particular hierarchy levels (e.g., analysts) were encouraged to participate. One limitation of the sample is that I did not interview partners. To a certain extent, this is compensated for by the participant observations and interviews with the directors and the HR manager who, as top firm representatives, are likely to reproduce the official management discourse promoted by the partners.</p>

<p>The interviews, lasting between 45 min to 2 hr, took place mostly in meeting rooms at the firm’s London offices. Before each interview, apart from assuring data protection and confidentiality, I informed interviewees on how findings will be reported back to management, namely, in an aggregated and quantitative manner so that they remain unidentifiable. The interviews were semistructured and roughly followed an ethnographic interview guide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492612439104">Spradley, 1979</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-1056492612439104" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Background questions to learn about the interviewees’ position at work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Framing questions regarding the culture, working life and people’s interests, and lives outside of work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Focus questions about people’s identity constructions within work and nonwork and attitudes/feelings about corporate life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Concluding remarks of interviewee.</p></list-item></list>
<p>I used the guide in a flexible manner. When interviewees reported insightful incidents, stories, or experiences, I let their narrative flow and did not strictly adhere to the schedule.</p>
<p>Over the 4 months, I went up to 10 times to one of the offices and gathered a total of approximately 35 hr of participant observation data on organizational practices and social interactions. This enabled me to take detailed notes of the office life. Most importantly for this article, on two occasions I was invited to socialize with a consulting project team in a pub next to the office after work, one time for over 5 hr at the beginning of the study and another time for about 3 hr in the middle of the study. This yielded rich data on team member interactions, which I wrote down in a field diary. Finally, documentary data, such as recruitment brochures, leaflets, advertisements, and websites, were gathered. These were fruitful sources for learning about the cultural scripts, language, and meaning systems. I also collected newspaper articles and external career websites to learn about the company’s business model, market position, and reputation.</p>
<p>These three data sources had different, albeit complementary uses: the documentary data enabled me to understand the organizational context and learn the specific terminology and frequently used expressions at the firm. In familiarizing myself with these, I was in a better position to establish rapport with and understand the informants. The documentary data also provided clues on the kind of persona espoused to at ZOI Consulting, since they offered access to the official culture management discourse. My understanding of this was, furthermore, enhanced through the interview with the HR manager. The interviews with the consultants revealed how they talk about, understand, and experience the culture and construct their identity. In providing firsthand insights into the cultural practices in use, the participant observation data substantiated the other data types.</p>
<p>The first occasion of participant observation is of great importance to this article, as here the topic of friendship initially surfaced, which was right at the beginning of the research study before any interviews had taken place. The first time I was with a consulting team at a pub, I noticed how the interactions between the people, including management, were characterized by informality, intimacy, and closeness. This experience and observation was corroborated in the interviews and later observations (e.g., in another “pub session,” which took place in the middle of the research process). The interview data are a further source this article particularly relies on. Specifically, when I asked how to describe the culture, interviewees referred to rituals (e.g., “common to go to the pub together”), values (e.g., “we have a community ethos”), and stories, indicative of what I conceptualize as a culture of friendship. The idea regarding a culture of friendship emerged especially from one interview, which took place in the middle of the research study, where one consultant referred to a manager as “a friend.” In this sense, from the start (given the initial participant observations at the pub) and through the interviews, friendship surfaced as a central theme. It should be noted that although this theme emerged, I did not change my interview protocol during the study. It was designed in such an open-ended manner, entailing general questions regarding culture so that data concerning friendship could surface without addressing it in a specific manner (this means that the data presented in this article are not prompted by leading questions).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The study is neither driven by a deductive logic nor does it follow a strict grounded theory approach (when entering the field I had certain theoretical conceptions of culture in mind). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492612439104">Alvesson and Kärreman (2007)</xref> have recently argued, “Data is inextricably fused with theory” (p. 1265). The interplay between theory and empirics represents one of abduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492612439104">Alvesson &amp; Kärreman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492612439104">Locke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492612439104">Van Maanen et al., 2007</xref>). I approached the field through established interpretations concerning culture and normative control, although being open to and searching for surprising phenomena, such as the culture of friendship, not fitting extant interpretations. These phenomena then made me rethink prior conceptions, and this entailed a creative theory building process concerning the culture of friendship and normative control.</p>
<p>I transcribed all data and coded them with the computer software <italic>Atlas.ti</italic>. First, I coded the first-order “in vivo” data by searching for relevant words, phrases, and descriptions, such as “down-to-earth,” that capture the cultural arrangements and experiences at ZOI Consulting. Second, I grouped and merged these codes into first-order categories, which are still close to the informants’ language and meaning systems. An example of first-order categories is “buddy relations to introduce people.” Following this, the data analysis process entailed linking and collapsing the first-order categories into significant second-order themes, such as “rituals.” These themes are derived from the theoretically informed interpretations of the data and thus are distinct from the first-order categories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492612439104">Van Maanen, 1979</xref>). This step was iterative and involved a meticulous process of going back and forth between the emerging insights from the data, extant theorizations, and creative theory building. Finally, I linked the second-order themes to two overarching theoretical dimensions, namely, friendship culture and normative control. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056492612439104">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the emerging data structure with the first-order categories, second-order themes, and higher-level theoretical dimensions, which underpins the findings presented in this article. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1056492612439104">Table 3</xref>, representative first-order data are displayed, on the basis of which the first-order categories and second-order themes were developed.</p>

<title>Friendship Culture at ZOI Consulting</title>
<p>Typical for a professional services firm, the culture management discourses and practices at ZOI Consulting emphasize hard work, professionalism, and client ethos (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492612439104">Anderson-Gough, Grey, &amp; Robson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492612439104">Grey, 1998</xref>). Apart from this, through various rituals, practices, and discourses, they are geared toward informality, leisure, and intimacy. They portray the image of an open, egalitarian, and informal workplace, where people can live out their nonwork interests and interact with each other in close and personal ways. According to one consultant (1 year),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1056492612439104">1</xref></sup> the importance placed on personal relationships in the HC team relates to the fact that “the team is geared towards people issues and that is why we focus on relationships internally.” The notion of friendship significantly shapes the ways in which people make sense of the relationships and the culture at ZOI Consulting. Individuals state that “the culture is quite conducive to meeting people . . . and building friendships” (analyst [A], 1 year) and that “we are all friends here” (consultant [C], 3 years). The following analyzes how a friendship culture is present at ZOI Consulting. To develop its specific features and ways of operating, I compare the findings with those reported in studies of family cultures at the end of each section.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1056492612439104">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section10-1056492612439104">
<title>Recruitment—Diverse People to Hang Out With</title>
<p>The recruitment process is very meticulous at ZOI Consulting. The candidates have to go through various interview stages, where they meet a variety of consultants from different hierarchy levels. One criterion, particularly important for successful recruitment, is that the candidate convinces people that they “fit into the culture” (HR Manager [HRM], Manager [M], 4 years). One manager (8 years) explains what this means:
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to work with people to whom you can talk about more things than work . . . you can go for drinks with . . . like to hang around even after work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many employees share similar interests (e.g., train for marathons) and come from the same universities (e.g., Oxbridge). Interestingly, despite this apparent homogeneity (of which more later), what ZOI’s culture strongly stresses is the diversity and individuality of organizational members. This is, for instance, apparent in the diversity and inclusion campaigns advertised all over the offices and on the firm’s website. ZOI Consulting recruits graduates from different academic backgrounds, such as history, arts, language, and business. Moreover, the team members are of different nationalities, such as British, German, Nigerian, or Dutch. This may explain why individuals describe the culture as “diverse and open-minded” (Director [D], 8 years), and on the website, it states, “At ZOI you work one to one or in a team with a range of people from diverse backgrounds.”</p>
<p>The majority of ZOI consultants are young. This is the case across hierarchy levels, as one can find people on the manager level aged 29 years old or a 31-year-old director. The young average age also results from the fact that consultancy is typically considered as an entry job, which opens up great opportunities for career advancement in other industries/organizations later on so that individuals usually do not stay at ZOI Consulting for life (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492612439104">Sturdy &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). But it also marks management’s efforts to create a culture that is considered “very energetic, positive, young, and dynamic” (M, 5 years), where people engage with each other in friendship-like ways.</p>
<p>The literature on family cultures, similarly, notes the significance placed on recruiting individuals “fitting into” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>, p. 131) the company. One difference is that at ZOI Consulting, this “fit” is more strongly assessed on the basis of candidates’ nonwork persona. In particular, at ZOI Consulting, diversity and individuality is a greater concern than described by studies of family culture. Such an emphasis on diversity and individuality is seen to have become more prevalent in various kinds of businesses today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492612439104">Fleming &amp; Sturdy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492612439104">Zanoni &amp; Janssens, 2004</xref>), a trend that is reflected in a friendship culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1056492612439104">
<title>Socialization—The Buddy Initiative</title>
<p>Apart from some formal training sessions concerning consultancy work, new recruits are socialized into the firm through the so-called “buddy initiative.” This encourages and helps newcomers to form personal relationships:
<disp-quote>
<p>We allocate a buddy to people before they join and when they actually do join it is someone they can go to for informal questions . . . Just like a person to introduce them. (C, 4 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through a discourse of friendship, that is, the “buddy,” employees are “introduced” into the organization. To this extent, from the moment of entering the firm, individual’s work life is shaped by “informal,” friendship-like relationships. Moreover, newcomers are expected to “go around to everyone . . . [so that] they can get to know them” (M, 5 years).</p>
<p>Such informal socialization is, of course, part and parcel of any culture (given its tacit and intangible nature). What is distinct is the emphasis placed on informal relations and the relative insignificance of “formal socialization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612439104">Casey, 1995</xref>, p. 79). Previous studies have reported that recruits are given a clear and defined “manual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>, p. 6) or “handbook” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>, p. 1481). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> states that “although the product—a member role consisting of behavior, thoughts, and feelings—is not concrete, there are specified ways of engineering it: making presentations, sending ‘messages’ . . . giving speeches, formulating and publishing the ‘rules’” (p. 7). At ZOI Consulting, the cultural rules and scripts are not “formulated and published” but need to be picked up by the candidates in informal socialization processes, particularly through the friendship-like relations and going around to people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1056492612439104">
<title>Rituals of Play, Drinking, and Sport</title>
<p>The rituals of the HC team highlight further how culture management discourses and practices invoke the notion of friendship. Rituals are conventional practices and acts in groups, and as such significantly shape people’s understanding of a shared situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492612439104">Dacin, Munir, &amp; Tracey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492612439104">Douglas, 1966/2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492612439104">Turner, 1982</xref>). At ZOI Consulting, the regularly organized team or so-called “fun events” (A, 1 year) constitute a ritual. They enable individuals to “get to know people” and engage with each other in ways “where . . . rank and hierarchy have absolutely no bearing at all” (M, 6 years). Alongside these team events, it is common for people to “play football with the team on Sundays” (C, 1 year), “train for the marathon” (M, 3 years), and “get together, go for drinks, and have fun” (M, 2 years) in casual and relaxed environments. The significance of such rituals of nonwork activities is, for example, underlined in the recruitment brochures where consultants are displayed participating in sport challenges. Moreover, I experienced with a team at the pub how people go out and drink together. At one pub evening, the director (9 years) said to me in a joking tone:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is normal for us to have meetings in the pub, have so much fun together and free alcohol.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These leisurely activities are commonly associated with friendships, as they involve sharing oneself with others and abandoning behavioral protocols; drinking and alcohol entail the relaxation of norms and a great amount of self-disclosure, which requires a certain level of trust, typically present in friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612439104">Allan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492612439104">Silver, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Although previous studies have also pointed to rituals of team building exercises (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612439104">Casey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>), the nature of these rituals differs here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> mainly describes meetings, lectures, and training workshops, which are more directly work related, whereby “timeout meetings” (p. 149) seem to be the only exception. However, these do not seem to entail such an emphasis on nonwork activities in form of socializing, drinking, and sport as in a friendship culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer and Pahl (2006)</xref> note how “companionship and fun” are “taken for granted” in friendship relations but “not expected” (2006, p. 114) in families. This also means that in a friendship culture, team activities often take place outside the firm’s walls, whereas the spatial locus of family cultures seems to be more the company “home.”</p>

<title>Egalitarian and Open Atmosphere</title>
<p>Organizational members describe the atmosphere as “sociable and friendly” (Senior Consultant [SC], 2 years) with a “community ethos” (C, 3 years) and where management is “interested in you as a person rather than as a colleague” (A, 2 years). Here the still existing hierarchical and formal relationships are culturally downplayed. For example, one recruiting leaflet states, “Our teams operate in an informal manner . . . so that you learn a lot.” A sense of egalitarianism and openness is fostered, in that individuals note how they “can speak to anyone at any level” (A, 1 year) and in that the atmosphere is “quite nonhierarchical” (M, 2 years) and “open and sociable” (C, 3 years). Management’s efforts to create a friendship culture of openness and egalitarianism are apparent in this interview excerpt:
<disp-quote>
<p>At these [team] events we have the whole community . . . together. . . . It is down-to-earth. It shows the leadership team trying to interact with people on the same level, being . . . down-to-earth. (M, 11 month)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These gatherings are used by leadership to instill a “down-to-earth” atmosphere, where people relate to them in informal, nonhierarchical, and, indeed, friendship-like ways:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is one partner who you will see most Fridays down in the pub having a drink and you can go and chat to him like a <italic>friend</italic> [italics added]. He will buy you a drink and chat to you. He is interested in everybody. He really wants to know how people are doing. (M, 3 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This remark is corroborated by my observations of a team at the pub, where the director kept on laughing and joking around with everyone. In some ways, it seemed as if we were a group of friends hanging out and drinking together after work.</p>
<p>A friendship culture, like a family culture, stresses personal and informal relationships and downplays hierarchy. The difference between these cultures lies in management’s role of paternal authority and the accent on unity. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming (2005)</xref> observes how a family culture seeks to “discard formal relations and promote a trusting and kindred atmosphere” (p. 1477). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> notes how at the engineering firm Tech “[u]nity and similarity are emphasized, authority and power deemphasized and legitimated: the distinction between management and employees is conveyed by the unquestioned imagery of parental or religious authority” (p. 90). At ZOI Consulting, management does not take the role of “parental . . . authority,” but that of “the friend.” Thus, culturally hierarchy is more downplayed, and simultaneously egalitarian relations are more stressed. It should also be noted that there is not an emphasis on the sense of “we are one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>, p. 51). Although some individuals refer to a “community,” this is more diverse, open, and characterized by individual relationships.</p>

<title>Normative Control in the Friendship Culture at ZOI Consulting</title>
<p>In this section, I analyze how despite its celebration of openness, egalitarianism, and individuality, the friendship culture at ZOI Consulting entails normative control. We can recall that normative control is concerned with a managerial attempt to mold organizational members through instilling certain values, norms, and behaviors. The following develops how in a friendship culture there are four interrelated ways in which normative control is exercised, involving certain paradoxes and reinforcing control circles (I elaborate on these in more detail in the discussion). To illustrate the particular workings of normative control in a friendship culture, I again provide a comparison with the family culture.</p>
<sec id="section15-1056492612439104">
<title>Integration of Overall Life</title>
<p>In a friendship culture, individuals are expected to express and live out their nonwork interests and selves. How this can involve a compulsory logic is revealed by one senior manager’s remark (2 years):
<disp-quote>
<p>I take out my team for drinks in Amsterdam once a week. . . . If two, three weeks in a row someone doesn’t want to come, then I think: “hm, what’s wrong with her?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, I observed on the Friday evening with the team at the pub how consultants kept on receiving phone calls from their friends to meet up. Nobody left the pub though, because the director was still present. We can thus see how a friendship culture involves the extension of work into the realm of nonwork and the incorporation of nonwork into that of work, thereby greatly affecting people’s overall selves and lives. The result of this is that organizational members relate to the company not only on the basis of the actual work but, more importantly, through the various nonwork activities and generally the culture of friendship. That such an identification beyond work and, indeed, of some kind of lifestyle is desired by how this can generate positive attitudes toward ZOI Consulting is evidenced here:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is so great to work here. I learn so much [and] . . . developed so many friendships. It is an amazing job. At times it really doesn’t feel like a job and that is so great about it. (M, 3 years)</p>
<p>We have a lot of fun together . . . in the project team … With one of the managers and the analyst on our project we all went glasses shopping, because we all needed new glasses. After that we decided to go for drinks and that is the sort of thing that one would normally do with friends. But I think it is fantastic that one can be like this here. (C, 5 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These remarks highlight how in light of the friendship culture, people develop positive feelings toward ZOI Consulting. They regard it as more than a job, namely, as a basis to live out their overall, that is work and nonwork, life and self. Thus, they integrate their overall selves into the company, thereby displaying the preferred organizational self of an open, sociable, and fun person.</p>
<p>However, there are also individuals who find this integration of the overall self and its accompanying normative control effects of having to be fun, open, and sociable troubling. They feel it “encroaches on [their] life” (C, 3 years) and requires them to “reveal much [of their] personal life” (C, 1 year). Consultants also note how having to “constantly . . . give more of themselves” (Senior Manager [SM], 2 years) makes it difficult to sustain their friends and interests outside work. As people are “supposed to do all with ZOI Consulting” (M, 3 years), they have to “give up lots of [their] interests” (M, 5 years) and are “doing a lot less . . . like sports, activities, or just seeing [their] friends outside of work” (A, 2 years). This vanishing of the nonwork life can make individuals turn back to their work then, as a basis for their social life, interests and, indeed, selfhood. As one manager (7 years) states, “It is strange, but at some point you just lose track with your old friends . . . and what is happening at work is the more important.”</p>
<p>At the same time, employee friendships at work are also affected by the culture. Of course, there are consultants referring to friendships, formed more outside the realm of culture management. Yet people note how “at times you can never quite be sure who your friends are” (M, 2 years)— I discuss further below how this can imply the undermining of collective forms of employee subversion. One analyst (1 year), for example, remarks that her workplace friendships are influenced by her not being “as good in [the] job” as her friends—something that makes her feel “less significant within the group.” This reveals how employee friendships can also be understood through and lived out within the regulatory meaning systems of the corporate culture (namely, in terms of what it means to be a “good” consultant).</p>
<p>Like in a family culture, in a friendship culture management seeks to instill certain values, norms, feelings, and behaviors, making individuals act in ways desired by the company. One central difference is that these are more strongly related to the nonwork realm. The preferred ZOI Consulting persona is not only professional and hard-working but also sociable, fun, and approachable. This differs from insights of previous research, where the company self is primarily defined in relation to values associated with work—something that the notion of family with its connotations of “duty and obligation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>, p. 114) fosters. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda’s (2006)</xref> “engineering self” displays the “appropriate behaviors (‘doing what’s right,’ ‘working hard’ . . . ), the cognitions (‘the importance of technological accomplishment’ . . . ), and emotions (‘commitment’ . . . ‘enthusiasm’)” (p. 154). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612439104">Casey’s (1999)</xref> “designer self” exhibits the “values of dedication, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and passion for the product and customer” (p. 161). In comparison with this, the friendship culture more strongly embraces values, norms, and behaviors beyond their everyday professional work. As I develop in the discussion, this serves to accentuate and extend control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1056492612439104">
<title>From Uncertainty to Dependence</title>
<p>In a friendship culture, relationships are not given and fixed. People do not have clearly assigned roles, as friendships are experienced as being established out of interest and choice. This makes them seem more fluid, open, and individualistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612439104">Allan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492612439104">Silver, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>). As there is not such a homogeneous unity with stable relationships in a friendship culture, individuals can find themselves in a state of uncertainty, which is amplified by the coming and going of team members at ZOI Consulting. These remarks highlight the sense of uncertainty:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is very easy to get lost in ZOI, because there is no hierarchy or team structure. (SC, 2 years)</p>
<p>Often you don’t know what and where things are going on, which can be a bit overwhelming. (C, 3 years)</p>
<p>Less positive [aspects of the culture are] . . . when I am really not sure what I am supposed to be doing and I am not sure to whom I am meant to be going. There is kind of a lot of uncertainty. (C, 4 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That individuals working for ZOI Consulting for 3-4 years (this is considered long) report a sense of uncertainty shows how this represents a deep-seated phenomenon.</p>
<p>At the same time as the friendship culture fosters some kind of uncertainty, consultants try to overcome this very uncertainty through friendship relations. Given the uncertainty people feel a constant need to keep up and secure friendship relations. This involves making themselves known within the team by participating in various activities and going up to the team members:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is massively important that you know people and that they know you. (A, 2 years)</p>
<p>The emphasis is on visibility, on how you come across . . . and that you are known and . . . hang out with others. (C, 5 years)</p>
<p>I realized that is so important to go to all these social events and talk to people. (M, 2 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, uncertainty coupled with the need to be known promotes employee behaviors, such as participating in the various nonwork activities and being sociable and friendly, desired in the friendship culture. Consultants express how this can create a sense of inauthenticity of having to “hang out with others,” “go to all . . . social events,” and “always make sure . . . [to] go these events regularly” (SC, 2 years). Thereby, this need to establish friendships also involves a feeling of being dependent on others. One manager (2 years) remarks that it is “important . . . that [others] know [and are friends] with you” and that you “stay in the loop of others.” Thus, the very celebration of individuality and choice in a friendship culture, paradoxically, can entail greater dependence on others accompanied with a sense of inauthenticity. Moreover, the attempt to overcome uncertainty through friendships can, in fact, heighten it:
<disp-quote>
<p>I . . . always ask myself, have I done enough [in terms of participating in the culture]? Or do I need to be known more? I am never sure about it. (SM, 2 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This reinforcement of uncertainty (“I am never sure”) results from the way in which in a friendship culture, given its accent on individuality, choice, and openness, relationships are not fixed and set, but require constant reaffirmation by individuals.</p>
<p>These insights of the culture of friendship diverge from those of family cultures, as here people do not “have their proper place in it, just as in a family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1999</xref>, p. 180). Instead of the “sentiments of care, protection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>, p. 1476) and the image of “a haven of stability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>, p. 175), a friendship culture stresses individual choice, openness, and diversity. That is, “relations are not prescribed . . . in contrast to the restriction of freedom in the family model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612439104">Boltanski &amp; Chiapello, 2005</xref>, p. 134). This implies a more complex interplay of uncertainty, culture, and normative control. As mentioned above, in some ways family cultures propagate the overcoming of uncertainty through stressing unity and parental management. In contrast to this, a friendship culture itself induces uncertainty, because it emphasizes individuality, choice, and egalitarianism. That is, relations are “not expected to last indefinitely” and thus not “taken for granted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>, p. 114). This results in greater dependency, in that individuals constantly need to reconfirm friendship relations. Such a dependency is also reported in family cultures, yet apart from being heightened due to the greater uncertainty, in a friendship culture it does not revolve around one defined “benevolent patriarch” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming, 2005</xref>, p. 1477) but entails various individual and shifting relationships with “others.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1056492612439104">
<title>Identity Regulation through Clique Formations</title>
<p>Although in the previous section the empirical data demonstrate how individuals experience uncertainty regarding the relationships in a friendship culture, in the following two sections I discuss how at the same time organizational members perceive the existence of certain influential in-groups and important individuals in higher hierarchical positions—something that entails two distinct facets of normative control. At first sight, this seems conflictual, yet we can explain these different perceptions by the way in which the perceived influential in-groups and important people are shifting and changing. Although at times individuals seem to know who or what group it is important to be friends with, this is only momentarily the case, in light of the volatile team membership (something I discuss in more detail later on) and given that friendships are not set but constantly need to be reaffirmed. Moreover, I show shortly, how the very perception of not being part of cliques can reinforce a sense of uncertainty. Finally, individuals’ wish to belong to in-groups, and their practice of looking up to those positioned higher within the hierarchy can be interpreted as part of their struggle to find and maintain their place in this uncertain cultural setting.</p>
<p>Organizational members remark that there are certain influential, albeit shifting inner circles of friends, to which they aspire to belong. They state that the culture feels “quite clique” (M, 6 years). As one manager (5 years) puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>There certainly is a culture of a highly influential, inner circle of friends. It seems to be quite clear at times <italic>who is in</italic> and <italic>who is out</italic> [italics added].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her observation points out how there is an “inner circle,” which “at times”—thus not in a stable and given manner—shows a demarcation of inclusion (“in”) and exclusion (“out”). This is typical for groups, as it enables them to construct a positive social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492612439104">Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989</xref>). Such a demarcation often underlies friendships and can have regulatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492612439104">Derrida, 2005</xref>). The sense of exclusion makes individuals ask how they have to be in order to be “in” this “inner circle.” Such questioning involves making sense of oneself through the disciplinary meaning system underlying the corporate culture, namely, of what is regarded as desirable—something that members within inner circles are seen to embody—and what is not desirable (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492612439104">Rose, 1989</xref>). The observation of one senior manager (2 years) highlights this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes there is a sense of a clubby feeling between the partners and directors . . . that makes me question if they [management] are really looking for diversity? And I ask myself can I belong to it? I have the sense that I don’t feel like I can.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This club involves the exclusion of individuals in the team, which makes him feel not only that “diversity” is not possible here (as the culture of friendship with its inner circles is built upon homogeneity) but also that given the way he is in contrast to those members of the club, he cannot participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1056492612439104">3</xref></sup> How the perception of such an inner circle entails the enforcement of certain ways of being is expressed here:
<disp-quote>
<p>This community [referring to a certain circle] . . . demands more of an outgoing sort of individual, because it is all about people, building relationship, having fun and going out etc. (C, 9 months)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To be part of the “community,” individuals feel they have to display the identity desired within the corporate culture, namely, of being “outgoing” and hence not introvert. This taxonomic understanding of selfhood has “identity regulation” effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492612439104">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1056492612439104">4</xref></sup> Individuals construct themselves through organizational discourses and practices and thus seek to display the desired persona in such a culture of friendship. In this sense, a culture of friendship despite its emphasis on diversity and openness can, paradoxically, lead to forms of homogeneity, identity regulation, and individualized exclusion, given the perception of “behind-the-scenes,” yet at times visible in-groups. This can make individuals on the outside of these groups feel the more insecure about themselves, to the extent that they question themselves, that is, who they are and how/who they have to be in order to belong to them (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492612439104">Collinson, 2003</xref>). Hence, the existence of cliques can further reinforce uncertainty for those not part of the “inner circle” and therefore encourage them to build friendships and be part of certain circles.</p>
<p>Like a family culture, a friendship culture involves identity regulation effects, as members construct themselves in line with the culture, its values, and meaning systems (as the sections above also showed). One way in which identity regulation takes place concerns the perception of in-groups and thus of being excluded, which is different from family cultures. In cultures drawing on the family metaphor there is a stronger sense of unity and togetherness, and it is more obvious who is excluded. This is apparent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda’s (2006)</xref> study, where “[b]y implication, the principles of membership experience apply to all who are glossed by reference to ‘we’” (p. 68). In his case, “we” excludes “temporary workers” and “Wage Class 2” employees, such as secretaries, although it includes the engineers. In a friendship culture, it is not so clearly set who is in or out of the group. The demarcation does not follow such an obviously defined line. At ZOI Consulting, there seem to be various cliques. For some, the “inner circle” is that of directors and partners, whereas for others it is that of members of a certain project. This further underlines the ambiguity and uncertainty of the team structure. As a result, individuals, not belonging to a clique, are more insecure about themselves and question themselves concerning how they have to be in order to belong to a clique. Thereby, they understand their behaviors, attitudes, and so on and thus construct themselves through the organizationally desired self. In this sense, despite the celebration of heterogeneity and diversity, through identity regulation a certain homogeneity prevails in a friendship culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1056492612439104">
<title>Reinvigoration of Hierarchy</title>
<p>A friendship culture involves an interesting interplay between informality and formality. In emphasizing informal friendship relations, I propose, it simultaneously reinvigorates the formal hierarchical relations. As shown above, the sense of uncertainty leads to the need to be friends with others, and hence, it makes people dependent on other team members. This can in turn reinforce rather than reduce the perceived sense of uncertainty. In this section, I argue that, paradoxically, it involves the reinforcement of hierarchy and thus increasing influence of those positioned higher within the hierarchy (i.e., manager to partner level). It should again be stressed that this does not mean that the perceived uncertainty described above is reduced. This is the case, as at ZOI Consulting, the people who are positioned higher within the hierarchy are constantly changing, as generally team membership does. Moreover, such reinvigoration takes place in an opaque manner. But why or how can a friendship culture in emphasizing informality, paradoxically, reinforce hierarchy?</p>
<p>As egalitarian and intimate friendship relations are culturally stressed at ZOI Consulting, the hierarchical relations become the more important for consultants, because these provide clues on who is important to be friends with. Thus, there is an interesting tension between informality and formality:
<disp-quote>
<p>[People] want to be not hierarchical but in reality it is quite hierarchical. (C, 3 years)</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like everyone knows what is going on. So, I would go to my manager and say. “I have noticed this and that . . . can I help you with that?” That is what you have to do in order to do well. (C, 5 years)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The remark shows the need to establish “personal” relationships with those positioned higher within the hierarchy by “going” to them and offering one’s help in a friendly manner. Specifically, it reveals how this behavior is desired and fostered in a culture of friendship (“you have to do . . . [it] . . . to do well”) and how employees feel the need to align themselves to it (hence, experiencing it in a forced and fake manner). How this culture celebrates informal, egalitarian, and open relations, while reinforcing hierarchy, is confirmed by my observations of group interactions of the consulting team at the pub. In my field diary I wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the pub everyone sat around one table . . . It was a strange atmosphere because everyone was laughing, drinking and joking around, whilst at the same time they seemed to look up and carefully listen to what the director had to say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The requirement to “look up” to those positioned higher within the hierarchy is not explicitly conveyed to individuals because this would undermine the very cultural emphasis on informality, individuality, choice, and egalitarianism. It constitutes an “unspoken rule,” which individuals are, nevertheless, expected to know and follow:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean this is sort of an unspoken rule here that you constantly need to self-promote yourself [in front of management]. That also makes it quite competitive at times. (A, 2 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This underlines how the reinvigoration of hierarchy takes place in an inconspicuous manner, because outwardly the culture celebrates informal, egalitarian, open, and “down-to-earth” friendship relations, formed out of choice and mutual interest. It is therefore in the responsibility of the individual to be aware of the “unspoken rule.” This comment also highlights how, paradoxically, a friendship culture can give rise to competition for the friendship of those positioned higher within the hierarchy. In the discussion, I elaborate on how such competition with its individualizing effects can amplify control, but for now, I focus on the reinforcing paradox between friendship and hierarchy: a friendship culture downplays hierarchy, which, paradoxically, makes individuals place more, rather than less, emphasis on hierarchy, and this is then expressed in them seeking to establish friendship-like relations to those positioned higher within the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Again we find certain similarities to family cultures, in that there managerial authority is also said to be reinforced. The key difference lies in the way in which this occurs. The extant literature notes how hierarchy is substituted. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> argues that ‘culture’ replaces ‘structure’ as an organizing principle to explain reality and guide action” (p. 30). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612439104">Fleming (2005)</xref> show, management can derive power from and be legitimized through its cultural equation with paternal authority. In a friendship culture, management actively refrains from positioning itself as paternal authority, but in so doing, the still existing hierarchical structures become the more important for individuals. These provide them with guidelines concerning who one should be friends with. The relationship between culture and structure is therefore different: “Structure” provides the frame of understanding reality rather than solely “culture”, resulting in a complex and ambiguous interplay of hierarchy and friendship (something that can also engender a sense of inauthenticity among employees). Furthermore, when compared with family cultures, where management is outspokenly presented as paternal authority, all this takes place in an “unspoken” manner.</p>

<title>Reinforcing Paradoxes of Normative Control in Friendship Culture</title>
<p>In the empirical analysis, I have shed light on normative control in a culture of friendship. It should be stressed that I do not suggest that every friendship is necessarily and always enmeshed with control. Of course, there are spaces for friendships residing in the “unmanaged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1995</xref>) organizational realm. Notwithstanding this, the case of ZOI Consulting has revealed the ways in which friendship can also be part of the “managed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1995</xref>) organizational realm as it becomes a central coordinate within culture management. I have developed the features and ways of operating of a friendship culture as well as its relation to normative control by comparing it with family culture. In so doing, I do not seek to propose that every friendship (or family) culture necessarily contains all the features discussed here. Moreover, although I have compared and contrasted these two cultures, one might find elements of both in organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1056492612439104">5</xref></sup> I have illuminated certain similarities concerning the emphasis on intimate, private, and informal relationships and, indeed, the resulting existence of normative control. That is, in both cultures, there is the managerial attempt that members define themselves through the organizationally preferred norms, attitudes, and behaviors. Such normative control can involve a variety of employee responses, such as alignment, ambiguity, and inauthenticity.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis has also demonstrated how the nature and mechanisms of normative control differ in these two cultures: in a friendship culture, individuals’ overall selves are integrated more strongly, as greater emphasis is placed on the nonwork realm; rather than a sense of stability and protection, that of uncertainty prevails making subjects more dependent on others; in place of a somewhat clearly defined unity of “we,” the team is more fragmented into cliques, involving identity regulatory social exclusion effects; and instead of managerial authority being reinforced through its reemergence as paternal authority, it is reinvigorated in a complex interplay of hierarchy and friendship. The empirical analysis has, moreover, revealed how normative control is especially “tricky,” that is difficult to grasp, ambiguous, and opaque, in a friendship culture because control seems so absent here. Indeed, a friendship culture celebrates individuality, openness, choice, and egalitarianism, yet this, paradoxically, can entail dependency, hierarchy, exclusion, and identity regulation. In the empirical analysis, I have highlighted how a friendship culture involves ways of enforcing itself. It is these very paradoxes and how all this involves reinforcing interrelated control circles that I will now turn to.</p>
<p>A friendship culture, paradoxically, reduces spaces for people’s friendships outside of work, or more precisely culture management. This can, in turn, reinforce the formation of friendships defined by the culture. There is an incorporation of and an extension to the realm of nonwork in terms of activities, values, time, and space. The organizationally preferred self is defined not only through the work-related company values but also through those derived from the nonwork realm, in form of being a fun, sociable, and approachable persona. I propose that normative control is both extended and accentuated here: Realms not affected by the corporate culture are markedly reduced, and thus culture becomes a more important basis for defining oneself. Indeed, the empirical analysis has shown how given the emphasis on nonwork activities, interests, and so forth, individuals identify with the organization in a friendship culture. They approach it predominantly through the positive associations of “fun,” “friendship,” and leisure rather than simply hard work, professionalism, and so on. It can be argued that in this way, employees are “distracted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492612439104">Fleming &amp; Sturdy, 2011</xref>) from the ways in which the company still requires them to work hard, long hours, be professional, and so on. The case of ZOI Consulting has also illuminated how those individuals seeking to define themselves in ways outside of the corporate culture (as they feel it is fake or overwhelming) experience difficulties, as they cannot keep up their friendships, interests, and selves outside of work. This can make them turn toward friendships within work that, however, can be significantly marked by the friendship culture. We can, therefore, see that those realms central for people to construct a disidentifying self, one in opposition to the company self, and hence for engaging in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006</xref>, p. 107) terms “role distancing” are reduced (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492612439104">Costas &amp; Fleming, 2009</xref>). As a result, individuals, their selves and lives, are significantly and in a reinforcing manner defined by the friendship culture.</p>
<p>Despite its connotations of individuality and choice, a friendship culture can involve, paradoxically, greater dependency, as subjects are placed in a state of uncertainty. This, in turn, can make individuals seek to be known by others, participate in the various cultural activities and, indeed, form friendships with others. The relation of uncertainty and friendship is a mutually reinforcing one. Individuals search for a sense of security and stability through friendship relations, but, given the emphasis on choice, autonomy, and individuality, the relations are never fixed, thereby leading to the need for constant reaffirmation. In this sense, a friendship culture reduces and simultaneously induces uncertainty, involving the accentuation of normative control, as in the state of uncertainty individuals are more prone to subject themselves to the corporate culture. Interestingly, the ways in which organizations induce uncertainty and how this intersects with control has received scant attention by management research so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492612439104">Power, 2007</xref>). Perhaps this might be explained by the assumption that, especially in family cultures, uncertainty is somewhat overcome, given the emphasis on protection and security. In this article, I have suggested that this assumption does not seem apposite in corporate cultures, indicative of broader developments toward choice, individuality, and openness and also characterized by volatility and change.</p>
<p>A friendship culture entails the paradox of celebrating individuality, diversity, openness, and egalitarianism, while also giving rise to identity regulation, homogeneity, and social exclusion, given the clique formations involved. Instead of fostering the sense of unity and togetherness like in a family culture, individuals perceive fragmented social formations of cliques. It should be noted that these clique formations do not serve to overcome the sense of uncertainty outlined in the previous reinforcing control circle; not only are they shifting (i.e., not clearly defined) but also they heighten individuals’ insecurity about themselves, entailing identity regulation effects and reinforcing the need to be friends with and belong to the “right” in-groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1056492612439104">6</xref></sup> Those subjects not part of some kind of “inner circle” question themselves through the meaning system underlying the culture (e.g., “introvert” vs. “outgoing”). In this way, they understand and construct themselves in line with the preferred company self.</p>
<p>There is also a paradox between, on the one hand, stressing informality and egalitarianism and, on the other hand, the reinvigoration of hierarchy (again the latter does not reduce the kind of uncertainty outlined before, as those positioned higher within the hierarchy are changing, and it all takes place in an opaque manner). This paradox serves to enforce a friendship culture: in downplaying hierarchy and informality individuals place even more emphasis on hierarchy as a way to “explain reality and guide action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda, 2006</xref>, p. 30). Such a reinvigoration of hierarchy manifests itself in employees “going up” to and seeking to form friendship relations with those positioned higher within the hierarchy. This reveals how relations of friendship and hierarchy can intertwine, placing managers in the comfortable position of not having to represent the guarantor of protection and security—a role that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006</xref>, p. 104) shows can be at times difficult to perform given employees’ demands and expectations and the often empty and false management promise of security. More importantly, in fostering friendship relations, employees are prone to seemingly “freely” seek to “help,” that is, work for those positioned higher within the hierarchy. In a friendship culture, we thus find an interesting interplay between what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612439104">Kunda (2006)</xref> terms “culture” and “structure” (rather than simply a replacement of the latter through the former). This insight resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492612439104">Courpasson (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492612439104">Kärreman and Alvesson (2004)</xref>, who have argued that although organizations seemingly increasingly de-emphasize formality and structure, this does not mean that they have actually become less important. To the contrary, there is the emergence of hybrid forms of control.</p>
<p>The forms of control, I developed here, happen in a somewhat invisible and “unspoken” manner. On the face of it, a friendship culture celebrates the very opposite. To this extent, it can be suggested that such a culture might make it difficult for individuals to express concerns regarding dependency on others, hierarchy, and so forth. That is, a friendship culture’s celebration of openness, egalitarianism, individuality, and choice can provide little surface to voice critique in the name of these values. Related to this, a friendship culture may not only promote the workings of control but also undermine certain forms of subversion. As aforementioned, the realm of nonwork is incorporated into a friendship culture, which is traditionally associated with subversion, such as friendship itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492612439104">Foucault, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492612439104">Silver, 1989</xref>) or drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492612439104">Bamberger &amp; Bacharach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492612439104">Gouldner, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492612439104">Sonnenstuhl, 1996</xref>). Thus, through a friendship culture management might co-opt the very sites of subversion, reducing spaces for employees to voice their dissent. At ZOI Consulting, this is apparent in the ways in which employee friendships are influenced by the company, leading to certain tensions (e.g., “at times you can never quite be sure who your friends are”). The empirical analysis has also shown how a friendship culture, again paradoxically, involves competition between individuals, namely, for the attention and closeness, that is friendship with those positioned higher within the hierarchy. Great importance is placed on individual relations to management rather than on some kind of togetherness and unity. This may suggest that a friendship culture might inhibit forms of collective employee dissent. Similar observations have been made in cultures drawing on a family metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612439104">Kondo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492612439104">Casey, 1996</xref>). However, given the greater individualistic focus in a friendship culture, such an undermining of forms of collective dissent might be even more prevalent here. Having said that, I do not aim to engage in “premature requiems for employee resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612439104">Gabriel, 1999</xref>, p. 191). Throughout the empirical analysis, I have pointed out how employees express ambiguities and tensions concerning inauthenticity and the integration of overall lives into corporate life.</p>
<p>One form of resistance that is, moreover, apparent at ZOI Consulting is that of “exit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492612439104">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). Although the resulting volatile team membership can be argued to be typical for a consultancy firm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492612439104">Sturdy &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>), it may also represent both the basis for and the outcome of a friendship culture: first and as aforementioned, it might be precisely because an organization is characterized by change and volatility that its culture is geared toward drawing on a friendship instead of family imagery, as this is not underpinned by a promise of protection and stability. Second, on the basis of the empirical data, I have developed how this very volatility and change serves the functioning of control in a friendship culture, given that it fosters uncertainty. Third and to what I want to draw attention now, a friendship culture might also bring about the coming and going of team members. At first sight, this might seem contradictory, because this article has discussed at length how a friendship culture normatively controls employees in a reinforcing manner. However, there is a subtle, yet significant difference to the way in which this occurs in a family culture. Although normative control is extended and accentuated here, there is less stress on indefinite loyalty. Put differently, friendships are not expected to necessarily last forever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612439104">Spencer &amp; Pahl, 2006</xref>). In this sense, we might argue that the option of “exit” is somewhat more inherent to a friendship culture—something that can perpetuate, rather than inhibit, the workings of control. This might be reinforced by the particular understanding of friendship propagated in a friendship culture, which ultimately rests on homogeneity and thus is both limited and limiting.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have explored a culture of friendship and argued that its emphasis on individual choice, openness, egalitarianism, and diversity should not deceive us from seeing how this can provide the basis for normative control. The cultural accent on individual choice can involve dependency, openness can entail social exclusion, egalitarianism can reinvigorate hierarchy, and friendship can turn into competition. The very celebration of the absence of control in a friendship culture can actually imply the extension and accentuation of normative control, given the paradoxes and reinforcing control circles involved. In illuminating this, the article has made two broad contributions.</p>
<p>First, I have developed the implications of a friendship culture for normative control. In particular, I have added to current research by illuminating ways in which a friendship culture extends and accentuates normative control, as it works through various paradoxes and reinforcing control circles. I have drawn attention to four ways in which this takes place: the integration of the overall employee self through the incorporation of and an extension to nonwork, the creation of uncertainty and dependence, identity regulation through clique formations, and the reinvigoration of hierarchy. It is in these ways that a friendship culture enforces itself. I have also highlighted how such forms of normative control take place in an opaque manner. Moreover, I have indicated how normative control in a friendship culture can entail various employee responses, such as alignment, ambiguity, and inauthenticity, and how it can interact with resistance—something that further research may explore in greater depth.</p>
<p>Second, I have drawn attention to an unexplored organizational cultural arrangement that is indicative of broader social and cultural developments. I have conceptualized this as a friendship culture and shed light on its distinct features and ways of operating through a comparison with the widely studied family culture. This has allowed me to show how the culture of friendship is also configured around informality, intimacy, and closeness. Yet it does not propagate some kind of security and protection, in positioning management in the role of paternal authority and stressing unity and togetherness. By contrast, individuality, egalitarianism, openness, and diversity are celebrated. Although on the basis of the empirical data, I cannot make claims regarding its wider significance, I have suggested that such a culture might be prevalent in organizations, such as knowledge-intensive firms, that strongly emphasize autonomy, individuality, and are characterized by change.</p>
<p>In studying a friendship culture, I have pointed toward the ways in which organizational friendships can simultaneously reside in the formal and informal realm, thereby providing the basis for normative control—an insight that future research on friendship should take into consideration. In particular, the study has shown that friendship should not be romanticized as a “pure” phenomenon, untouched by formality and structure, which, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492612439104">Grey and Sturdy (2007)</xref>, seems to be a common assumption of extant research. On the contrary, management may actively foster friendship relations so that an interesting interplay between formality and informality can unfold, which can have significant implications for normative control. In this context I have also brought into focus certain underresearched organizational practices and rituals, particularly concerning drinking, fun, and socializing. Until now, management research has largely approached these as forms of subversion, resistance, and escape, whereas the present study has demonstrated how management can seek to incorporate these into the corporate culture. In conclusion, in this exploratory article I hope to have provided revealing insights and also inspired further research on the topic of normative control, culture, and friendship in organizations.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the studies (e.g., Kunda, Casey) I refer to describe cultures where the family metaphor is one of a series of metaphors used by the company. I nevertheless discuss these as family cultures, as the notion of family appears central in the corporate culture of the firms they empirically investigated and in particular with respect to the cultural dimensions I analyze.</p></fn>

<p>The question of gender did not surface here. This might result from the fact that the team studied had a high percentage of women and in leadership positions. In other contexts, it can be imagined, however, that gender plays an important role, namely, how friendships represent gendered phenomena, making it more difficult for female employees to be part of the right circle and display the required identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492612439104">Elsesser &amp; Peplau, 2006</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>In a similar vein to normative control, identity regulation refers to how individuals define themselves through the regulatory meanings systems embedded in a culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492612439104">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 2002</xref>).
