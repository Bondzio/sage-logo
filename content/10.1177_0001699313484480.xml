<abstract>
<p>Research consistently shows that the share of females in an occupation is negatively associated with wages, and this has frequently been interpreted as an expression of devaluation of women’s work. However, few studies have described the detailed shape of the relationship between wages and occupational sex composition. Using Swedish register data from 2001 and 2003, I advance our understanding of the devaluation process by studying the functional form more closely in both the cross-section and panel. The analyses reveal a non-linear relationship between sex composition and wages, where the highest wages for both men and women are earned in sex-integrated occupations. Second, studying the wage payoffs of people moving across occupations with varying sex compositions shows that both sexes gain by moving to relatively sex-integrated occupations (about 25 to 54% female).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The theory of devaluation explains lower wages in female-dominated occupations as a consequence of a cultural devaluation of women’s work which affects wages in female-dominated occupations and in occupations where the tasks are associated with female characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699313484480">Kilbourne et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001699313484480">Reskin and Bielby 2005</xref>). Since cultural devaluation cannot readily be studied directly, a negative wage effect of occupational sex composition has frequently been interpreted as an expression of devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>; England, et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001699313484480">Kilbourne et al., 1994b</xref>). Studies in several countries and at different points in time show a net negative association between wages and percentage females, and thus present empirical evidence in support of devaluation theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699313484480">Reid, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699313484480">Tomaskovic-Devey, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Few prior studies have considered whether the relationship between share of females in occupations and wages is linear or not. In some studies that do consider the functional form of the relationship, however, a non-linear relationship has been found (Cotter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699313484480">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699313484480">Magnusson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699313484480">Pfeffer and Davis-Blake, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699313484480">Cotter et al. (2004</xref>), for instance, show that wages in male-dominated occupations are lower than in integrated occupations and that in most female-dominated occupations wages are equal to those of male-dominated occupations. Cotter et al. point out that this non-linear relationship is not well known or investigated in the literature. Instead, the commonly used approach is to assume and model a linear relationship between the percentage female and wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699313484480">Kilbourne et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699313484480">Reid, 1998</xref>), and interpret an unexplained negative wage effect as reflecting a devaluation of women’s work. In theory, an increase in the proportion of women in an occupation should have a negative wage effect across the entire sex composition distribution, or at least never have a positive one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al. (1988</xref>) assert that if ‘the per cent female of one’s occupation has a negative effect on wages’, after controlling for human capital and occupational characteristics this effect reflects wage discrimination against female occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al., 1988</xref>: 552). Put simply, a positive relationship between percentage female and earnings would be inconsistent with devaluation theory. I further our understanding of this matter by investigating the functional form of the relationship between occupational sex composition and wages in more detail. In this part of the article, I use Swedish cross-sectional data from 2003.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001699313484480">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The relationship between percentage female and wages has largely been studied using cross-sectional data (for exceptions, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699313484480">Karlin et al., 2002</xref>; Levanon, et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699313484480">Pfeffer and Davis-Blake, 1987</xref>). However, to isolate the effect of sex composition, all other possible factors that could account for the association should be controlled for, which is close to impossible with cross-sectional data. Since panel data allow controls for stable unmeasured personal characteristics, such as innate abilities and preferences, which may partly account for the unexplained wage effect of sex composition, a longitudinal approach is desirable. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>) used occupation-level longitudinal data and found no support for the hypothesis that a change in sex composition leads to changes in wages. They concluded that the negative effect of the female share of occupations was not due to an ongoing process. Instead, the lower wages in female-dominated occupations were supposedly settled when the occupations were established in the past and still determine wages in these occupations, i.e. path dependency is expected to be strong.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001699313484480">2</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, analysing occupation-level change data now seems irrelevant, since the negative effect on wages of the share of females is a phenomenon established in the past and hence not affected by contemporary changes in the occupational sex composition.</p>
<p>Another way of assessing causality, short of an historical analysis, is to analyse change data at the individual level, i.e. worker mobility across occupations that differ in their sex composition. According to the devaluation thesis it is reasonable to assume that employees gain most if they change to male-dominated occupations or, at least, to occupations where the proportion of women is smaller. A benefit with change data at the individual level is that this avoids the problems that time-series analysis on the occupational level has with the fact that both skill demands of an occupation and how a task in an occupation should be performed may change over time and be mixed up with changes in sex composition. The present individual-level longitudinal approach makes it possible to control for constant unobserved individual characteristics and for changes in a number of observed individual characteristics. In the present article, I use a panel data set from Sweden including extensive information on more than 1.6 million employees, with which it is possible to carry out careful and robust controls for levels as well as changes in central individual characteristics that are possible confounders of the empirical association between occupational sex composition and wages. Employees’ mobility patterns – why and when individuals change occupations – can be explained by several processes. The present study makes no contribution to clarifying these mechanisms. Instead, the aim is to analyse the effect of individual mobility across different categories of occupational sex composition on wages in the framework of the theory of devaluation.</p>

<sec id="section2-0001699313484480">
<title>The theory of devaluation and previous findings</title>
<p>The theory of devaluation rests on the premise that women and female characteristics are culturally devalued in society. Cultural assumptions about skills associated with men’s and women’s work have resulted in a sex bias in the evaluation of men’s and women’s work, where societies devaluate women’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699313484480">Steinberg, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Proponents of the devaluation view claim that widespread cultural values are institutionalized in the wage structure and decrease wages in female-dominated occupations of both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699313484480">Steinberg, 1990</xref>). A commonly used statement according to the theory is that ‘the higher the percentage of females in an occupation, the less the job pays’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>: 125). In previous research, an unexplained negative wage effect of the percentage females or of feminine tasks has often been interpreted as evidence supporting the theory of devaluation.</p>
<p>Consistent with the theory, it has been found in many empirical analyses that the percentage female in occupations is negatively associated with earnings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699313484480">England, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001699313484480">Kilbourne et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699313484480">Reid, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699313484480">de Ruijter et al., 2003</xref>; for Sweden, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699313484480">le Grand, 1997</xref>). Previous research has also shown a negative wage effect for care or service work even after taking occupational sex composition into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699313484480">England, 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0001699313484480">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is also empirical evidence that is inconsistent with the theory. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699313484480">Tam (1997</xref>) found that the sex composition effect in the United States might be explained by the wage effect of occupation-specific on-the-job training and required qualifications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0001699313484480">4</xref>
</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699313484480">Jurajuda and Hermgart (2004</xref>) found a positive wage effect for female-dominated occupations in East Germany.</p>
<p>In data from the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699313484480">Shauman (2006</xref>) found that female occupations are not systematically devalued. On the contrary, some occupational characteristics associated with female tasks, for example verbal skills, have a positive association with earnings, while characteristics associated with males, such as quantitative skills, are not positively associated with wages.</p>
<p>To summarize, there are many empirical findings in line with devaluation theory, namely the recurring negative relationship between wages and the share of female employees in an occupation, but there are also empirical findings that contradict the theory.</p>
<sec id="section3-0001699313484480">
<title>Previous research on the functional form of the relationship between occupational sex composition and wages</title>
<p>As already mentioned, the relationship between occupational sex composition and wages has mostly been assessed using linear models, although some authors have found a non-linear relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699313484480">Cotter et al. (2004</xref>) show for the US that the median earnings in female-dominated occupations are in general lower than in male-dominated occupations. However, they also find that wages are highest in sex-integrated occupations, and in many female-dominated occupations are equal to wages in male-dominated occupations. They conclude that the relationship between percentage female and wages is more complex than a straight line, and that this non-linear pattern where integrated occupations have the highest earnings is not well known in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001699313484480">Hakim (1998</xref>) questions the devaluation of female work and argues that in Britain the highest wages are in integrated occupations.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>) analysed the association between wages and the proportion of women using repeated cross-sectional data for each year between 1982 and 2000 and examined a possible non-linear relationship. They found some support for a positive relationship where wages increased along with the share of females. However, this was true only for occupations with 90 per cent female incumbents or more. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>) concluded that the relationship is best described as linear since wages in general fall as the female share goes up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0001699313484480">
<title>Previous longitudinal research on occupational sex composition and wages</title>
<p>As the following passage shows, longitudinal analyses are still few and with diverse results. Most previous studies are based on data from the US. Some of these prior longitudinal studies have occupations as units and have sought to assess whether changes in the occupational sex composition precede changes in wages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al., 2007</xref>). Others are case studies exploring one or a few occupations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699313484480">Pfeffer and Davis-Blake, 1987</xref>). In some studies, individual-level data and fixed-effects models are used to avoid selection bias (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001699313484480">Reskin and Roos (1990</xref>) showed that when women entered male-dominated occupations, wages and prestige in these occupations had already begun to sink. They claim that women only get entry to jobs men do not want; they called this <italic>the queuing</italic> or <italic>relative attractiveness hypothesis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699313484480">Catanzarite (2003</xref>) used longitudinal data at the occupational level from the US to show that sex composition influences wages over time: in occupations where the female share had increased earnings decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001699313484480">Wright and Jacobs’ (1994)</xref> case study of computer specialists did not find women’s inroads and feminization of the occupation in parallel with declines in earnings in the labour force as a whole. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699313484480">Pfeffer and Davis-Blake (1987</xref>) found that increases in the proportion of women among college administrators in the US had a negative effect on wage levels in later years. In the same study they found that low pay was related to an increase in per cent females in the job category. Their results are thus inconclusive with regard to the devaluation theory.</p>
<p>Using panel data from the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699313484480">Snyder and Hudis (1976</xref>) found that the share of women was later negatively associated with salary level, although their study considered only males’ wages. Also, in a longitudinal analysis based on data from the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699313484480">Karlin et al. (2002</xref>) showed that a higher proportion female in an earlier year was associated with lower wages in later years, which is a finding in line with devaluation theory.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699313484480">Gerhart and El Cheikh (1991)</xref> used longitudinal data from the US and analysed the relation between percentage female and earnings with a fixed effects model. They found that the penalty for the female share of occupations, which is shown in many cross-sectional studies, was not significant with longitudinal data, except for women with intermittent labour force participation. Their study implies that previous research, based on cross-sectional data, has overestimated the wage effect of percentage female. They suggest that women’s lower wages can be explained by lower returns to individual characteristics rather than by occupational characteristics. In a longitudinal study, also from the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699313484480">Macpherson and Hirsch (1995</xref>) found a negative effect of the per cent female on wages with cross-sectional models. However, when they analysed the relationship longitudinally, the effects became appreciably lower. They emphasized that the per cent female in an occupation might largely be seen as a proxy for unmeasured skills, preferences and occupational characteristics. Wages in female-dominated occupations are low because the level of skills is lower. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699313484480">England et al. (1988</xref>) used a fixed-effects model on individual-level data and found a negative effect of per cent female on wages. Using Swedish data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699313484480">le Grand (1997)</xref> found a negative wage effect of occupational sex composition (female share) with both cross-sectional and panel data. As reported above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>) used a fixed-effects model on occupational level US data, but their study gave no support for the assumption that the feminization of occupations lowers wages (in the occupations). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699313484480">Levanon et al. (2009</xref>), who also used a fixed-effects model with occupations as units, followed occupations in the US from 1950 to 2000 and did find support for the devaluation theory.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0001699313484480">
<title>Research approach</title>
<p>As reported above, many prior longitudinal studies on the relationship between percentages female and wage have occupations as units and use time-series analysis, or are case studies on one or a few occupations. However, a limitation with time-series analysis is that it cannot control for changes in the characteristics of occupations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699313484480">Tam (1997</xref>) asserts, not all unobserved variables are stable across occupations and time. For instance, both the required skills of an occupation and how a task should be performed in an occupation may change over time and be mixed up with changes in sex composition. The approach of the present study, studying short-term individual mobility across occupational sex composition categories, avoids these problems. First, the present study estimates change over a two-year period from 2001 to 2003. It is unlikely that crucial changes in the occupational characteristics, such as required skills in the occupation or which task to perform and how these task should be executed in the occupation, have taken place during this short period of time. Thus, even if organizations within occupational categories are reorganized during a two-year period, a reformation of the entire occupation probably takes longer. Furthermore, estimates from a short time period, only two years, decrease the likelihood of changes in unmeasured individual traits. It is therefore unlikely that respondents have changed their unmeasured productive capacity or their preferences appreciably during this time period.</p>
<p>The present analysis suggests an alternative method for assessing the causality of the relationship between the percentage of females and wages. If the relationship were negative, this would be true also using longitudinal individual data. In other words, individual mobility across occupation to an occupation with a larger female share would be negative for the change in wages compared with individual mobility to an occupation where the female share was smaller.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0001699313484480">5</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>An advantage with a panel study measuring the same individuals at two points in time is the control for selection bias, since we can control for constant individual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699313484480">Gerhart and El Cheikh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699313484480">Tam, 1997</xref>). By analysing mobility with data on a large number of employees – as in the present case – it is possible to control for changes in individual observed characteristics such as level of education and socio-economic status between the two points in time, which is important in assessment of the causes of earnings development. Thus, with this type of approach, one can control for all constant individual characteristics (both measured and unmeasured) and measured changes in individual characteristics.</p>
<p>Individual mobility has many causes. On average, it can be assumed that employees change jobs to maximize their rewards, i.e. to get a job where the rewards match one’s resources in the best way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001699313484480">Sørensen, 1975</xref>). When and whether a person decides to move, and also to what position, further depends on the opportunity structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699313484480">Rosenfeld, 1992</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0001699313484480">6</xref>
</sup> The present study does not attempt to answer these questions, but it is important to control for the factors that are commonly believed to affect mobility opportunities and outcomes in order to better isolate the impact of sex composition. However, to control for all possible factors that have an impact on whether and why an individual changes occupation is difficult to accomplish in practice. The absence of controls for important reasons for individual mobility, reasons which may have an impact on wage growth, is of course a weakness of the present study. However, it is a weakness that is shared by almost all other studies in the field. The strength of the data set used, on the other hand, is significant and uncommon. In particular the size of the data set and the quality of the information recorded are strong assets.</p>

<title>Predictions</title>
<p>On the basis of the devaluation theory one prediction is derived which is tested using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data:
<disp-quote>
<p>Wages are expected to be a decreasing function of the female share of occupations. In other words, the female percentage in an occupation is expected to have a linear or at least a monotonous negative effect on wages.</p>
</disp-quote> In the longitudinal section the above prediction is formulated in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Individual mobility to occupations with a larger female share is expected to be negatively associated with the change in wages (compared with individual mobility to occupations with a smaller female share).</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section7-0001699313484480">
<title>Data</title>
<p>In the empirical section, I use a large number of administrative register data sets. The cross-sectional part, where the shape and form of the relationship between wages and the female share is investigated, is based on data from ‘The Structure of Earnings Survey’ (Lönestrukturstatistiken, LSS) 2003. The LSS includes the Swedish population aged 18–65 employed in the public sector or in private establishments with 500 employees or more. Random samples drawn from private establishments with fewer than 500 employees are also included, although there is an over-representation of employees in large firms in the private sector. In the analysis a weight is used to correct for the under-representation of smaller establishments in the private sector. The longitudinal part, where mobility over occupational sex composition categories and its connection to wage change is examined, is also based on LSS data from 2001 and 2003. In both parts, LSS data are matched with data from ‘The Employment Register’ (Yrkesregistret) 2001 and 2003.</p>
<p>In this study, the sample has been reduced to consist of individuals who were employed in both 2001 and 2003. This sample, used in both the cross-section and panel, consists of 1,657,049 employees, 56 per cent of them women. The greater share of female employees is due to over-representation of the public sector and large establishments, both of which have a relatively greater share of female employees.</p>
<sec id="section8-0001699313484480">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable logarithm of monthly <italic>wage</italic> in 2003 in the cross-sectional part is derived from LSS data. Part-time wages or other kinds of wages have been transformed into monthly full-time wages by Statistics Sweden (SCB). Besides basic salary, the wage variable includes both fixed and variable wage supplements, such as piece-rate wages, commission, unsocial hour bonuses and other earnings compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001699313484480">Statistics Sweden, 2006</xref>). In the analysis using panel data, the dependent variable is the wage growth in log monthly wage between 2001 and 2003 (log monthly wage in 2003 – log monthly wage in 2001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0001699313484480">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>A central variable <italic>Occupation</italic> is classified according to the Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations (SSYK), which is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). Three-digit codes of ISCO-88 are used and 113 occupations are included in the study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0001699313484480">7</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>The main independent variable is <italic>occupational sex composition</italic>, which is measured as the percentage females in each occupation. In the analysis, the female percentage in each occupation is used as a continuous variable, ranging from 0 to 100 per cent females, and also as a categorical variable, which consists of the following seven groups: 0 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 74, 75 to 84 and 85 to 100 per cent females in the occupation (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0001699313484480">Appendix</xref> for a list of all occupations within each category of sex composition). The division of sex composition categories in the longitudinal part differs slightly from that used in the cross-sectional part. The longitudinal part includes only five categories, since the numbers of individuals in each cell of the matrix of mobility across sex composition categories are too small when using a finer division of categories. This results in the following division: 0 to 24, 25 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 84 and 85 to 100 per cent females in the occupations.</p>
<p>In the cross-sectional analysis, I control for <italic>educational attainment, sector</italic> (public/private), <italic>age, age squared, social class</italic> and <italic>managerial position.</italic> <italic>Educational attainment</italic> is divided into four categories: compulsory education, upper secondary school, college or university studies less than three years and college or university studies three years or more. The variable <italic>social class</italic> is divided into three dummies: working class, intermediate class, service class. The division of social class is based on the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC). For a further description of ESeC, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001699313484480">Rose and Harrison (2007</xref>). I also distinguish managerial position as separate class categories. If an employee’s occupation according to SSYK (ISCO) belongs to group 1 (legislators, senior officials and managers), s/he has been coded as having a <italic>Managerial position</italic>. <italic>Public sector</italic> is a dummy variable (1=public sector). <italic>Age</italic> is used as a proxy for time spent in the labour market, although it is a poorer measure than work experience, a variable that is not available in the data set.</p>
<p>In the longitudinal analysis, the central variables are the dummy variables that measure individual mobility across occupational sex composition categories between 2001 and 2003. In total, there are 25 possible combinations in <italic>occupational sex composition</italic>, of which 20 are changes and 5 imply no change over time. For example, one dummy measures employees working in occupations with 0 to 24 per cent females in 2001 who had moved to occupations with 45 to 54 per cent women by 2003.</p>
<p>Research on work-life mobility has shown that time spent in the labour market, level of education and positional levels in the labour market (class) are important factors when considering job mobility (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699313484480">Rosenfeld, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001699313484480">Sørensen, 1975</xref>). It is possible that mobility between occupational sex composition categories accompanies changes in level of education and social class, which also have an impact on the change in wages. To isolate the wage effect of changing to different categories of sex composition from wage effects associated with changes in educational attainment, social class and sector, I control for all possible levels and changes in these variables between the two occasions. This type of approach requires a large number of observations which are available in the present panel data set.</p>
<p>
<italic>Sector</italic>is a categorical variable divided into four dummies (with one of them used as a reference category): public employee in both 2001 and 2003, private employee at both points in time, public employee in 2001 but private employee in 2003, and private employee in 2001 but public employee in 2003. Theoretically, <italic>educational attainment</italic> has 16 possible combinations across time (four categories), but downward changes have been considered as measurement error; these cases have been set at the educational value of 2001 (the first point in time) for both occasions. This results in 10 dummies for level of education. <italic>Social</italic> <italic>class</italic>, including separate categories for managerial positions, has 16 possible dummies (four categories).</p>

<p>For both men and women, occupations with 45 to 54 per cent females have the highest wages according to model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699313484480">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699313484480">1b</xref>. When adding age, sector, educational attainment, social class and managerial position to model 3, the wages for women are highest in occupations with 15 to 24 per cent females. For men, wages are still highest in sex-integrated occupations. Unexpectedly, the wages are not lowest in the most female-dominated occupations (85 to 100% female). This is true for both men and women. Instead, the lowest wages are in occupations with a 75 to 84 female percentage, but wages are also rather low in male-dominated occupations. These results indicate that wages are far from being a strictly decreasing function of the female percentage. Instead, the shape of the relationship is clearly non-linear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0001699313484480">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The main advantages of the data used here are the many observations and the high quality of the information recorded. The data also have drawbacks, the most important of which is the narrowness of the set of available control variables. With the present data there is thus only limited scope to control for central individual and occupational characteristics that are of importance in earnings models. To explore whether the non-linear relationship remains when a battery of additional control variables is included in the model, some supplementary analyses have been carried out with data from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey 2000 (Levnadsnivåundersökningen, LNU). These analyses clearly support the above findings and tend to confirm that wages are not a decreasing function of the per cent female in the occupation. Fairly integrated occupations (30 to 50% female) have the highest wages.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0001699313484480">11</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the most female-dominated occupations (80 to 100% female) have higher wages than occupations where 50 to 80 per cent are female. In these models, level of education, experience, educational requirements, formal and informal on-the-job training, sector, authority and autonomy are taken into account (results available on request).</p>
<p>The next stage of the analysis is to investigate the wage consequences of individual mobility across occupational sex composition categories in order to assess whether the empirical pattern from the cross-sectional data is reproduced in the panel data case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0001699313484480">
<title>Longitudinal analyses</title>
<p>The analyses below investigate the economic outcome of the mobility of employees across occupational sex composition categories between 2001 and 2003. The purpose is to assess to which category of sex composition it is most economically profitable to move given occupational location in 2001. I conduct separate analyses for men and women but also for the different categories of sex composition. In other words, when I examine to which category of occupational sex composition it is most economically profitable to move, I compare men/women employed in male-dominated occupations (0–24% female) in 2001 separately, and men/women employed in occupations with 25 to 44 per cent female in 2001 separately, and so forth. With this approach I thus compare employees belonging to the same category of sex composition in 2001 (the starting point) with each other. In those few cases where an occupation’s sex composition has changed between 2001 and 2003 and belongs to different categories of occupational sex composition in 2001 and in 2003, e.g. an occupation may have 25 per cent female employees in 2001 but 24 per cent in 2003, the per cent female of the occupation has been set at the value of 2001 for both occasions. Since it is possible that it is most profitable not to move, the analyses contain both employees who shift occupations across sex composition boundaries as well as those who do not.</p>
<p>In order to isolate the net wage effect of individual mobility between occupations with different sex composition, changes in education, social class and sector between the two time-points are included as control variables in the regression model. The specification used is similar but not identical to a change score (CS) or first-difference model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699313484480">Johnson, 2005</xref>). All variables in the estimated models are entered as change scores, both the outcome variable (wage change) and the predictors (see section ‘Variables’ above). The only exception is age, which is measured at the first time-point (t1=2001). In a pure CS model, age at t1 would drop out since it is a time invariant variable. It is nonetheless included here since age is known to be significantly associated with many dynamic aspects of labour markets, such as occupational mobility and wage growth. In an alternative specification, the analysis has also been carried out with log wage in 2003 as the outcome variable and with a control for the starting wage (wage in 2001), i.e. a lagged dependent variable (LDV) model. The results from these models do not differ substantially from the results presented below. I have chosen to report the CS-type model outcomes since recent research indicates that this kind of specification is superior to LDV models in important respects (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699313484480">Johnson, 2005</xref>). In addition, all analyses have been carried out with a control for external (employer) shifts and with separate models for external shifts. Results from these models are also similar to those reported below, and are not shown here.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699313484480">Table 2a</xref> shows the outcome of a set of wage growth models for women. Thus, the Table shows the results of analyses of the association between women’s occupational mobility and their wage growth 2001 to 2003. As described above, separate models are estimated for each occupational sex composition category in 2001, with individuals working in sex-integrated occupations (45–54% female) in 2003 as the reference category in all models. Thus, in model 1, the reference category is women who moved from male-dominated occupations to integrated occupations. The coefficients indicate the impact on wage growth of mobility across occupational sex composition categories, given controls for age, education, sector, social class and managerial positions. Bold coefficients indicate the highest wage growth in each category of occupational sex composition. Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699313484480">Table 2a</xref> shows that for women employed in male-dominated occupations (0 to 24% female) in 2001, not one of the sex composition coefficients is significant. Thus there are no significant differences in wage growth between these categories when controlling for education, sector, social class and managerial positions. For women in occupations with 25 to 44 per cent females in 2001 (model 4), the wage growth is highest for those who shift to occupations where the sex composition is between 45 and 54 per cent female. For women in integrated occupations (45–54% female) in 2001 (model 6) it is most profitable to stay in this occupational category. For women in occupations with 55 to 84 (model 8) per cent females the wage growth is highest for those who shift to occupations 25–44 per cent female (note <italic>p</italic> = 0.10). Also for women in female-dominated occupations (model 10), it is best to shift to occupations 25 to 44 per cent female.</p>

<p>Overall, apart from women in male-dominated occupations, women get the highest wage growth if they move to (or stay in) occupations with 25–54 per cent women. How these results should be interpreted is not obvious. According to the devaluation thesis, it would be most profitable to move to male-dominated occupations. According to the present results this is not true for any of the women regardless of occupational sex composition. Furthermore, shifting to male-dominated occupations is negative for almost all categories of occupational sex composition. From the above analyses it is quite clear that being employed in or moving to integrated occupations is more profitable than staying in or moving to either female or male-dominated occupations.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0001699313484480">Table 2b</xref> reports the results from the corresponding analysis for men. As for women the reference category is individuals working in integrated occupations in 2003 (the destination point in time). Model 2 indicates that men in male-dominated occupations have the highest wage growth if staying in male-dominated occupations; however, the difference in wage growth is not significant. Men in occupations 25 to 44 per cent female (model 4) and in sex-integrated occupations (model 6) have the highest wage growth if they move to (or stay in) integrated occupations (45–54% female). Men who in 2001 were employed in occupations with 55 to 84 per cent women (model 8) gained most if they shifted to the category with 25 to 44 per cent females. Also for men who worked in strongly female-dominated occupations 2001 (model 10) it was most profitable to move to occupations with 25 to 44 per cent females. However, the wage growth is not significantly different compared to the reference category.</p>

<p>For all men it is negative to move to or stay in male-dominated occupations. However, the results also indicate, apart from occupations with 55 to 85 per cent females, that wage growth is lowest for those who move to the category that is most female-dominated (85–100% female).</p>
<p>Taken together, the wage growth is highest in both genders for those who move from strongly male or female-dominated occupations to occupations with a more mixed sex composition.</p>
<p>The panel results are thus basically in line with the cross-sectional findings. Female-dominated occupations are less well paid than male-dominated occupations. It is this difference that is reflected in the negative association between wages and the female share of occupation measured as a linear term in a wage regression. However, the linear specification hides the fact that sex-integrated occupations are actually better paid than any of the sex-typed occupational categories, male or female. This non-linearity is inconsistent with the interpretation of the single sex composition coefficient reflecting devaluation.</p>

<sec id="section13-0001699313484480">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of the present article was to test the devaluation theory empirically. I have done so using cross-sectional data by analysing whether or not wages are a monotonically decreasing function of the percentage females across the entire sex composition distribution. I complemented these tests with panel data by analysing the wage consequences of individual mobility across categories of occupational sex composition.</p>
<p>The results from the cross-sectional part show that sex-integrated occupations have the highest wages. The analysis using panel data supports this finding. The results from panel data show that for both genders the rate of wage growth is highest when moving from strongly male or female-dominated occupations to occupations with a more mixed sex composition. Thus, findings from both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses are inconsistent with the prediction from the devaluation theory that wages are a decreasing function of the female share of occupations. However, for both men and women it is in general most negative to be employed in or move to moderately or heavily female-dominated occupations, which is a finding that could be interpreted as consistent with the devaluation theory.</p>
<p>A striking finding from the cross-sectional part is that the most female-dominated occupations do not have the lowest wages. Thus, wages are higher in occupations with 85 to 100 per cent females compared with 75 to 84 per cent females. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>), who also (for the US) show that wages went up when the per cent female rose for occupations with 90 per cent female or more.</p>
<p>While the findings from the cross-sectional part clearly contradict predictions from the theory of devaluation, those from the panel design are slightly more ambiguous. Overall, the results from the panel models are similar to those from the cross-sectional part, so wage growth is highest for those who move to (or stay in) integrated occupations. However, wage growth tends to be lowest for those who move to a heavily female-dominated occupation.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that wages in female-dominated occupations, in general, are lower than in male-dominated occupations. Since one assumption of the theory is that female-dominated occupations are devalued when pay is lower than in comparable male occupations, this can be interpreted as support for devaluation theory. However, lower wages in female-dominated occupations should not necessary be interpreted as evidence of the devaluation theory. Instead, the remaining negative effect of the percentage female could be due to unmeasured variables or misspecified models. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699313484480">Tam (1997</xref>) points out that the sex composition effect in the US could be ascribed to specific human capital, on-the-job training and vocational training.</p>
<p>In all categories of occupational sex composition, even in integrated occupations where wages are highest, the results show a gender wage gap to the disadvantage of women (results not shown). Other research has shown this as well (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699313484480">Budig, 2002</xref>). Men are therefore more advantaged than women in regard to wages across all sex composition categories. Findings like these, taken together with the reported non-linear relationship between occupational sex compositions and wages, make it difficult to explain women’s lower wages with the devaluation of female work or other characteristics of female occupations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699313484480">Macpherson and Hirsch (1995</xref>) assert that since a large part of the gender wage gap remains after sex composition and other important individual and occupational characteristics are taken into account, it would be more useful if public policy focused on earnings differences between men and women <italic>per se</italic> instead of the wage differences associated with wage differences between male and female-dominated occupations.</p>
<p>One striking aspect of the non-linear relationship between female percentages and wages is the high wages in sex-integrated occupations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699313484480">Magnusson (2009</xref>) has shown that integrated occupations have the highest prestige as well. Why sex-integrated occupations have the highest level of both wages and prestige is an issue that needs to be further explored.</p>

<p>Another approach for testing the devaluation theory is to measure alternative mechanisms that may account for (and explain) the unexplained effect of percentage females in the occupation. For example, measures of specific human capital – usually on-the-job training – have been shown to explain at least part of the effect of percentage female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699313484480">Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699313484480">Tam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001699313484480">Tomaskovic-Devey and Skaggs, 2002</xref>). This is a model worthy of imitation since it tests the presence of devaluation more directly. Thus, if the effect of percentage of females could be explained by other indicators it would be difficult to argue that a devaluation still exists. The register data used here lack sufficient information about some important mechanisms, which is a major drawback. This makes it more or less impossible to take a ‘mechanism-based approach’ like Tam’s (1997). Nevertheless, the widespread approach in prior research, testing devaluation theory, is to look for a negative wage effect of occupational sex composition, and measurement of the percentage female in the occupation is in general to use a linear function. In view of this, investigations of the functional form between wages and sex composition could still be considered as interesting. The presence of higher wages in integrated occupations that has been found in earlier studies (e.g. Cotter et al., 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699313484480">Magnusson, 2004</xref>) is not well known and could be further explored. In addition, the approach of using change data at the individual level (as done in the present paper) is an alternative way of evaluating the association between occupational sex composition and wages which, hopefully, can contribute with some new knowledge to the field.</p>

<p>In a later work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699313484480">Levanon et al. (2009</xref>) carry out a similar analysis to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699313484480">England et al. (2007</xref>) but use a longer period. This study gives support to the devaluation theory.</p>

<p>Out of considerations of space, this article does not investigate the relationship between wages and care or service work. However, this relationship has previously been studied with Swedish data pointing out a wage premium for care work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699313484480">Magnusson, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699313484480">2010</xref>).</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001699313484480">England et al. (2000</xref>) replied to Tam’s study by including a measure of general educational requirements of occupations and subsequently found a negative effect of the share of women in the occupation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699313484480">Tam (2000</xref>) for a counter-reply).</p>

<p>Individual mobility only includes individuals who have shifted from one occupation to another, that is, the shift needed to result in a change in the ISCO-88 code. In most cases, changing occupation also implies mobility across employers, although it is possible to shift occupation but not employer. For instance, individuals can make an occupational shift from nurse (ISCO=323) to midwife (ISCO=223), but still have the County Council as their employer.</p>

<p>Mobility itself is an interesting and well-established field of research in the literature. No further mention is made here of theories concerning mobility (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699313484480">Feldman and Ng (2007</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699313484480">Rosenfeld (1992</xref>)).</p>

<p>The division of SSYK is based on two key concepts: (a) ‘type of job’, i.e. the set of tasks performed in the job and (b) the qualifications normally required to perform this job. SSYK has, as ISCO-88, a hierarchical structure with four levels, major groups, sub-major groups, minor groups and unit groups. For a detailed description of SSYK, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scb.se/Pages/List259304.aspx">http://www.scb.se/Pages/List259304.aspx</ext-link></p>

<p>Standard errors are clustered at the establishment level, since it could be assumed that individuals at the same establishment may not be independent of each other (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699313484480">Cameron and Trivedi, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Other measures of per cent females in occupations have also been used; for example, logging and squaring the variable. The explained variance is smaller in these models.</p>

<p>Since occupations in the public sector are female-dominated, these analyses have also been carried out with separate models for the private and public sectors. Those for the public sector reveal a clearly non-linear relationship where integrated occupations have the highest wages for both sexes. In the private sector, women have the highest wages in occupations with 15 to 24 per cent females. For men, wages are highest in integrated occupations in the private sector as well.</p>

<p>The LNU survey is based on a representative 0.1 per cent sample of the Swedish population between the ages of 18 and 75. In LNU 2000, 5,142 respondents participated, with a response rate of 76.6 per cent. The division of sex composition categories in the analyses based on LNU data differs from the division that is used with register data. The division in LNU is similar to the division used in an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699313484480">Magnusson (2004</xref>).</p>
