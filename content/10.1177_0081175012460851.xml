<p>In using new qualitative data analysis software (QDAS), each different program can feel like a world unto its own. Becoming competent, let alone fluent, in the operations of any one of the programs, not to mention multiple programs, or mastering their more advanced toolboxes, requires much time and perseverance. One can quickly feel that the tools of research are overtaking the substantive goals of inquiry. Is computer-assisted qualitative analysis worth the effort? The papers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460851">Franzosi, De Fazio, and Vicari (this volume, 2012</xref>:1–42) and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081175012460851">White, Judd, and Poliandri (this volume, 2012</xref>:43–76) say yes. Although both papers make caveats and offer cautions, each sees great promise in new tools of computer-assisted analysis. Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA) is said to break new ground in empirically measuring the elusive, celebrated concept of “agency,” whereas QDAS programs for thematic analysis, it is provocatively suggested, might one day play a role for qualitative research akin to that played by “computational software in fomenting the quantitative revolution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081175012460851">White et al., 2012</xref>:44).</p>
<p>Having recently installed the latest version of ATLAS.ti, which came loaded with fabulous bells and whistles, I am acutely aware of what White and colleagues call the “mismatch between the technical capabilities” of the software and how researchers like me actually use it—which is mainly as a computerized version of what earlier generations did with index cards and highlighters. But I am not entirely convinced by the authors that deploying the new tools is as promising as they suggest.</p>
<p>The authors provide a useful example of how secondary analysis of codes can shed light on research questions. But their example also points to how much more complex analysis becomes once one moves beyond “code and retrieve.” This complexity contains at least three levels: first, one has the initial complexity of assigning codes to text. This process requires the standard concerns of relating texts to contexts, coding and reliability, and so forth—all the ordinary issues about which we are familiar. But when one moves to meta-analyze codes, then we also must understand how the various codes relate to other codes, which involves a different level of complexity. The authors tackle this second level of complexity by discussing denominator, null response, and overlap. Of these, perhaps the “denominator” is the most vexing problem because in textual analysis the unit of analysis and how units are related is hard to pin down. Is the unit the linguistic passage that has been coded, the text to which it belongs, or the subject who was interviewed? Units of textual analysis are not very much like the units of survey research because they vary not just by their attributes but by linguistic context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081175012460851">Krippendorff 2004</xref>). For instance, should a code assigned to a 10-sentence quotation in ATLAS.ti be treated quantitatively the same way as a code assigned to a three-word quotation? Who could answer such a question?</p>
<p>The third level of complexity introduced by the higher order QDAS tools is that of communicating your findings. Not only does the researcher need to explain the relationship of codes to text and text to context, but now the author also needs to explain all the meta-relationships of codes to codes and their process of quantization. More complexity means less transparency, more room for error, and more potentially dubious conclusions. Increased complexity is not, of course, grounds for rejecting new tools and methods, but it does call out for caution and some healthy skepticism.</p>
<p>Having responded to White, Judd, and Poliandri by asking if the authors are too optimistic, my response to Franzosi, De Fazio, and Vicari is in the opposite direction: the authors might go even further in affirming the value of their tool for measuring agency. Franzosi and colleagues say that QNA captures agency “without meaning.” They reason that newspaper data cannot capture the subjective motivations of individual actors—that these meanings would be better studied, as they note, through close readings of diaries, letters, etc. But, contrary to the conclusion of the authors, I view their network graphs (Figures 1 and 2) as demonstrating a structure of social relations that is meaningful through and through: the graphs contain meaningfully constructed categories (for example, “negros,” “white mobs,” “white women,” “law enforcement”) and meaningful actions (for example, violence, rape, assembling, coercion).</p>
<p>The QNA data offer a picture of agency from the perspective not of individual subjectivity but of white-owned newspapers and, more broadly, institutionalized power in Georgia between 1875 and 1930. This picture represents a meaningful field of actors and action (and thus agency), which is shaped by racism, violence, and gender. Newspaper articles about lynching codified and disseminated those representations, which further propagated those collective identities and scripts for interaction. The QNA data give us a quantified schematic of these representations of agency aggregated over time. The network graphs are, in a sense, a picture of meaningful agency construed from the perspective of relational sociology—the precise field to which the authors want the method to be of service. In other words, should we not see QNA as a tool for depicting meaningful agency from the methodologically relational, rather than individualist, point of view?</p>

His research includes a project using quantitative narrative analysis, for which he received a Dissertation Improvement Grant from the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program of the National Science Foundation. He earned his PhD in sociology at Yale University and holds an MA in religious studies from Indiana University. Current research concerns the diffusion of social movement protest practices within the global diaspora of China since 1978.</p>
