<abstract>
<p>Churches have been a popular site for the implementation of health promotion interventions. Although the efficacy of church-based health programs have been established, it is unknown which aspects of church-based health promotion drive health behavior change. Process evaluation is a way to increase our understanding of key components of church-based health promotion and to move the field forward. Thus, a systematic review of the utilization of process evaluation in church-based health programs was conducted. Articles from 1990 to 2008 were screened for eligibility, resulting in the analysis of 67 articles. The majority of church-based health programs assessed recruitment (88.1%) and reach (80.6%). About 28.4% assessed dose delivered, and 27.3% measured dose received. Context and fidelity was assessed by 34.3% and 20.9%, respectively, of church-based interventions. Approximately 9% of church-based programs measured fidelity. On average, only three of seven possible components of process evaluation were measured among the studies reviewed. The number of process evaluation components assessed did not differ by program feature (e.g., target population, target health condition, program objective, etc.). Consistency in the conceptualization and measurement of process evaluation may facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive process evaluation effort in church-based and other health promotion interventions.</p>

<p>Churches have been a popular site for the implementation of health promotion interventions, particularly those targeting underserved groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910390358">Baskin, Resnicow, &amp; Campbell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910390358">Eng &amp; Hatch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910390358">Olson, Reis, Murphy, &amp; Gehm, 1988</xref>). There are several advantages to partnerships between researchers and academic institutions and members of church-based organizations with respect to health-related interventions. Churches are ubiquitous social institutions that have deep and embedded ties within communities in which they are found. Thus, churches are places where researchers can reach individuals who may not be accessible via other organizations or agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390358">Lapane, Lasater, Allan, &amp; Carleton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390358">Lasater, Carleton, &amp; Wells, 1991</xref>). Church members also commonly have well-established social networks so that health programs can be developed and reinforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910390358">Chatters, Levin, &amp; Ellison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390358">Lapane et al., 1997</xref>). The history of volunteerism in most churches can also serve to strengthen health programs instituted in the church. And, entire families are often involved in church activities that will ultimately encourage the initiation and maintenance of healthy behavior changes in all age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390358">Lapane et al., 1997</xref>). Church members and the public health community also embody a similar set of ethos with respect to health by placing value on service, education, and behavioral change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910390358">Chatters et al., 1998</xref>). In many religious organizations in the United States, and in related theological teachings, the body is viewed as a “temple” where God resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910390358">Kim &amp; Sobal, 2004</xref>); thus, health and religiosity are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>Several reviews of church-based health promotion programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910390358">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven, Hunter, Wilder, Walton, &amp; Berry, 2004</xref>) have reported positive effects on a myriad health behaviors, such as healthy eating, physical activity, smoking, and screening, to reduce disease risk and/or prevention. The potential of church-based programs to reduce health disparities have also been documented in the ability of churches to change health outcomes among low-income, rural, and minority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910390358">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>). Although the efficacy of church-based health programs has been established, it is unknown which aspects of church-based health promotion drive health behavior change. Whether the church is used as a site for recruitment and/or the intervention only (faith-placed) versus engaged in the program’s delivery (faith-based) has been suggested as a potentially important factor in a church health program’s effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>). Incorporating culturally appropriate components, such as spiritual elements, has also been suggested as an essential church program design element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910390358">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>). A thorough understanding of the key components of successful faith-based health promotion interventions, and under what conditions these components are successful, is needed to advance the field. Process evaluation is a way to increase our understanding of key components of church-based health promotion and to move the field forward.</p>
<p>Process evaluation helps investigators understand how and why certain aspects of an intervention were successful or not, and under what conditions the intervention was successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). Process evaluation associated with health interventions has increased considerably over the past 20 years, in part because of the growing complexity of behavioral interventions, including interventions with multiple components addressing multiple levels of the ecological model, across multiple sites for multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). Process evaluation can shed light on why some interventions produced the intended results, and why others did not, and provide valuable insights about significant, modest, or null findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, to understand the key components of successful church-based health promotion interventions, a systematic review of the utilization of process evaluation in church-based health programs was conducted. To the authors’ knowledge, a systematic review of the utilization of process evaluation in church-based health programs has not been reported in the literature. The specific goals of the review were to (a) ascertain what proportion of church-based health promotion studies report process evaluation, (b) ascertain what process measures were used, (c) ascertain how reported process measures varied by select program features, and (d) discuss how process evaluation enhances understanding of the process through which church-based interventions promote health.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910390358">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>We identified relevant articles from 1990 to 1999 from a review of church-based organizations and health promotion programs conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al. (2004)</xref>. A total of 97 manuscripts were accrued. Using a similar methodology as DeHaven et al., we identified relevant articles from 2000 to 2008 through conducting literature searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. PubMed was chosen as the primary database to conduct our search. The terms “faith based,” “church based,” “community church,” “congregational nursing,” and “parish based” were entered with the term “health.” A set of religion terms (e.g., religion, spirituality, faith) were also entered with the term “health.”</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of articles identified from our comprehensive review were read for possible inclusion in the formal review process. Articles considered for formal review met the study’s objective to identify the process methods used in church-based studies that promoted health. If it was not clear from the title or abstract whether the article was consistent with our review’s objective, they were entered into the formal review process. From the articles identified from 2000 to 2008, 74 articles entered the formal review process. The 97 articles identified from 1990 to 1999 through the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al. (2004)</xref> review were included in the formal review, for a total of 171 articles.</p>
<p>The formal review process consisted of reading the article and determining whether the health program or intervention was directly connected with attempting to change a health outcome. The exclusion criteria included reviews without a specific description of the studies reviewed, health ministries not describing specific components of a health program, and church buildings used as part of a public health strategy (distinct from involvement of the church community as part of a multisite health intervention). Some programs published a separate process evaluation paper in addition to an outcomes and/or program description paper; articles describing one program were combined and considered as one unit for the purposes of our review. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 67 articles remained for analysis.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1524839910390358">
<title>Data Gathering</title>
<p>The following data were extracted from the remaining 67 articles: target population (race, age, gender), target health conditions (general health, cardiovascular health, cancers, diabetes, mental health, nutrition/weight control, smoking, other/not specified), program objective (primary, secondary, tertiary), program scope (congregation, community, city, or region), and number of congregations involved in the intervention (&lt;10, 10-49, 50-100, &gt;100).</p>
<p>Faith-based organization (FBO) level of involvement was based on the prior literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390358">Lasater et al., 1991</xref>). If the FBO was used as a site for recruitment and/or the intervention was delivered in the church, FBO level of involvement was coded as “faith placed.” If the congregation was involved in the program’s delivery or spiritual elements were included in the intervention, FBO level of involvement was coded as “faith based.” If the program involved the congregation in program delivery and included spiritual elements in the program, FBO level of involvement was coded as “faith-based plus.”</p>
<p>Whether program outcomes were measured (yes/no), had multiple outcomes (yes/no), took place across multiple sites (yes/no), and used a theoretical perspective was also extracted, in addition to program/intervention location (city and state), study design (randomized controlled trial, single-group, etc.), and intervention/program components.</p>
<p>A considerable array of process measures have been reported in the health promotion literature. To promote a systematic approach to guide process evaluation efforts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan and Steckler’s (2002)</xref> schema was used to conceptualize process evaluation and subsequently extracted for data analysis: context, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, implementation, and recruitment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910390358">Table 1</xref> adapts Linnan and Steckler’s schema to conceptualize process evaluation for church-based health interventions. Sample size for process evaluation (<italic>n</italic> = less than 100/<italic>n</italic> = greater than 100) was also extracted. If the study explicitly incorporated process evaluation measures, the specific process evaluation component was recorded, with a brief description of the evaluation’s results.</p>

<title>Process Evaluation Components by Program Features</title>
<p>Programs with 50 to 100 congregations involved reported the greatest mean total number of process evaluation components assessed, compared with programs with less than 10, between 10 and 49, and more than 100 congregations involved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839910390358">Table 4</xref>). Programs with the program scope at the congregation level or implemented in churches (vs programs targeting a community, region, or city) also reported the highest mean total number of process evaluation components, compared with those programs aimed at the community, region, or city. Those programs focusing on secondary prevention reported a mean of 3.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.1) process evaluation components assessed out of a maximum of seven, compared with those programs whose objective was primary (1.3 ± 1.9) or tertiary (1.7 ± 0.8). Interventions targeting African Americans reported a slightly higher mean of process evaluation components measured (3.1 ± 1.2) compared with interventions targeting other racial/ ethnic groups (2.5 ± 1.2). Smoking programs reported the highest mean of process evaluation components assessed (4.0 ± 1.4) followed by cardiovascular health (3.5 ± 1.3), nutrition/weight control (3.2 ± 1.0), and cancer (3.1 ± 0.9). Programs for adults (3.1 ± 1.1) or the elderly (3.0 ± 1.0) assessed a greater number of process evaluation components compared with programs for children, teen, or other age groups. In addition, programs targeting females (3.3 ± 0.9) assessed more process evaluation components compared with those targeting men (2.5 ± 2.1) or were unspecified by gender (2.7 ± 1.4). Faith-based plus programs reported the greatest number of process evaluation components assessed (3.1 ± 1.4) compared with faith-placed or faith-based interventions. Studies reporting program outcomes, multiple outcomes, and a theoretical perspective also reported higher mean process evaluation components assessed. Furthermore, multisite programs reported more process evaluation components compared with single-site programs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of this systematic review of process evaluation among church-based health interventions revealed that despite the advantages of process evaluation in understanding project outcomes, it is rare to find studies that have conducted a comprehensive process evaluation effort in conjunction with a program or intervention. Moreover, on average, only three of seven possible components of a comprehensive process evaluation effort as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler (2002)</xref> were used and/or measured among the studies reviewed, with the most common component being recruitment (measured in 88% of studies reviewed).</p>
<p>Although this study’s results do not give information about whether process evaluation efforts in church-based health interventions were done well or appropriately given the research questions, or whether the components of process evaluation were conducted in a valid or reliable way, this review illustrates the extent to which crucial process evaluation components are conducted and provides information about the necessity of comprehensive process evaluation efforts in future church-based health interventions. Currently, a “gold standard” for quality process measures does not exist, and the nature of published articles is such that it is difficult to evaluate the quality of process evaluation conducted. Inventorying the extent of process evaluation use is an important step towards building a consensus in the measurement of process evaluation so the quality of process measures can be evaluated in the future. In addition, the study serves as an important reminder to researchers and practitioners about the necessity of thorough process evaluation in future health interventions. To demonstrate how the seven components of process evaluation examined in the study are crucial to advance the field of church-based and other health interventions, a brief description of each process evaluation component is described below along with an example of how process evaluation can be interpreted and applied.</p>
<p>Referring to the procedures used to approach and attract prospective program participants and the organizations (e.g., churches) from which participants are recruited from, recruitment can yield understanding of the external validity of final outcomes. African American girls’ views of exercise as unfeminine coupled with social norms of “thicker” body size acceptance may have played a role in the recruitment troubles reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910390358">Resnicow, Taylor, Baskin, and McCarty (2005)</xref> in their weight control intervention. Thus, the program’s results may only be applicable to African American girls who do not hold traditional African American cultural views of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910390358">Kumanyika, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910390358">2002b</xref>). In addition to understanding recruitment at the participant level, understanding recruitment at the organizational level yields insight of the internal and external validity of final outcomes, as the organizational level impacts outcomes at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910390358">L. A. Linnan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Reach was also a popular process evaluation component assessed among the studies reviewed (measured in 81% of studies reviewed). Concerning the degree to which the intended audience participates in an intervention, reach reflects the proportion of participants who engage in/with an intervention and yields information on whether participants who engage in the intervention are representative of the larger population who are eligible to participate. Examining reach can also yield insight at the organizational level on the proportion of churches at the organizational level from all churches who are engaged in the intervention and whether the types of churches who agree to participate in the program are representative of the larger universe of churches eligible to participate. Given the investment in time and resources in developing and delivering interventions, a clear description of reach is warranted so that interventions can be evaluated for appropriateness in other communities. Churches participating in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910390358">Yanek, Becker, Moy, Gittelsohn, and Koffman’s (2001)</xref> study were interested in participating in the study, had a history of active community involvement, and had no pre-existing programs in the health behaviors targeted for intervention. Thus, Yanek et al.’s intervention may only be successful in churches with similar characteristics (participation interest, history of involvement, no preexisting health programs).</p>
<p>In comparison with recruitment and reach, process evaluation efforts were less likely to include information about context (34%), which refers to the larger physical, social, and political environment that either directly or indirectly affects an intervention program. Context is important to assess because it gives insight into how and why an intervention was successful or not. For example, in one study reviewed, Baptists in the spiritually oriented intervention were three times (odds ratio = 3.23; <italic>p</italic> = .010) more likely to make positive progress (e.g., quit rate, stage of readiness to change) in a smoking cessation program than other denominations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910390358">Voorhees et al., 1996</xref>). These investigators described the larger social context of the interventions where strong social norms against smoking, and the labeling of smoking “as a sin” in Baptist theology, may have explained why the intervention was more effective among congregants of Baptist churches.</p>
<p>Like the process evaluation element context, only 28% of studies we reviewed measured dose delivered. Referring to the amount or proportion of the intended intervention that is actually delivered to program participants by the study team, dose delivered can shed light on whether a program did, or did not, yield an effect because of the intervention dose delivered, or because of the ineffectiveness of the intervention itself. Moreover, it can shed light on which elements of an intervention dose were delivered, or not. Likewise, understanding whether only certain elements of an intervention were delivered can provide a context for correctly interpreting study results. For example, when describing their smoking cessation intervention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910390358">Stillman, Bone, Rand, Levine, and Becker (1993)</xref> noted that some churches in the intervention condition did not deliver the programmatic-related sermons on smoking and health and/or the required number of smoking cessation support groups. Although readiness to quit smoking significantly increased among treatment churches, it is possible that this effect may have been even stronger if all program components were delivered as intended.</p>
<p>Related to the concept of dose delivered, dose received refers to the extent that intended participants actually received (e.g., read, viewed) the intervention. Although a study team may have delivered 100% of a particular educational brochure to a church, if only 10% of the congregation actually read the print material, the likelihood of an intervention effect may be diminished. Unfortunately, dose received was only measured and reported by 27% of the programs reviewed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910390358">Campbell et al. (2000)</xref> measured participant exposure to their fruit and vegetable intervention (e.g., received information on fruit and vegetables, heard of and talked with lay health advisers) and discovered that participants who reported being more exposed to the intervention reported greater fruit and vegetable consumption than participants with less exposure, which indicated that dose received mattered in terms of understanding program effectiveness. Again, understanding the extent to which participants are aware of, and engage with the intervention that is delivered, will help those who intervene understand which elements of the intervention are having the most/best impact and which are not.</p>
<p>Reported by only 9% of the programs reviewed, fidelity refers to the quality of the implementation of an intervention, or whether the intervention was carried out according to a prespecified plan. Understanding fidelity can yield important information about intervention feasibility and quality, and thus can provide useful insights about the effectiveness of specific interventions. In one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910390358">Smith, Merritt, and Patel (1997)</xref> reported that their hypertension intervention was not implemented in several churches because lay church leaders did not place the program’s implementation as a high priority and/or did not feel competent to lead the intervention. Thus the intervention’s modest effects may have been due to the program not being implemented according to established protocol in all treatment churches.</p>
<p>Including a combination of reach, dose delivered, dose received, and fidelity, implementation was assessed by just 21% of interventions reviewed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910390358">Yanek et al. (2001)</xref> reported that no differences between the spiritual and standard interventions were likely because the standard group incorporated spiritual elements (e.g., prayer, scripture reading) into the program. Thus, the lack of an added effect from incorporating spiritual elements (e.g., group prayer, health messages with scripture) may have been because of the level of spirituality of the participants reached and the delivery and receipt by all intervention participants of spiritual program components. If Yanek et al. had not collected process evaluation data on both the spiritual and standard intervention arms, the contamination of the standard arm with spiritual elements would have been undetected and erroneous conclusions about the added effect of including spiritual components could have been made. Thus, it is crucial to gather data from control/comparison churches in addition to treatment churches.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The need for thorough process evaluation is not only applicable to church-based interventions but also to health promotion interventions in other settings (e.g., worksite, school, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910390358">Butterfoss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910390358">Murta, Sanderson, &amp; Oldenburg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910390358">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). Focusing solely on outcome evaluation may result in potentially efficacious interventions being discarded as failures when in reality they were simply not delivered and/or received as intended. Process evaluation components can help identify the cause(s) for the “failure” (or success) and allow for modifications to be made in order to increase the likelihood of desired behavior change. Thus, process evaluation is essential in intervention research in avoiding Type III error resulting from “evaluating a program that has not been adequately implemented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910390358">Basch, Sliepcevich, Gold, Duncan, &amp; Kolbe, 1985</xref>, p. 316), and drawing incorrect conclusions about its efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistency in the conceptualization and measurement of process evaluation may facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive process evaluation effort in church-based and other health promotion interventions. Adoption of a comprehensive list of key process evaluation components (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>) as necessary in evaluating programs would provide investigators with a “checklist” of what process evaluation components to include to fully understand the impact of their interventions. Coming to a consensus on how to conduct a comprehensive process evaluation (e.g., the steps outlined in figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>) would also contribute to the consistency in the conceptualization and measurement of process evaluation needed to advance the field. Thus, the combination of having a common language and agreement on key process evaluation components (e.g., dose delivered, reach) and then a reasonable process for how to make decisions about which elements to include (see figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>), should yield an effective and comprehensive process evaluation effort that maximizes information yield with minimal cost and resources required. Moreover, this type of process evaluation effort would allow for comparisons between studies on common measures so that dissemination of effective program elements can be accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910390358">Weiner, Lewis, &amp; Linnan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In times of scarce resources, it is important to ascertain which aspects of an intervention are essential for promoting behavior change and which are either secondary or irrelevant. Intervention studies are costly and time intensive, so wise use of staff time and expertise, being mindful of participant burden, and prioritizing well when making decisions about what and when to collect data, is essential for optimal study management. If intervention components are not efficacious, researchers should have the information they need to make good decisions about what should be included in future interventions and what should be dropped. Dissemination of evidence-based interventions depends on the wise use of data, and process evaluation is central to making informed decisions during the study, as well as at study conclusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390358">Linnan and Steckler (2002)</xref> recommend that researchers “attempt to strike a balance between the data that is clearly needed and the data that is merely ‘nice to have’” (p. 9) in order to minimize burden on project staff (including volunteers) who are often involved in collecting and managing data, and on study participants who provide data. As such, researchers should clearly make known to study staff and volunteers the importance of process evaluation data, and be creative in finding ways to make data collection efforts as streamlined as possible to minimize barriers associated with conducting this type of data, while maximizing the quality and usefulness of the data.</p>
<p>Recent reviews have called for the incorporation of religious and spiritual values in program design, collaborative approaches between FBOs and academia, effectiveness studies, and the targeting of diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910390358">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390358">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>). As church-based interventions become increasingly complex, process evaluation becomes even more crucial in advancing research and practice. By understanding the current status of process evaluation in church-based health promotion, future studies can choose to build and improve on the current literature to improve the effectiveness of church-based interventions and thus, the health of the faith communities who frequent these settings.</p>
