<abstract>
<p>This article explores the processes that occur when music fans reject the up-to-date flow and download culture of the internet in favour of a more traditional first experience of listening to an album. Examining a sub-group within an online community for fans of rock band R.E.M., this article discusses how these fans assume non-normativity, due to their activities evading spoilers concerning the then forthcoming album. Driven by a nostalgic aim to recapture the experience of buying a new album without prior knowledge other than official information, this research shows how fans endeavour to resist technology and restore the experience of listening to and purchasing a new album as a singular event. The analysis shows how this pursuit of pleasure resulted in their cultural distinctiveness from the community and how it enabled them to create a form of inverted fan cultural capital, positioning them as a different, albeit temporary, interpretive community.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article seeks to unravel, and explore the consequences of, how some fans are responding to the listening processes and consumption of music online by aiming to recapture a more traditional, or authentic first listen. To achieve this, I will examine the Triskaidekaphobics (Trobes), a social sub-group within <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Murmurs.com">Murmurs.com</ext-link>, an online community for fans of American rock band R.E.M., and analyse their attempts to recapture the pre-internet experience of listening to and purchasing a new album as a singular event. However, as I will show, this appreciation is undertaken in a way that ultimately makes Trobes non-normative, due to their temporary spoiler-evading activities, which disrupt the exchange of knowledge with other members and results in their precise subcultural distinctiveness from the rest of the Murmurs community.</p>
<p>In their efforts to achieve the ‘ultimate first listen’, Trobes are temporarily giving up the ability to converse with the majority of the community about the new music, limiting themselves to certain, un-spoilt, areas of the forums and also contesting the vital processes of information acquisition within fandom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811422895">Fiske, 1992</xref>). This, I suggest, affects not only inter-relationships, but also Trobe accumulation of fan cultural capital, which is dependent on the acquisition and exchange of knowledge surrounding the object of fandom. However, I show that this situation allows them to create their own temporary forms of inverted fan cultural capital that are distinct from the rest of the Murmurs community, and argue that this process places Trobes in a position between non-Trobes and ‘casual’ fans, subsequently operating as a different ‘interpretive community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811422895">Fish, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>After exploring the reasons for the development of Trobes, I analyse the repercussions that arise for them, being a non-normative group who are motivated by a pursuit of pleasure that is temporary and nostalgically based, and therefore unorthodox in manner to the rest of the community. I argue that it is this temporality that not only dictates the dissolution of their subcultural distinctiveness, but also allows a smooth process of re-unification between Trobes and non-Trobes, and their attempted re-integration within the community once the need for their non-normative actions has expired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1461444811422895">
<title>The pursuit of the ultimate first listen</title>
<p>Murmurs is the largest and longest running online community for fans of R.E.M. Established in 1996, the website has recently celebrated its fifteenth anniversary and, at the time of writing, has achieved over eighteen thousand members and over two million posts. The data for this study was collected through a cyber-ethnography of the community, of which I have been a participating member since 2000. Alerting the community to my researcher status, I observed Murmurs over a four-year time period (between 2004 and 2007) and also during March 2011, surrounding the release of R.E.M.’s album <italic>Collapse into Now</italic>. During this time, I examined all posts within the Trobe sub-forum from its inception and monitored all discussions that mentioned Trobe behaviour within the Pop Songs forum before and after the album release (this totalled 434 posts). I also conducted interviews through email with members of the Trobe club. To maintain anonymity, I have refrained from featuring any identifying usernames within this article.</p>
<p>The Trobes operate in direct opposition to the information that the internet and Murmurs can provide. This is to say, instead of embracing the rapid flow of information and new processes of musical distribution that the new technology can deliver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811422895">Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811422895">Sterne, 2006</xref>), they are driven by a nostalgic aim to recapture the experience of buying a new release by a band without any prior knowledge of its contents, other than information which has been officially released. This motivation is encapsulated by the Trobe host who juxtaposes the different ways of approaching an album release and laments the disjointed process of experiencing a new album through the Murmurs community:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the most amazing times to be an R.E.M. fan (or a fan of any band, really) is that moment when you rush excitedly into the record store after work or school and grab a new album on the day of its release. You study the album art, pull out the disc, bring it home, play it and a whole new world opens up for you … But, unfortunately, in this crazy world of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://murmurs.com">murmurs.com</ext-link> and the Internet, the old feeling of awe and surprise at a new record has all but disappeared. That’s because all you have to do is come to Murmurs every day during the recording process, check the news articles, download the cover art, download the mp3s, all in an excited, tedious process that seems harmless – until the day the album comes out and you’re standing in the record store with nothing new and you realize you’ve taken away from the experience, lessened the intensity of the ultimate moment as a fan of recorded music. (21 September 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It can be seen from these comments that the Trobe approach to new musical content is formed on the premise that this new process of experiencing music is not only transforming what used to be a singular event into a disjointed one, but that it also, and most significantly, diminishes the levels of pleasure that the fan can experience, in as much as the ‘awe and surprise’ of the occasion is lost. From this perspective, the Trobe method of experiencing a new R.E.M. album works to re-emphasize its value as an aesthetic object. I will also suggest that Trobe activities, in addition to resisting the normative practices of the Murmurs community, also defy the music industry-driven template of album promotion and release cycle. Instead of responding to pre-release information and material, with which the industry generates interest and confers economic value on a product, Trobes, I would argue, actually resist the industrial events and processes leading up to the album release.</p>
<p>It is apparent that Trobes are committed to an effort to recapture and reinstate the first listening process as a singular event, rather than a gradual process of exposure, as new song snippets or tracks are leaked. They urge other community members who wish to join them to avoid ingesting any new information concerning the new R.E.M. album before it is released. In order to assist this, they have their own sub-forum within the R.E.M. music forum and also have a special icon to post in their signatures to express membership. Any new information concerning the album that is released unofficially online is classed as a spoiler by Trobes. A spoiler can be defined as ‘a piece of information … which has either not been aired to the general demographic of the online community, or which (in an alternative definition) has not yet been seen by an individual participant in that community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811422895">Cantwell, 2004</xref>: np). Because of this, spoilers have been perceived to ‘connote incorrect, cruel, and mischievous practices … hence [presenting] themselves as oddities and aberrations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811422895">Gray and Mittell, 2007</xref>: np). Jonathan Gray, drawing upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811422895">Gerard Genette’s (1997)</xref> concept of ‘paratexts’, which are ‘semi-textual fragments that surround and position the work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811422895">2003</xref>: 72) views spoilers as occupying this position between reader and the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811422895">2010</xref>). Due to its sometimes exclusivity, spoiler information can be of great interest to some fans<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444811422895">1</xref></sup> and also regarded as a means of gaining status<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444811422895">2</xref></sup> and social capital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461444811422895">3</xref></sup> within a community.</p>
<p>For Trobes, spoilers can take the form of song files or snippets, revelations of new song titles or lyrics, information on any musicians involved, descriptions or images of any cover artwork and any other reference to the style and content of the music. Any thread containing details of this nature is requested to be marked with a spoiler warning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1461444811422895">4</xref></sup> in the title so Trobes can approach it with caution. Members are requested to take the sacred oath for the club before joining, which attempts to consolidate their loyalty to both the club and other Trobes:
<disp-quote>
<p>I pledge my eternal soul to not listen to the new REM songs before the release of the next album, unless said songs are debuted via official non-internet media, such as Vh1, MTV or on my local radio station. If I do, I will be shamed amongst my fellow oath-takers and will not enjoy the new album nearly as much as they will. I understand that by breaking any of the codes of my oath, I will be subject to whatever punishment my fellow oath-takers deem fit, cruel and unusual or not. (21 September 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trobes are allowed to listen to any new songs performed during an R.E.M. concert they may attend. They are however not allowed to download any Mp3s of the songs performed live. If a concert is streamed live online, they are permitted to listen to that show once only and must refrain from making a note of any new song lyrics; it is felt that this behaviour acts as a simulation of ‘liveness’ that does not contravene the Trobe oath.</p>
<p>The actual creation of a social club within Murmurs for those who choose not to partake in the digestion and discussion of any new album pre-release information began in late 2000, in anticipation of R.E.M.’s twelfth studio album, <italic>Reveal</italic>. Calling themselves the Non-Revealing Revealers, some community members rallied together to refrain from listening to, or reading about, any new information concerning <italic>Reveal</italic> before the actual album release. R.E.M’s previous studio album, <italic>Up</italic>, was released in 1998, and therefore <italic>Reveal</italic> was the first album to be released by the band following the expansion of Murmurs as a fan community, and also within the up-to-date flow of information that is possible on the internet. It is interesting therefore, that this approach by community members was adopted in anticipation of how something might be spoiled for them, rather than from experience concerning another R.E.M. album release. With the creation of Non-Revealing Revealers to signify those who refrained from involvement in the consumption of news concerning the new album, the significantly larger group who were actively ingesting information were soon termed The Revealers. For some individuals, the club changed their experience of both listening to, and enjoying the new album:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the last album, a club was started – THE NON-REVEALING REVEALERS. Our mission was simple: to recapture the awe and excitement of the day of an album’s public release. Supporting each other as best as we could, and even getting … our own forum, we strove to ignore the news, to keep everything a mystery until the day of release – and it worked! (21 September 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the success of the Non-Revealing Revealers, it was decided by the cluster of group members that they would apply the same method of approach to the release of the next album. As the only information known about the next R.E.M. studio album was that it was their thirteenth, it was suggested that the new name for the group should be the Triskaidekaphobics or Trobes for short, which indicates a fear of the number thirteen. A sub-forum was again created within which the club could discuss their levels of commitment, provide encouragement for each other and talk about what they hoped or anticipated the new music would sound like: all aspects of the online exchange that were strongly valued by Trobes. For example, members often made themselves available on chat clients to provide support for other group members when a new snippet of information, or song, was revealed.</p>
<p>This commitment to encouraging each other and offering reminders of the reason why they were abstaining from being exposed to any new information, and what results this would ultimately deliver to them was a frequent theme within Trobe communications. The possibility that they would enjoy the new musical product considerably more than the non-Trobes was even stressed with a seemingly religious fervour:
<disp-quote>
<p>Folks, there a-gonna be people who are gonna oppose the righteous things we do! … are gonna try and put us down, are gonna try and ridicule us, are gonna try and make us feel like freaks … are gonna try and tempt us with mp3s and hints that things are being revealed in other forums … we shall enjoy a fresh new album come next Spring! we shall open that plastic wrap and/or cardboard box that surrounds the jewel case, pop in the CD and hear fresh new never-before-heard-by-our-ears sound. WE SHALL RING IN A NEW ALBUM WITH JOY, WITH UTTER AND COMPLETE PURITY, WITH UNSTAINED HEARTS AND MINDS! and it will be great! and it will be wonderful! and it will be sublime! keep the faith – and we shall have the last laugh indeed!!! (21 September 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trobes constantly remind themselves to ‘keep the faith’ in the belief that deferred gratification will deliver a greater reward than that experienced by non-Trobes, in the shape of the ultimate first listen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1461444811422895">5</xref></sup> Although Trobes believe that they will have the ‘last laugh’, it remains to be seen how their position and integration within the community is affected both in terms of their relations with non-Trobes, other Trobe members and in their expressions of fandom. To examine this, I shall now move on to explore how Trobes and non-Trobes’ opposing interpretations of what constitutes the most pleasurable approach to a new R.E.M. album release became a source of conflict within Murmurs that remained unresolved due to Trobes’ failure to adequately articulate the required sub-cultural knowledge of the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1461444811422895">
<title>Spoilers</title>
<p>Although there have been a number of studies that consider the effects of spoilers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811422895">Baym, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811422895">Brooker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811422895">Foster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811422895">Hill and Calcutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811422895">Jenkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811422895">Wright, 2004</xref>), they tend to focus on television or film fan communities rather than music fans. In addition, although Foster does acknowledge that spoiled fans derive a ‘different kind of pleasure’ to unspoiled fans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811422895">2004</xref>: 284), there has also been inadequate attention given towards the divisions that can occur between the spoiled and the un-spoiled within a fan community.</p>
<p>Nancy Baym observes that the use of spoiler warnings creates a ‘barrier between the viewer who does not want to know what will happen ahead of time and the preview’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811422895">2000</xref>: 88). However, I will also argue that the barriers that can arise between community members due to differences and contradictions within what fans ‘want to know’ should also be considered. I will suggest that within Trobe activities, the avoidance of spoilers creates a barrier not only between Trobes and the fan text, but also between Trobes and the rest of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1461444811422895">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A key issue which affects the relationship between Trobes and non-Trobes is one of responsibility for spoiling and non-spoiling. There has been a debate between those who believe that Trobes should be solely responsible for ensuring they do not come into contact with spoilers placed on the other sections of the boards by other members of the community, and those who believe that non-Trobes should not discuss any information that would compromise the Trobe position, without giving them prior warning. This latter perspective was articulated by a Trobe who drew attention to the notion that non-Trobes should not only be responsible for the spoiler-free content of their posts, but also for the information within the titles of threads:
<disp-quote>
<p>There seems too much stuff on murmurs that is not trobe-friendly … The problem is the titles include stuff we don’t want to know. We somehow need to get people to put a warning for trobes in the titles. (17 November 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However this request presupposed that non-Trobes had the same understanding as Trobes of what constitutes a spoiler. This assumption, combined with the expectation that other community members would respond positively and would understand the Trobe position, provoked adverse responses from non-Trobes who were not previously active within the Trobe forum, but entered to voice their opinions:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we need is Trobes stop whining. Trobes will, as of now, be forbidden to go to future R.E.M. gigs as there might be new material being played. Trobes will, as of now, be excluded from Newsstand as there might be news in a post containing song names, lyrics snippets from the next record. Trobes will … mmm … get my point? Trobes better go into solitary confinement till the new record’s released. Even the first single will give away info about the new record, thus Trobes can’t buy that either. My conclusion: being a trobe is mission impossible! (18 November 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These comments demonstrate the debates that can occur within fan communities concerning the interpretation of what a spoiler actually is, and the extent to which the un-spoiled can remain immune from exposure. Some other community members also called into question the Trobe process of attempting to preserve all information, even song titles, until the day of release:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well thats what THIS forum is all about not the rest of the site. We cannot stop talking about new music if people dont want to hear about song titles. I really doubt that announcing a song title in a post is that big of deal. And if you are mistakenly downloading songs or looking at pictures on the internet of new songs or cover art of future rem releases then maybe its time to take a computer class. (18 November 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This poster works from the perspective that both Trobes and non-Trobes cannot achieve mutual satisfaction within the community without a level of division. He draws a distinction between the different functions of the Trobe and non-Trobe forums and later suggests that Trobes should only view and participate in specific areas, or otherwise leave the community during this period:
<disp-quote>
<p>How can knowing a title of a song ruin the experience of hearing the album for the first time? And why would hearing it live and finding out the title be ok but seeing the title on We Talk not be ok? That doesn’t make any sense to me. Also, if you’re really gung ho about not knowing anything about the new album, Murmurs is not the place to visit. About the only way to do it would be to automatically mark all messages in all the R.E.M. forums ‘read’ every time you visit. Have fun with that. (19 November 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this regard, it was suggested that if Trobes planned to follow their oath, then they should either isolate themselves from the R.E.M. discussion forums, or look elsewhere than Murmurs.</p>
<p>Another poster took a different perspective in pursuit of a solution and recommended Trobes access alternative forums and view thread titles with caution. It was considered that the onus for being exposed to, and accessing, unwanted material was the responsibility of the Trobe, rather than the poster:
<disp-quote>
<p>With all due respect to the trobe community, i think it’s clear from the trobe oath and rationale that the burden of remaining information-free regarding album #13 is generally on the trobe, and not on Murmurs members at large. aside from reading the titles of threads when you use the ‘view all new posts’ command, i think that if you stay out of certain forums you will be relatively safe from spoilers. i’m not a trobe, but I also don’t want to know every living detail of #13 before it comes out, so i suppose that as the release approaches, i’ll be reading selectively. but that’s my reponsibility, and if i inadvertently read something that tells me more than i want to know, then i’m surely not going to blame the poster. (19 November 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It can be seen that, as more information concerning the new album is dispersed and discussed within Murmurs, the division between Trobes and non-Trobes is widened. It appears that efforts by Trobes to draw the two groups closer together were unsuccessful. This could suggest that Trobes did not sufficiently articulate subcultural knowledge in their posts that was required to draw a more positive response from the non-Trobes. Matt Hills observes that a requisite part of successful interaction in a fan community is the enunciation of ‘shared assumptions within the fan culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811422895">2004</xref>: 19). He considers that threads which promote agreeable responses can be regarded as a ‘successful sub-cultural performative – a successful ‘doing’ of being a … fan, which other fans iterate in their responses’. Conversely, threads that attract negative responses only work to ‘demarcate the boundaries to appropriate fan-cultural identity’. It could be argued that Trobes fail to adopt a sufficiently performative approach. While their constative statements describe the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811422895">Hills, 2005</xref>: 1–7), they fail to communicate the required levels of subcultural knowledge which, it can be argued, will be more likely to elicit positive responses. This situation can be viewed in contrast to Baym’s depiction of spoilers in a fan community where the un-spoiled simply ‘appreciate’ not being exposed to spoilers, and the others ‘like knowing the spoilers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811422895">2000</xref>: 88). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811422895">Bowen (2005</xref>: 39) also adopts a similar observation in his account of <italic>Star Wars</italic> fans. While he acknowledges that some fans welcome spoiler information, and others do not, he neglects to explore the situation any further. These approaches do not account for any possible divisions and tensions that may occur between the two groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1461444811422895">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Trobes do have a number of activities that work to consolidate the group, such as regular supportive discussion and speculations on the forthcoming album, there is a distinct lack of opportunity to engage in ongoing and regular decoding of material as apparent in the rest of the community, by those who are embracing the new, rather than traditional listening experience. For non-Trobes, this new listening experience works to heighten the pleasures of fandom rather than fracturing it, offering new opportunities for conversations surrounding the new music and spoilers, as they happen. However, Trobes cannot engage in these discussions and the sharing of new information occurring within a large part of the community. This will affect social relationships being formed, developed and maintained within the forum and also between Trobes and non-Trobes. Matt Hills also highlights the problem when fan communities are forced to conform in accordance with broadcast schedules. In his examination of the Alt.tv.xfiles newsgroup, he observed that this situation had a lasting effect on the community – ‘its affective space remains tied to a commodity-text, and atx therefore remains bound to the schedules and The X-Files US transmission dates and times’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811422895">2001</xref>: 157). This is an important perception, because within a discussion-based community, this alteration in communal relationships and communication exchange will have significant effects on an individual’s accumulation of subcultural and fan cultural capital. The membership of a social club within Murmurs may expand an individual’s social network, and strengthen bonds with other members. However, as I have shown, the ‘unspoiled’ Trobe club in one respect operates to isolate the club members from the rest of the community. Therefore, this will ensure the reduction of social interaction and discussion with the large percentage of Murmurs members who actively ingest and exchange new information. I shall now move on to explore how this situation not only disrupts Trobe acquisition of fan cultural capital and exchange of knowledge with other community members, but also how it allows them to create their own temporary forms of inverted fan cultural capital that are distinct from the rest of the Murmurs community.</p>

<title>Fan cultural capital and the imbalance of knowledge</title>
<p>Within the Trobe club, fandom is expressed and experienced by members in a number of ways that distinguish them as a group from non-Trobe R.E.M. fans. Given this situation, it is necessary to inquire how the distinctive and temporary nature of their activities affects both the accumulation, and value levels of, fan cultural capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811422895">Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> notion of social and cultural capital has been applied to fandom, most notably by John Fiske, who uses it to determine a ‘cultural economy’ that can be found within the actions of fans. His insistence that ‘knowledge is fundamental to the accumulation of cultural capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811422895">1992</xref>: 42) is also shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811422895">Hobson (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811422895">Hunt (2003)</xref>. Henry Jenkins also refers to the importance of the ‘exchange of knowledge between different segments of the [fan] community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811422895">1992</xref>: 7), concluding that ‘knowledge equals prestige, reputation, power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811422895">2006</xref>: 125), as does Majorie D. Kibby in her relation of the ‘ritual sharing of information’ between John Prine fans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811422895">2000</xref>: 96).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1461444811422895">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, when spoilers and their surrounding tensions appear within a fan community, there appears to be an alteration in the use and acquisition of knowledge. As is evident within the activities of Trobes and the notion of spoilers in general, I will support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811422895">Cantwell’s (2004</xref>: np) observation that the manner in which fan ‘knowledge is negotiated shows that it is not indiscriminately embraced’. Thus, maximum possible knowledge is not an absolute motivation for <italic>all</italic> members of a fan community. Knowledge of the object of fandom is no longer exchanged and accumulated by potentially all interested members of the community, but rather, the division of spoiled and un-spoiled members in a community creates instead an imbalance of knowledge. It can be accepted that members of a fan community can display varying degrees of knowledge: that I will not dispute. However, when a collective of members, in this instance the Trobes, makes a decision to remain unexposed to new information that is of great interest to other members of the community, a significant imbalance of knowledge occurs which may be temporary, but can have disruptive effects on the community.</p>
<p>Considering the implications of this imbalance, it is necessary to take into account how this prospect combines with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811422895">Pierre Lévy’s (1997)</xref> concept of the ‘cosmopedia’ and the collective and overlapping knowledge that can be found within this space. Lévy offers a vision of the technological future that is ‘a utopian one, based on a form of direct, computer-mediated democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811422895">1997</xref>: 57). Within this, the cosmopedia is interpreted as a ‘knowledge space’ that produces ‘collective intelligence’, which is ‘a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811422895">1997</xref>: 13). Lévy views the ‘deterritorialization’ of knowledge that occurs within the cosmopedia through the breakdown of geographical barriers as enabling wider and more rapid lines of communication, participation and information exchange.</p>
<p>Henry Jenkins concludes that fan communities online could constitute ‘fully realized versions’ of the cosmopedia due to them being ‘held together through the mutual production and reciprocal exchange of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811422895">2006</xref>: 27) and the ‘collective production, debate, and circulations of meanings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811422895">2002</xref>:158). Jenkins applies these observations to <italic>Survivor</italic> spoiler fans who he determines demonstrate ‘collective intelligence in practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811422895">2006</xref>: 28), as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811422895">Gray and Mittell (2007)</xref> argue of the television show <italic>Lost</italic>. Jenkins concludes that ‘what holds a collective intelligence together is not the possession of knowledge – which is relatively static, but the social process of acquiring knowledge – which is dynamic and participatory…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811422895">2006</xref>: 54). However, when a fan community is divided between those who are, and are not, willing to participate in the exchange of spoiler knowledge, even on a temporary level, how does this affect the ‘collective intelligence’ of the community? How do Trobes fit within the concept of fan ‘cosmopedia’? I will suggest that because Trobes temporarily do not contribute to the collective intelligence due to their non-involvement in the exchange of information, their practices meet the criteria of ‘unanswered questions’ that Lévy projects will ‘create tension within cosmopedic space …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811422895">1997</xref>: 217). This is because the nature of the Trobe position means that they disrupt the collective exchange of knowledge and production of meanings, and by doing so call into question Jenkins’ application of the cosmopedia.</p>
<p>In relation to this, and due to their elective isolation from new R.E.M. information, it is important to assess how fan cultural capital is affected by, and acquired within, the Trobe club. There appears to be a distinct dichotomy in the acquisition and value levels of fan cultural capital between Trobes and non-Trobes. It can be determined that as a result of their membership of the Trobe club, fan cultural capital is affected in a number of ways. Within the Trobe group, fan cultural capital still operates, yet in reverse to that experienced by non-Trobes. That which may be shameful as a fan to admit in the main R.E.M. forums, such as displaying a non interest, is instead applauded here. Within the Trobe forum the less you know about the current R.E.M. release the greater status and belonging you have, which is the opposite to the function of fan cultural capital in the other R.E.M.-related forums. Within these non-Trobe forums, displaying knowledge about the band and their current activities is a vital component of accruing fan cultural capital.</p>
<p>It can be seen therefore that Trobes do not conform to the behaviours and processes that acquire and validate fan cultural capital within the rest of the community, but instead work to create their own forms of capital. Jeffrey Sconce observes a similar occurrence within fans of trash cinema whose distinctions are applied to academia. Drawing on Bourdieu, he contemplates the attraction that different types of cultural capital will have for those who have yet to develop official cultural capital or transfer their educational capital into economic capital. He concludes that fans that fulfil these categories look towards trash culture as ‘a source of refuge and revenge’ due to their exiled nature. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811422895">1995</xref>: 379). This occurrence also complements Bourdieu’s perception that the dominated bourgeoisie seek to increase their accumulation of cultural capital ‘by making “risky” investments in new forms of cultural distinction and hence in new fields of cultural value (trash cinema in this case)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811422895">Hills, 2002</xref>: 59). Although the Trobes do not map onto a specific class faction, and cannot therefore be classed as dominated bourgeoisie, I will argue that they make similar investments by inverting the pre-existent forms of fan cultural capital in the community and working to extend them into different areas to create new forms of value and capital.</p>
<p>The process of minimizing knowledge is of great importance to Trobes who actively attempt to alter their listening experience towards the album release. They essentially seek to control their consumption and reception of the product in an effort to recapture the feeling gained from earlier enjoyable aesthetic encounters. It is important to ask therefore how this imbalance of knowledge affects their experiences and perception of being a fan. For some, the first listen is often one of the most memorable experiences of their fandom and can act as an historical determinant in any fan self-classification:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I heard Reveal it was totally fresh in every way – I hadn’t heard a single song (besides the already-released radio single Imitation of Life) from the album until two days before the release, when I saw them perform a free show in Cologne, Germany. By the time I got home from that weekend, it was time to walk through the streets of Prague with my Discman, enjoying a new and strange album – a moment I will never forget. (21 September 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This comment articulates not only the sense of individual pleasure that was experienced in the form of a memorable initial listen, but also a significant and meaningful occasion. One Trobe member, whose experience of the last album was greatly diminished due to the online pre-release of material, discovered a greater appreciation of the later new music upon first listen:
<disp-quote>
<p>It really gave me that old school feeling of buying an album. I kept away from the songs until the day i bought it – 4 days after it came out – and then listened to the whole thing during one drive. I remember that first listen as I did <italic>Up</italic> which was a similar experience. Reveal wasn’t like that at all – i knew more than half of it going in. It made me appreciate the whole experience much less. This time I listened carefully and appreciated every fresh song. It was very satisfying, more so than i had thought it’d be. (Interview, 2005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Trobe member, who had also listened to the previous R.E.M. album before its release, expressed a similar experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had listened to other albums (Reveal, New Order – Get Ready, etc.) online before the album release and found that it somewhat diminished my enjoyment because the record release date was not a big deal anymore to me. My listening experience as a ‘Trobe’ this time around, therefore, enhanced my experiences as a fan because I rushed out to the record store to buy the new album as soon as I got a chance and I felt the ‘old school’ rush of wanting to get home to listen to the album when I bought it. (Interview, 2005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both individuals display a desire to change their listening experience from a fragmented one, as witnessed with their pre-exposure to the <italic>Reveal</italic> album, to a single occasion that can be re-told to other fans. The prospect of having a story to re-tell to others can often be very desirable – fans often enjoy relating to others about the moment they became a fan (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811422895">Cavicchi, 1998</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811422895">Kibby, 2000</xref>: 95 for music fans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811422895">Jenkins, 1992</xref>: 58 for television fans; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811422895">Hills, 2004</xref> for genre fans). It could be argued that this desire for a clear fan self-narrative forms the basic principle of membership to the Trobe club and forms the basis of how their fandom is interpreted and expressed.</p>
<p>Trobes collectively may have an extensive historical knowledge of R.E.M. as a group and their musical output, yet in this instance, when purchasing the new album, they may hold the same, or even less, awareness as the casual fans or general audience who may be less devoted, but more aware of the product content. This affects Trobes’ status as fans and how they are viewed by others within the community. Fiske’s statement that ‘the fan is an “excessive reader” who differs from the “ordinary” one in degree rather than kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811422895">1992</xref>: 46) must also be considered at this point. Because Trobes approach the new release in a manner that is contrary to that displayed by the majority of the fan community, under Fiske’s definition they might be considered ‘ordinary’ readers. However, it is important to understand how the listening process will differ between Trobes and casual fans. Even though both may purchase the new product with the same (limited) knowledge of the new music, Trobes will apply longer-term historical, cultural and musical knowledge of the band to the music upon first listen. This will place them in a far better position to discuss issues concerning the album with other self-classified ‘fans’ after release, and this is what distinguishes them from a casual fan. I argue that, in this form, they can be viewed as a different ‘interpretive community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811422895">Fish, 1982</xref>), existing temporarily between the subject positions of non-Trobes and casual fans.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article I have examined the processes that occur when music fans, rather than avidly embrace the up-to-date flow and download culture of the internet, reject it in favour of a more traditional first experience of listening to an album. I have shown the consequences of this activity within the larger fan culture, and how it affects relations between fans. However, this also raises two key considerations.</p>
<p>Firstly, how does a group formed around this practice respond after the album release? In order to ascertain the level of involvement and discussion remaining after the event, and to assess Trobes’ feelings with regard to the purchase and reception of the album, I placed a thread within the forum entitled <italic>How was it for you</italic>?, stating: ‘I wasn’t a Trobe but I followed a lot of the threads with great interest. I just wondered – now that the album has been out for a short while, how did being a Trobe change the experience of buying and listening to the new album for you?’ (15 November 2004). The thread received little reaction, and those who did reply were either non-Trobes, or were unaware of what being a Trobe actually meant. Therefore this could indicate that there was no real Trobe group left post-release, until the stimulus for re-emergence arises. Since the new album was released, there were only two new threads posted within the Trobe forum, with both receiving only one or no replies. The little interaction between the Trobe members is contrary to the earlier claims from the group in regard to the pleasure and excitement factor that was mentioned in so many posts and threads building up to the album release. There was no Trobe reaction to the recent threads placed in the forum and little discussion of the frequently mentioned higher level of pleasure they would receive upon first listen. I will suggest that the Trobe members were eager, not to discuss their experiences amongst themselves, but instead to reintegrate into discussions with the rest of the community and end their distinctiveness, in an effort to reclaim structures of fan cultural capital subscribed to by the wider community.</p>
<p>Secondly, the quite complex relationship within music fandom towards albums and recordings and their changing form needs to be considered. Jonathan Sterne has argued that, ‘mp3s exist as software, people tend to treat them like objects … mp3s present us with an interesting bifurcation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811422895">2006</xref>: 832). However, as I have shown, for some groups of fans, this bifurcation, in addition to the fragmented flow of new music to online fan communities, works to contest the authenticity of their listening experience. In 2011, with the release of the latest R.E.M. album <italic>Collapse into Now</italic>, the continuing value of the CD and album as material object remained evident with some fans in Murmurs. As the album started appearing online and in record shops for purchase, members started posting threads entitled ‘It’s In My Hands’, including a picture of themselves holding the new release. Some fans had purchased the album through iTunes; however, they still transformed this digital product into physical object by burning the CD and printing the cover art.</p>
<p>This changing experience for online music fans also yields opportunities for future research. Due to their popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, R.E.M.’s fan base is of a generation that may have experienced what Trobes would deem as the traditional listening experience, by purchasing and listening to the album as a single event, with only officially released prior knowledge. However, how other fan communities comprised of younger generations who might be growing up with Mp3 downloads as their main consumption of music, will respond to the bifurcation of music in the age of the internet, and perhaps even transform within fan cultures what is regarded as the authentic or ‘ultimate first listen’ to a music album should be explored. The migration of these fan bases to social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter could also be examined, in terms of how the recirculation of information and debate by larger and mobilized fan audiences impacts on the discussion of music reception.</p>
<p>In this light, the effects of social media on fan groups such as the Trobes could also be considered. When the Trobes were in operation, Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy and the main avenues of caution for Trobes to avoid spoilers about the forthcoming album release were the Murmurs forums and various music news websites. With the current proliferation of social media platforms where news is distributed rapidly and widely, how challenging it would be now to avoid information surrounding a release in light of these technological changes could also be investigated.</p>
<p>Subsequently, how the music industry has adapted to this widespread use of social media also demands exploration. With new releases being launched on Spotify and Facebook in the form of listening parties, and songs being officially previewed on YouTube, what constitutes officially released information surrounding a new album has also changed since the formation of the Trobes. Previously, fans would ‘leak’ tracks online and distribute the links amongst the fan community, whereas official channels would distribute material that would have to be purchased and correspond to a set release date. Although these practices still occur in some forms, the division between official and fan-released material and information is not as clear cut as before, with some albums being promoted through online social media platforms in this manner and seemingly ‘leaked’ to the fan community.</p>
<p>Finally, future research could also consider how musicians are responding to these changes in the listening experience. As social media are offering more opportunities for musicians and other celebrities to connect with their fan bases, stars are revealing more information via these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811422895">Marwick and boyd, 2011</xref>), providing frequent updates. How a Trobe would approach this information, and whether it would be considered ‘official’ could also be considered. In addition, some fans are now being permitted through social media to engage in the creative process with musicians. Imogen Heap’s strategy of allowing her fans to be active participants in the creation of her album <italic>Ellipse</italic> through Twitter and Facebook is one example of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811422895">Wikström, 2010</xref>: 176, 177). In sum, this altered dynamic of fan/musician relations may work to reconfigure the idea of an ‘ultimate first listen’ within online music fan culture even further.</p>
