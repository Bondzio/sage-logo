<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger’s disease, is a segmental inflammatory vasculitis that involves small and medium-sized vessels and leads to occlusion in predominantly young male smokers. Without tobacco avoidance, the disease progresses and the final outcome is the occlusion of the involved vessels. Lower extremity arterial involvement is typically infrapopliteal and is one of the classical findings of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612450588">1</xref></sup> As the disease progresses, rest pain and ulcerations on the toes and other sites on the feet may develop. TAO is associated with a high risk of limb amputation. The amputation rate is 25% at 5 years, 38% at 10 years, and 46% at 20 years as reported in a series that included 111 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612450588">2</xref></sup> Prostacycline derivatives, sympathectomy, and bypass surgery have been used when patients develop critical ischemia. However, scarce information exists regarding the usefulness of the endovascular approach with angioplasty when these young patients develop critical ischemia. It has recently been reported that a series including 20 cases treated by the endovascular approach resulted in a 100% of limb salvage rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612450588">3</xref></sup> Based on our experience treating difficult cases of critical ischemia in patients with diabetes involving below-the-knee lesions by endovascular approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612450588">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612450588">5</xref></sup> and encouraged by the experience from other authors, we decided to give a chance of limb salvage to a patient with Buerger’s disease, critical ischemia, and big toe ulcer who had been scheduled for a big toe amputation by another team. The patient gave informed, written consent to be operated on and photographed and for his case report to be published anonymously.</p>

<title>Report</title>
<p>A 41-old-man who had been diagnosed with Buerger’s disease 17 years ago (1993) sought a second opinion in our department. Diagnosis was initially done due to foot pain and sympathectomy was carried out. He quit tobacco for 3 years, but started smoking again after this period. He developed a paronychia in 2004, which required drainage and did not heal. A spinal cord stimulator was inserted to aid wound healing. The lesion healed, but he continued smoking. The initial treating team performed an angiogram, and they did not consider any type of revascularization. Big toe amputation had been indicated. When he was evaluated in our department (April 2010), he had severe rest pain treated with transdermal fentanyl (100 µg/h) and a severe ulceration on the big toe in his right foot for 8 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612450588">Figure 1</xref>). Cessation of smoking had been achieved 8 months ago. Popliteal pulse was present but distal pulses could not be palpated. The ankle/brachial index was 0.5. Toe pressure could not be evaluated due to big toe involvement, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure was not available. A new angiography was performed in our department with the following findings on the right limb: no lesions were found in the aorta, iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries; findings included proximal occlusion of the peroneal artery and anterior tibial artery in its distal third as well as several stenosis of the posterior tibial artery with occlusion just before entering the foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612450588">Figure 2</xref>, stop). “Corkscrew collateral” arteries could be seen in the images (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612450588">Figure 2</xref>). The patient accepted the endovascular treatment. The plantar artery was recanalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612450588">Figure 3</xref>) using a 2.4-Fr microcatheter and a 0.012-in. microwire (Terumo Corp, Tokyo, Japan). Angioplasty of the posterior tibial and plantar arteries was performed with a 0.014-in. wire using a 2 × 20 mm Sprinter angioplasty balloon (Medtronic Corp, Minneapolis, MN). Severe artery spasm of the treated segment occurred during the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612450588">Figure 4A</xref>), which required 1 mg of nitroglycerine and 1 mg of sodium nitroprusside intraarterial in order to resolve it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612450588">Figure 4B</xref>). After resolving the artery spam, the postprocedure angiogram demonstrated adequate caliber of the treated segment and good perfusion of the foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534734612450588">Figure 5</xref>). The tibial posterior pulse could be palpated after the procedure. Pain disappeared the first night after the procedure. Following the endovascular procedure, the patient started antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/d) indefinitely and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for 6 months. Healing was achieved over a period of 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534734612450588">Figure 6</xref>). Narcotic treatment was progressively dropped out. We encouraged the patient’s wife to also quit smoking in order to decrease tobacco exposure to our patient through passive smoking; she also quit smoking. The patient remains asymptomatic 21 months after the procedure, the posterior tibial pulse remains palpable, and he is currently able to cycle for 80 km without stopping.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Open revascularization of patients with TAO is difficult because bypasses must be very distal and patency is poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612450588">1</xref></sup> The endovascular approach, mainly involving angioplasty of below-the-knee lesions, is associated with good rates of limb salvage with low morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612450588">6</xref></sup> Despite these good results in complex lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612450588">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612450588">6</xref></sup> scarce information existed regarding its usefulness in patients with TAO and foot ulcers until now. Angioplasty and thrombolysis were reported in one case of acute ischaemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612450588">7</xref></sup> and other authors reported a successful procedure in a 36-year-old man with untreatable rest pain in an article dealing with below-the-knee angioplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612450588">6</xref></sup> The latter experience encouraged us to attempt it, giving the patient the chance of limb salvage. The same leading author has recently published a hopeful experience treating 20 cases of critical ischemia in patients with Buerger’s disease, 55% of those presenting with tissue loss (Rutherford 5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612450588">3</xref></sup> Only 3 minor amputations were required after procedure and no major amputations were carried out achieving, therefore, 100% of limb salvage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612450588">3</xref></sup> A new approach for revascularization, defined as extended angioplasty of each tibial and foot artery obstruction, was performed to achieve direct perfusion of at least 1 foot artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612450588">3</xref></sup> We think that this was the key in our case. Opening the plantar artery quickly relieved the pain, which remains severe despite of sympathectomy, spinal cord stimulator, and transdermal fentanyl. Our patient had been scheduled for amputation of the first ray. When evaluating the angiogram, one must intuit that there would have been a high risk of failure of this procedure as subsequent amputations, some major, would have been required. Currently, nobody at this patient’s home smokes, which is key for obtaining the optimum outcome. The outcome achieved in this case and recent series should encourage doctors dealing with this problem to attempt limb salvage by means of the endovascular approach.</p>
