<body>
<p>Jon Wefald concluded his leadership as president of Kansas State University (KSU) in June 2009, after serving in that role since 1986. His atypically long 23-year tenure as a university president has been highlighted by many achievements, a number of challenges, and a few failures and controversies along the way. Wefald began his career as a history professor at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota after earning his PhD from the University of Michigan. After two unsuccessful runs for political office (U.S. Congress in 1968 and State Auditor in 1970), he became the president of Southwest State University (now Southwest Minnesota State University). From there, he became chancellor of the Minnesota State University System, finally ending up as the K-State president in 1986. Jon has been happily married to Ruth Ann for 46 years, has two sons, Skipp and Andy (one of the coauthors of this article), and four grandchildren—all currently residing in Manhattan, Kansas. Jon is a voracious reader on many subjects, including current events, military history, sports history, nature, and politics. Among his many awards and honors, Jon was elected into the Scandinavian Hall of Fame in 2003 and was honored by <italic>The Topeka Capital-Journal</italic> as their 1998 Kansan of the Year.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Let’s begin at the beginning; tell us about the formative years and your upbringing.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>I came from humble beginnings. I mean, we lived in a house with an outdoor toilet. When I was in grade school and then when we moved to Minot, North Dakota, we actually lived in a motel, Pat’s Motel. There were four kids, a mom and dad, and we all lived in two small rooms. My mother and dad slept in one room and that’s where we had dinner and the four kids slept in the other. We were in Pat’s Motel for a year and a half to 2 years. You know, when people find out where you live, you get that reputation of being from “the other side of the tracks.” As one result, I never took a book home in high school. I was a very average student who played a lot of pool and just wanted to be well liked.</p>
<p>However, an incident with a high school teacher dramatically helped to determine my destiny. As I said, I was an average student in high school. Well, this teacher asked me what I was going to do after I got out of high school. I told her that I wanted to go to college. She about fell out of her chair and told me that I was not college material and never would be. I have thought about this conversation often over the years whenever someone has told me that something can’t be done. For me, hope springs eternal and I just say to these naysayers, let’s wait and see. I am ever hopeful and optimistic. Over time, I started thinking I’m not only smart, I’m smarter than everybody else. I ended up getting a PhD in history from the University of Michigan.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Briefly describe for us a “typical” day as president of a major, land-grant university, such as KSU.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Clark Kerr was so correct: A university president has to wear many hats. But, whatever hat I was wearing, my typical day always involved interacting with people. I had an open door policy and tried not to schedule ongoing meetings. That means that I always had time to bring people in on short notice who wanted to talk with me. I viewed myself as a free safety in football; I didn’t have to make all the tackles, but if somebody gets through then I’m there to make the play. I was in the office almost every day, and I probably only had 4 or 5 meetings a week! Think about that. As a result, my typical day was not filled with meetings. So, I had the time to walk down the hall in central administration and talk to the vice president for administration and finance and say, “Ok, the March revenues were 15 million dollars under what was estimated, what do you think this means for the budget?” Or, I might say to him, “Ok, we’re having a board of regents meeting in 2 weeks and on Page 10 there’s this item for all 6 state universities and what do you think it means and how would we go about answering the question?” Then, I might go over and watch the debaters practice and see how they are doing because I gave lots of support to the debate team. Later, somebody from the theater department might come in and say “Hey, we need some help, we need to have a new carpet, is there any way we can get that done?” While every day was different, I was almost always there and available.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Tell us more about what you mean when you say that you were “almost always there and available”?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611427805">Peters and Waterman (1982)</xref>, I constantly practiced “management by walking around” (MBWA). I was very willing to go to somebody’s office. Actually, I would just as soon do that because by walking down the hall, you are bumping into people and saying hello and getting meaningful “face time” as well as the pulse of what is really going on.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>We all have performance expectations in our jobs. What performance expectations have you had to live up to as K-State president?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>I was lucky to have a job in which I had the latitude to set my own performance expectations. I always tried to do the best job I could, to always be available, I tried to do the right thing, tell the truth, to be true to myself, and I didn’t try to be somebody that I wasn’t. Nobody’s a genius. In reality, I probably have an average intellect but I’ve got a lot of common sense. To accomplish these performance expectations, I tried to always surround myself with really good people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer Note:</speaker>
<p>In researching the topic of college presidents, the interviewers found that although all college presidents technically hold employment contracts, one third of public university chiefs do not have formal written agreements. In a sense, this makes the presidents “at will” employees who serve at the pleasure of the appropriate university governing board. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611427805">Sander (2009a)</xref>, this is quite different from the contracts of high-profile collegiate coaches. For instance, Michigan State University’s men’s basketball coach, Tom Izzo, had a 59-page contract on which his 2006 total compensation of US$8,722,663 was based. The salary and contract length only became public through the <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic> using an open-records request to obtain the 42-page compliance questionnaire submitted by Michigan State University to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Following up on this notion of performance expectations, what aspects of your job as president did you find most enjoyable?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>The most enjoyable aspect for me as president of the university is that everyday is different. I spent 14 to 15 hours a day on the job, maybe 8 or 9 of those in the office and 3 hours at home. I enjoyed dealing with the various issues that came up, from minor to major. Just having your staff get along can be a challenge at times. You can have four or five coworkers and they get little wars going on. I had to be aware of those potential conflicts. I tried to interject humor into situations that were minor but which could escalate. I consider myself a fireman of the highest order. I would say the most exciting job aspects involved putting out the fires. It was the exhilaration of knowing that everyday was going to be different. You’re trying to run a first class institution and you are trying to make it a top-ten land-grant university.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Wow! 14 to 15 hours a day on the job makes for a long day. Organizational researchers have consistently found that these types of workdays can increase the chance of burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611427805">Wright &amp; Cropanzano, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611427805">Wright, Larwood, &amp; Denney, 2002</xref>) and work–family balance issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611427805">Wright, Cropanzano, &amp; Bonett, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611427805">Dowdall (2004)</xref> quotes one president as stating that “it’s not a great idea to be a president with a young family.” How did you address the issue of work–family balance early on when both your sons were young and living at home?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>From the time I was a professor of history at Gustavus Adolphus to the 6.5 years that I was commissioner of agriculture, I had a more regular routine. For those jobs, I was not putting in 14 to 15 hour workdays and wasn’t working at home as much. With these two jobs, our two sons were in grade school and junior high school. Thus, during this period of time, we had a more normal family life. By the time I became president of KSU in 1986, our two boys were in high school. So our boys were more independent by the time I became president of KSU. Very quickly, my workload increased to 8 hours or more at work Monday through Friday. I almost always had 2 to 3 hours of work at night. Then, on almost every weekend, I had a number of commitments and presentations to make before a variety of groups and constituencies. Thankfully, my wife, Ruth Ann, was a superb mother to both our boys and that helped a great deal. We tried to do things together as a family by going out for dinner from time to time and attending athletic events and movies.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What aspects did you find least enjoyable?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>The least enjoyable would be going to meetings, not the ones that were crucial to the accomplishment of important tasks but all the others which were just an exercise in rhetoric and potentially a big waste of time. As you can tell, I didn’t like a lot of meetings.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>With your retirement, K-State has a new president. What one piece of advice would you offer to your successor, President Kirk Schulz?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Management guru Peter Drucker said that incoming leaders should never say, “What can I do?” The question always has to be “what needs to be done.” If you follow that mantra “what needs to be done” instead of just unilaterally imposing your will, that means you are asking faculty, students, deans, department heads “‘ok, what are the issues here?” Find out what the issues are and then you try to set up a process to get at that issue. I would say for 23 years that was the question I always asked, “What needs to be done?” In addition, trust people. You know, Ralph Waldo Emerson always said that if you trust people they will trust you back 20 times over. Emerson well sums up my beliefs.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Can you give us an example of “mutual trust” in action?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>In June 2008, a tornado hit the K-State campus. The tornado impacted 43 buildings, thousands of windows were damaged. The roofs were off probably 5 or 6 buildings where everything on the roof was on the ground. In addition, 150 trees were destroyed, 100 plus cars were just ruined. It was a devastating tornado. Everyone knew that we only had 2 months to get the school ready for fall semester. It was a remarkable 2 months! Instead of people saying that I only do electrical or plumbing, nobody looked at their position description. What they said was that we have one huge problem here and we collectively asked the question, “What needs to be done?” In other words, people moved outside the narrow confines of their job description as an electrician or plumber and pitched in where they were most needed. As a result, we had a wide range of people out picking up branches, raking, painting, and just doing what was needed to get it done. We completed our task before the start of the fall semester. We never could have gotten that done without trust. Once trust is gone, the relationship is over.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What word descriptors best categorize your leadership style?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>I would say that the best descriptor of my leadership style is “problem solver.” No kidding, I may be one of the five greatest problem solvers ever! No one could solve problems like I could because I had the mind-set that there is no job that I couldn’t handle. Being a great problem solver is about working with people. It’s about treating people with respect and expecting them to do the best job possible.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611427805">Hersey and Blanchard (1969)</xref> developed the Situational Leadership Model suggesting that the leader’s behavior should be adjusted to the maturity level of the subordinates. Their model resulted in four styles of leader behavior—telling, selling, participating, and delegating. It would appear that the style that best fits you would be delegating. A delegator gives wide latitude to their subordinates in the actual accomplishment of the assigned task, focusing more on maintaining the social aspects of the relationship. Do you agree that you have primarily used a delegating style?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Over the course of my career, I have used each of the four styles, but I would say my most effective style is as a delegator. Being able to delegate means that you have to hire good people and trust them. You would be amazed at what results can happen when you trust people and encourage their best efforts.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611427805">Tulgan (2004)</xref> recently suggested that in an effort to avoid being characterized as micromanagers, leaders often adopt the principle of empowerment, an idea very similar to Hersey and Blanchard’s delegating leader. The problem with the (over)use of empowerment as a management tool is that it can lead to undermanagement and the abrogation of one’s responsibilities as a leader and manager (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611427805">Wright &amp; Larwood, 1998</xref>). Where do we draw the line between being a good delegator (empowering employees) and actually shirking one’s duties?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>A recent example is Barack Obama’s dealing with the terrorist in the failed Detroit airline bombing. His laid-back style of leadership was ineffective in this instance. He felt like he had the right people in place and that they would do their respective jobs. I agree that you have to be a delegator when in a position of top-level leadership. However, in this situation, it took Obama 3 days to respond to the failed attack. As more evidence came in, he realized it was a terrorist attack and that his intelligence groups had many signals of the forthcoming attack. His own internal investigation showed a lack of intelligence sharing. For example, the father of the attacker tried to inform U.S. security about his son. This demonstrated some misplaced trust and possibly some misplaced delegation or empowerment.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How has your leadership style changed over the years?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>It probably took 8 years to implement a successful delegating leadership style. When I came to K-State in 1986, the mantra was “If it’s good for my department, then it’s good for the university or if it’s good for my college, then it’s good for the university.” This did not provide a good culture for delegation, with everyone out for themselves. I had to initially use more of a telling, followed by a selling leadership style. It took 8 to 10 years to get people to say, “If it’s good for K-State, we’ll do it; if it’s not good for K-State, then let’s not.” We worked hard to develop that kind of a mind-set and now it’s engrained in the K-State culture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>You undoubtedly learned a lot about leadership styles during your time in politics. How did your career in Minnesota politics influence your vision for being a successful university president?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>My background in Minnesota politics has had a great influence on my 23 years as K-State president. I learned a lot from watching such Minnesota political figures as Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who was a tireless campaigner, the “Happy Warrior.” I have a funny Hubert Humphrey story to share. Lorne Greene, best known as Ben of <italic>Bonanza</italic> fame, was a supporter of Humphrey’s attempt to be president. Greene would travel with Humphrey on his speech tours. Humphrey was so confident that he was willing to take live call-in questions on TV, which not everyone was willing to do at that time. Well, as luck would have it, Greene couldn’t make it one day, and I got a call to fill in for him. Here’s where my confidence kicks in. I had never done anything like this, but I said, “why not” and went to the TV station for the interview. With 10 minutes to go before going on live TV, I noticed that the zipper to my pants was broken. I asked around to see if someone had an extra zipper or safety pins. When Humphrey hears about this, he finds it quite humorous, which on hindsight it was. Anyway, I did get four safety pins and the show went on!</p>
<p>Well, I did a nice job and Humphrey wanted me to continue on the tour. I said “sure” and got on his plane to fly to the next location. Then I got to thinking that I still have this pair of pants with a broken zipper and no spare pair for the next interview. I asked Humphrey if he happened to have an extra pair of slacks that I could wear. Here’s this guy who missed being president of the United States by one vote per precinct and he gets me a brand new pair of slacks to try on. God! they fit perfectly. So, I got to thinking, if the slacks fit, maybe the coat will also. So I asked Humphrey about borrowing a sport coat and he loaned me his whole outfit! Well, we did three more shows and Humphrey’s outfit fit me perfectly; we were the same size. So at the end of the night we go and have a hamburger in his room. This might show a little chutzpah on my part but I said, “Senator, I’ve done such a good job for you. Would you mind if I keep this outfit?” and he said, “You go ahead, it’s yours.” Hubert Humphrey was a nice man.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Great story! Getting back to the Situational Leadership Model, a delegating style only works if the maturity level of the subordinates is high (they are both ready and willing to complete the task). Over the years, you have made both good and bad choices in the hiring of key subordinates. What personal qualities most influenced your hiring decisions?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Well I’m not saying this would work for everyone but for me it takes about 5 minutes to “size up” an individual. To do this, I intently studied aspects of their personality. Are they optimistic? Are they going to work hard? Are they going to be a team player?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>You mentioned that it doesn’t take you long to “size up” an individual and that you study their personality for attributes like optimism, work ethic, and teamwork skills. Do you have an actual system or process for doing this?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>I always tried to think about how potential hires would fit in to their role at KSU. I look for people that look me in the eye and I also like someone with a firm handshake. A firm handshake is very important to me and it is part of making a positive first impression.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Over the years, many faculty have expressed strong desires to have more of a say in who becomes their department head, dean, etc. Shouldn’t faculty have more say in who actually governs them?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I think the faculty is pivotal in the hiring of deans and department heads as well as other administrative positions. We should mandate that more faculty members be engaged in the search and decision making process. The faculty is the heart and soul of a university—period, amen, goodnight!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Many voters are coming to believe that our politicians should serve with fixed limit terms. Shouldn’t university department heads and deans serve with fixed limit administrative contracts?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>No, I don’t think so. If you had fixed terms for department heads and deans, then you would have to have them for presidents, provosts, and everyone. I don’t think that it would be workable. I trust the faculty to know whether an administrator is doing an effective job. As long as there are periodic reviews of these positions, which there are, then term limits are not needed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Well, it seems that too many faculty members go into administration for the wrong reasons. In any event, there sure are a lot of poor department heads and deans!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, a lot of them don’t know what they are doing. As I think back, in addition to my own role in failed situations, it was the failure to make good hiring choices that led to the greatest problems.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>All too often the hiring process in higher education becomes grossly confounded by ego. When administrators of modest talent are offered the opportunity to hire people better than they are (at whatever the relevant task), all too often they become intimidated, lose confidence, start to micromanage, and make bad decisions.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Yes, that is both accurate and unfortunate. You know, when all is said and done, it takes a very strong-minded individual to hire subordinates who are brighter, more talented than they are. However, that is what the most effective leaders have to be willing to do in order for their organization to prosper.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Let’s transition to a topic of interest to many readers of the <italic>Journal of Management Inquiry</italic>: collegiate sports. Collegiate sports constitute a multibillion dollar industry. With this fortune and fame come a number of criticisms. Is the current economic downturn, with the significant cuts facing many colleges and universities, the necessary signal that it is well past time to reconsider the role of big-time college athletics in fulfilling the core mission of teaching and research?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. There is no doubt big-time college athletics has become the tail that wags the dog and a corruptive force. This is true for any Bowl Championship Series (BCS) university. But, any potential change has nothing to do with the state of the economy. Let me explain why this is so. Our graduates, I’m talking about our best and brightest, lawyers, CEOs, they turn to the sports page first with their morning coffee. They want to see how Notre Dame did in football and basketball and Texas and UCLA and USC and Michigan and KU and K-State. The plain truth is that is what they are most interested in. It’s ridiculous, but they are most interested in their athletic teams. Let me give you an example. If you took a thousand of the top alums at any Big 12 universities and you said to them, “Name the 4 people that you think are most important at your university.” The most important would be the football coach, second would be the men’s basketball coach, third would be the president of the university, and fourth would be the athletic director. After that, no one cares who the college of engineering dean is; they don’t even know unless they are a graduate of that college. So it truly is the tail that wags the dog. And, I agree, it is totally ridiculous.</p>
</speech>

<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How do you respond to those of us who find it grossly unfair that high profile men’s football and basketball coaches are often paid salaries that equal the combined salaries of 40 to 50 assistant professors? When you consider the stated mission of a university is to teach and do research, is a coach’s salary worth the equivalent of 50 professors?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Outrageous! truly outrageous. High-profile football coaches typically have multiple million dollar contracts and they still complain! Assistant coaches make more money than any faculty member at many schools, including K-State. An assistant basketball coach at KSU made more than me and it’s outrageous. The reason for this inequity is called the law of supply and demand. It’s the free market, what the market will bear. The reason they are so highly paid is because our graduates want to win. It’s that simple. That’s all there is to it. I mean, Alabama coach Nick Saban has a US$40 million dollar multiyear contract for goodness sake!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer Note:</speaker>
<p>President Wefald is correct that an assistant coach made more than he did as president of K-State. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611427805">Sander (2008)</xref> reported that Dalonte Hill, an assistant basketball coach at KSU, will take home US$420,000 in annual compensation for 4 years. The reason for this largesse was that Mr. Hill had helped steer star basketball recruit Michael Beasley to K-State. After just one season at K-State, Mr. Beasley left to become the NBA’s No. 2 draft pick. Also contained in the Sander article, before coming to K-State, Mr. Hill supposedly made US$70,000 a year as an assistant coach at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>It’s interesting that the free market works so well in the athletic departments of universities, but not so well in academic departments. By that we mean that some high profile faculty members are twice as productive as others, but the law of supply and demand doesn’t appear to have the same effect as it does for high profile coaches.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Following the free market, the best way for faculty to get a pay raise is to go to another school; that’s the best way to get paid more. As president it irritates me to no end to know that there are five or six individuals at K-State, all coaches, who are paid more than I am. When all is said and done, I don’t know how fair that is, but that’s what the market dictates.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What would happen if a school, for example K-State, deemphasized big-time sports?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Plain and simple, it would be a total disaster. First of all, enrollment would plummet; students would flock to schools with big-time programs. K-State would go from 23,000 students to 10,000 students within 10 years. In addition, private donations would disappear and K-State would disappear from the map.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer Note:</speaker>
<p>President Wefald’s opinions are highly consistent with those of many other university presidents. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611427805">Sander (2009b)</xref>, many university presidents at Division I-A schools not only believe that the system has spiraled out of control but also believe that they are powerless to effect change. The consensus of presidents is that they lack the power to challenge the power base composed of boards of regents, university benefactors, and political supporters who want to win above all else. So, in spite of greatly increased costs—the median operating budget in Division I-A athletics departments increased by 46% to US$41 million from 2004 to 2008—university presidents have shown extreme reluctance to scale back athletic expenses.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>As we conduct this interview, a number of newspapers are either in serious financial difficulty or have gone bankrupt and out of business. Two factors seem to be the major cause. First, the opportunity to read the news on the Web for minimal costs has resulted in many readers canceling their print subscriptions. In other words, why pay for something you can get for free! Second, many newspapers (and other forms of the media as well) have moved from merely reporting the news to active attempts to create and shape reader opinion. At the extreme, many newspapers have lost philosophical touch with their mainstream readership: They now focus on trying to create opinion instead of reporting opinion. Universities are facing similar challenges. For example, and especially considering the current recessionary environment, students have the alternative options of corporate-sponsored certificate programs, numerous other online certificate programs, and a variety of alternatives to a traditional degree approach. Given this, what proactive strategies should universities enact so as to not follow the same destructive path of the print media?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>It not an easy challenge. Like many schools, K-State had to cut its budget by 10% for 2009–2010. I think the best strategy is to get K-12 students interested in coming to K-State early on. We are now bringing 8th-grade students from all over Kansas to Manhattan for campus tours. After the visits, we write the students handwritten notes. We never used to do that. Many students want to go away for their college experience. Having a beautifully landscaped campus, with great residence halls are other incentives to help us maintain a steady supply of students. Simply put: No students, no university.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>The topic of diversity is a highly controversial topic, both in higher education and our society in general. How have you approached diversity at KSU in your tenure as president?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Diversity to me means everyone has an equal opportunity for a position. Their credentials should always be the first consideration. Making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity has resulted in an increase in the number of faculty members of color at K-State. We don’t hire based on quotas. Quotas can lead to mediocrity. It is best to hire based on qualifications.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Today’s students are the leaders of tomorrow. What is the role of the university in producing these leaders?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wefald:</speaker>
<p>Universities play a very important role. Classes must be designed to emphasize character and moral, honest behavior. Classes must emphasize personal integrity, leadership, courage, and generate an interest in our youth to do the things that benefit the common good. For instance, some classes are requiring a component of public service. That is good and it will be interesting to see if this makes a difference in helping students, our leaders of tomorrow, in further developing strengths of character. I certainly hope that this is the case as our students are indeed our future.</p>

<title>Concluding Comments</title>
<p>Dr. Wefald accurately notes the important role of character in the education of our students. Wright and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611427805">Wright &amp; Goodstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611427805">Wright &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>) defined character as those interpenetrable and habitual qualities within individuals and applicable to organizations that both constrain and lead them to desire and pursue personal and societal good. The importance of character was recently made very clear to the lead interviewer and his MBA class in Organizational Behavior at KSU. Upon receiving his teaching evaluations for the fall 2009 semester, he immediately noticed that roughly half of the student evaluations had been fraudulently altered. An independent investigation by K-State’s Center for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning confirmed the fraudulent behavior. As each alteration was from a high (<italic>good</italic>) to low (<italic>bad</italic>) evaluation, it was readily apparent that the instructor had no motive. Similarly, interviews with student class members indicated no student wrongdoing.</p>
<p>This example makes quite clear that character is important for <italic>all</italic> university stakeholders: administrators, faculty, and students. Over the last 3 years, the lead interviewer has made the discussion of character a major learning component for his classes. To that end, students fill out the 240-item Values in Action (VIA)-Inventory of Strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611427805">Peterson, Park, &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>). On completion of the questionnaire, students receive feedback regarding their scores on 24 strengths of character, including integrity, gratitude, kindness, bravery, and self-regulation. After receiving their scores, we then engage in a typically spirited exchange on the role of character in the development of more ethical individuals and a more ethical society. The discussion focuses on the students’ reported top five strengths of character. Using focus groups composed of four or five students, I assign the groups the task of identifying the signature strengths or “profiles in character” considered to be most beneficial (their ideal top five strength profile) to become an effective MBA student, manager, accountant, sales/marketing executive, and nurse, among other occupation categories. Some very interesting findings indicate that the actual student profiles are quite different from their proposed or ideal character profiles. For example, students assess social intelligence as being one of the top strengths necessary to be an effective manager, whereas love of learning is assessed as a necessary strength to be a successful MBA student. However, each of these strengths is actually among the least commonly self-reported by the students. Consistent with Dr. Wefald’s admonition for college classes to actively engage our students on the merits of character, we are hopeful that these types of classroom exercises will be instrumental in the further moral development of our students, the businessmen and women of tomorrow.</p>
<p>President Wefald, thank you very much for your time and insights. Your answers should provide the fuel for some interesting discussion for the <italic>Meet the Person</italic> readership of the <italic>Journal of Management Inquiry</italic>.</p>
