<p>Time plays an important role in organizational life. Organizations compete for the shortest “time to market.” Work of teams and individuals is structured by schedules and deadlines, and many employees feel pressed for time, leaving them only a short amount of time for addressing things that really matter on the job – and beyond. Therefore, an outsider to this discipline might expect that time is one of our core topics. Definitively, this is not the case – neither in theory building nor in empirical studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2041386612442079">Fried and Slowik (2004</xref>) described advances in conceptualizing time within organizational research and related fields as “esoteric and far from becoming common knowledge” (p. 405). Despite this rather pessimistic view, organizational scholars have become more and more aware that time should receive more attention in our discipline. During the past two decades, excellent approaches that deal with time in organizational research have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2041386612442079">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2041386612442079">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612442079">Mitchell &amp; James, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2041386612442079">Roe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2041386612442079">Zaheer, Albert, &amp; Zaheer, 1999</xref>) and methodological advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2041386612442079">Ployhart &amp; Vandenberg, 2010</xref>) make it easier to adequately incorporate time in empirical studies.</p>
<p>These developments help building and refining theory in organizational research by taking temporal aspects explicitly into account. In the main part of this contribution I will describe four predominant ways of how time can be incorporated in organizational research. Subsequently, I will give examples of recent advancements in implementing a temporal perspective in organizational research. By doing so, I argue that our field can gain a lot by paying more attention to time issues and that ultimately, future theoretical work in organizational research should be envisioned as contributing to our understanding of time in organizational life.</p>
<sec id="section1-2041386612442079">
<title>Temporal perspectives in organizational research</title>
<p>Adopting a temporal perspective in organizational research can mean at least four different things: (1) studying time-related constructs, (2) investigating time-sensitive processes, (3) specifying adequate time lags (i.e., addressing the question of “when things happen;” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612442079">Mitchell &amp; James, 2001</xref>, p. 530), and (4) taking the temporal context into account. In the following paragraphs, I will explain these four issues in more detail.</p>
<sec id="section2-2041386612442079">
<title>Time-related constructs</title>
<p>One very straightforward way to incorporate time in theorizing within organizational research is the study of time-related constructs. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2041386612442079">Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, and Tushman (2001</xref>) mentioned constructs such as an individual’s time urgency or time perspective. One can also think of time pressure, time-based work–family conflict, or polychronicity. More recently developed time-related constructs include temporal focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2041386612442079">Shipp, Edwards, &amp; Lambert, 2009</xref>) and team temporal leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2041386612442079">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2041386612442079">Shipp et al. (2009</xref>) defined temporal focus as “the allocation of attention to the past, present, and future” (p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2041386612442079">Mohammed and Nadkarni (2011</xref>) introduced team temporal leadership as “the degree to which team leaders schedule deadline, synchronize team member behaviors, and allocate temporal resources” (p. 489, 490) and demonstrated that it is relevant for team performance.</p>
<p>Research that includes time-related constructs does not necessarily use specific research designs or approaches to analyzing the data. Within this research stream, time is incorporated at the construct level and most often time is at the core of the construct of interest. Temporal aspects with respect to the relation between the constructs are not necessarily addressed when studying time-related constructs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2041386612442079">
<title>Time-sensitive processes</title>
<p>When studying time-sensitive processes temporal processes are in the focus of interest. Such processes refer to patterns of activities (and events) that often follow a specific order or “inner logic.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2041386612442079">Ancona, Okhuysen, et al. (2001)</xref> described such processes when speaking about “mapping activities to time” (p. 515). The core underlying question here is: how do activities occur within the time continuum? The mapping of these activities varies in the degree of complexity ranging from the scheduling of a single activity within the time continuum to the comparison and meshing of several activity maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2041386612442079">Ancona, Okhuysen, et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One particularly interesting process that is highly time-sensitive is “entrainment.” Entrainment describes a process in which individuals or groups change the pace or cycle of their activities so that they are synchronized with other internal or external processes or pacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2041386612442079">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2041386612442079">Kelly, Futoran, &amp; McGrath, 1990</xref>). For instance, a recent study in the area of computer-mediated communication (e.g., responding to electronic messages) showed that people adjust their pace of communication to that of the person they are communicating with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2041386612442079">Campbell, Cothren, &amp; Burg, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2041386612442079">
<title>Time lags</title>
<p>In a well-received article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612442079">Mitchell and James (2001</xref>) have argued that in order to bring more light into causal processes within organizational research, scholars should pay much more attention to the question of “when things happen” (p. 530). Mitchell and James described eight different configurations of how two or three variables might be causally related. For instance, the simplest relationship refers to a situation where X (at Time 1) causes Y (at Time 2; Configuration 1 in Mitchell &amp; James’ overview). A more complex pattern refers to the situation where X (at Time 1) causes Y (at Time 2) which in turn causes a changed X (ΔX; at Time 3) which causes a changed Y (ΔY; at Time 4; Configuration 6). Mitchell and James argued that in all configural patterns theorists should specify the time lags implied in the models. With respect to Configuration 1, theorists should state not only that X precedes Y, but should also specify when Y happens. Similarly, in Configuration 6, theorists should specify the time lags between Time 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of course, the three time lags do not have to be identical.</p>
<p>Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612442079">Mitchell and James (2001</xref>) did make the point that researchers should not only propose causal relationships, but should also specify how long the processes of interest need to develop. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2041386612442079">Zaheer et al. (1999</xref>) have argued that organizational theory should explicitly spell out the time scale on which phenomena are happening. For instance, these authors explained that factors that contribute to interpersonal trust differ when looking at a short versus a longer time scale. Addressing Mitchell and James’ suggestions poses challenges for the design of empirical studies and theory development alike. With respect to theory development, researchers have to specify the so-called equilibrium condition (How long does it take a variable X to affect Y? How long does it take for a changed Y to become noticeable and observable? How long does it take until Y remains stable – even when X is still present?), and the entropic period (When does Y start to change again? When does Y wear off?).</p>
<p>In most areas of organizational research, answers to these questions are yet to be developed. Things become more complicated by the likely fact that these time lags might not be invariant across all situations and in all organizations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2041386612442079">Zaheer et al. (1999</xref>) have argued, phenomena may mean very different things when looking at different time scales. Moreover, organizations themselves might be actively trying to influence how quickly things happen.</p>

<sec id="section5-2041386612442079">
<title>Temporal context</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2041386612442079">Johns (2006</xref>), temporal context is a “surrogate for environmental stimuli” (p. 392) that is present when a behavior of interest happens and this affects the social and economic relationships around organizational behavior. By addressing the temporal context, researchers specify the time periods for which their propositions hold. The temporal context is often seen as a boundary condition of a theory. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2041386612442079">Whetton (1989</xref>) stated that temporal factors “place limitations on the propositions generated from a theoretical model” (p. 492). However, temporal context may not only point to a theory’s boundary conditions. Describing the temporal context can add depth and specificity to a theory. It can add value by contextualizing basic propositions, that is, by specifying <italic>when</italic> what will happen and how hypothesized processes might differ between various temporal contexts.</p>
<p>Temporal context can have various layers, including the broader historical context, the economic context, the temporal context of the organization and of the broader organizational setting, as well as the temporal context of the team and of the individual.</p>
<p>With respect to historical context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2041386612442079">Johns (2006</xref>) provided some examples of how the sign of the relationship between strikes and absenteeism changed over time. Also, research related to societal and economic changes in Eastern Europe during the eighties and nineties of the last century illustrate that the historical context can have an enormous impact on processes within organizations and that knowledge of the historical context is crucial for understanding organizational phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2041386612442079">Frese, Kring, Soose, &amp; Zempel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2041386612442079">Pearce, Branyiczki, &amp; Bakacsi, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The economic time context refers to the specific temporal phases within the ups and downs of business cycles. Whereas the economic time context is of major interest in other disciplines (e.g., economics), it has gained relatively little research attention in micro-level approaches within organizational research. Noteworthy exceptions include research on employee turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2041386612442079">Gerhart, 1990</xref>), absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2041386612442079">Shoss &amp; Penney, in press</xref>), and career-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2041386612442079">Bidwell &amp; Briscoe, 2010</xref>). Economic time might play a role for many more phenomena of interest to organizational researchers, such as people’s optimism and regulatory focus, as well as the association between optimism or regulatory focus and behavior.</p>
<p>The temporal context of an organization refers to processes and events happening before (or at the present moment), within the organization or the broader organizational setting. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2041386612442079">Ancona, Goodman, et al. (2001)</xref> described technology implementations in two organizations with different temporal contexts, one in which at the same time other organizational change processes were taking place, and one in which the new technology system was introduced during a peak period of heavy workload. Along with other factors, these two distinct temporal contexts offered insights into the success factors during technology implementation. With respect to broader organizational settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2041386612442079">Soda, Usai, and Zaheer (2004</xref>) examined past and present network structures in the Italian television production industry and their relevance for performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Within research on teams, quite some attention has been paid to the temporal context – although not to the extent that would be desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2041386612442079">McGrath &amp; Tschan, 2007</xref>). For instance, a number of studies have addressed the question of how the effect of team diversity changes over time. However, results remain inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2041386612442079">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>), suggesting that more systematic theorizing about time is needed.</p>
<p>Finally, individuals have their own temporal contexts. It is a common-sense assumption that our past experiences have at least some influence on our present thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Importantly, there is ample evidence from empirical research that life events have an effect on individuals’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2041386612442079">Luhmann, Hofmann, Eid, &amp; Lucas, 2012</xref>). Moreover, stress research has documented that people who have experienced major life events show decreased cardiovascular reactivity to more acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2041386612442079">Chida &amp; Hamer, 2008</xref>), illustrating that earlier events affect the unfolding of momentary processes.</p>
<p>Overall, these examples illustrate that the temporal context can have an enormous impact on organizational processes, both with respect to mean levels of core variables and to associations between variables. Taking the temporal context into account when specifying (and testing) relations between variables promises a much deeper insight into what is happening in organizations during specific times.</p>

<title>Recent developments</title>
<p>Particularly at the turn of the millennium insightful papers on time in organizational research behavior have been published (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2041386612442079">Ancona, Goodman, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2041386612442079">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612442079">Mitchell &amp; James, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2041386612442079">Zaheer et al., 1999</xref>). It seems that the calls for greater attention to time issues have not remained unheard. For instance, new constructs related to time have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2041386612442079">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2041386612442079">Shipp et al., 2009</xref>), or refined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2041386612442079">Gevers, Rutte, &amp; van Eerde, 2006</xref>). Moreover, theoretical contributions have been developed in which time issues play a core role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2041386612442079">Crossan, Cunha, Vera, and Cunha (2005</xref>) presented a model of organizational improvisation in which they differentiated between clock time versus event time and between a linear perspective on time versus a cyclical perspective on time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2041386612442079">Steel and König (2006</xref>) proposed Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT) as an integrative theoretical framework in which they proposed that time plays an important role in motivational processes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of very promising attempts have been made in which researchers added an explicit time perspective to existing theoretical frameworks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2041386612442079">Fried and Slowik (2004</xref>) discussed time issues within goal-setting theory and demonstrated that paying explicit attention to time issues deepens our understanding of goal setting and goal striving processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2041386612442079">Standifer and Bluedorn (2006</xref>) extended earlier work on shared mental models in teams in which they now proposed that it is important that team members share temporal features of their mental models, particularly elements related to entrainment. In other words, teams should have a shared understanding of pace, time cycles, and time orientation. Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2041386612442079">Shipp and Jansen (2011</xref>) conceptualized time within “fit theory”. They proposed that individuals make sense of current experiences by creating “fit narratives” (p. 77) that include retrospected, concurrent, and anticipated fit perceptions. These retrospections or anticipations of fit may directly influence current attitudes and behaviors or may influence them via temporal comparison processes that relate current fit perceptions to retrospected and anticipated fit. These three examples illustrate that there is substantial “room” in existing theoretical frameworks to incorporate a temporal perspective and that existing theories can gain tremendously when making issues related to time more explicit.</p>
<p>Moreover, when not a central part of the conceptual work, time issues increasingly seem to find their way into theory papers. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2041386612442079">Rupp (2011</xref>) argued that time should be incorporated into the study of organizational justice. Timing issues are also crucial in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386612442079">George’s (2011)</xref> dual-tuning perspective on positive and negative affect. Specifically, George suggested that work tasks or dyadic relations that elicit positive emotions also elicit negative emotions – but at different times. Thus, time is essential in the dual-tuning perspective. Another way to stress the time perspective in theory development was followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2041386612442079">Bell and Marentette (2011</xref>). They refined team viability – a construct that itself is closely linked to the notion of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2041386612442079">
<title>What needs to be done?</title>
<p>Overall, we are witnessing increased awareness of time in organizational research. Importantly, time-related issues are now not only discussed in a normative way at a conceptual level, but are incorporated in recent theoretical work as illustrated by the examples given above. This trend is mirrored by recent developments in empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2041386612442079">Chen, Ployhart, Thomas, Anderson, &amp; Bliese, 2011</xref>). Researchers are becoming more and more aware of approaches to data analysis that do address time issues in a more adequate way (Ployhart &amp; Vandenberg, 2011). This development also makes it more attractive to include time issues when developing theory, because testing such a theory becomes more feasible.</p>
<p>In the future, researchers should continue along this road when developing and refining theory. Thus, we need theoretical work that explicitly addresses time issues. This can take several forms. For instance, we need work that puts time in focus by specifying new temporal constructs and describing time-sensitive processes and the interrelations between such processes. Moreover, and maybe this is even more important, we also need to make time an essential part of theoretical work that does not focus on time per se. Of course, this might not always be feasible, but neglecting time should become the exception rather than the norm – and researchers might need good arguments to explain why they neglect time issues. Finally, the four time-related topics described here (time-related constructs, time-sensitive processes, time lags, and temporal contexts) should not be discussed in isolation. For example, time-sensitive processes might differ from one temporal context to another. Time lags are not fixed entities, but might also differ from one context to the other and might even be actively influenced by people and groups that are influential within an organization. Furthermore, time lags might not be invariant across historical times. In our fast-paced times, some psychologically relevant processes might accelerate compared to earlier times.</p>
<p>Overall, we need a better understanding of what time really can mean. Until now, time has often been viewed as an abstract, purely quantitative entity. What happens “during time” has often been ignored, even in research that has tried to incorporate a temporal perspective. For example, “time lags” are typically discussed in a quantitative metric. In the future, researchers should pay more attention to the question of what is happening as time passes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2041386612442079">Tesluk and Jacobs (1998</xref>) have suggested that an individual’s work experience – traditionally operationalized as length of time at a job – has quantitative and qualitative components, comprising aspects of amount, time, density, timing, and type. Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2041386612442079">van Knippenberg, De Dreu, and Homan (2004</xref>) have argued that several processes may take place as time passes when team members work together (e.g., change in transactive memory systems, change in various dimensions of fit). Based on these conceptual approaches of Tesluk and Jacobs and of van Knippenberg and his co-workers, one may assume that time does not have a uniform effect on specific outcomes but, contingent on the specific events, activities, and experiences time is “filled with,” the impact of time might differ largely.</p>
<p>Thus, we would move a substantial step forward when attention to time is no longer viewed as “esoteric” and when at least some of the concerns related to temporal issues are “becoming common knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2041386612442079">Fried &amp; Slowik, 2004</xref>, p. 405).</p>
