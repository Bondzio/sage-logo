<body>
<p>In spite of the efforts of school social workers, behavior problems remain a threat to the school success of many middle school students. In fact, public schools in the United States reported a 4.1 percent <italic>increase</italic> in violent crimes between the 1999–2000 to 2007–2008 academic years (National Center for Education Statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468017311435446">NCES], 2009</xref>). In addition, middle school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468017311435446">NCES, 2009</xref>), males, and students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311435446">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010</xref>) often have higher rates of reported behavior problems at school than their counterparts. Understanding the causes of behavior problems, as well as the likelihood of students with different gender-race characteristics being exposed to those causes, may help school social workers respond with appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>Practitioners in schools are increasingly encouraged to use evidence-based programs to address the mental health and behavioral problems evidenced by students. Although there are limits to the feasibility and availability of evidence-based programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468017311435446">Powers, Bowen, &amp; Bowen, 2010</xref>) and questions about the efficacy of many programs (Powers, Bowen, Webber, &amp; Bowen, in press), helping school social workers identify and implement programs whose effects are supported by research remains preferable to relying on ‘authority-based’ practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311435446">Gambrill, 2011</xref>). The success of evidence-based programs and practices, however, also relies on the appropriate matching of programs to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468017311435446">Thyer &amp; Myers, 2011</xref>). Key to appropriate matching is a thorough understanding of the social environmental contributors to the behavior problems in individual students. For example, non-compliant behavior that derives from a sense of physical danger in a setting requires a different intervention approach than disruptive school behavior that stems from an association with violent peers.</p>
<p>Individual characteristics that contribute to optimal matching of students to interventions include both social environmental experiences and demographic characteristics that may be associated with those experiences. Although studies have shown that prevention and intervention efforts work better for some students than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311435446">Fraser, Richman, Galinsky, &amp; Day, 2009</xref>), few assessment tools help practitioners identify the most appropriate interventions for their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311435446">Gordon, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468017311435446">Powers, Bowen, &amp; Rose, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study furthers the ability of school-based social workers to understand and, therefore, appropriately address potential sources of behavior problems in middle school students. The theoretical framework of general strain theory (GST) is coupled with the statistical methodology of latent class analysis (LCA) to create a typology of social environmental exposures that contribute to problem behaviors. The patterns of exposure represented in the typology are then examined in terms of gender-race characteristics. Finally, practitioners are referred to online resources that link the patterns to appropriate evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1468017311435446"><title>School behavior problems</title>
<p>The term <italic>school behavior problem</italic> refers to a specific action that is contrary to rules and regulations established by school professionals and that, when detected, receives a school sanction. Such behaviors include actions such as getting into fights with peers or cutting class. This definition is based on both mental health (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311435446">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and criminological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311435446">Hirschi, 2002</xref>) literature.</p>
<p>Research has shown an association between school behavior problems and a number of adverse consequences for students and others. For example, students with behavior problems have more academic difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311435446">Bowen, Rose, &amp; Glennie, 2009</xref>) and increased likelihood of dropping out of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1468017311435446">Viljoen, O’Neill, &amp; Sidhu, 2005</xref>). The lack of a high school education places individuals at a deficit both in terms of finding a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017311435446">Leckman, 1995</xref>) and earning an income adequate to support a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311435446">Bowen, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, students’ behavior problems create challenges for other students by reducing the amount of time teachers can spend with other students, thereby, decreasing opportunities for learning among other students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468017311435446">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec2-1468017311435446"><title>General strain theory</title>
<p>GST provides a useful framework for developing a typology of youths’ social environment and the environment’s contribution to school behavior problems. First, it is consistent with social work’s focus on the influence of the social ecology in youth development and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311435446">Fraser, 2004</xref>). Second, it specifies the mechanisms by which individuals’ social experiences affect their behavior. Specifically, GST posits that aversive experiences in the social environment (e.g. witnessing violence) result in negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311435446">Agnew, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311435446">1992</xref>). The aversive experiences are called ‘strain’. To manage the negative feelings caused by strain, individuals engage in coping strategies that range from legitimate to delinquent behaviors. Greater strain increases the chances of maladaptive coping strategies such as fighting with peers.</p>
<p>The type of strain that has received the most attention and is most familiar to social workers is <italic>experienced strain.</italic> Experienced strain includes direct personal involvement in aversive situations, such as violence or abuse, discrimination, social exclusion, or unfair treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>). Social workers are generally attuned to these sources of strain and help school staff support students who experience them. However, a growing number of studies have shown that students also react negatively to other types of strain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311435446">Botchkovar, Tittle, &amp; Antonaccio, 2009</xref>). Two more recently elaborated types of strain that can increase the depth of social workers’ understanding of student experiences in the social environment are <italic>vicarious</italic> and <italic>anticipated strain</italic>.</p>
<p>Unlike experienced strain, <italic>vicarious strain</italic> refers to a person hearing about or witnessing the strains of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>). Agnew has theorized that vicarious strain is most severe when the victim of strain is someone emotionally or physically close to the adolescent or is a member of a group to which the adolescent belongs. <italic>Anticipated strain</italic> refers to an individual’s expectation that strain will be experienced or will continue to be experienced in the future. A small but growing number of studies have shown that youths are exposed to vicarious neighborhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311435446">Flannery, Singer, &amp; Wester, 2001</xref>), school (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311435446">Kort-Butler, 2010</xref>), and peer (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311435446">Baron, 2009</xref>) strain as well as anticipated neighborhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311435446">Allison, Adalf, &amp; Mates, 1997</xref>) and school (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311435446">Kort-Butler, 2010</xref>) strain.</p>
<p>GST posits that vicarious and anticipated strain, as well as being distinctive constructs, may be interrelated with each other and with experienced strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>). As such, each type of strain may influence the other types. For example, a vicarious strain such as witnessing school violence may enhance an individual’s anticipated strain (i.e. fear of future personal victimization at school). Few studies have tested the inter-relationships of vicarious and anticipated strain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311435446"><title>Relationship of strain to behavior problems</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311435446">Kort-Butler (2010)</xref> has found in a nationally representative sample that vicarious and anticipated strain are associated with behavior problems; however, support for the relationship between these strains and problem behaviors is found largely outside of the GST literature itself (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1468017311435446">Stewart, Simons, &amp; Conger, 2002</xref>). Using school-based samples, several studies have shown an association between aversive neighborhood conditions and behavior problems at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311435446">Bowen, Bowen, &amp; Ware, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311435446">Brunson &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468017311435446">Stewart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468017311435446">Stewart &amp; Simons, 2010</xref>). Such studies, however, have not explicitly examined anticipated strain or used the terminology of GST.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017311435446"><title>Gender differences in strain</title>
<p>GST includes theoretical explanations for gender differences in behavior problems. For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311435446">Broidy and Agnew (1997)</xref>, males and females experience different types of strain and respond differently to strain. Specifically, the strains males experience are more likely to result in delinquency (e.g. they may occur in contexts that are conducive to delinquency) than the strains females encounter. Further, males are more likely to externalize strain (e.g. respond with anger), whereas females are more likely to internalize strain (e.g. experience depression). Last, males are less likely than females to respond to strain using positive coping strategies.</p>
<p>Studies of gender differences in strain have examined the influence of experienced strain on delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311435446">Baron, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311435446">Broidy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311435446">Hay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017311435446">Hoffmann &amp; Su, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311435446">Jang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435446">Kaufman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017311435446">Mazerolle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468017311435446">Piquero &amp; Sealock, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311435446">Broidy (2001)</xref>, for example, found females less likely to respond to experienced strain with delinquent acts than males among a sample of college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311435446">Hay (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468017311435446">Piquero and Sealock (2004)</xref> have shown similar results in samples of juvenile delinquents. Although studies have not explicitly focused on vicarious or anticipated strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>), they suggest that there may also be gender differences in responses to anticipated and vicarious strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311435446">Bowen &amp; Chapman, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468017311435446"><title>Racial differences in strain</title>
<p>GST has also attempted to explain racial differences in delinquency. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311435446">Kaufman, Rebellion, Thaxon, and Agnew (2008)</xref> have argued that Blacks are exposed to more strains and different types of strain than Whites. Specifically, these authors have contended that Blacks encounter more economic, family, educational, criminal victimization, discrimination, and community strain than Whites. Further, because of social conditions, Blacks may be more likely to experience elevated negative emotions due to exposure to strain, which may increase their likelihood of engaging in delinquency.</p>
<p>Several empirical studies suggest the need for exploring racial differences in the study of strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311435446">Jang &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468017311435446">Simons, Chen, Stewart, &amp; Brody, 2003</xref>). Such studies tend to use race-specific samples. Simons and colleagues, for example, used data collected from 10- to 12-year-old Black adolescents and their caregivers. Their study found that discrimination was positively associated with delinquent behaviors.</p>
<p>In sum, constructs from GST and research related to strain help explain behavior problems among youths and behavioral differences among gender and racial groups. Although social workers are familiar with experienced strain and its negative consequences on youth, understanding the potential impact of vicarious and anticipated strain on youth behavior can improve social workers ability to support students appropriately. Finally, being aware of which students are more or less likely to be affected by patterns of vicarious and anticipated strain can help social workers assess and match students to relevant interventions more efficiently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017311435446"><title>Latent class analysis</title>
<p>Latent class analysis (LCA) is a person-centered modeling procedure used to develop typologies. A typology is a tool that provides practitioners with greater understanding of how students might fall into groups with similar experiences. A typology identifies subpopulations within a population or sample based on carefully selected, theoretically relevant, observed variables. By specifying the nature of commonly shared experiences, a typology also equips practitioners to understand problematic student behaviors and to link students to appropriate interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311435446"><title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Using LCA and based on GST and research on strain, the current study used three indicators of vicarious strain in the social environment and two indicators of anticipated strain to develop a typology. Specifically, we included vicarious neighborhood, school, and peer strain, as well as anticipated neighborhood and school strain. The following hypotheses were tested:
<list id="list1-1468017311435446" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Distinct patterns of exposure to vicarious and anticipated strain exist among middle school youths.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. Black and White female and male youths will experience different patterns of strain. We expected that Black males would be most likely to be in the subgroup reporting the most strain, whereas White females would be most likely to be in the subgroup reporting the least strain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3. Patterns of exposure to vicarious and anticipated strain among youths will be predictive of behavior problems. Specifically, the subgroup with the highest level of strain will report the most behavior problems.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<sec id="sec8-1468017311435446" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec9-1468017311435446"><title>Dataset</title>
<p>Between September 2001 and July 2005, 37,354 middle and high school students in 318 schools from six states (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia) completed the School Success Profile (SSP). The SSP, a self-administered survey for middle and high school students, has repeatedly demonstrated strong reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311435446">Bowen, Rose, &amp; Bowen, 2005</xref>). An eco-interactional developmental model of school persistence frames the SSP, which focuses attention on the social environmental antecedents to school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311435446">Bowen &amp; Richman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Cases missing more than 5 percent of the SSP variables were removed from the data set before it was made publicly available, resulting in a non probability sample of 20,749 high school and middle school cases. The procedures of the current study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<italic>.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468017311435446"><title>Sample</title>
<p>The current study used data from 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-grade students who reported Black or White heritage (<italic>N</italic> = 12,209). Given the potential for erroneous results caused by missing data, we first conducted a missing data analysis. The data set comprised 11,903 cases with complete data and 306 cases (2.6%) with at least one missing value. Males [χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 11,903) = 74.68; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01] and Blacks [χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 11,903) = 10.69; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01] had significantly more missing data than other youths. Such results suggest that missing data may be missing at random. Because scholars state that researchers may apply listwise deletion when sample sizes are large and the percentage of missing values is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311435446">Acock, 2005</xref>), listwise deletion was used. The final sample had 11,222 cases with complete data. We next drew three random subsamples from the 11,222 cases with complete data. One sample (<italic>n</italic> = 3728) served as the primary analysis sample, and the other two served as validation samples (<italic>n</italic> = 3699; <italic>n</italic> = 3795). The primary sample comprised 24.5 percent Black males, 28.1 percent Black females, 23.4 percent White males, and 24 percent White females. The two validation samples had similar demographic compositions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468017311435446"><title>Measures</title>
<p>Gender and race were included in the latent class analysis, which were combined into one variable: 0 = White male; 1 = Black male; 2 = Black female; 3 = White female.</p>
<p>The vicarious neighborhood strain index was based on six items from the SSP. Respondents recalled the past 30 days and indicated ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to six statements: a) someone in your neighborhood was robbed or mugged; b) you heard gunshots; c) you saw someone selling illegal drugs; d) a person was murdered; e) a fight broke out between two gangs; and f) you saw someone threatened with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club. Scores were generated by counting ‘yes’ responses and dividing the sum by 6. Scores were then dichotomized at the mean (<italic>M</italic> = .15) and assigned values of 0 or 1, with 1 indicating high vicarious neighborhood strain.</p>
<p>The vicarious school strain index was based on nine items from the SSP. Respondents were asked to rate the magnitude of the following school-related problems: a) fights among students; b) destruction of school property; c) student use of alcohol; d) student use of illegal drugs; e) students carrying weapons; f) students physically abusing teachers (hitting, pushing); g) students verbally abusing teachers (yelling, name calling); h) racial tension; and i) gang fights. Response options on the SSP were on a three-point scale (1 = not a problem at all, 2 = a little problem, 3 = a big problem). Composite scores were generated by summing the scores and dividing the sum by 9. Scores were then dichotomized at the mean (<italic>M</italic> = .44) and given values of 0 or 1, with 1 indicating high vicarious school strain.</p>
<p>The vicarious peer strain composite scale was based on nine items from the SSP (α = .89). Respondents reported how well the following statements described them: a) I have peers who get into trouble with the police; b) I have peers who use drugs; c) I have peers who belong to gangs; d) I have peers who drink alcoholic beverages; e) I have peers who often cut class; f) I have peers who carry a weapon such as a knife, gun, or club; g) I have peers who make bad grades in school; h) I have peers who get into trouble at school; and i) I have peers who probably will not graduate from high school. Response options on the SSP were on a three-point scale (1 = not like me, 2 = a little like me, 3 = a lot like me). Composite scores were generated by summing the scores and dividing the sum by 9. Scores were then dichotomized at the mean (<italic>M</italic> = .19) and assigned values of 0 or 1, with 1 representing high vicarious peer strain.</p>
<p>The anticipated neighborhood strain score was based on one SSP question: how often are you afraid someone will hurt or bother you on the way to or from school? Response options on the SSP were on a three-point scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often). Response options were dichotomized, with 0 indicating never and values of 1 indicating responses of ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ and representing high anticipated neighborhood strain. Overall, 25.9 percent of the sample had a 1.</p>
<p>The anticipated school strain score was based on one SSP question: how often are you afraid that someone will hurt or bother you at school? Response options on the SSP were on a three-point scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often). Response options were dichotomized, with 0 indicating never and values of 1 indicating responses of ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ and representing high anticipated school strain. Overall, 31.2 percent of the sample had a 1.</p>
<p>The behavior problem index was based on eight items from the SSP. Respondents were asked to indicate during the past 30 days, how often the following happened: a) I cut at least one class; b) I cut the entire school day; c) I showed up for school late (unexcused); d) I was sent out of class because I misbehaved; e) my parent(s)/guardian(s) received a warning about my attendance, grades or behavior; f) I got in a physical fight with another student; (g) I was put on in-school suspension; and (h) I was given an out-of-school suspension. Response options on the SSP were on a three-point scale (1 = never; 2 = once or twice, 3 = more than twice). Composite scores were generated by summing the scores, subtracting the sum from 8, dividing this number by 16, and then multiplying this number by 100. Thus, results are reported as a percent of the maximum score, with higher scores representing more behavior problems.</p>

<p>Using SPSS version 14.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468017311435446">SPSS, Inc., 2005</xref>) and the primary sample, we obtained descriptive statistics, assessed the reliability, determined cut-points for the three vicarious strain composites, and determined the prevalence of vicarious and anticipated strain across the four gender-race categories examined. Latent class analysis (LCA) with MPlus version 3.11 was used to develop the typology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2004</xref>). The three vicarious strain indicators and two anticipated strain indicators were submitted to the LCA. We replicated the typology analysis using the two secondary random samples, and then validated the typology by testing its relationship to behavior problems. A one-way ANOVA, conducted in SPSS 14.0 (SPSS, Inc.), was used to test for significant relationships between the classes and behavior problems.</p>
<p>Latent class analysis (LCA) is a special case of person-centered mixture modeling used to develop typologies. LCA identifies subpopulations of a population or sample based on carefully selected indicator variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468017311435446">Muthén, 2001</xref>; Muthén &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017311435446">Muthén, 1998–2004</xref>a). Specifically, LCA assigns individuals into latent classes based on observed categorical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017311435446">Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry, 1968</xref>). LCA also provides information about class membership including the size and nature of each class and the average likelihood of individuals being assigned to each class given their observed scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311435446">Bowen, Lee, &amp; Weller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468017311435446">Weden &amp; Zabin, 2005</xref>), we sought the class solution with the fewest number of classes that adequately explained the relationships among observed indicator variables. The best model was selected by first developing a measurement model and then a covariate model. To develop the measurement model, we submitted the indicators to an unrestricted LCA with a one-class solution. Unrestricted LCA allows for an examination of the natural structure underlining the probabilities of class solutions to emerge rather than imposing constraints on the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311435446">Böckenholt &amp; Böckenholt, 1990</xref>). We then added classes until the best-fitting model was identified based on pre-established fit criteria.</p>
<p>Scholars have debated the best ways to assess model fit in LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468017311435446">McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017311435446">Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). In general, however, researchers commonly have reported three statistical criteria related to fit: Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), average latent class posterior probabilities, and the number or percent of subjects in the smallest class solution. The present study applied each of these criteria.</p>
<p>BIC values provide information on relative fit across models. The BIC uses maximum likelihood estimation to assess how well the model fits the data and ‘rewards’ model parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017311435446">Kuah, 2004</xref>). The lower the BIC value, the better the model relative to other models. Some scholars have reported that the BIC is one of the more reliable indicators of model fit in LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017311435446">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468017311435446">Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Average latent class probabilities indicate the average probability of correctly predicting class membership for individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>). A model with good fit has diagonal probability matrix elements close to 1.0 and off diagonal elements close to 0. Some scholars recommend seeking diagonal elements greater than .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311435446">Bowen et al., 2007</xref>), whereas other researchers report that diagonal elements greater than .80 are acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468017311435446">Weden &amp; Zabin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Class size has also been used to evaluate LCA models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017311435446">Muthén (1998–2004)</xref> warned against generating classes with fewer than 50 cases; however, other studies have used class solutions with smaller classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468017311435446">Oxford et al., 2005</xref>). Classes with less than 5 percent of the sample in the smallest class are also discouraged; however, this criterion may be problematic when smaller groups are expected based on theory and epidemiology.</p>
<p>After a measurement model was selected based on statistical criteria, covariates were added to the model. The inclusion of covariates in LCA does not alter the conditional probabilities of the latent classes, but it allows for the examination of the distributions of individuals from groups across classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1468017311435446">Vermunt, 1997</xref>). Based on GST, we added our gender-race variable to the model.</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468017311435446">Weden and Zabin (2005)</xref>, we followed a sequence of steps to determine whether to include theoretically relevant covariates in an LCA model. The first step was to run models in which each covariate is regressed on each latent class to detect significant relationships (CR &gt; 1.96). Significant covariates were retained. The second step was to compare the measurement and covariate models using the BIC and the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic. In addition to the BIC, scholars have recommended that the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is appropriate for comparing measurement and covariate models with the same class solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468017311435446">Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2002</xref>). The third step was to identify the model that made most theoretical sense – the measurement or covariate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017311435446">Muthén, 1998–2004</xref>). According to a number of LCA experts, substantive meaning and interpretability of the model may supersede statistical criteria for the selection of the final model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311435446">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468017311435446">O’Connor &amp; Colder, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we also referred to GST to guide selection of the final model. To establish the replicability of the typology findings, each step described above was repeated using the second and third random samples.</p>
<p>Finally, we validated the model by examining whether classes were associated as predicted by GST with self-reported behavior problems. One-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc comparisons was used to determine if members of classes with higher strain reported significantly higher levels of problem behavior.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311435446">Table 1</xref>, using the primary sample, a four-class solution emerged as the best model based on the BIC. The lowest average latent class posterior probability, however, indicated that a two-class solution was best. None of the obtained class solutions violated the minimum class size criterion requirements. Given the preference for the BIC observed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017311435446">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>) and the need to use the BIC to compare the measurement and covariate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468017311435446">Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2002</xref>), we determined that the four-class measurement model was the best. Further, the four-class model is supported by recent substantive advancements in GST, which are discussed later in the discussion section.

<p>To create a covariate model, still using the primary sample and the four-class measurement model, covariates were regressed on each class. Because the gender-race combinations were significantly associated with each class, each gender-race combination term was retained in the model. Next the fit statistics from the measurement and covariate model were compared. The BIC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311435446">Table 1</xref>) and the likelihood ratio chi-square (ΔL<sup>2 </sup>= 11335.59 − 11227.00, Δd.f. = 9, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.001) indicated that the covariate model fit the data better than the measurement model.</p>
<p>After deciding that the four-class covariate model was the best model based on statistical criteria, we then determined that the final model also made most theoretical sense because, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew (2002)</xref>, youths in the sample were exposed to different types of strain and, as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311435446">Broidy and Agnew (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311435446">Kaufman et al.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017311435446">Figure 1</xref> presents the vicarious and anticipated strain characteristics of each class based on the primary sample. The five strain indicator variables are along the x-axis and the probabilities of class membership are plotted on the y-axis. The probability of class membership represents the average probability that members in a class reported high strain scores (indicator variable = 1). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017311435446">Figure 1</xref> shows that youths in the High Strain Class (HSC) had an 80 percent probability of reporting high strain scores on the vicarious neighborhood strain indicator. The figure also shows significant differences in average probabilities among classes. For example, we see that members of the HSC (80%) had a significantly higher probability of reporting vicarious neighborhood strain than youths in the Low Strain Class (LSC) (24%). The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017311435446">Figure 1</xref> indicates the percentage of the sample that was assigned to each class.

<p>The figure shows that members of the HSC had high strain scores and a 100 percent probability of reporting anticipated neighborhood strain. The Vicarious Strain Class (VSC) was distinguished by high probability of high vicarious strain scores; and it comprised 25.1 percent of the sample. In contrast to HSC, VSC had low probabilities of high anticipated strain scores, including a probability of 0 percent for high anticipated neighborhood strain scores. The LSC was characterized by low probabilities of high scores on all five strain measures, and it comprised 40 percent of the sample. The Anticipated Strain Class (ASC) was distinguished by a high probability of high anticipated school strain scores (probability of 100%), and it comprised 17.8 percent of the sample. The ASC had a greater likelihood of high anticipated neighborhood strain scores than the VSC and LSC, but a lower probability than the HSC, and relatively low probabilities of high scores on the three vicarious strain measures. The ASC had as high a probability of high scores on anticipated school strain as the VSC.</p>
<p>Gender-race combinations were significantly associated with class membership. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468017311435446">Figure 2</xref> presents the probability of class assignment for each gender-race group. Each bar indicates the percentage of all members of a gender-race demographic group that was found in each class. For example, 4 percent of the Black males in the sample were in the HSC and 33 percent were in the VSC. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468017311435446">Figure 2</xref> also can be interpreted within or across classes. For example, a higher percentage of White females (67%) than Black males (24%) were in the ASC. Further, White females were more likely to be in the ASC than any other class. Conversely, Black males (38%) were more likely to be members of the LSC than any other class, and reported more exposure to the strain of others close to them than other demographic groups (33% of Black sample members are in the VSC compared to less than 20% of each of the other subgroups).

<sec id="sec17-1468017311435446" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to develop a typology of strains that contribute to behavior problems among youths. Based on GST and using LCA, we identified a typology of vicarious and anticipated strain. The typology comprises of four classes: High Strain Class (HSC), Low Strain Class (LSC), Vicarious Strain Class (VSC), and Anticipated Strain Class (ASC). Members of the HSC report, on average, high probabilities of exposure to all five sources of strain, suggesting that one group of youths has an elevated risk of strain exposure. Members of this class would most likely benefit from interventions that address strains in the neighborhood, school, and among peers. The SSP intervention database (Bowen &amp; Bowen, n.d.), an online database that links problem areas revealed in youths’ SSP scores to evidence-based programs, indicates that one such program is the Quantum Opportunities Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017311435446">Lattimore, Mihalic, Grotpeter, &amp; Taggart, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike the HSC, members of the LSC report low probabilities of exposure to five strains, suggesting that these youths are not only exposed to less strain, but also may not benefit from interventions across the multiple strains. Students in the LSC, however, may benefit from universal programs such as All Stars Middle School Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468017311435446">McNeal, Hansen, Harrington, &amp; Giles, 2004</xref>). This comprehensive program aims to decrease substance use among middle school students while simultaneously helping students set goals for the future and develop positive attachments to school.</p>
<p>Students in the VSC report high exposure to vicarious strain, whereas students in the ASC report high exposure to neighborhood and school anticipated strain but not vicarious strain. Students in VSC may benefit from the CASASTART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311435446">Harrell, Cavanah, &amp; Sridharan, 1999</xref>) because youths in this group reported high rates of vicarious neighborhood and school strain and had significantly more behavior problems than the other classes. CASASTART is a community-based program that has shown to positively impact youths’ experiences at school and decrease behavior problems. Youths in the ASC, on the other hand, may benefit most from Positive Action because it uses school and community ‘Kits’ to target specified issues such as school and neighborhood safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017311435446">Flay, Allred, &amp; Ordway, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to developing a typology of strain, we also assessed whether each class varied in gender-race combinations. Indeed, Black and White male and female membership varied across the classes. We found, for example, that White females were significantly more likely than Black males to be members of the ASC, whereas Black males were significantly more likely than White females to be members of the VSC. These results highlight the need to also consider gender-race when selecting interventions. For example, Black males may benefit more from interventions that target decreasing school and neighborhood violence than White females, who may require interventions related to perceptions of safety.</p>
<p>We validated the typology by comparing class membership with reported behavior problems. According to GST, individuals exposed to strain may be more likely to engage in behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2001</xref>). We hypothesized, therefore, that members of the HSC would have an increased likelihood of engaging in behavior problems. Study results partially support this presupposition, in that the HSC had more reported behavior problems than the ASC and LSC. However, the VSC had significantly more behavior problems than any other class. This finding, though not hypothesized, is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311435446">Agnew’s (2001)</xref> argument that vicarious strain may be especially linked with behavior problems. Such results both support GST and indicate the theory needs to expand to explain why VSC reported significantly more behavior problems than the HSC. Nonetheless, individuals in the VSC and HSC may benefit most from interventions that focus on decreasing the occurrence of behavior problems.</p>
<p>In addition to providing recommendations for matching students to specific interventions, results from this study also provide insight into other areas of social work practice. The results indicate that students are exposed to anticipated and vicarious strain. Moreover, exposure to multiple sources of strain – in particular, multiple sources of vicarious strain – is associated with behavior problems. To reduce the occurrence of behavior problems, practitioners may find it helpful to inquire about students’ exposure to such strain and use this knowledge to inform practice. In particular, working with students to develop strategies for reducing or avoiding exposure to sources of strain may yield insightful practice ideas. While inquiring about strain, practitioners should also consider students’ gender and race.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1468017311435446"><title>General strain theory</title>
<p>The findings from the present study provide support for GST and indicate that it requires further elaboration. For example, in addition to being distinctive constructs, GST posits that vicarious and anticipated strain can be interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>). The current study supports this supposition. In the HSC and LSC, probabilities for high scores on the five indicators of strain were either all relatively high or all relatively low. Similarly, two classes had low probabilities of both types of anticipated strain while the other two classes had moderate-to-high probabilities for both types of anticipated strain. Also, regardless of the class, the three types of vicarious strain tended to have similar values – either all relatively high or low. These patterns support GST’s claim that types of strain tend to co-occur, even though they are separate entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>). Further, the results provide support for GST’s assumptions that exposure to strain varies by gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311435446">Broidy &amp; Agnew, 1997</xref>) and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311435446">Kaufman et al., 2008</xref>); however, because GST currently does not provide a comprehensive rationale for differences in exposure to vicarious and anticipated strain by gender-race, further theoretical elaboration is necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1468017311435446"><title>Limitations and strengths</title>
<p>A limitation of the study is that it relied on cross-sectional data that were collected for purposes other than testing strain hypotheses. We cannot make causal inferences based on the results of our cross-sectional analyses. In addition, the study population excluded students not enrolled in school. We could not test some relevant GST hypotheses because of the absence of certain variables in the data set, such as experienced strain. The study also is limited because missing data were not missing completely at random. Nonetheless, the present study provides useful guidelines for practitioners and lays a foundation for future research to explore the influence of vicarious and anticipated strain on delinquency.</p>
<p>Methodological strengths of the study include the availability of a large, school-based sample, and reliable and valid measures. Previous studies of GST have used small and gender- and/or race-specific samples (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468017311435446">Simons et al., 2003</xref>), or have not measured strain well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311435446">Agnew, 1992</xref>). Also, the present study used two subsamples to replicate and validate its findings. Conceptually, this study is strong because it used one of the leading theories of delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2006</xref>), addressed new aspects of GST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435446">Agnew, 2002</xref>), and explored gender-race differences in class membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311435446">Broidy &amp; Agnew, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311435446">Kaufman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec20-1468017311435446"><title>Implications for future research</title>
<p>Future research should expand GST to account for differences in exposure to vicarious and anticipated strain by gender-race combinations. Future research also could test competing hypotheses about which classes of youth are most likely to engage in behavior problems. For example, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311435446">Anderson’s (1999)</xref> concept of <italic>street code</italic>, scholars could argue that anticipated strain has the strongest influence on individuals’ likelihood of engaging in behavior problems as a pre-emptive strategy. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311435446">Agnew (2001)</xref> suggests that vicarious strain is most likely to result in delinquency.</p>
<p>Future research also should replicate and expand on the findings of the current study using a nationally representative sample and include other racial/cultural groups. Studies that include measures of experienced strain are needed to more thoroughly test hypotheses based on GST. Longitudinal studies could elucidate the differential effects of the four classes of strain found in this study on various youth outcomes overtime. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health offers promise as a dataset for replicating and extending the present analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec21-1468017311435446" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We used concepts from GST to identify a typology of vicarious and anticipated strain among adolescents that takes into account gender-race combinations. Our results support tenets of GST and suggest the value of expanding and testing the theory further. In particular, it identifies patterns of exposure to two under-studied sources of strain – anticipated and vicarious strain – and links those patterns to youths’ gender-racial groups. The findings have implications for how social workers approach solutions to behavior problems in schools.</p>
