<abstract>
<p>This article introduces the exploratory-triangulation mixed methods approach to hospitality and tourism research. A specific empirical example of using the exploratory-triangulation design is illustrated. With this approach, hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria for entry-level managerial positions in the college recruiting settings were explored and triangulated with the attributes of hospitality graduating seniors who receive job offers. The advantages and disadvantages of the exploratory-triangulation design are discussed. Considerations are proposed for researchers who plan to adopt the exploratory-triangulation mix methods approach in future studies.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1467358412466669" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The debate among social scientists of using qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods in research studies has great influence in the discipline of hospitality and tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1467358412466669">Mehmetoglu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1467358412466669">Walle, 1997</xref>). As in other academic disciplines such as marketing, economics, and sociology, the positivist paradigm of quantitative method has played a predominate role in hospitality and tourism research over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1467358412466669">Davies, 2003</xref>). While the interpretivist paradigm of qualitative method started to gained more attention from hospitality and tourism researchers in the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1467358412466669">Mehmetoglu, 2004)</xref>, recent scholarly discussion is also devoted to utilizing the mixed methods approach to conduct hospitality, tourism, and leisure research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1467358412466669">Davies, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1467358412466669">Downward and Mearman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1467358412466669">Henderson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1467358412466669">Mason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1467358412466669">Pansiri, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1467358412466669">Johnson et al. (2007)</xref> refer to a mixed methods study as ‘the type of research in which a researcher or team of researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e.g. use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration’ (p. 123). Mixed methods researchers are considered ‘pragmatists’ who believe research approaches should be mixed in the ways that offer the best opportunity for answering complex research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1467358412466669">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1467358412466669">Onwuegbuzie and Leech, 2004)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1467358412466669">Richins (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1467358412466669">Mehmetoglu (2004)</xref> suggest that there are many advantages of utilizing mixed methods in tourism and hospitality research. For example, researchers may be able to use qualitative research to ‘facilitate’ a quantitative study by providing theoretical background, contextual information, or sources for generating hypotheses. Researchers may use a quantitative approach in selecting informants for a qualitative study. By comparing the results drawn from different approaches, mixed methods may produce fresh insight on existing research findings with further detail, or bring in new, deeper, and paradoxical dimensions. As a result, mixed methods can usually enhance the understanding of an issue being studied or provide a more ‘complete’ picture of a phenomenon. In addition, the strengths of a single method may be able to compensate the weaknesses or overlap the strengths of another method and bring greater scope, depth, and power of a research study.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1467358412466669">Creswell and Clark (2007)</xref>, mixed methods studies can be classified into four major categories: triangulation, embedded, explanatory, and exploratory design. A triangulation design is appropriate when researchers intend to best understand a phenomenon by obtaining different but complementary data on the same topic, allowing researchers to enhance the validity of their findings if they compare their qualitative with the quantitative results. In an embedded design, researchers collect two types of data to answer two different questions in one study, of which one data set provides a supportive, secondary role to the primary data set. An explanatory design usually initiates with a quantitative data collection and follows by a qualitative study to help researchers explain or build on the initial quantitative results. An exploratory mixed methods study also contains two phases, of which the first phase is usually a qualitative study, helping researchers develop or inform the second phase (quantitative study). Nevertheless, researchers need not follow a ‘standardized’ model of combining qualitative and quantitative methods in a research study because one approach can be added to another, intertwined, and/or integrated in different stages of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1467358412466669">Punch, 1998</xref>). Rather, researchers should determine the appropriate research methodology according to the purpose of a study and research question(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1467358412466669">Kwok et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to communicate with other scholars that an alternative mixed methods approach – exploratory-triangulation design – can also be used in hospitality and tourism research. An empirical study that used exploratory-triangulation mixed methods approach is also provided in this article as a specific example. It is hoped that this article will encourage other researchers to consider adopting the mixed methods approach in hospitality and tourism research and open up a discussion of using a variety of mixed methods designs in research studies.</p>
<p>The following discussion starts from the background information for the empirical study, in which an investigation was planned to identify those hospitality graduating seniors who meet hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria, followed by a detailed description of how exploratory design and triangulation design can be combined and used in a single investigation. To demonstrate how additional insightful findings may emerge by comparing the qualitative and quantitative data, triangulation analysis is also included. The article ends with a closing discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the exploratory-triangulation design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1467358412466669"><title>A brief background of the exploratory- triangulation mixed methods study</title>
<p>Hospitality organizations are very selective in choosing the ‘right’ candidates for job placements because of the high costs associated with college recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1467358412466669">Kwok et al., 2012</xref>). Hospitality students often find it difficult to secure a job offer. Since December 2007, the U.S. economy has entered a worsening recession, with 9.5 per cent or 14.6 million people unemployed in the U.S. in July 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1467358412466669">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). The leisure and hospitality industry alone lost 448,000 jobs in the period between April 2008 and April 2009; the unemployment rate in this industry reached 10.2 per cent in 2009 and experienced little change ever since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1467358412466669">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1467358412466669">2010</xref>). Students are competing with one another for very limited job opportunities. A possible solution to this problem is prepare students according to the hospitality industry’s expectations and recruiters’ selection criteria with appropriate coursework, relevant job or internship experience, study abroad programs, and extra-curricular activities. As seniors, students should be able to articulate their qualifications during the recruiting-selection process. Empirical studies suggest that students can use influential tactics to affect the interviewers’ impression of them and then influence recruiters’ hiring decisions. These tactics include knowledge, skills, talents, personality characteristics, values, and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1467358412466669">Higgins and Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1467358412466669">McFarland et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the industry’s expectations, several quantitative studies have been conducted on the perceived qualities of managers in the hospitality industry (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1467358412466669">Emenheiser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1467358412466669">Graves, 1996</xref>). There are also studies that discuss the skills that a student should have for a successful hospitality career (for e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1467358412466669">Countryman and Horton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1467358412466669">Tesone and Ricci, 2006</xref>). Current literature, however, does not provide sufficient information to help researchers identify hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria in college recruiting settings. In addition, most recruitment and selection studies in hospitality and tourism utilized either qualitative or quantitative methods to analyze data, which supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1467358412466669">Davies’ (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1467358412466669">Mehmetoglu’s (2004)</xref> assertion that many hospitality and tourism studies are either qualitative or quantitative in nature and very few combine both approaches. Theoretically, only a few studies used a conceptual framework. This kind of research has been categorized as dispositional research and criticized for not having a theoretical foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1467358412466669">Wright and Boswell, 2002</xref>). A theory can help researchers ‘identify and define problems, prescribe a means for evaluating or solving the problems, and facilitate response to new problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1467358412466669">Klein and Zedeck, 2004</xref>, p. 931). While several narrative and meta-analytic reviews of recruitment literature confirmed that researchers have applied expectancy theory, reasoned action, planned behavior, the image theory model of decision making, social justice theory, and attribution theory in recruitment studies, scholars advocate using a variety of theories to study the decision-making process of organizations and recruiters (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1467358412466669">Breaugh and Starke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1467358412466669">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1467358412466669">Hausknecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1467358412466669">Ryan and Ployhart, 2000</xref>). Examining a complex problem with a variety of frameworks and models can increase reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1467358412466669">van de Ven and Johnson, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, a research investigation was planned to bridge the knowledge gap, and three different but contemporary research questions were raised to help researchers better understand hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria in college recruiting:<def-list id="duolist1-1467358412466669"><def-item><term>RQ1:</term><def>
<p>What factors influence hospitality recruiters’ hiring decisions when they select qualified hospitality graduating seniors for entry-level managerial positions?</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RQ2:</term><def>
<p>According to hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria, what characteristics do hospitality graduating seniors who receive job offers possess as compared to those who do not?</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RQ3:</term><def>
<p>What differences and similarities are there in the characteristics possessed by hospitality graduating seniors who receive job offers and hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria?</p></def></def-item></def-list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1467358412466669" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The mixed methods approach was deemed to be the most appropriate methodology for the investigation because qualitative methods are important in revealing in-depth information about hospitality recruiters’ expectations (RQ1) and quantitative method are necessary in identifying the characteristic possessed by the graduating seniors who receive job offers (RQ2). More importantly, because studies in social sciences have shown that people’s actual behaviors may differ significantly from their responses to research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1467358412466669">Pager and Quillian, 2005</xref>), it is possible that hospitality recruiters may hire graduating seniors who do not meet their selection criteria. It becomes important to further compare recruiters’ preferred characteristics (qualitative results) and those characteristics possessed by those graduating seniors who receive job offers (quantitative results) before drawing a final conclusion.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1467358412466669"><title>Development of a guiding framework</title>
<p>With the purpose of examining an ‘old’ recruitment and selection phenomenon with ‘new’ perspectives, this research study was initiated with the development of a guiding framework. A relevant recruitment and hospitality literature was reviewed and conceptualized by the researchers in a proposed framework entitled Factors Influencing Hospitality Recruiters’ Hiring Decisions (FIHRHD) Model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1467358412466669">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1467358412466669">Kwok et al., 2011</xref>). FIHRHD Model suggests that the process of hiring hospitality graduating seniors takes into account a variety of factors: student characteristics, recruiting-selection process, recruiters’ demographic backgrounds, and their expectations. Student characteristics are the main criteria recruiters consider before making hiring decisions, which include intellectual skills, academic performance, extra-curricular activities, relevant job experience, job pursuit intention, and person-organization (PO) and person-job (PJ) fit. ‘Other qualities’ is also included because it is possible that researchers may not have identified all the qualities that hospitality recruiters look for. Student characteristics affect the recruiting-selection process, which in turn influences recruiters’ hiring decisions. The moderating factors are recruiters’ demographic backgrounds and expectations. Demographic backgrounds are significant statistical or quantifiable human characteristics. Recruiters’ expectations are formed by their personal and professional experiences. This proposed FIHRHD Model was used to guide the mixed methods investigation.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1467358412466669"><title>The exploratory-triangulation design</title>
<p>This investigation adopted the ‘instrument development model’ of exploratory design and the ‘convergence model’ of triangulation design to answer the three research questions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1467358412466669">Creswell and Clark (2007)</xref>, an exploratory design is appropriate for the following possible reasons: measures or instruments are not available, the variables are unknown, and/or there is no guiding framework or theory. A study using instrument-development exploratory design usually contains two phases. The first phase is a qualitative exploratory study. After the qualitative data are analyzed, researchers will generate the quantitative instruments by ‘quantifying’ the qualitative data under an instrument development model. These instruments will then be used in a follow-up quantitative study. Exploratory design is advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1467358412466669">Mason et al. (2010)</xref> in tourism research due to its ability to bring in new insights. Because this investigation was framed under a newly introduced conceptual model (FIHRHD Model), exploratory design is suitable for the research study.</p>
<p>A triangulation design is probably the most familiar mixed methods approach, which often requires researchers to conduct two or more concurrent studies that answer different but contemporary research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1467358412466669">Cresswell, 2003</xref>). A triangulation design allows researchers to enhance the validity of their findings if they compare the different data sets on the same topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1467358412466669">Creswell and Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1467358412466669">Punch, 1998</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1467358412466669">Creswell and Clark (2007)</xref>, in a convergence model of triangulation design, researchers collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data separately. Then, the different results are synthesized to interpret the research findings.</p>
<p>It is important and necessary to combine the instrument development-exploratory design and the convergence triangulation design in this investigation because the exploratory-triangulation design allows researchers to develop a survey instrument that was closely matched with the interview protocol. The analogous data from the quantitative and qualitative studies could be better compared and converged during triangulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1467358412466669">Figure 2</xref> provides a visual diagram of the overall research design.
<fig id="fig2-1467358412466669" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Visual diagram of the mixed methods investigation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1467358412466669-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1467358412466669"><title>The qualitative pilot study</title>
<p>The investigation began with a pilot qualitative study in the summer of 2008. The purposes of this pilot study were to develop a survey instrument for the quantitative study and to finalize the interview protocol for the actual qualitative study. The informant selection of the qualitative study was facilitated with a qualitative method, in which a maximum variation sampling procedure was used. This sampling technique was adopted because it allows researchers to find the typical group(s) to represent a case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1467358412466669">Teddlie and Yu, 2007</xref>). In particular, the informants were selected from 72 hospitality recruiters who were conducting interviews at a major hospitality program in the Southwestern USA in the summer/fall of 2008. These recruiters were asked to complete a one-page questionnaire about their demographic information while they were interviewing students on campus. Based on their responses, seven recruiters were selected from five hospitality companies for the pilot qualitative study. These seven recruiters represented five hospitality segments of luxury hotel chains, liquor sales, on-site foodservice companies, quick casual restaurant chains, as well as casual dining restaurant chains, and they frequently recruited graduating seniors from multiple hospitality programs in the USA. Interview questions used in the pilot qualitative study were developed from the proposed FIHRHD Model. Each interview question addressed one construct of the model except for ‘recruiters’ demographic backgrounds,’ which was recorded in recruiters’ self-reported questionnaire. To better understand recruiters’ rational choice preferences of selecting qualified candidates, informants were also asked to rank the order of every selection factor discussed. All interviews were completed when recruiters conducted campus interviews and were audio taped. The data was analyzed with the content analysis techniques in conducting ‘phenomenology’ qualitative research suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1467358412466669">Creswell et al. (2007)</xref>, in which tapes were listened to multiple times before transcribing the data and major themes were coded and analyzed by the researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1467358412466669"><title>The actual qualitative study</title>
<p>After the pilot data were analyzed, the interview questions were modified, and a finalized interview protocol was developed for the actual qualitative study in the fall of 2008. Compared to the pilot study, the open-ended questions in the actual study were more specific to the constructs in the FIHRHD model. In addition to rank order, informants were asked to rate the importance of the influential factors discussed in interviews with a 10-point Likert scale (from 1 as ‘Not Important At All’ to 10 as ‘Extremely Important’). Furthermore, a definition page of the terms found in the interview questions was prepared for those participants who needed clarification. In the actual qualitative study, the same maximum variation sampling technique was used and another 22 participants from 14 hospitality companies were selected. The sample represented hotel chains, restaurant chains, on-site foodservice companies, service-sales companies, and club and resort chains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1467358412466669">Table 1</xref>). If recruiters were travelling with operation managers/directors, they were all invited for interviews. The interviews were audio-taped and analyzed, using the same content analysis techniques in conducting ‘phenomenology’ qualitative research suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1467358412466669">Creswell et al. (2007)</xref>. The results of the actual qualitative study answered Research Question 1: What factors influence hospitality recruiters’ hiring decisions when they select qualified hospitality graduating seniors for entry-level managerial position?

<sec id="sec8-1467358412466669"><title>The quantitative study (the exploratory design)</title>
<p>The quantitative study started with the instrument development by quantifying the results of the pilot qualitative study. The instrument, which was developed from the pilot qualitative study, was first pilot tested with 40 junior students in a major hospitality program in the Southwestern USA in early November 2008 when these students interviewed for internships with hospitality recruiters. After the pilot study was completed, the responses were reviewed by several experienced researchers. Minor changes were made in wording and format. Because the sample size was not sufficient for a factor analysis, no statistical analyses were performed with the pilot data. Furthermore, the questionnaire was carefully compared with the qualitative interview protocol. Minor revisions were made to ensure that the finalized survey instrument and finalized qualitative interview protocol could possibly yield comparable and analogous data for the triangulation analysis.</p>
<p>The finalized survey instrument has two sections. The first section included 38 statements, which reflected the recruiting-selection process and hospitality recruiters’ views about the characteristics they seek in qualified hospitality graduating seniors. Participants were asked to rate these 38 statements on a 5-point Likert scale, where one means ‘Strongly Disagree’ and five indicates ‘Strongly Agree.’ The second section consisted of questions about participants’ demographic information. Participants were also asked to answer two fill-in-the-blank questions. One question was designed to report participants’ information regarding the construct of ‘relevant job experience.’ Participants were asked to state the time (in months) of their work experience (excluding internship) and their internship experience under six hospitality segments: restaurant and/or lodging foodservice,’ ‘lodging (other than lodging foodservice),’ ‘institutional foodservice,’ ‘clubs or resorts,’ ‘sales,’ and ‘other.’ The other question asked participants to indicate the number of interviews they had completed, the offers they had received, and the possible offers they were expecting to receive by the six hospitality industry segments of restaurants, hotels, institutional foodservice, clubs or resorts, sales, and other.</p>
<p>The population of this study consisted of graduating seniors in 69 selected U.S. hospitality programs, which were chosen according to a criterion-based, mixed-purpose sampling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1467358412466669">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). The list of these 69 hospitality programs was generated from three separate sources. First, researchers surveyed 72 hospitality recruiters who conducted college recruiting in a major university in the Southwest USA in the summer/fall of 2008 and listed 34 hospitality programs. Second, as an attempt to include more major hospitality programs in the USA in this quantitative study, researchers also checked the hospitality programs that were listed as premium members of The International Council on Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Education (I-CHRIE) organization. Many I-CHRIE premium members are highly recognized by both academia and industry, and these programs play an important role in hospitality education. As of November of 2008, there were 49 premium members in the USA, of which 20 were already listed by the recruiters. Thus, another 29 I-CHRIE premium members were added to the list. Last, six hospitality programs with which researchers have personal connections were also included in the list. In the end, a total of 69 hospitality programs were invited to participate in this study, which included 11 out of the 13 top hospitality programs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1467358412466669">Withiam’s (1997)</xref> report, 23 out of the top 29 hospitality undergraduate programs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1467358412466669">Brizek and Khan’s (2002)</xref> study, and 10 out of the 11 leading hospitality programs suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1467358412466669">Harris et al. (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Timing was critical in the actual quantitative study for two reasons: (a) many hospitality companies do not make job offers until the end of a semester and (b) the triangulation design suggests that researchers conduct two concurrent studies. Thus, data collection for the actual quantitative study took place at the end of the fall semester in 2008 (starting from a week before the Thanksgiving holiday in November and ending in mid-December). In November 2008, the faculty or staff members in the 69 selected hospitality programs were asked for their assistance in collecting data. Among the faculty members and staff who were willing to help collect data, some preferred to distribute hard-copy questionnaires, and others requested e-mail invitations for online surveys. Consequently, schools either received hard-copy questionnaires as well as a stamped return envelope by regular mail or an e-mail invitation with a link to the online survey. The content and the order of the questions in the online survey were identical to those in the hard-copy questionnaires. Then, the faculty/staff members who received hard copy questionnaires were to distribute them to the hospitality graduating seniors in their programs and to return the completed questionnaires by mail. The faculty/staff members who received e-mail invitations helped researchers forward the e-mail to the hospitality graduating seniors in their programs. The hospitality graduating seniors who received e-mail invitations were invited to complete the questionnaire online.</p>
<p>In the end, 16 hospitality programs were willing to collect paper questionnaires and 10 chose to send out e-mail invitations. By January 2009, 343 paper questionnaires and 73 online responses were received. Because this study was designed to examine the characteristics possessed by graduating seniors, only the valid questionnaires reported by the informants who stated that they anticipated graduating in December 2008 were included in data analyses; the questionnaires reported by the informants who would graduate in May 2009 or later were not included in data analysis. Therefore, useful surveys consisted of 149 paper (43.15 per cent of 343) and 34 online (46.47 per cent of 73) questionnaires, representing 26 hospitality/travel and tourism program in 20 states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Washington.</p>
<p>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), <italic>t-</italic>tests, and logistic regression were used in quantitative data analyses. Statistical testing helped researchers to support or reject the null hypotheses that were advanced from the proposed FIHRHD Model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1467358412466669">Figure 1</xref>). The actual quantitative study answered Research Question 2: According to hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria, what characteristics do hospitality graduating seniors who receive job offers possess as compared to those who do not?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1467358412466669"><title>The triangulation design</title>
<p>After the qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed separately, the research findings from the actual qualitative and the quantitative studies were further compared. The triangulation results were used to answer Research Question 3: What differences and similarities are there in the characteristics possessed by hospitality graduating seniors who receive job offers and hospitality recruiters’ selection criteria? In this investigation, multi-steps were carefully taken to ensure the qualitative and quantitative data were comparable. First, a pilot qualitative study was conducted to finalize the interview protocol that was closely matched with the survey instrument used in the quantitative study. Then, a maximum variation sampling procedure was used to recruit informants in the qualitative study. The sample included national or regional recruiters of major hospitality companies who recruited graduating seniors in multiple hospitality programs in the USA. Often, recruiters from different regions within the same hospitality company are aware of their company standards and use similar, if not identical, recruiting-selection practices to select the qualified candidates for their companies. Transferability of the qualitative study was established, and the qualitative results are perceived to reflect the selection criteria used by major hospitality companies in the USA as a whole. Last, a criterion-based, mixed purpose sampling procedure was used to collect quantitative data. This study invited the graduating seniors in 69 hospitality programs in the USA, which included many major hospitality programs in the USA and in particular, the programs where the interviewers (hospitality recruiters) conducted college recruiting. The quantitative data represent a good sample of graduating seniors in the baccalaureate-degree hospitality programs in the USA. Therefore, the characteristics possessed by graduating seniors who received job offers, which were identified in the quantitative study, were used to triangulate with the selection criteria used by the hospitality recruiters when selecting qualified graduating seniors for entry-level management positions.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1467358412466669"><title>Qualitative research findings</title>
<p>Guided by the proposed FIHRHD Model, the qualitative inquiry was completed in the fall of 2008, and the detailed research findings have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1467358412466669">Kwok et al. (2011)</xref>. In a short summary, the qualitative results suggest that seniors’ leadership, relevant job experience, PO and PJ fit, and personality are the most influential factors in recruiters’ hiring decisions. Candidates’ job pursuit intention, intellectual skills, and flexibility also appear important. A student’s academic performance and extra-curricular activities are not considered as important as other factors by hospitality recruiters. The qualitative inquiry helped researchers advance the Modified FIHRHD Model under the Qualitative Inquiry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1467358412466669">Figure 3</xref>), in which student characteristics are listed according to the ‘rank order’ and ‘rate the importance’ analyses. Even though the qualitative data do not seem to support the influential relationships of recruiters’ demographic backgrounds, recruiters’ expectations, and recruiting-selection process, and their hiring decisions, these constructs were retained for triangulation analyses, in which dotted lines were used to indicate the relationships needing more empirical support.

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1467358412466669"><title>Quantitative research findings</title>
<p>Also guided by the proposed FIHRHD Model, the quantitative study was completed in the fall of 2008. The detailed quantitative research findings have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1467358412466669">Kwok et al. (2012)</xref>. In brief, quantitative analyses allow researchers to compare the graduating seniors who received job offers and those who did not in terms of students’ intellectual skills, academic performance (GPA), extra-curricular activities, relevant job experience, job pursuit intention, perceived PO &amp; PJ fit, and ‘other qualities’ if other qualities emerge in EFA. Quantitative data analyses with EFA, <italic>t</italic>-tests, and logistic regression confirmed that graduating seniors who receive job offers are different from those who do not in relevant work/internship experience, perceived PO and PJ fit, leadership/career preparedness, professionalism, and interview behaviors. The quantitative research findings helped researchers develop the Modified FIHRHD Model under the Quantitative Investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1467358412466669">Figure 4</xref>), in which the influential constructs/factors that show statistical differences between groups are bolded.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1467358412466669"><title>Triangulation analysis</title>
<p>The triangulation analysis compares the quantitative data and the qualitative results, which has never been reported in any form of publications. In addition, the purpose of presenting the triangulation results is not to repeat the detailed descriptive qualitative data in Kwok et al.’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1467358412466669">2011</xref>) or quantitative analysis in Kwok et al.’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1467358412466669">2012</xref>). Rather, this triangulation analysis shows how one set of data can be used to support or inform the other. Based on the sequence of the constructs presented in the Modified FIHRHD Model under the Qualitative Inquiry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1467358412466669">Figure 3</xref>), the following discussion begins with student characteristics of leadership, relevant job experience, person-organization and person-job fit, personality, job pursuit intention, intellectual skills, flexibility, academic performance, and extra-curricular activities. Then, the emerging factors from the quantitative investigation and the possible intervening factors are discussed. Selected direct quotes from the audit trails (with company name and page number) were also used when the qualitative data are reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1467358412466669"><title>Leadership</title>
<p>Leadership is ranked as one of the most important factors that influence recruiters’ hiring decisions. The recruiter of Company G stated: ‘When doing college recruiting, I am looking for leaders who can develop other people but not people who are just there running shifts. Students with strong leadership skills have long-term potential for career advancement within the company’ (p. 4). Taking a leadership role in extra-curricular activities or at work is considered a big indicator in leadership skills by recruiters. Recruiters in Company M mentioned: ‘If they have been able to direct somebody who is not being paid and get them involved, get them excited, and get them to follow through on projects, they should be able to do that much better when they end up in a position they are actually paying someone to do that’ (p. 5). When the recruiter of Company G interviews candidates, he looks for ‘some sort of shift leader experience because it is great to see them to be leaders in their jobs’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>EFA grouped the variable of how students practice their leadership skills in extra-curricular activities and at work and how students prepare for their career as a single factor – ‘leadership/career preparedness.’ The <italic>t</italic>-test results indicate statistical differences exist between graduating seniors who received job offers and those who did not in the hospitality industry as a whole and in particular, the restaurant and hotel segments in terms of leadership/career preparedness. Logistic regression results support leadership/career preparedness as a good indicator of seniors’ likelihood of receiving job offers in the hospitality industry and particularly the restaurant segment. The quantitative results agree with the qualitative findings on this construct. At the same time, both data sets indicate that there is a high correlation among ‘Leadership,’ ‘Extra-curricular Activities,’ and ‘Relevant Job Experience’ because recruiters assess students’ leadership potential by evaluating the leadership responsibilities and experiences students have had at work and/or in extra-curricular activities. More research attention is needed for better understanding these constructs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1467358412466669"><title>Relevant job experience</title>
<p>Recruiters prefer students to complete an internship or work in a company that is closely related to the hospitality segment of their company. Company K emphasized: ‘We are looking for individuals that can come in, manage accounts, and manage people. And if they have never worked in the hospitality environment or the hospitality field, it is going to be hard’ (p. 5). In terms of ‘relevant’ experience, recruiters in hotels, clubs and resorts, and service-sales value different experience within the hospitality industry. Recruiters in restaurants and on-site foodservice companies preferred candidates have either front of the house or back of the house foodservice experience. The recruiters in an on-site foodservices company stated: ‘If I see somebody interned in hotels, front desk clerks, something like that, that does not have a lot of value to me because, yeah, the interactions are important, but at the same time, I am looking for the servers and the cooks’ (Company I, p. 7).</p>
<p>The <italic>t-</italic>test results and the logistic regression analysis support recruiters’ comments. Compared to the graduating seniors who did not receive restaurant job offers, those who did had more restaurant work experience and institutional foodservice internship experience. Seniors who received institutional foodservice job offers had less lodging (other than lodging foodservice) internship experience and more institutional foodservice internship experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1467358412466669"><title>PO and PJ fit</title>
<p>Another important factor that influences hospitality recruiters’ hiring decisions is PO &amp; PJ fit. According to the recruiter of Company F, ‘It (PO fit) is a paramount factor. Candidates can have the most amazing technical skills, great hands-on skills in jobs, but if they don’t have the personality to blend in with the organization, it really will not mean anything’ (p. 7). Recruiter of Company C believes if they match the right candidate to the right position, both the candidate and the property will succeed.</p>
<p>Personality fit can be measured with the direct (perceived) PO fit approach, where employees are asked if they believe ‘fit’ exists between their values and those of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1467358412466669">Tepeci and Bartlett, 2002</xref>). The quantitative study measured graduating seniors’ perceived PO &amp; PJ fit with a single-item variable. Statistical analysis suggests that graduating seniors who received job offers from the hospitality industry, and in particular, from the restaurant, hotel, and institutional foodservice segments perceived better PO and PJ fit than those who did not. Quantitative data supports the qualitative findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1467358412466669"><title>Personality</title>
<p>Even though ‘personality’ is an important influential factor that emerged in the actual qualitative study, this factor was not discussed by the recruiters in the pilot qualitative study. As a result, the survey instrument developed from the pilot qualitative study does not include any variables that measure graduating seniors’ personalities and their relationships with ‘job offers received.’ Without complimentary quantitative data, the qualitative results about ‘personality’ cannot be triangulated. Future studies, however, can build on the qualitative findings and confirm/disconfirm whether ‘personality’ is an important factor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1467358412466669"><title>Job pursuit intention</title>
<p>Job pursuit intention was ranked below the four factors discussed above. However, this factor is ‘fairly important because the cost of turnover is not cheap, what we spend on recruiting is not cheap. So, I want to make sure that they are interested in the company’ (Company L, p. 8). Candidates can show their interest in a company by signing up for interviews before the company does a presentation (Company D), having done research on the company (Company B), following up after the interview with a personal thank you note and asking recruiters further questions to keep the conversation going back and forth (Company E), and quickly responding to recruiters and their phone calls (Company M). The quantitative study examined the construct of job pursuit intention but did not find a statistically significant difference between graduating seniors who received hospitality job offers and those who did not. This contradicting result indicates further investigation is needed to confirm the importance of a candidate’s job pursuit intention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1467358412466669"><title>Intellectual skills</title>
<p>Even though recruiters did not consider ‘intellectual skills’ as one of the most important factors, they reported that they seek graduates with problem-solving ability and verbal/written communication and analytical skills. Recruiters want to hire the candidates who understand the concepts of numbers, accounting, labor, and finance because they expect candidates to run a business from a numbers standpoint.</p>
<p>The developed survey instrument in the quantitative study asked informants to evaluate how much they agree or disagree with the statements about their intellectual skills. Contradicting the qualitative results, the odds ratio reported in the logistic regression suggest that students with slightly lower intellectual skills were actually more likely to receive job offers. This could be caused by the limitation of a self-reported survey instrument, in which respondents were asked to evaluate their own intellectual skills. Students who ‘believed’ they were highly ‘intelligent’ may have been viewed as ‘overly confident’ by recruiters during the recruiting-selection process and were less likely to receive job offers. Future research using objective scales to measure candidates’ intellectual skills can help explain the contradicting results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1467358412466669"><title>Flexibility</title>
<p>Recruiters also consider a candidate’s flexibility when making a hiring decision. Recruiters in Company C stated: ‘a relevant factor is the person’s flexibility. If a student tells me s/he is only interested in lodging event planning in City A, s/he just narrowed her/his job possibility from 200 down to one’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>Because the variable of flexibility did not load with other factors in the exploratory factor analysis, flexibility was not included in the <italic>t</italic>-test or logistic regression analysis in the quantitative study. Thus, additional <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to compare the flexibility of the graduating seniors who received job offers and those who did not. As suggested by the <italic>t-</italic>test results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1467358412466669">Table 2</xref>, being flexible about a location where a senior begins her/his career is a factor that can differentiate the seniors who received job offers and those who did not in the hospitality industry, restaurants, hotels, and clubs and resorts. The <italic>t-</italic>test results agree with the qualitative findings.

</table-wrap></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1467358412466669"><title>Academic performance (GPA)</title>
<p>Few recruiters consider GPA as an important factor in hiring. In addition, no statistically significant difference was found between the graduating seniors who received job offers and those who did not. It would seem that academic performance (GPA) has little impact on recruiters’ hiring decisions. Nevertheless, as suggested in a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1467358412466669">McKinney et al. (2003)</xref>, it is possible that a hospitality student’s major GPA has stronger correlations with recruiters screening decisions than the overall GPA. Future studies are encouraged to take a close look at a hospitality student’s major GPA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1467358412466669"><title>Extra-curricular activities</title>
<p>While recruiters seek leadership quality, teamwork, and responsibility in extra-curricular activities, they rated this construct the least important factor affecting their hiring decisions. Because the variables about students’ extra-curricular activities in the survey instrument were loaded into the construct of ‘leadership/career preparedness’ with other variables, statistical analyses failed to provide evidence to support whether students’ level of involvement in extra-curricular activities can predict their employability. Leadership, however, is considered one of the most important influential factors. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that extra-curricular activities are not important unless students take leadership roles and practice their leadership skills in extra-curricular activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1467358412466669"><title>Other influential factors emerged from the quantitative investigation</title>
<p>Three ‘other qualities’ emerged in the exploratory factor analysis – ‘leadership/career preparedness,’ ‘interview behaviors’ and ‘professionalism.’ While ‘leadership’ also emerged in the actual qualitative study and has been discussed under ‘leadership’ and ‘extra-curricular activities,’ the following discussion focuses on ‘interviewing behaviors’ and ‘professionalism,’ which are not listed in the qualitative study as individual constructs. The descriptive statements under ‘recruiters’ expectations’ and ‘job pursuit intention’ provide evidence to support the quantitative findings. Selected comments of recruiters include:
<list id="list2-1467358412466669" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>They have been to our website. They have taken the time to do some research and have some questions prepared for us (Company I, p. 3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For hospitality students, I expect they know our organization or the organization that they are interviewing with (Company K, p. 2).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The basic expectation is they know about the company and the position. They have done the research. They don’t have to know everything, but they should have a basic understanding of the career path, the company culture, and the position itself (Company M, p. 3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We also want to make sure that they come well-dressed because obviously, we want to see someone dress for the position that they are going to go into. … it (hospitality) is a very conservative industry. (Company A, p. 6)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I expect them to be professional. That means no tongue ring, no piercing in the face. I expect them to be professional in their attire. I expect them to be timely, on time for the interview. (Company E, p. 2)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1467358412466669"><title>Proposed intervening factors</title>
<p>The qualitative study did not find strong evidence to support the influential relationships among recruiters’ demographic backgrounds, expectations, recruiting-selection process, and their hiring decisions. The quantitative investigation surveyed graduating seniors about their characteristics in the proposed FIHRHD Model. Therefore, the quantitative study did not examine the influence of the intervening factors either. More studies are needed because the proposed intervening factors could also play an important role in recruiters’ decision-making process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1467358412466669"><title>Conclusions of the triangulation results</title>
<p>In general, the qualitative and quantitative data are in agreement. The triangulation results indicate that hospitality graduating seniors who received job offers possess the characteristics as suggested by hospitality recruiters except for intellectual skills, the construct in which future studies using an objective scale are advocated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1467358412466669">Table 3</xref> summarized the important factors influencing hospitality recruiters’ hiring decisions. The triangulation analysis identified six important influential factors, including leadership (leadership/career preparedness), relevant job experience, PO and PJ fit, flexibility, interview behaviors, and professionalism.

<p>Accordingly, a Modified FIHRHD Model after the Triangulation Analysis is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1467358412466669">Figure 5</xref>, which only includes the factors supported by both qualitative and quantitative results. As compared to the Modified FIHRHD Model under the Qualitative Inquiry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1467358412466669">Figure 3</xref>) and the Modified FIHRHD Model under the Quantitative Investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1467358412466669">Figure 4</xref>), the Modified FIHRHD Model after the Triangulation Analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1467358412466669">Figure 5</xref>) does not include the constructs of personality, job pursuit intention, intellectual skills, academic performance, extra-curricular activities, recruiters’ demographic backgrounds, recruiters’ expectations, and recruiting-selection process. They are excluded because (a) no triangulation results support their influential effects on recruiters’ hiring decisions and/or (b) more empirical investigations are needed to confirm the influential relationships. It is concluded that hospitality recruiters assess hospitality graduating seniors’ leadership (leadership/career preparedness), relevant job experience, person-organization and person-job fit, flexibility, interview behaviors, and professionalism when making hiring decisions.

<sec id="sec26-1467358412466669"><title>Implications drawing from the triangulation analysis</title>
<p>The triangulation analysis helped researchers further confirm the importance (or unimportance) of the following influential factors: leadership, relevant job experience, PO and PJ fit, professionalism, interview behaviors, and academic performance. Moreover, the triangulation analysis brought in new ‘insights’ to the phenomenon, such as flexibility and how recruiters access a senior’s leadership potential. Future research attention can devote to those areas where the qualitative and quantitative results fail to reach an agreement or there is a lack of supporting empirical evidence from one method to another.</p>
<p>Practically, the research findings of this exploratory-triangulation mixed methods investigation also provide some useful information for both students and hospitality programs. Graduating seniors may prepare for a hospitality career by planning their course work, part-time job and internship experience, extra-curricular activities, job search tactics according to those influential factors revealed in the mixed methods investigation. Hospitality programs may review and develop a curriculum that meets recruiters’ expectations and provides appropriate career advice to students.</p>

<p>This article introduces an exploratory-triangulation mixed methods approach for studying a complex hospitality and tourism phenomenon with a detailed and specific example. It is possible and feasible for researchers to combine the instrument development model of exploratory design and the convergent model of triangulation design in one investigation. By adopting the mixed methods approach, researchers will be able to examine a complex issue with different perspectives; the triangulation analysis of multiple data sets also provides a broader and a more complete picture of a phenomenon. Reflecting on the empirical study outlined in this article, the advantages of using an exploratory-triangulation mixed methods approach seem obvious:
<list id="list3-1467358412466669" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The pilot qualitative study can help researchers develop a self-reported survey instrument for a quantitative study and finalize an interview protocol for a follow-up qualitative study. A qualitative method was used to facilitate both the actual qualitative study and the quantitative study. The comparable survey instrument and interview protocol also allows researchers to better triangulate the research findings from two independent studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The quantitative method (survey) allows researchers to a use maximum variation sampling procedure to select the informants for the qualitative study. Likewise, the qualitative study helped researchers identify the hospitality programs where the informants (hospitality recruiters) conducted college recruiting. The graduating seniors in these hospitality programs were invited to participate in the quantitative study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>New themes can emerge after researchers compare the qualitative findings with the quantitative results. Flexibility, for example, was first dropped from the data analyses after EFA because it was not loaded in a factor. The qualitative results, however, informed the importance of this variable. Flexibility was identified as another important influential factor after the triangulation analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The strengths of the qualitative and quantitative methods can be overlapped, and the weakness of one method can be compensated by the strengths of another. In this case, the qualitative data provides detailed and in-depth descriptions of the phenomenon being examined. The quantitative analyses allow researchers to generalize the research findings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The exploratory design allows researchers to use quantitative methods to test some relationships among the constructs in a newly developed framework, and the triangulation design help researchers make a more convincing conclusion by comparing different sources of data.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The exploratory-triangulation design, just as other mixed methods study, also has several disadvantages. For example, researchers must ‘forget’ the debates between research paradigms before adopting a mixed methods approach. Instead, researchers should allow the research question to drive the research design. The biggest strength of the qualitative approach lies in its ability to yield descriptive, in-depth, and insightful data. Consequently, numbers and frequency counts may not seem important in a qualitative study. On the contrary, quantitative researchers must rely on ‘numbers’ for decisions. If a researcher takes a positivist position, s/he might find it difficult to recognize or even utilize the strengths of the qualitative approach; interpretivists, on the other hand, may also face similar obstacles when conducting quantitative research. Another major concern of adopting the exploratory-triangulation mixed methods approach is about time, research scale, and controlling the research process. As illustrated in the empirical example, researchers are required to simultaneously conduct multiple studies with different sets of research skills. According to the concurrent triangulation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1467358412466669">Creswell, 2003)</xref>, researchers are suggested to compare two data sets that are collected during the same period of time. A small mistake in one stage may affect the overall research design and make it almost impossible for researchers to finish the whole study in a reasonable time frame. Researchers are advised to adopt the exploratory-triangulation design with caution and plan for unexpected incidents.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the mixed methods approach could be very powerful in helping researchers better understand a complex phenomenon, and thus will benefit hospitality and tourism research. When planning a mixed methods investigation, research need not follow a `typical' research design. Rather, they can ‘think outside the box’ and be creative in collaborating qualitative and quantitative methods in different stages of the research process.</p>
