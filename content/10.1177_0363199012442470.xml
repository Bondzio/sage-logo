<abstract>
<p>Since the process of assimilation of Jews coincided with a fertility transition, this study examines the relation between changes in the household structure of families of Jewish origin and the process of assimilation. Data were gathered from the Amsterdam registry for 717 Jewish descendants born in Amsterdam between 1883 and 1922. Our research shows a decrease in average number of siblings at birth among successive birth cohorts. Moreover, especially those persons born outside the Jewish district had a significantly smaller number of siblings at birth. This result might indicate that the fertility transition among Jews started with families who had left the Jewish district. This study also shows that subjects who had a higher number of siblings produced more children themselves, whereas those who married a gentile had fewer children.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For centuries, the district in the eastern part of the Dutch city of Amsterdam, around the Waterlooplein, was known as the Jewish area and was viewed as the center of Jewish life in the Netherlands. After the legal emancipation of Jews in 1796 and the abolishment of restrictive settlement rules, Jews continued to live in that part of the city. Compared to other parts of Amsterdam, the Jewish district was characterized by extremely high population densities. In 1859, it had the highest number of persons per house and the highest average household size of all Amsterdam districts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199012442470">1</xref>
</sup> This was still the case in 1899. Moreover, in the Jewish district, as well as in the Jordaan district, the size and quality of the houses scored extremely low.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199012442470">2</xref>
</sup> It was only after the First World War, as a consequence of the Public Housing Act which offered local authorities the possibility to intervene in housing conditions, that slums in the Jewish district were demolished.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199012442470">3</xref>
</sup> As a result of the reconstruction of the Jewish neighborhood and the strong increase in the number of newly constructed council houses in quarters outside this neighborhood, thousands of Jews left the area. Notwithstanding the decrease in the average number of persons per house, the Jewish district maintained one of the highest housing densities of all Amsterdam districts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199012442470">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More qualitative evidence also points to the high occupancy rates in the Jewish neighborhood. Narratives in “The Memory of Jewish Amsterdam” and “Memoir book,” for example, do indeed tell and visualize with photographs that families with large numbers of children lived in single-room apartments of poor quality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199012442470">5</xref>
</sup> Leydesdorff concluded from a report of the municipal health inspection in 1903 that large families were no exception among Amsterdam’s Jewish population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199012442470">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was not only the size of the Jewish families which differed from that of other religious groups. The municipal health inspection also noted that many households hosted more distant relatives too.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199012442470">7</xref>
</sup> A strong orientation toward the family is considered a fundamental characteristic of the Jewish identity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199012442470">8</xref>
</sup> This has been linked to the fact that the traditional set of Jewish values puts a strong emphasis on the importance of marriage and the family, as witnessed for example by the observance of life-cycle events. Important is also that religious establishments stress the role of the family and that many rituals taught are intended to carry over to family practices, thereby strengthening family bonds.</p>
<p>From the second half of the nineteenth century on, Dutch Jewry underwent a process of assimilation. One could therefore expect this process to cause a weakening of the orientation toward the wider family network, and for a loosened grip of religious values to also have an effect on the composition of the household. Leydesdorff indeed observed a change in the household characteristics of Jews in the first decades of the twentieth century: while among poor Jewish families adult children still lived with their parents, it was no longer taken for granted that grandparents or even more distant ill family members would be brought into the household.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199012442470">9</xref>
</sup> This had to do with the fact that from 1913 on, poor relief in Amsterdam was more centrally organized and coordinated; this might have resulted in better relief services, while at the same it became more accepted among Jews to leave the care of their parents in the hands of others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199012442470">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Those who had moved further away from the Jewish district now lived more frequently in houses that were specifically designed for a nuclear family, and had less intense family contacts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199012442470">11</xref>
</sup> Within the Jewish community it was particularly the supporters of the Social Democratic party who adopted this new family orientation. This political party was responsible for the creation of new working-class neighborhoods, and a mentality of a neat working-class family had developed first among this group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199012442470">12</xref>
</sup> This is confirmed by observations of contemporaries such as Heertje, who tells that Jewish diamond workers, who were largely loyal supporters of socialism, were very family-oriented, toward their parents as well as their siblings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199012442470">13</xref>
</sup> Yet, although the bedrooms held big portraits of the parents, Heertje did not observe any coresidence of parents or siblings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199012442470">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The statistical as well as the qualitative information discussed above provide only very crude data on the characteristics of the members of the households in which Jews lived. They suggest and sometimes even provide evidence on changes in household size and occupancy rates over time, but do not allow us to pinpoint the underlying processes that caused the divergence in household characteristics of Jewish families versus those of other religious groups. Neither do they offer the opportunity to study differences over time, or allow us to test whether or not an assimilation process was at the core of the changes in the Jewish household structure.</p>
<p>The present study uses newly gathered data from the population registry of the city of Amsterdam to examine changes in the household structure of Jewish families in Amsterdam during a period characterized by changes in the demographic parameters relevant to the process of household formation as well as by a process of assimilation of the Jewish population. The data allow us to use more refined information on the presence of various members of the kin network in Jewish households, making it possible to distinguish between demographic processes and other processes that determine the composition of the household. Although we are not yet able to compare household characteristics of Jewish with those of Catholic or Protestant families, our data do offer the opportunity to compare household structures of Jewish families according to the degree of assimilation of the family, defined by such factors as mixed marriages and the abandonment of Judaism. Finally, our data make it possible to compare the characteristics of the households over time, using comparable indicators. In doing this, we focus on the effect of the characteristics of the research subjects directly as well as on those of the parental home. We will analyze the household structure of about 700 persons who descended from three or four Jewish grandparents and were born between 1883 and 1922 in Amsterdam, and divide them according to birth cohort and degree of assimilation. Three questions are studied:</p>

<title>Household Structure of Dutch Jews: A Historical Overview</title>
<p>Compared with other countries such as the United States, information on the household structure in the Netherlands for the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is rather scarce. Census data, the main source of information, provide only a crude level on the composition of households. The census of 1879 was the first to collect information on the composition of households, but for a long time the categories distinguished were very wide and not very informative. For example, before 1920 kin members were grouped together with spouses and boarders, and up to the census of 1930 kin and boarders were included in one single category. It was only from 1947 on that a more differentiated classification system came into use. In addition, data were only published at the national and the provincial level. The census of 1971 was the first one to specify household structure for different religious groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199012442470">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Particularly in the United States, many studies have been published on the historical development of the household structure among various religious and ethnic groups, mainly based on random samples of the manuscript schedules of the censuses. This stands to reason, as the household structure of various groups of migrants was a topic of concern of social observers of the day. Studies were mainly directed at those migrants groups “where overcrowding, nonfamily units, unhealthy hygiene and housekeeping and ‘ immoral’ contacts were thought to flourish.” It was believed that as migrants became more educated and assimilated, the differences between the family patterns of migrants and those of older European migrants would disappear. Miller, Morgan, and McDaniel compared the way in which various migrant groups had structured their families in households, making use of data from the 1910 census.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199012442470">16</xref>
</sup> Their study focused on Jews from Central Europe (roughly the Austrian-Hungarian Empire) and Eastern Europe. The mean number of relatives (of the head of the family) was higher for both groups of Jews than for any other ethnic group. The total number of residents in Jewish households was also much higher than in other groups. On the other hand, the percentage living alone was very low among Jews. Compared to other ethnic groups, only a small percentage of all persons lived in an extremely large household (10+). Jewish households were the least likely to include nonfamily members. Boarding and employment in households were hardly found among Jewish men and women. Hence there were very few nonfamily members in households headed by Jews, but also Jews did not work or board in other households. As far as the extendedness of the household is concerned, Jews had much higher proportions of households that included some nonrelatives but no nonnuclear kin—the so-called augmented households.</p>
<p>There are few Dutch historical studies that inform us about the demographic processes underlying the family and household structure of the various religious groups. Most historical studies only present scarce and impression-based evidence. The little we know of the demographic development of prewar Jewry is based almost entirely on official census material which Boekman used in his study on the demography of Jews in the Netherlands.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199012442470">17</xref>
</sup> Indirect evidence supportive of the idea of a stronger orientation toward family members among Jews can be found in a study that noted clear differences between Jews and other religious groups in Jews’ tendency to involve members of the kin network as witnesses to the marriage ceremony.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199012442470">18</xref>
</sup> This stronger involvement of family members was observed in all social classes, but in particular within the lower social strata. A recent study using data from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands (HSN) observed that, compared to protestant children, Jewish children born in the southeastern part of the Netherlands between 1860 and 1922 had a higher chance of being born and raised in an extended household, that is, a household with nonnuclear kin but without nonrelatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199012442470">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several studies show that fertility levels among Jews were rather high until the mid-nineteenth century, but that Jews were also among the first to undergo a strong decline in number of children;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199012442470">20</xref>
</sup> this same phenomenon was observed in other European countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199012442470">21</xref>
</sup> Some scholars point to differences in breastfeeding between Jews and non-Jews that might have lowered infant mortality and influenced spacing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199012442470">22</xref>
</sup> Other typical lifestyle characteristics of Jews regulated by the Mosaic law, such as the obligation to refrain from intercourse until one week after menstruation, might also have resulted in a higher fertility rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0363199012442470">23</xref>
</sup> Statistical evidence on mortality among Jews—available from the middle of the nineteenth century in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe—shows without exception that Jews did better than any other religious and ethnic group in this respect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199012442470">24</xref>
</sup> How changing demographic parameters have affected the household structure considered typical for Jewish families has not been the subject of research.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363199012442470">
<title>Assimilation Process of Dutch Jewry and Its Effect on the Jewish Household Structure</title>
<p>The late nineteenth century was a period characterized by a change in the demographic regime of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations of the Netherlands, as well as by an intensified process of assimilation of Dutch Jewry. Assimilation is defined as a decline of ethnic distinction and its corollary cultural and social differences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199012442470">25</xref>
</sup> There are various indications of the process of assimilation of Dutch Jewry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199012442470">26</xref>
</sup> As already mentioned, more Jews left the Amsterdam Jewish district and started living more dispersed over other city districts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199012442470">27</xref>
</sup> Increasing numbers of Amsterdam Jews no longer adhered to religious rules: they broke the Sabbath and started eating non-kosher food too.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199012442470">28</xref>
</sup> Jewish–Gentile intermarriage increased heavily from the first decade of the twentieth century onward.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0363199012442470">29</xref>
</sup> Starting in the 1920s, more and more Jews abandoned the Jewish tradition and became religiously unaffiliated;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0363199012442470">30</xref>
</sup> of the Amsterdam Jews in 1941, around 7.5 percent was unaffiliated and 0.7 percent had converted to Christianity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199012442470">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For other Dutch cities too we have indications of an increasing process of assimilation. In The Hague, for example, starting in 1890s the number of mixed marriages grew, an ever-increasing proportion of children received no Jewish education whatsoever, and fewer children were registered as members of the Jewish religious community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0363199012442470">32</xref>
</sup> We also have evidence for the city of Delft showing that religious ceremonies for Jews became less and less important during the early decades of the twentieth century.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199012442470">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One could assume that this process of assimilation might have affected the household structure of the Jewish population in at least two different ways: at the meso-level as an effect of living in a religiously mixed environment, and at the micro-level as a consequence of growing up in a family in which Jewish religious values and norms were no longer transmitted from one generation to the next. A recent study found that a higher degree of religious orthodoxy in the parental household—parental membership of the Jewish community and degree of adherence to Jewish religious customs and holidays—the stronger the transmission of a Jewish identity to the next generation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199012442470">34</xref>
</sup> This was visible, for example, in the preference for a Jewish spouse. We might therefore expect differences in household characteristics between those persons who grew up in a family with two Jewish parents and those who lived in a household where one or both parents had abandoned Judaism and therefore might have reconsidered values and beliefs on family life.</p>
<p>Another relevant factor in the realm of family structure and its underlying processes is the transmission of values centering on childbearing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199012442470">35</xref>
</sup> One of the proposed underlying mechanisms is the socialization of fertility preferences during childhood and adolescence,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0363199012442470">36</xref>
</sup> especially in stable families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0363199012442470">37</xref>
</sup> Resemblance in fertility preferences between parents and their offspring might be stronger when all belong to the same religious denomination. We might therefore assume that for persons who abandoned Judaism or married a Gentile, traditional values on the importance of the family have lost their strength. We expect to find differences in household characteristics between those who had married a Gentile or had abandoned Judaism and those who had married a Jew and had not abandoned Judaism. As within Jewish culture orientation on the family and family relations are very important,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0363199012442470">38</xref>
</sup> we might also assume that coresiding family members play an important role in this socialization. While much of the Jewish ritual observance and transmission of values took place at home and women (mothers and their daughters) transmitted Jewish tradition, among Jewish families we assume a difference between men and women in their socialization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0363199012442470">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Next to the family context living in religiously mixed areas might also have affected the household structure. For instance, living in a religiously mixed district might lead to the adoption of new values and norms regarding familial obligations and relationships. Such an effect was found in a study in nineteenth-century Belgium, where it appeared that a mixed neighborhood had an effect on the adoption of new fertility behavior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0363199012442470">40</xref>
</sup> One could thus assume that Jews who had moved out of the Jewish district did have other household characteristics than Jews still living in that area.</p>

<title>Sources and Data</title>
<p>In order to stimulate interest in the historical development of the family and household structure of Jews in the Netherlands, Cohen made a call to set up a program of research.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0363199012442470">41</xref>
</sup> He pointed to the limitations of aggregate data, like the census, and suggested making use of primary sources such as circumcision and burial registers. A few years later, Schut suggested using information from the municipal population registers to study historical patterns of migration, household size, and spatial concentration of Jews.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0363199012442470">42</xref>
</sup> In these registers, Jews are defined according to their own stated religion. While within Jewish genealogy information given in the population registers has frequently been used to constitute family trees,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0363199012442470">43</xref>
</sup> this source is overlooked and underutilized when it comes to studying the demography and assimilation of Jews in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Population registers combine census listings with vital registration in an already linked format for the entire population of a municipality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0363199012442470">44</xref>
</sup> Continuous population registers, which recorded the population that was legally residing within the municipality, began in the Netherlands with the 1849 census. The returns from this census were copied into the population register, and from then on all changes occurring in a household over the next decade were recorded in the register. In most municipalities, this procedure was repeated with each subsequent ten-year census. The register recorded date and place of birth of each individual, relation to the head of the household, and sex, marital status, occupation, and religion. New household members who arrived after the registration had started were added to the list of individuals already recorded, and those who died or migrated were deleted and the place and date of death or of migration was recorded. The registers therefore provide information about demographic events leading to changes in the structure and size of households. By tracking individuals in the consecutive registers and, in the case of migration, in the population registers of the new place of residence, it is possible to follow individuals and their living arrangements over a long period of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0363199012442470">45</xref>
</sup> In most municipalities, population registers remained in use until 1910 or 1920, after which a new form of continuous registration was introduced consisting of loose sheets—so-called <italic>gezinskaarten</italic> or family cards. The unit of registration then ceased to be the household and became the family. This method continued until 1939. In contrast to the census data, the information given on the population registers and family cards is very well suited to study the household structure, as both sources describe the relation of each household member to the head of the family and at each moment of time. This allows a continuous reconstruction of the household structure.</p>
<p>To study household characteristics at an individual level, a database is needed which allows us to identify families of Jewish origin in the population registers and family cards. For the city of Amsterdam, names of persons of Jewish descent could be identified by taking a sample from the recovered original list of names of Amsterdam Jewish residents in 1941.<sup>

</sup> This list is the last documented information about the Jews in the Netherlands before the persecution by the Nazi occupiers began. In January 1941, the Nazis ordered all persons living in the Netherlands who had one or more Jewish grandparents to be registered. Supplementary legislation to the Nuremberg Laws defined persons who had three or four Jewish grandparents, who had two Jewish grandparents and were themselves members of the Israelite congregation, or who were married to a Jew as “full” Jews.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0363199012442470">47</xref>
</sup> Practically all of the “full” Jews complied with this order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0363199012442470">48</xref>
</sup> Although we are well aware of the Nazis’ initial intentions for the registration of Jews,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0363199012442470">49</xref>
</sup> the Amsterdam list does provide names of descendants of Jewish grandparents. While in most assimilation research it is difficult to assess which part of the second and third generation has left the confinement of their religious–ethnic minority milieu,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0363199012442470">50</xref>
</sup> this list allows us to include in our study persons who in 1941 did not belong to the Israelite congregation but were of Jewish descent—an impossible task when one draws a sample directly from the population register where only religious affiliation is given.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam list contains a total of 77,233 persons identified as “full” Jews. It gives information on place and date of birth, nationality, religious denomination, address, occupation, and marital status for each person. This list was drawn up in May 1941 before the Nazi occupiers took drastic anti-Jewish measures in the Netherlands, such as the prohibition to live in certain places and districts and to marry a Gentile, and before systematic deportation of Jews to concentration and death camps began.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0363199012442470">51</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>From this list we took first a random sample of 395 Jews, plus three supplementary samples to provide us with information on persons with a Jewish background characterized by a certain degree of assimilation. The Amsterdam list was alphabetically ordered by last name of the head of the household. As non-Jews were not included in the list, married Jews living at an address where only one married person was listed are coded as having a non-Jewish spouse, although it is possible that some Jewish spouses may have been temporarily living elsewhere. Based on this information, we took a first additional sample of 110 Jews who were married to a non-Jew. Religious affiliation tells us whether Jews belonged to an Israelite congregation, had converted to Christianity, or did not belong to any religious congregation. Based on the religion mentioned on the Amsterdam list, a second additional sample of 110 unaffiliated Jews and a third additional sample of 110 Jews who had converted to Christianity were taken. All 725 Jews were born in Amsterdam between 1883 and 1922. Next, additional information on 717 of the 725 Jews in our samples was collected from the population registers and marriage certificates in the Amsterdam archive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0363199012442470">52</xref>
</sup> In this way, we obtained information for each research person about their religion as registered in the population register, their household situation, and their migration, occupational, marital, and family history from birth to the end of the 1930s for the period of time they lived in Amsterdam or in the surrounding municipalities that were annexed during the first decades of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>For the reconstruction of the household, we mainly made use of the family card that was officially introduced in Amsterdam in 1893 and replaced the bounded population register’s double-page registration that was arranged by address.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0363199012442470">53</xref>
</sup> Both the double page and the loose sheet (the family card) show the relationship of the household members to the household head, and all changes in the membership of the household are recorded too. These sources are therefore ideally suited for our purposes. As Gordon remarks, family cards were to record families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0363199012442470">54</xref>
</sup> Because of the separate registration of servants and lodgers, reconstitution of the entire household would be difficult, therefore we will focus only on direct and distant family members and not on the coresidence of nonfamily members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0363199012442470">55</xref>
</sup> The big advantage of the registration is that it allows us to find out with whom the selected persons lived at each moment in time. Besides the relation to the head of the household and the dates of birth and of moving, these registrations contain information on occupation, addresses, and religion. This information will be used to classify the families of the subjects of research as (1) living in the Jewish district or in another Amsterdam district and (2) having parents whose religion is or is not Jewish. This kind of information will be used as a measure of assimilation.</p>

<title>Household Structure of Families of Jewish Origin</title>
<p>In this section, we will reconstruct the household structure of about 700 research persons who descended from three or four Jewish grandparents and were born between 1883 and 1922 in Amsterdam. All were still alive and living in Amsterdam in the spring of 1941, although some had moved temporarily to another dwelling. We will examine number of siblings and the presence of parents, grandparents, and more distant kin—uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces, and nephews—in their household. As the household structure might have undergone changes due to changing fertility and mortality levels and changes in the tendency of people to live together with more distant kin, we split up our sample according to year of birth of the sampled persons into four birth cohorts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363199012442470">Table 1</xref>). This will allow us to study changes over time. We reconstructed the household characteristics of these cohorts at two moments in time: the year in which the person was born and the year he or she turned twelve.</p>
<p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012442470">1</xref> shows the average number of siblings, including half- and step-siblings, living in the household of our research persons at the time of their birth and at age 12. In the oldest cohort, on average 2.7 siblings were present at the subject’s time of birth. This number decreased over time, especially between cohorts 1893–1902 and 1902–1912,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0363199012442470">56</xref>
</sup> reaching 1.6 in cohort 1913–1922.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0363199012442470">57</xref>
</sup> The average number of siblings at age 12 was much higher. In the oldest birth cohort, it was still 4.3 but it decreased fast over time—is faster even than the number at birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0363199012442470">58</xref>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0363199012442470">61</xref>
</sup> In the oldest birth cohorts, nearly all persons lived with both parents at the time of birth. This dropped to 96 percent in the successive birth cohorts, whereas in the last cohort the percentage had decreased to 92 percent.</p>

</fig>
<p>As is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363199012442470">Figure 3</xref>, there is a steady rise in the presence of grandparents in the household at the time of subjects’ birth in the successive cohorts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0363199012442470">62</xref>
</sup> Closer investigation shows that those who lived with a grandparent did this mostly in a household led by a grandparent and not the parent. This might explain the drop in the percentage of households in which both parents were present, as noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363199012442470">Figure 2</xref>. Our finding of the steep increase in the percentage of households with grandparents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363199012442470">Figure 3</xref>) is in line with the increased proportion, visible in the Jewish district, of recently married couples who did not set up a separate household.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0363199012442470">63</xref>
</sup> A reason for this trend might be World War I and its aftermaths, that is, economic recession, food shortage, impoverishment, and reconstruction of the Jewish neighborhood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0363199012442470">64</xref>
</sup> This might have temporarily resulted in housing problems and the tendency to live together with parents or grandparents among recently married couples who wanted to start their own family. In the year the research person turned twelve, the percentages living with grandparents were much lower, probably due to the higher age of grandparents and their consequently higher risk of dying. Although the rise in the presence of grandparents between the 1883–1892 and 1893–1902 cohorts is not significant, the decrease between 1893–1902 and 1913–1922 is.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0363199012442470">65</xref>
</sup> This means that in the period 1925–1934 a smaller proportion of twelve-year-old children lived with their grandparents than in 1905–1914. Based on the literature, we would like to point at a few possible explanations that might have caused this drop. First, the decreasing number of newborns over time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012442470">Figure 1</xref>) might have resulted in less need for grandparental assistance in the household. Second, the newly built houses, like those in the Transvaalplein, were designed for a nuclear family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0363199012442470">66</xref>
</sup> Third, from 1913 onward, poor relief in Amsterdam was more centrally organized and coordinated, a process which might have resulted in greater acceptance among Jews of leaving the care of their parents in the hands of others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0363199012442470">67</xref>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363199012442470">Figure 4</xref>, we present the percentage of households where also more distant kin lived. The trend runs more or less parallel to the one observed for the presence of grandparents, suggesting that the presence of both kinds of kin is probably related. The percentage of persons living with more distant kin is much higher, particularly at their time of birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0363199012442470">68</xref>
</sup> Again, we notice a peak in the youngest birth cohort, and assume that the previously mentioned housing problems played a role here. The decrease in the presence of distant kin between 1903–1912 and 1913–1922 at the age of twelve indicates that a smaller proportion of twelve-year-old children in the period 1925–1934 lived with distant kin than in 1915–1924.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0363199012442470">69</xref>
</sup> Since we lack a clear explanation for this decrease, we again point at the decreasing number of newborns over time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012442470">Figure 1</xref>), which might have resulted in less need for assistance in the household. Furthermore, the housing problem after World War I might have been solved in the second half of the 1920s, thus reducing the need to live together with other families.</p>

For both ages, we notice a shrinking average household size. This can be attributed almost completely to the lower number of siblings. There is one exception: research persons born in the youngest birth cohort lived in larger households than those born in the earlier cohort, which can be explained by the higher number of grandparents and distant kin present in these households.</p>

<title>Differences in Household Structure among Families of Jewish Origin: Degree of Assimilation</title>
<p>In this section, we describe the household structure of families of Jewish origin related to various kinds of assimilation. We will focus on the family structure at the time of birth of the research person. The indicators used here are (a) the birth address of the subjects (to classify families living within or outside the Jewish district)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0363199012442470">70</xref>
</sup> and (b) the religious denomination of the parents as given in the population register. When a family lived outside the Jewish district or one or both parents did not belong to the Israelite congregation, we consider this to be a more assimilated family of Jewish origin than families living within the Jewish district with both parents belonging to the Israelite congregation. Given the small number of research persons with non-Jewish parents in the oldest of the four birth cohorts, we distinguish here only two birth cohorts, namely 1883–1902 and 1903–1922. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363199012442470">Table 2</xref> describes the characteristics of the groups.</p>

When birth district was used as indicator of assimilation, the two groups did not differ in the proportion of households with both parents present, nor in the proportion with grandparents or distant kin present. Only when the religion of the parents was used as indicator was the proportion of households with both parents present significantly different in birth cohort 1883–1902.<sup>

<title>The Impact of Socialization and Assimilation on Number of Children in the Household of the Research Persons</title>
<p>Did socialization and assimilation have an effect on the number of children that the research persons themselves had? First, we assume that the presence of both biological parents and grandparents increases the chances of Jewish family values being transmitted to the next generation. Our first hypothesis is then: If both biological parents were present in the household when the subject was twelve years old, then this person will have more children. We look at the number of children the parents of the research persons had produced and which were still living in the household, as well as at the presence of grandparents or distant kin. Since we assumed a stronger socialization along the female line, we study whether these characteristics had different effects for men and women. Our second hypothesis is then: A woman will produce more children than a male subject when both biological parents are present in the parental household at the age of twelve. We subsequently focus on difference in religious affiliation between the research persons and their parents and spouses. We assume that adults who had the same religious affiliation as their parents would more likely identify with their parents’ values and belief system than if they changed religious affiliation. Our third hypothesis thus reads: A person who has abandoned Judaism will produce fewer children than someone who remains Jewish. Another way in which the impact of socialization of fertility preferences might decrease is when persons intermarry and are confronted with other religious, that is, values and belief, systems. Our fourth hypothesis is: A person who married a Gentile will have fewer children. A third way in which the impact of socialization of fertility preferences might decrease is when one is confronted with different values and belief systems by moving. Our fifth hypothesis then follows: A person who leaves the Jewish neighborhood will have fewer children.</p>
<p>In the analyses, we will use information on number of coresiding children in the household of our research persons as an indicator of the number of live born children that these subjects have had. We must stress that this number is not equal to the number of children ever born, as we do not have information on children born and deceased for those subjects who lived temporarily outside Amsterdam. We use information on all research persons born between 1883 and 1901 and count the number of coresiding children when our subjects had reached age 38—in total 269 research persons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0363199012442470">72</xref>
</sup> We have included all nonmarried persons, since they also run the risk of becoming a parent. Leaving them out of the analysis could result in overestimating the impact characteristics of the parental household, so instead we include number of years married as a covariate. We focus on comparing research persons who abandoned Judaism while their biological parents remained Jewish with those cases in which both the research persons and their biological parents remained Jewish or both abandoned Judaism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0363199012442470">73</xref>
</sup> The total number of research persons used in our analyses was 240. On average, 1.54 children lived in these households (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363199012442470">Table 3</xref>). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363199012442470">Table 4</xref>, we present the frequency of the number of children living in the household of the research persons. This table shows that about 30 percent did not have children in the household at age 38, about one quarter had two children, and 8 percent had more than three children.</p>

<p>To test the first hypothesis, we counted the number of siblings in the parental home when the research persons were twelve years old and determined the presence of one or more grandparents, distant kin, and both biological parents in the parental household at this same point in time. We used the subjects’ gender to test the second hypothesis, considering their religious affiliation as well as that of their spouses and parents to test the third and fourth hypotheses. To analyze the impact of differences in religious affiliation between subjects and their parents and between subjects and their spouses, we created dummy variables consisting of clear reference groups. To test the fifth hypotheses, we use the first address of the subject’s own household. We use multivariate regression analysis to test the various hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the first model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0363199012442470">Table 5</xref>, we introduce coresiding family members in the parental household when the research persons were twelve years old. A higher number of siblings significantly increased the number of children of the research person. This effect remains positive and significant after the introduction of other variables in the next models and supports our first hypothesis. The presence of both biological parents has a negative and significant effect in all models, leading to a rejection of our second hypothesis. The presence of one or more grandparents or of distant kin members did not have a significant impact on the subject’s number of children in this first model or in the other models. These results do not support our first hypothesis. In models 2a and b, we include interaction effects with gender. These interactions do not show any significant effect and do not support our second hypothesis.</p>

<p>In model 3, we introduce the religious affiliation of the subjects in relation to that of their parents. The reference group in this model consists of research persons who abandoned Judaism while their parents remained Jewish. Neither persons who themselves and their parents remained Jewish nor those who themselves and their parents abandoned Judaism had a significantly higher number of children than the reference group; this result does not support our third hypothesis.</p>
<p>The religious affiliation of married subjects in relation to that of their spouses is introduced in model 4a. In this model, the reference group were Jewish-Gentile intermarried couples. These couples had significantly fewer children than couples where both bride and groom were Jewish; this result supports our fourth hypothesis. On the other hand, non-Jewish couples, that is, in which neither bride nor groom were Jewish, did not have a significantly higher number of children than Jewish–Gentile couples. Since this group of non-Jewish couples contains a mix of religious denominations and religiously unaffiliated couples we have no explanation at hand for this result. Not surprisingly, the unmarried had significantly fewer children than Jewish–Gentile intermarried couples. This latter effect is no longer significant when we introduce marital duration in model 4b, but does not alter the significance levels of the effect of the other variables.</p>
<p>In the fifth model, we look at the effect of differences in living district at birth and at the first address of one’s own household. As the results of this analysis relate only to 213 instead of 240 cases (due to missing addresses), we will only discuss the results of the neighborhood effect and not any change in effect of the other variables. This model shows that those born in the Jewish district but who set up a household elsewhere did not have significantly fewer children than Jews who showed another moving pattern; this result does not support our fifth hypothesis.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>Existing studies on the household structure of Jews in prewar Netherlands provide only very crude data on the households in which Jews lived. Although these studies provide some evidence on changes in household size over time, we do not have any information about the factors underlying divergent Jewish household structures. The present study uses newly gathered data from family cards and population registers to examine changes in the household structure of Jewish families in Amsterdam during a crucial period of Dutch Jewry, when changes in the demographic parameters relevant to the process of household formation coincided with a developing process of assimilation. By focusing on the micro level, this study expands on what we know about household structure among Jews and teaches us about the impact of the process of assimilation in prewar Amsterdam. We focused on the way in which the household structure of families of Jewish origin developed in the period 1883–1934, and examined the question of whether this structure differed according to degree of assimilation. Finally, we tried to find out what the impact was on the household structure where subjects grew up, and what effect the process of assimilation had on their number of children.</p>
<p>We noticed a decrease in the average number of siblings over time, which resulted in a shrinking average household size. To examine whether household structure differed according to degree of assimilation, we classified families by religious affiliation and living district. Families of Jewish origin living outside the Jewish district or whose parents had abandoned Judaism were regarded as being assimilated to a higher degree. We found that especially persons born in the Jewish district had a significantly larger number of siblings at the time of birth than those born in other districts, for both birth cohorts 1883–1902 and 1903–1922. Since Boekman noted a sharper decline in fertility among Jews compared to other religious denominations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0363199012442470">74</xref>
</sup> our results refine his finding: a smaller number of siblings might have started among those families of Jewish origin who lived outside the Jewish district. It has been said that many of these families remained Jewish but in fact adhered to socialism and that they developed a new family orientation characterized by a preference for smaller families, as socialism did not reject birth control or family planning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0363199012442470">75</xref>
</sup> That was the case among the diamond workers, for example.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0363199012442470">76</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the number of children in the research person’s own household at the age of thirty-eight. To explain differences in fertility, we deduced hypotheses from the theory of socialization. Persons who had more siblings at age 12 did have more children at the age of 38 themselves. Apparently, having grown up in a large family stimulated both men and women to have more children. Surprisingly, the presence of both parents in the parental household at the age of twelve did have a negative impact on number of children in the subject’s own household. As the hypothesis based on socialization theory has to be rejected, other explanations must be found. Testing hypotheses from the economic deprivation theory or the stress theory could be an option here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0363199012442470">77</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We argued that persons who had the same religious affiliation as their parents would more likely identify with the latter’s values and belief systems, and their childbearing behavior is expected to resemble that of their parents more closely than that of persons who abandoned their religious affiliation. This hypothesis is however not supported by our data. An explanation for this result might be the rising preferences among Jewish families for smaller family and household size over time, as more Jews adhered to socialism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0363199012442470">78</xref>
</sup> Rising preferences might also be the reason why we did not find any significant results regarding the effect of moving to other districts. Moving from the Jewish to another Amsterdam district had much less of an effect than the spouse’s religious affiliation. Jewish–Gentile couples had a smaller number of children than Jewish couples. These results support our hypothesis of similarity of religious affiliation between spouses and are in line with the finding of Boekman that Jewish–Gentile couples had lower fertility rates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0363199012442470">79</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our research sample is too small to split up those who abandoned Judaism into separate categories according to their newly adopted religious affiliation. We might for example expect Jews who converted to Christianity to have more children than those who became religiously unaffiliated. Future research on fertility among families of Jewish origin might therefore focus on different groups of assimilated Jews. Moreover, studying the fertility of siblings might result in a better understanding of the process of identification with the parents’ values and belief system and the impact of the parental household structure. The future research might also try to include level of religiousness, for example, observing the Sabbath or attending synagogue. Relating religiousness of Jewish families to fertility might give us a better understanding of their decreasing fertility levels.</p>

<p>Gordon states that in some municipalities like The Hague, families were defined quite narrowly, consisting of a solitary or simple family unit—a married couple living alone or with unmarried children, a widow/widower alone or with unmarried children. We have no evidence that such a narrow definition was used in the Amsterdam registry, as we came across distant kin on the family cards, irrespective of year of birth, see Gordon, “The bevolkingsregisters,” 22.</p>
