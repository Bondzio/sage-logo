<p>Construct validity evidence for measures of depression, hopelessness, and psychache was evaluated with 2,974 undergraduates. Analyses indicated three dimensions each contributing to statistically predicting suicide ideation. Contribution patterns supported the differential validity of these dimensions.

<p>For North American society, suicide-related behavior is a major public health issue. Suicide is one of the 12 leading causes of death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612451744">National Institute of Mental Health, n.d</xref>.) and in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748175612451744">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, for every death by suicide, there is 50 to 100 times that number of attempted suicides resulting in injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748175612451744">Pagliaro, 1995</xref>). A risk factor for both death by suicide and attempted death by suicide is suicide ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748175612451744">Ranieri et al., 1987</xref>) and, as such, understanding, predicting, and intervening with suicide ideation can have value for the prevention of suicide and attempted suicide.</p>
<p>Prominent risk factors for suicide-related behavior include a previous suicide attempt and biological sex. However, in that historical and many demographic factors are not susceptible to change, recent research has focused on delineating psychological risk variables because such factors are posited to be amenable to therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175612451744">Brown, Beck, Steer, &amp; Grisham, 2000</xref>). Particularly salient among the psychological variables related to suicide are the constructs of depression, hopelessness, and psychache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175612451744">Pereira, Kroner, Holden, &amp; Flamenbaum, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As a risk factor for suicide, depression has a long history. In his cognitive model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612451744">Beck (1967)</xref> proposed that the fundamental cause of depression is a triad of dysfunctional negative beliefs about the self, the world, and the future. Empirical data have supported the linkage between depression and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175612451744">Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748175612451744">McHugh &amp; Goodell, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748175612451744">Robins, Schmidt, &amp; O’Neil, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748175612451744">Silver, Bohnert, Beck, &amp; Marcus, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175612451744">Abramson, Metalsky, and Alloy (1989)</xref> more finely articulated a cognitive model of depression and suicide that focuses on a subtype of depression, namely, hopelessness depression. Hopelessness depression, rather than depression in general, is seen as the relevant precursor to suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide ideation. Research has supported hopelessness as a mediator between depression and suicide-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175612451744">Dieserud, Roysamb, Ekeberg, &amp; Kraft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612451744">Dyer &amp; Kreitman, 1984</xref>) and as a predictor of eventual death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175612451744">Beck et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612451744">Beck, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612451744">Beck, Steer, Kovacs, &amp; Garrison, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to cognitive approaches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman (1993)</xref> asserted that suicide is caused by psychache (i.e., intense psychological pain). Psychache is defined as the chronic, free-floating, nonsituation-specific anguish, hurt, angst, humiliation, or, more generally, internal perturbation, that leads individuals to seek permanent escape. The affective state of psychache is distinct from any particular psychiatric diagnosis, and associations between psychological disorders and suicide are mediated by psychache. Thus, psychache is regarded as a necessary condition for suicide. Empirical findings have supported the unique explanatory power of psychache, relative to depression or hopelessness, in the statistical prediction of suicidal manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175612451744">Berlim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612451744">Holden &amp; McLeod, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612451744">Holden, Mehta, Cunningham, &amp; McLeod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175612451744">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748175612451744">Troister &amp; Holden, 2010</xref>). Psychache was also shown to mediate associations between perfectionism and suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612451744">Flamenbaum &amp; Holden, 2007</xref>) and between alexithymia and suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748175612451744">Keefer, Holden, &amp; Gillis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence has supported the importance of psychache relative to depression and hopelessness for understanding suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612451744">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>); however, because scales measuring depression, hopelessness, and psychache have correlated highly, the distinction among these constructs can be challenged (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748175612451744">Shahar, Bareket, Rudd, &amp; Joiner, 2006</xref>). Are depression, hopelessness, and psychache all distinct statistical predictors of suicide manifestations or is any predictive value principally a function of each of these psychological variables assessing a larger, more general expression of negativity? To establish evidence of construct validity for depression, hopelessness, and psychache, the current research evaluates whether operationalizations of these constructs assess distinct factors, whether these distinct factors have added value (i.e., incremental validity) in the statistical prediction of suicide ideation, and whether these distinct factors demonstrate differential strengths in statistically predicting different forms of suicide ideation. Based on previous empirical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612451744">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748175612451744">Troister &amp; Holden, 2010</xref>), we hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0748175612451744" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Measures of depression, hopelessness, and psychache would represent three correlated, but distinct, factors. That is, three factors would underlie the latent structure of content scales of depression, hopelessness, and psychache.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The assessment of latent factors for each of depression, hopelessness, and psychache would have added value (i.e., would explain unique variance) in the statistical prediction of suicide ideation. That is, for the simultaneous regression of suicide ideation on to predictors, regression coefficients for factors of depression, hopelessness, and psychache would each demonstrate statistical significance.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Furthermore, based on Shneidman’s model of suicide that emphasizes the preeminence of psychache as a cause of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman, 1993</xref>) and that other psychological factors are suicide-relevant only to the degree that they produce psychache, we further hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0748175612451744" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Psychache would statistically mediate the associations of depression and hopelessness with suicide ideation. That is, the associations of suicide ideation with depression and hopelessness would decrease significantly when psychache was statistically controlled.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Finally, given the empirical findings that the relevance of internal perturbations was relatively greater for more intense aspects of suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175612451744">Holden, Kerr, Mendonca, &amp; Velamoor, 1998</xref>), we also hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0748175612451744" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: The prominence of psychache, relative to depression and hopelessness, would be greater for the statistical prediction of the more active or intense, behavioral facets of suicide manifestations. That is, the ratio of regression coefficients of psychache to depression or hopelessness factors would be greater for statistically predicting suicide preparation compared to suicide motivation.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Statistical predictors</title>
<p>Constructs of depression, hopelessness, and psychache were assessed using three self-report scales, with higher scale scores indicating higher scores on the corresponding construct. The Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175612451744">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) is a 21-item measure of depression symptoms. Items are rated on 4-point scales as applicable within the previous 2 weeks. Scale alpha reliability coefficients have ranged from .73 to .95 and concurrent validity for the scale has been demonstrated in psychiatric and nonpsychiatric samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175612451744">Beck, Steer, &amp; Garbin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748175612451744">Spreen &amp; Straus, 1991</xref>). The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612451744">Beck, Weissman, Lester, &amp; Trexler, 1974</xref>) is a 20-item, true/false instrument that measures negative expectations about the future. The scale has empirical evidence supporting its reliability and validity in clinical and nonclinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175612451744">Durham, 1982</xref>) and its ability to predict subsequent death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612451744">Beck et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612451744">Beck et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175612451744">Beck et al., 1990</xref>). The Psychache Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612451744">Holden et al., 2001</xref>) comprises 13 items with content (e.g., “I hurt because I feel empty”) that focuses on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> definition of psychological pain. Items are answered as 5-point ratings. Scale internal consistency reliabilities have exceeded .90 with samples of undergraduates and prison inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175612451744">Mills, Green, &amp; Reddon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175612451744">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). The Psychache Scale has shown validity by differentiating suicide attempters from nonattempters and by statistically predicting suicidality when controlling for depression and hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175612451744">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612451744">2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0748175612451744">
<title>Suicidality criteria</title>
<p>The self-report Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175612451744">Beck &amp; Steer, 1993</xref>) consists of 19 items that assess suicide intent by evaluating the quality and quantity of ongoing suicide ideation. As well as measuring a range of attitudes and behaviors that clinicians regard as relevant for assessing suicidal risk, the BSS assesses specific suicidal characteristics that merit closer clinical focus. Beck and Steer reported BSS alpha reliability coefficients of .87 and .90, respectively, for outpatient and inpatient suicide ideators. Furthermore, correlations of the BSS with a clinician-rated version were .94 and .90 for outpatients and inpatient samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175612451744">Beck, Steer, &amp; Ranieri, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the total scale, the BSS has two subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175612451744">Beck, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1997</xref>). Whereas the Suicide Motivation subscale assesses a more passive aspect of ideation involving an uncertainty about living or dying in addition to the frequency and duration of suicidal thoughts, the Suicide Preparation subscale involves a more active component, including planning the suicidal act. In a study of suicide attempters, support for the two-factor structure of the scale was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175612451744">Holden &amp; DeLisle, 2005</xref>) with further research supporting the internal consistency reliability of these subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612451744">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>). The bidimensionality of suicide ideation has also been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175612451744">Holden &amp; Kroner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175612451744">Johns &amp; Holden, 1997</xref>) to distinctly relate to dimensions of negative cognitions (for suicide motivation) and action orientation (for suicide preparation). In particular, the action orientation dimension was differentially linked empirically to previous suicide attempts, internal perturbation-based reasons for attempting suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175612451744">Holden &amp; Kroner, 2003</xref>), and self-reported likelihood to die by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175612451744">Johns &amp; Holden, 1997</xref>). As such, we regarded it as important to separately evaluate the BSS subscales in addition to the total BSS scale.</p>

<p>For respondents with missing data, scale scores were generated by prorating scores provided that no more than 10% of items within a scale were missing. Within a scale, averaging is appropriate given the small amount of missing data and, particularly, as was present here, when scale internal consistency is high with items forming a single domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748175612451744">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>). Scale descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliabilities, and intercorrelations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748175612451744">Table 1</xref>. Descriptive statistics are similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612451744">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>) for university students. Visual inspection of histograms indicated that any distributional nonnormality was attributable to skewness and lack of mesokurtosis rather than because of the presence of outliers.</p>

<p>To verify the distinctiveness of the statistical predictors, separately, within each of the BDI-II, BHS, and Psychache scales, item parcels were formed for subsequent factor analyses. Factoring of item parcels is advocated because, relative to individual items, parcels will have greater reliability, higher communality, closer approximations to a normally distributed interval scale, more optimal indicator to sample size ratios, less item-specific anomalous influences, and a greater likelihood of an appropriate solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175612451744">Meade &amp; Kroustalis, 2006</xref>). We viewed such advantages as important particularly given that the response formats for items differed across the BDI-II, BHS, and Psychache scales. Parcels typically involve three to five items per parcel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0748175612451744">Sterba &amp; MacCallum, 2010</xref>), and with a desire to have three or four parcels per scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175612451744">Kishton &amp; Widaman, 1994</xref>), we generated parcels comprising either three or four items.</p>
<p>Within a scale, our parceling of items involved principal components analysis of item intercorrelations that evaluated and indicated the presence of a large component (supporting scale unidimensionality) and the allocation of items to parcels such that each parcel had items with approximately equal average loadings on the first unrotated principal component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175612451744">Meade &amp; Kroustalis, 2006</xref>). This procedure was intended to ensure both unidimensionality and representativeness, characteristics associated with the effective parceling of items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175612451744">Kishton &amp; Widaman, 1994</xref>), and produced seven item parcels for the BDI-II, six for the BHS, and four for the Psychache scale.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we examined the 17 item parcels with both exploratory and confirmatory analyses. For exploratory analyses, the eigenvalue &gt; 1 heuristic, a scree plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175612451744">Figure 1</xref>), and parallel analysis (1,000 replications and 95% confidence interval [CI]) each supported three components. Principal components analysis with either an oblique promax or an orthogonal varimax rotation indicated that the seven BDI-II parcels defined one component, the six BHS parcels defined a distinct component, and the four Psychache parcels defined yet another separate component (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748175612451744">Table 2</xref>). Using a confirmatory approach, maximum likelihood factor analysis of the 17 item parcels supported the model that depression, hopelessness, and psychache were three distinct constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748175612451744">Figure 2</xref>), χ<sup>2</sup>(113) = 389.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, normed fit index = .994, comparative fit index = .996, goodness-of-fit index = .999, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = .999, root mean square error of approximation = 0.032 (90% CI = .029, .036). Furthermore, this model had significantly better fit than a one-factor model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 10177.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Thus, in support of Hypothesis 1, both exploratory and confirmatory analyses indicated the differentiation of measures of depression, hopelessness, and psychache into three corresponding separate factors.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> causal model of suicide would predict that other psychological factors are only relevant to suicide because of their associations with psychache. Therefore, psychache should mediate the associations between other psychological variables (i.e., depression, hopelessness) and suicide criteria. As such, we evaluated the potential mediating effects of the psychache factor on the associations of factors of depression and hopelessness with suicide ideation through the SPSS MEDIATE procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175612451744">Hayes and Preacher (2011)</xref> and using 95% confidence intervals with 10,000 bootstrap samples. Although for each of the total BSS scale and its subscales, the psychache factor significantly mediated the links from each of depression and hopelessness factors, alternative mediation models were also tested and similarly supported. That is, for every outcome measure of suicide ideation, each predictor (i.e., depression, hopelessness, psychache) significantly mediated the associations between every other predictor and suicide ideation. In all instances, significant partial, but not full, mediation was present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0748175612451744">1</xref></sup> This result does not fully support Hypothesis 3, derived from Shneidman’s assertion that all other psychological factors are only relevant for suicide to the extent that they relate to psychache.</p>
<p>To more fully articulate the relative merits of depression, hopelessness, and psychache in the statistical prediction of suicide ideation, we evaluated the equality of coefficients within a regression equation using procedures detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612451744">Kenny (1979)</xref> to compare the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of an equation containing separate predictors versus summed predictors. If the standardized regression weights for two predictors are equal, the increase in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> between estimating a common weight for the predictors and computing distinct coefficients for the predictors should be nonsignificant. In predicting the total BSS, the regression coefficient for the depression factor was significantly less than for factors of hopelessness, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,177) = 5.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, or psychache, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,177) = 6.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, which did not differ significantly, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,177) = 0.26, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. For predicting Suicide Motivation, the regression coefficient for the hopelessness factor was significantly greater than for depression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,274) = 13.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, or psychache, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,274) = 4.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, which did not differ significantly, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,274) = 2.95, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. In predicting Suicide Preparation, the regression coefficient for the psychache factor surpassed that for either depression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,174) = 10.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, or hopelessness, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,174) = 4.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, which did not differ significantly, <italic>F</italic>(1, 2,174) = 2.68, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. Interpretations, similar to those based on standardized regression weights, of the relative size of contributions to predicting suicidality criteria emerged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175612451744">Table 3</xref>) when based on general dominance weights or relative importance weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175612451744">Braun &amp; Oswald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0748175612451744">Tonidandel, LeBreton, &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Thus, in support of Hypothesis 4, whereas psychache had a less prominent role than hopelessness in the statistical prediction of suicide motivation, psychache was the most important contributor to the statistical prediction of the more intense, behavioral aspect of suicide ideation, suicide preparation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0748175612451744" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a primary cause of death globally, suicide annually accounts for nearly one million fatalities worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0748175612451744">World Health Organization, 2000</xref>). Although identifying individuals at risk for suicide is an important aim for practitioners and researchers, another essential health goal is specifying malleable antecedents that subsequently result in suicidal behavior. Toward that end, mental health research has focused on suicide-related constructs such as depression, hopelessness, and psychache. Although each of these psychological variables has been associated empirically with suicidal behavior, the relationships among the constructs have not been fully articulated. The present research contributes by establishing the extent of independence of these psychological variables, by evaluating their added value (i.e., their contribution to prediction independent of other predictors) for statistically predicting suicide-related behavior, and by supporting the construct validity of these psychological variables through demonstrating their differential relevance for statistically predicting separate suicide criteria that vary in degree of intensity.</p>
<p>First, in examining the latent structure for parcels of depression, hopelessness, and psychache items, favored heuristics for determining the number of factors to retain all uniformly indicated three factors. Furthermore, exploratory analyses using item parcels resulted in a perfect sorting of parcels, in terms of salience, into corresponding dimensions of depression, psychache, and hopelessness, regardless of whether oblique or less appropriate orthogonal (i.e., varimax) rotations were used. In addition, confirmatory analyses with item parcels hypothesized to load on three corresponding factors, demonstrated excellent fit and a substantially better fit than for a one-factor model. In the three-factor confirmatory model, factors did correlate .54 to .69 but, nevertheless, their differentiation was empirically indicated. Thus, rather than one general factor of negativity, evidence supported the delineation of variables into three correlated, but distinct, dimensions with each one defined by items predominantly from a single scale.</p>
<p>Second, although three factors were indicated, these factors could possibly reflect response styles rather than content dimensions. Consider that the number of response options per item is four, two, and five for the BDI-II, BHS, and Psychache items, respectively, and could potentially be the basis for factor differentiation. The interpretation and utility of factors cannot be determined solely by their factor space prominence but must be established through their differential validity in predicting meaningful criterion variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748175612451744">Jackson, Paunonen, Fraboni, &amp; Goffin, 1996</xref>). Thus, it is essential to demonstrate that these factors have added value (i.e., make unique statistically significant contributions) in predicting a relevant criterion. As such, the significance of each of the factor score coefficients in each of the multiple regressions provides confirmatory evidence that legitimizes the content, rather than stylistic, interpretation of the obtained factors.</p>
<p>Third, evidence for the construct validity of emerged factors is enhanced further by their differential prominence in statistically predicting different relevant criteria. If extracted factors represented the same underlying construct, different patterns of regression weights should not emerge. Yet, whereas for the statistical prediction of suicide motivation, the hopelessness factor had a regression weight significantly greater than the other variables, the psychache factor was significantly more prominent than the other variables for the statistical prediction of suicide preparation. The pattern of differential validity supports both the separate content interpretation and construct validity of these latent variables.</p>
<p>Present results both support and also challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> model in which psychache is the most proximal, direct cause of suicide and other suicidogenic psychological factors are associated with suicide only through psychache. Accordingly, psychache should be regarded as a full mediator of relationships between other psychological variables and suicide. For the current study and supporting Shneidman’s perspective, psychache was significantly correlated with each index of suicide ideation and remained so when statistically controlling for other psychological variables in the multiple regressions. Nevertheless, in challenge to Shneidman’s view, depression and hopelessness factors retained their statistical significance in the multiple regressions when psychache was statistically controlled for.</p>
<p>Although a temporal ordering of cause, mediator, and effect relationships is more properly evaluated through longitudinal research, causal mediation can also be statistically tested within cross-sectional designs, provided that a logical ordering such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> model is assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612451744">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). For a mediator (<italic>M</italic>) to mediate associations between causal variables (<italic>X</italic>s) and an outcome variable (<italic>Y</italic>), the association between <italic>M</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> must be significant, the association between <italic>X</italic>s and <italic>Y</italic> must be significant, and the association between <italic>X</italic>s and <italic>Y</italic> must decrease when <italic>M</italic> is controlled for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612451744">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). Full mediation occurs when the decrease is to zero and partial mediation is indicated by a significant reduction but not to zero. In formally testing for mediation through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175612451744">Hayes and Preacher’s (2011)</xref> implementation, the psychache factor demonstrated significant partial, but not full mediation, of the associations of depression and hopelessness factors with each of the total BSS, Suicide Motivation, and Suicide Preparation scales. Although the presence of this mediation aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> assertion of the importance of psychache, the lack of full mediation is contrary to his claim that all other psychological factors and affective states are only relevant to the extent that they relate to psychache. Furthermore, alternative mediation models were also examined (i.e., depression mediates the association of hopelessness and psychache with suicide ideation; hopelessness mediates the association of depression and psychache with suicide ideation) and the occurrence of significant partial, but not full, mediation with almost all of these other models argues against the exclusivity of psychache as a causal agent and also demonstrates the high collinearity among the conceptually and empirically distinct measures of depression, hopelessness, and psychache. Given the cross-sectional nature of the current design and the lack of statistical support for full mediation for psychache, an alternative conceptualization can view depression, hopelessness, and psychache as overlapping risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175612451744">Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, Offord, &amp; Kupfer, 2001</xref>) for suicidality that are nonredundant.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting current finding occurred in the multiple regression analyses with an inversion of importance for the statistical predictors as the suicide criterion shifted in intensity. Whereas beta weights (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175612451744">Table 3</xref>) for psychache (.21) and hopelessness (.28) yielded a ratio of .75 in statistically predicting suicide motivation, for suicide preparation, the corresponding ratio of 1.63 indicated that the relative importance of psychache more than doubled (1.63/0.75 = 2.17). A similar inversion for regression weights of hopelessness and internal perturbation-based reasons for attempting suicide (a construct similar to psychache) has been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175612451744">Holden et al., 1998</xref>) in predicting suicidal desire and suicide preparation for patients attending a psychiatric hospital crisis unit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175612451744">Johns and Holden (1997)</xref> in research with undergraduates and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175612451744">Holden and Kroner (2003)</xref> in a study of incarcerated offenders also found that whereas hopelessness tended to cluster with less intense suicide manifestations, internal perturbations-based reasons clustered with more intense suicide actions. Thus, as lethality increases, there emerges a consistent increase in the importance of psychache relative to hopelessness. This increased importance for psychache as the lethality of suicidal manifestations intensifies is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748175612451744">Shneidman’s (1993)</xref> view of the action of suicide as an escape from overwhelming internal psychological pain.</p>
<p>The unique contribution of psychache to understanding suicidality adds a potential treatment avenue beyond currently implemented interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapies, antidepressant medication) that emphasize depressogenic factors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748175612451744">Patterson and Holden (2012)</xref> suggested that the importance of psychache may indicate the potential merit of affect-based interventions (e.g., ACT therapy) as an alternative or complement to cognitive-based treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy). Furthermore, in his psychache causal model of suicide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748175612451744">Shneidman (2005)</xref> stated that psychache, itself, results from unfulfilled psychological needs. Thus, tailored anodynic therapy focusing on an individual’s specific frustrated psychological needs can be the means for reducing psychache and, consequently, suicidality. Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612451744">Murray’s (1938)</xref> need theory of personality, Shneidman identified sets of needs that, when frustrated, were especially relevant for suicide; succorance and affiliation; achievement, autonomy, order, and understanding; affiliation, defendence, and shame-avoidance; affiliation and nurturance; dominance and aggression. Following from this, a solutions-focused approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175612451744">De Jong &amp; Berg, 2007</xref>) may be used to generate concrete ways to fulfill needs that individual clients perceive as not being met. There is also the potential for frustrated psychological needs to be addressed within a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. For example, an individual with a frustrated need for affiliation may have the thought “If my friend doesn’t want to see me tonight that means she doesn’t like me.” This thought could be tested and adjusted using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques such as thought records and behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612451744">Greenberger &amp; Padesky, 1995</xref>), which in turn may reduce that individual’s level of psychache. Therapeutically addressing these needs when thwarted as an intervention for psychache and its subsequent suicidality awaits empirical verification.</p>
<p>Limitations to this research exist. First, this investigation focused on suicide ideation, not death by suicide. Despite being a less than perfect proxy for suicide, suicide ideation is both an antecedent risk factor for suicide as well as a mental health issue in and of itself. Second, participants were predominantly female university undergraduates. Although findings from analogue and clinical samples in depression and attribution research are generally consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748175612451744">Vredenburg, Flett, &amp; Krames, 1993</xref>), replication of current results with other populations (e.g., clinical patients, incarcerated offenders) will establish the generalizability of present findings. Third, the current research design was cross-sectional, limiting the ability to draw causal inferences. Are the psychological predictors studied here causes of suicide ideation, does suicide ideation cause depression, hopelessness, and psychache, or does some yet unspecified variable result in changes in suicide ideation, depression, hopelessness, and psychache? Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine temporal ordering and the drawing of stronger causal inferences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in supporting the differentiation of constructs of depression, hopelessness, and psychache, findings of the present research were the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0748175612451744" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Items from scales of depression, hopelessness, and psychache measure three distinct, correlated factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Factors of depression, hopelessness, and psychache each contribute to statistically predicting suicide ideation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collectively, depression, hopelessness, and psychache demonstrate differential patterns of association with suicidality with psychache’s relevance becoming more prominent with more lethal aspects of suicide ideation.</p></list-item></list>

<p>The lack of full mediation is also indicated by the presence of significant regression weights for each predictor in the simultaneous regressions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175612451744">Table 3</xref>).</p></fn>
