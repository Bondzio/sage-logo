<title>Screening for Lung Cancer in High-Risk Populations</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, and the majority of lung cancers are diagnosed at a late stage. This has prompted many groups to look into effective screening strategies to reduce lung cancer mortality in high-risk populations (generally defined as 45- to 60-year-old current or former smokers). Initial nonrandomized, uncontrolled screening studies in the 1950s (eg, the Philadelphia Pulmonary Neoplasm Research Project, Veterans Administration Trial, and South London Lung Cancer Study) were not able to show any significant benefit from screening chest radiographs (chest X-rays). Randomized, controlled studies in the 1970s (eg, the Mayo Lung Project) that used frequent chest X-rays for lung cancer screening proved that more early stage lung cancers could be detected and treated; however, in the final analysis, lung cancer survival was the same in both the screened and control groups. The ineffectiveness of chest X-rays was confirmed more recently by the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Randomized Trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812447167">1</xref></sup> In this trial, 154,901 patients (age range, 55-74 years) were randomized to annual chest X-rays for 4 years compared with usual medical care. There was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality between the 2 groups.</p>
<p>However, unlike the use of screening chest X-rays, investigation into screening with low-radiation-dose computed tomography (low-dose CT) has yielded promising results. Annual low-dose CTs were able to greatly improve the diagnosis of early lung cancer in the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP) and as a result were also predicted to be highly cost-effective. In the ELCAP study, the 10-year survival rate was 88% for patients with clinical Stage I lung cancers. Among the 302 patients with Stage I disease undergoing surgical resection within 1 month of diagnosis, the survival rate was 92%; 8 patients with clinical Stage I disease did not receive therapy, and all died within 5 years of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812447167">2</xref></sup> However, other studies looking at low-dose CT scans as screening tools, as with chest X-rays, postulated that only overdiagnosis and high false positive rates increased, without affecting lung cancer mortality. Clearly, low-dose CTs have diagnostic limitations for certain body types, and given the lack of contrast, but as a screening tool the ELCAP’s results were promising.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a groundbreaking multicenter trial, was published by the NLST Research Team in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812447167">3</xref></sup> From August 2002 through April 2004, 53,454 high-risk individuals (defined as age 55-74 years, with at least a 30 pack-year cigarette smoking history, and if a former smoker, had quit in the past 15 years) were randomized to low-dose CT or chest X-ray with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. These individuals were screened 3 times at 1-year intervals and were followed through December 2009. These low-dose CTs required 1.5 mSv compared with the average diagnostic chest CT’s 8 mSv and approximately 0.1 mSv for chest X-rays. Overall, 4.0% of patients were diagnosed with lung cancer in the low-dose CT group (1060 cancers in 26,722 screened) compared with 3.5% in the chest X-ray group (941 cancers in 26,732 screened). There was a relative reduction in lung cancer mortality of 20% in the low-dose CT group (356 lung cancer deaths in the low-dose CT group and 443 lung cancer deaths in the chest X-ray group). It is surprising that there was also a 6.7% relative reduction in death from any cause in the low-dose CT group (1877 deaths in the low-dose CT group compared to 2000 deaths in the chest X-ray group). This landmark trial has initiated a renewed interest in lung cancer screening, and further trials are ongoing to determine whether or not it will be feasible to offer yearly low-dose CTs to at-risk populations, given the established mortality benefit. The impact of overdiagnosis and interval cancers (those detected within a year after a negative or missed screening) on the results of the NLST remains to be clarified. A recent cost-effectiveness analysis has evaluated the national expense of such screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812447167">4</xref></sup> It has been estimated that such screening will add $1.3 to $2.0 billion in annual national health care costs for screening uptake rates of 50% to 75%, respectively. Screening may prevent up to 8100 premature lung cancer deaths at a 75% screening rate, but the additional cost of screening to avoid 1 lung cancer death is approximately $240,000. Still, the results of this study have already been “practice changing.” The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CTs in high-risk individuals as defined by the NLST, and this is a Category 1 recommendation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812447167">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Second Lung Cancers in Patients with History of Head and Neck Cancer</title>
<p>With regard to head and neck cancer patients after definitive therapy, head and neck oncologists and otolaryngologists typically order surveillance chest X-rays as a part of routine surveillance for second primary lung cancer. PET CT has been used after therapy for head and neck cancer to assess response, to differentiate tumor recurrence from necrosis, and to help predict the need for neck dissection. Still, the role of PET CT in surveillance for treated head and neck cancer is unknown. Patients with previously treated head and neck cancers, particularly patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers, have a high risk of developing second primary lung cancers. A case-control study by Dikshit et al evaluated second primary cancers in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma patients and showed a 6.3% rate of lung cancer (55 of 876 patients) with a 21-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812447167">6</xref></sup> Holland et al retrospectively reviewed T1/T2 laryngeal cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy with a median follow-up of 68 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812447167">7</xref></sup> This study showed an 11.7% rate of second lung cancers (28 of 240 patients). The median time to the development of a lung second malignancy was 19 months. Notably, 86% of patients who developed a second lung cancer died from it with a median survival of 4 months. Similarly, Gao et al reviewed second primaries in 20,074 laryngeal cancer patients using the SEER database (1973-1996) and found that the 10- and 20-year cumulative risks of secondary lung cancers were 11% and 19%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812447167">8</xref></sup> The overall survival difference between patients who developed second lung cancers compared to those who did not was significant, with a 15-year actuarial overall survival rate for those with a second lung cancer of only 10%. Sjogren et al evaluated second primary cancers in early (Tis-T1) glottis carcinomas diagnosed in the Netherlands between 1982 and 1993 with a median follow-up of 89 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812447167">9</xref></sup> The cumulative incidence of lung second cancers was 10.3%. In this report, they compared their findings to those of Fujita et al and Narayana et al, who studied similar groups and found an 11.3% and 10.4% cumulative incidence, respectively. Hsu et al conducted a retrospective study of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients and showed a 4.6% rate of lung cancer (18 of 392) after a median follow-up period of 73 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812447167">10</xref></sup> The 5-year overall survival was also significantly affected by second lung cancer primaries. In addition, Jayaprakash et al looked at 160,340 head and neck cancer patients in the SEER database from 1973 to 2006 and found that 5% developed a second lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812447167">11</xref></sup> Those that had larynx or hypopharynx cancer had a higher rate of second lung cancer than those with other primary cancers (oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx). The median time to development of lung cancer after head and neck cancer was 42 months, and the median survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer was only 7 months. The 5-year overall survival of patients with a prior head and neck cancer who developed a second lung cancer with localized, regional, and distant disease was 15.0%, 4.5%, and 1.6%, compared with survival of all patients with lung cancer of 52.9%, 24.0%, and 3.5%, respectively.</p>
<p>Although these studies are largely retrospective and therefore difficult to directly compare with each other, 2 points become clear: Lung cancer is common in head and neck cancer patients, and these second lung cancers are associated with a poor prognosis. The incidence of lung cancer in head and neck cancer patients appears to be high, specifically in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal primaries. The incidence of second lung cancers in select retrospective head and neck cancer series, and the results of the NLST are reviewed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812447167"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Currently, the NCCN guidelines recommend chest imaging in follow-up for head and neck cancer patients “as clinically indicated.” Low-dose chest CT is intriguing given the positive results of the NLST. Low-dose chest CTs are fast and expose the patient to less radiation than standard CT or PET CT. Of course, standard CT offers better diagnostic quality and, if contrast is used, better evaluation of the regional lymph nodes. PET CT is costly but can allow functional imaging based on glucose metabolism and can potentially image beyond the chest. Since head and neck cancer patients are at a high risk for deadly second primary lung cancer, and we now have evidence that low-dose CTs save lives in high-risk populations, low-dose CT scans may play an integral part in the follow-up of head and neck cancer patients. Future studies will hopefully clarify whether or not surveillance low-dose CTs should be considered standard of care for head and neck patients.</p>
