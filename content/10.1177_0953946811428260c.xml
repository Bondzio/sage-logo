<p>Despite its subtitle, this is not really a book about race. The problem of race in the modern world is a symptom—one that is virulent and powerful—but a symptom nonetheless. But a symptom of what? Given the historical perseverance of racialised cultural constructions it seems odd, to say the least, that Christian theologians seem never to have gotten to the bottom of the problem. More pointedly, they seem not to have even made a beginning in analysing it.</p>
<p>The reason that they have not, of course, is that race is a non-entity, a conceptual mistake, a projected fantasy of superiority. At least since the civil-rights era Christians can agree that racism is immoral, and therefore Christians ought not to practise it in any form. Yet it persists, even among Christians, its power seemingly not vanquished, even if it seems to have mutated into less obvious forms. ‘Nothing to see here’, the theological establishment says, ‘move on to more pressing issues’—usually adjudged to be the secularisation of the church bequeathed by the Enlightenment, with its rejection of tradition and a gospel of individualism joined at the hip with a proceduralist morality.</p>
<p>In this remarkable book Willie Jennings battles valiantly to overturn these dominant sensibilities, with no little success. Far too infrequently these days does a work appear in the academic press whose decades of maturation are apparent in the scope, penetration and conceptual integration on display. One can only agree with Jennings’ impulse, however, to explain why such a book does not easily yield its considerable riches. His suggestion that race is a gesture born of the loss of consciousness of place is counterintuitive to the modern mind, to say the least.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Geography matters for race as well as for identity, vision, and the hope of how one might live life. It is this deep connection between place and identity that will be difficult for many to grasp because people have been formed in a world in which such connections are only imagined, only fictions enabled solely by volition and market desire, the parents of private property… There is no mystery to race. But until we reckon with its substitution for place and place-centered identity, its power will remain and remain mysteriously ever renewing with each generation of race-formed children (p. 289).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A formulation of the problem of race as a problem of our relation to geography and relationships leads very quickly into a much broader theological inquiry. How does modern (western developed world) Christianity train its theologians, perpetuating the bifurcated Christianities that seem inevitably to worship in groups demarcated by different coloured skin? How have Christians understood themselves and their relation to the Jews? What are the doctrines of creation and redemption that perpetuate racial, class, cultural and national divisions between Christians and between churches?</p>
<p>These questions are not being asked in a purely intellectual register. Because they are not, they lead further into wide-ranging investigations of the changes in commerce and property usage we commonly refer to as globalisation with its concomitant assumption that humanity today no longer need define its identity with relation to place. Miroslav Volf voices a dominant theological response to globalisation, seeing in its reduction of the linkage of individual and place a new freedom for individuals to pursue ‘several consecutive careers in rapidly changing work environments; their occupational decisions need not be irrevocable commitments but can be repeatedly made in a continuous dialogue between their preferences and talents on the one hand, and the existing job opportunities on the other’ (Miroslav Volf, <italic>Work in the Spirit: Toward a Theology of Work</italic> [Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, 2001], p. 116).</p>
<p>Jennings offers the opposite reading of these trends, understanding them rather to represent the failure of Christian theology. The origin of this failure is a theological mistake gestated in Christian supersessionism and finding its definitive enactment in the Christian baptising of western colonialism. In the period when Christianity was forced to theologically articulate its relation to formerly unknown peoples, instead of finding a way to treat them as possessing knowledge of God’s creation that might enrich Christianity, they were deracinated, uprooted, made portable, individual, and, finally, property valuable only for their extractable labour. People who formerly understood themselves as part of kinship groups living in specific places, with specific relations to particular geographical features, flora and fauna, were perceived by western colonists not in terms of their own self understandings, but through a hierarchical grid keyed to skin colour. This grid boiled all human cultural and individual difference down to a highly individualised new identity visible on the surface of the skin. This new racial identity made it possible to sort people on the basis of their supposed intellectual and dispositional capacities, whether for the purposes of work or discipleship. In this activity ‘racial agency and especially whiteness rendered unintelligible and unpersuasive any narratives of the collective self that bound identity to geography, to earth, to water, trees, and animals’ (p. 59).</p>
<p>Given this situation, the main analytical task of theology, Jennings suggests, is to intellectually grasp the operation of this new matrix of identity, the whiteness scale. The practical effect of this scale has been to provide a conceptuality to replace the unquestioned assumption of previous civilisations that individuals and peoples are not portable, that where they lived mattered for who they were. Jennings is keen to stress that this replacement of one identity matrix with another was not an intellectual task accomplished by a lone thinker reflecting on a dream in an overly-warm room. Indigenes’ old identities had to be stripped by violent political force, in the new world by forced collectivisation, labour camps and the destruction of local fauna by imported animals, like sheep; in Africa through the breaking down of kinship suzerainty through the introduction of an early version of ‘free trade’, the training in commodification that would lead to the selling of bodies to slavers. Only when forced do people relinquish their sense that they are part of a family, located on some piece of earth, speaking the same language, eating food made for generations from what the land of that area produces. But once that force has been applied, new means of self-identification must be offered, new identities that are portable and not linked to kinship or diet or place. Only the wide allocation of such new identities will make possible the efficient sifting of productive bodies from unproductive. That passport we call race.</p>
<p>Economic considerations drove the construction of this racial system, but Christianity justified it. The destruction of indigenous worlds of meaning could only be called Christian if with the new identity being bestowed came the saving of souls. But the habit of grading humans by usefulness according to skin colour was difficult to contain, and so the political and economic necessity of organising the recently uprooted indigenes found its way into the church. As one sixteenth-century missionary to the new world put it, while the apostles ‘bore anything’ <italic>for</italic> those to whom they were sent, what these colonial missionaries saw themselves to be bearing was the inherent inferiority of those they were evangelising: ‘For in our case it is the stupidity and the ignorance of the Barbarians that militates against us…’ (p. 104).</p>
<p>This assessment of the missiological task of the church in the new world was uttered by the intelligent, pious and spectacularly well-trained Jesuit, José de Acosta Porres, tasked by the Spanish King with establishing the church and seminaries of Peru. As a theologian trained in the sophisticated Thomism of his time, he well understood the details and cosmic scope of scholastic theology and, as a Jesuit, he understood the importance of instilling habits of piety and education as the foundations on which a lasting Latin American Christianity could be built.</p>
<p>Christianity in this register is first one that must be taught; Christian habits must be inculcated. In one of the most breathtaking passages in the book, Jennings prosecutes a frontal attack on the reigning conceptual frame of his own educational context: Acosta’s program of training Christians and sanctioning the reordering of their lives for imperial profit is done in the name of what we today call good MacIntyrean character formation. It is because he has a thoroughly Thomist account of formation as preceding discipleship that Acosta believes there can be no inclusion of indigenes in the church without the preparation of habit formation, no Christian embrace in brotherly love without a gauntlet of evaluation.</p>

<p>Christians suffer in the New World not with the native inhabitants but with their weaknesses—moral, spiritual, intellectual, and environmental. These native weaknesses engender weaknesses in the Spanish in terms of the deficient Christian workers who are drawn to the New World as well as the corruption of their moral strength. Such a vision of suffering will be repeated countless times as colonialist Christianity grows in new worlds (p. 106).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The implicit criticism here of theology departments preaching a Christian duty of ‘excellence of formation’ while looking askance at students whose supposed ‘cultural inferiority’ will ‘undermine the intellectual standard of the institution’ is made explicit in a criticism of the way modern theological curriculum assumes there is a universal doctrinal content that can and should be separated from the way it has been enacted in the context of Christian mission. The problem of modern theology is not at root its subversion by Enlightenment rationalism and capitalist individualism (though those are a problem) but the prior and largely unexamined reformulations of theology as a ‘universal package’ serving the interests of (white) Christian missionaries and merchants as they ‘civilised’ new worlds. This alienation undergirds the split in modern theology between those who analyse the lived existence of faith, whether in cultural studies or practical theology or ethics, and those who ‘turned their attention to safeguarding or refashioning Christian intellectual life as that life entered the deep waters of modernity’ (p. 116). The lack of any intellectually serious interest in the deformations introduced into Christian theology in the missiology of the colonial era explains the relative disinterest of the modern theological academy in the lived Christian life as well as its fascination with the highly intellectualised problems introduced by the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>This is all incredibly bold material, presented with far more subtlety than a short review can reproduce. And there is more, much more: the problems and promise of vernacular Bible translation in colonial contexts, the contortions generated by the ingested racial scales of converted and freed slaves, the inevitability and intractability of cultural superiorities that plague even the secular age tied up with literature, languages and nationality. The whole yields a rather darkly persuasive sense of the vast distance between modern Christians and any sort of Christianity that can make sense of the joining of Jew and Gentile that seems such an obvious feature of the New Testament witness.</p>
<p>But Jennings does not leave us in this darkness, concluding his treatment with a well-developed and biblically articulated theology of emplacedness. It turns out that the real unreality of race is an artifact of a doctrine of redemption evacuated of a meaningful account of creation. This emphasis on the importance of Christian action being attuned to its local context has become rather trendy of late. James Hunter, for instance, is the most recent representative of Reformed culture-making dominion theology, now cast as a ‘theology of faithful presence’: ‘we are to be fully present to each other within the community of faith and fully present to those who are not…we imitate our creator and redeemer: we pursue each other, identify with each other, and direct our lives toward the flourishing of each other through sacrificial love’ (James Davidson Hunter, <italic>To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World</italic> [New York: Oxford University Press, 2010], p. 244). What this means, in the end, is using the cultural influence Christians have to ‘engage the world, to shape it and finally change it for the better’ (Hunter, p. 4).</p>
<p>Jennings’ treatment exposes the platitudinous nature of such formulations, demanding far more depth and bite from the doctrine of creation. Jennings draws his story of our social context together by comparing it to that attempt to recreate creation that was the slave ship, in which humans are rendered commoditised, racialised, dislocated, globalised bodies. This is the beginning of the social world in which a contemporary recovery of the truth of creation must take place. Because we exist in social worlds that have both misnamed our bodiliness (by naming us white or black or brown) and severed us from any meaningful identification with the concrete created world at our fingertips and under our soles, the doctrine of creation is far more important and has far more work to do than simply laying down a demand for ‘servant leadership’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A Christian doctrine of creation should not be articulated as though it is first an academic dissertation about divine power and ownership or human stewardship of the earth or about theoretical possibilities of the exact nature of human origins or about the precise relationship between biblical accounts of creation and the actual cosmic order of material existence. A Christian doctrine of creation is first a doctrine of place and people, of divine love and divine touch, of human presence and embrace, and of divine and human interaction. It is first a way of seeing place in its fullest sense. Christianity is in need of place to be fully Christian (p. 248).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The categorical difference between the account of the moral and theological importance of place displayed in the accounts of Hunter and Jennings indicates why the most important contribution of this book is its highly developed and clearly articulated sense of how Christian doctrine and the gospel is co-opted by being unreflectively set within more grammatically basic discourses and practices—in this case habits of economics and property usage that deny any theological validity to human claims to attachment to any place on God’s earth.</p>
<p>Jennings does offer his own sophisticated biblical theology of place in the final chapter of the book. He discerns in the story of (biblical) Israel a vision of peoples as divinely created relational spaces, being bonded together, not by their place, but in being divinely gathered and sent, and so <italic>given</italic> a place. Unlike the nations, Israel is not the product of local kinship and place, but exists because God’s election has proceeded and claimed individuals and groups of humans for kinship and emplaced them in a specific place in God’s globe. Israel has a collective identity and a place because God has thus first <italic>come between them</italic> as individuals and as collectives in places. But God has done so in order to give them both a literal geographic home, which shapes their self-understanding, and by drawing them into sedimented practices by which that place becomes theirs.</p>
<p>In Jesus Christ an invitation is offered to the gentiles to join Israel. This is not to tear (historical) Israel from its place, but is the creation of an intimacy between peoples that demands they learn to negotiate the things that make them the creatures they are, their cultures, their religions, their nations, their habits of procuring food and eating. Israel is not disembodied by the new covenant: rather, through them, gentiles become truly embodied. Gentiles come to know their place not as nature but as God’s creation, and other people not by a colour code, but as fully embodied, enculturated beings. In so doing they learn that the work of the Spirit is to draw humanity into the space which is Christ’s communion, begun in the space that is Israel. In this relational space they discover creation not by remaking other humans, but by taking their embodied and enculturated forms seriously. Here the divine redemptive activity is understood to be offering the antidote to a globalised world in which the doctrine of creation is taken to demand an ever-accelerating world and culture remaking. Instead, this account of redemption understands the doctrine of creation to force Christians to notice the sheer complexity and givenness of the people with whom they are drawn together in Christ, something that is only learned by those who first become disciples with them in the binding together of difference which is the work of Jesus Christ.</p>
