<p>With the rising popularity and variety of study Bibles and speciality Bibles, Bible Companions and Handbooks appear less frequently. The ESV Study Bible (Crossway, 2008) or The NIV Archaeological Study Bible (Zondervan, 2005), for instance, address issues according to chapter and verse of Scripture which in previous generations would have required picking up a reference Bible Companion or the like.</p>
<p><italic>The Eerdmans Companion to the Bible</italic> seeks to re-introduce the one volume reference companion to the modern reader. In the introductory section, Welcome to the Bible, the editors and contributors display their concern for the non-specialist contemporary reader, providing articles including: What is the Bible, Lands of the Bible, The Bible as Literature, and Archaeology of the Bible. The concluding section, The Bible and the Church, helps modern readers understand the Bible as the Guide for Christian Faith and Christian Living.</p>
<p>The bulk of <italic>The Eerdmans Companion</italic> is a full Bible Commentary, arranged by genre in each Testament, with substantial supplementary articles. Over fifty Who’s Who biblical studies scholars contribute nearly seventy-five articles pitched to the contemporary non-specialist. The Old Testament essays include: Creation and Modern Science, Old Testament History and History of Writing, Israel and Its Enemies in the Psalms, and Interpreting the Song of Songs. Within the New Testament Commentary, the Book of Acts receives the greatest number of scholarly articles, including: Paul’s Cities, Travel in the Roman Empire, and Christianity in the Eyes of Non-Christians. Five themes surface in articles across the Testaments: Society and Daily Life, Apocalyptic, Worship, Historical Reporting, and the Roles of Women.</p>
<p>For contemporary readers, the articles analyzing the roles of women hint at the unique contribution of <italic>Eerdmans Companion</italic>. The fact that the entire Bible Commentary section – roughly ninety percent of the volume’s 700 plus pages – is composed by a woman indeed sets the <italic>Eerdmans Companion</italic> apart from other single-volume reference works. Few companions of previous generations, or even modern study Bibles, provide feature articles on the roles of women in each Testament; rarely will a Bible companion provide a single author so much space. The entire commentary being composed by a woman is an aspect of this volume that breaks new ground. But what is equally unique is the lack of feminist agenda within such a framework. Connie Gundry Tappy judiciously treats passages (Genesis 3, Judges 5, 1 Corinthians 14; Ephesians 5, 1 Timothy 2; 1 Peter 3) whose contemporary interpretation often stimulates gender controversy. The editors note her as a free-lance author providing practical interpretation of the text – and she does.</p>
<p>Though <italic>Eerdmans Companion</italic> may provide a disproportionate concern for Women’s place in Scripture (the article on Roles of Women in the Old Testament is longer than articles on The Temple or Worship of Other Gods), the volume nonetheless provides contemporary readers male and female a lucid introduction to issues significant for interpreting the Bible, and easily readable prose commenting on each book.</p>
