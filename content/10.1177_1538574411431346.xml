<italic>Objective</italic>: To evaluate the results of a new thrombin sealant (Recothrom) for the treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms (PDAs). <italic>Methods</italic>: We reviewed 47 consecutive patients prospectively entered in a dedicated data set who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous thrombin injection to treat PDA.

The mean size of the PDA was 2.3 ± 0.9 cm. The mean injected volume was 2.4 ± 1.4 mL containing 500 ± 320 units. Recurrence of the PDA occurred in 4 (8.5%) patients and was not related to anticoagulation status, body habitus, platelets levels, or use of antiplatelets. All recurred PDAs were successfully sealed with a second (n = 3) and a third injection (n = 1). There was no distal embolization or allergic reactions and no surgical intervention was required. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The new human recombinant thrombin (Recothrom) is a safer nonimmunogenic option with similar success rates of other fibrin glue sealants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arterial pseudoaneurysm (PDA) is a known complication secondary to percutaneous interventions that occur in about 1% to 2% in high-volume centers.<sup>

</sup> Pseudoaneurysm etiology is multifactorial and has been related to hemostatic techniques after arterial catheter removal, sheath size, underlying arterial disease, body habitus, blood dyscrasia, and anticoagulation status.<sup>

<p>The mechanism of action of the thrombin sealants also called “fibrin glue” includes conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin polymers utilizing calcium and factor XIII.<sup>

<title>Methods</title>

<title>Patient Population and End Points</title>
<p>Data on 47 consecutive patients who underwent thrombin injection to treat PDA were prospectively collected between July 2008 and December 2010. The project was approved by the Stony Brook Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Patients with local skin infection, short and wide PDA neck (&gt;5 mm), anastomotic, and aortic or visceral artery PDA were excluded. All other patients with PDA regardless of any known allergic reactions in the past were included.</p>
<p>Pseudoaneurysm diagnosis was made by color flow duplex ultrasound (DUS). The criteria used were a cavity in continuity with the arterial wall at the puncture site dissecting into surrounding tissues with a swirling flow pattern and bidirectional flow in the neck. The PDA was characterized as simple when 1 lobe was identified or complex in the presence of 2 or more lobes. All patients were examined by experienced vascular technologists that had performed more than 1000 arterial DUS prior to the study. All examinations were supervised by at least 1 of the Vascular Surgery faculty members (N.L., A.G., D.L., and A.K.T.) who have significant experience on DUS and PDA injection.</p>
<p>A new recombinant thrombin solution, the Recothrom was utilized to treat all PDA. The product is commercialized in vials containing lyophilized powder that is reconstituted using a supplied diluent for less than 1 minute at room temperature. The area of interest was prepared with povidone–iodine. A 21-gauge needle was guided by DUS toward the PDA on B-mode imaging. Once the needle was positioned in the PDA, the color Doppler mode was switched on and then thrombin glue was slowly injected. Pseudoaneurysm thrombosis was confirmed by the absence of color flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411431346">Figure 1</xref>
). The needle was withdrawn by slowly injecting thrombin into the needle path to avoid any bleeding at the puncture site. A DUS study was obtained after 24 hours to confirm PDA thrombosis and the status of the arteries and veins above, at, and below the injection. All patients had pedal pulses checked prior and postprocedure. Evaluation by Doppler flow velocities was utilized in patients who sustained known peripheral arterial disease with no palpable pulses. End points were PDA recurrence, need for reintervention, allergic reactions, and related complications such as limb ischemia or need for open repair.</p>

<title>Demographics and Clinical Presentation</title>
<p>Most patients were female (55%) and the mean age was 71 years (range 45-87). At the time of diagnosis, 40 (87%) patients had worsening of the ecchymosis and groin pain and half had a pulsatile mass. Forty (87%) patients were on aspirin, 37 (80%) on plavix, and 27 (57%) on both. Twelve (26%) patients were started on unfractionated heparin after the percutaneous procedure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574411431346">Table 1</xref>
). Twenty-nine (63%) patients had palpable pulses and the rest had biphasic Doppler signals at the ankle level. The mean time interval between the arterial puncture and the PDA diagnosis was 4 days ranging from 1 to 23 days. All 4 patients who had a PDA diagnosed with more than 7 days from the intervention were re-admitted to the hospital with groin pain worsening with or without enlarging ecchymosis.</p>

<title>Intervention and Ultrasonographic Data</title>
<p>Iatrogenic femoral artery PDA following cardiac catheterization was the leading cause of PDA in 41 (87%) patients. The procedures were evenly diagnostic or therapeutic. Sixteen (80%) patients who underwent therapeutic cardiac catheterization had at least 1 drug-eluting stent placed requiring long-term dual antiplatelet regimen. Other causes of PDA included peripheral endovascular interventions in 2, insertion of triple lumen catheter in 2, intra-aortic balloon pump removal and pacemaker implantation in 1 each. All but 3 PDAs originated from puncture sites in the common femoral artery with the right side being involved in 37 (84%) patients. The other 3 PDAs occurred due to endovascular instrumentation in the right subclavian, left distal femoral, and right common carotid artery caused by pacemaker placement, guide wire during femoral artery stenting, and triple lumen line placement. The most common arterial catheter or peripherally inserted arterial sheath size utilized was 6F (range, 5-8) in 27 patients (58%). Moderate thrombocytopenia (50 000-100 000 platelets) was detected only in 3 patients prior to the arterial access with mean platelet count of 218 000 (range, 82 000-900 000).</p>
<p>Different protocols of arterial closure postcardiac catheterization were utilized during the study period. Manual compression alone was applied in 17 (39%) cases. A compression device, FemStop (Radi Medical Systems Inc, Reading, Massachusetts), was applied on the puncture site in 9 (20%) patients following manual compression and in 6 (14%) patients immediately after sheath removal. Percutaneous closure devices were deployed in 10 (25%) patients. A 6F Angioseal (St Jude Medical, Minnetonka, Minnesota) was used in 9 patients and in one case a Perclose (Abbott, Redwood City, California).</p>
<p>The mean size of PDA was 2.3 ± 0.9 cm (range, 1.5-5 cm) and cross-sectional area of 3.8 ± 2.4 cm<sup>2</sup>. Complex configuration was found in 15 patients (32%). Of those 15 complex PDAs, only 2 cases required a second injection due to recurrence. Retroperitoneal hematoma was associated with PDA in 6 (13%) patients that occurred likely due to high supra-inguinal arterial access with back wall damage. Of those, 5 patients required transfusions of packed red blood cells (range, 1-3 units) and 2 fresh frozen plasma but no platelets. All patients were observed closely with none of them requiring any further intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538574411431346">
<title>Procedural Data and Outcomes</title>
<p>At the time of the PDA injection, none of the patients had therapeutic levels of anticoagulation with mean international normalized ratio of 1.2 ± 0.3 and activated partial thromboplastin time of 32 ± 8 seconds. All PDAs were treated with fibrin sealant injection at the time of diagnosis. The average volume injected was 2.4 ± 1.4 mL with a mean of 500 ± 320 units of Recothrom per patient.</p>
<p>Atypical location of the PDA was noted in 3 patients, one from the distal portion of the left femoral artery (FA), another one from the infraclavicular portion of the distal third of the left subclavian artery, and the last PDA originated from the right common carotid artery (CCA). The first 2 were related to inadvertent wire injury during pacemaker placement and femoral artery stenting. The CCA iatrogenic damage occurred during a renal transplant due to a misplaced triple lumen catheter. In both the CCA and FA injuries, the patients were anticoagulated during the respective procedures. All patients were diagnosed between 4 and 8 days after the arterial injury sustaining either a pulsatile mass associated with ecchymosis or local pain. A complete resolution of the PDA was achieved after the first intervention with thrombin sealant injection. The mean volume of Recothrom and additional information is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574411431346">Table 2</xref>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bovine thrombin preparation was first used under ultrasound guidance to treat arterial PDA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411431346">10</xref>
</sup> Because of the simplicity of the technique, short learning curve, low cost, and high success rate, this treatment has been adopted worldwide. A systematic review comparing surgical and nonsurgical PDA treatment demonstrated that fibrin sealants are an efficient technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411431346">11</xref>
</sup> Several single and multicenter reports have also demonstrated that thrombin sealants must be the first option to treat arterial PDA. Surgical repair should be reserved for cases with complicated anatomy (ie, no or very short and wide neck) or puncture site infection.<sup>

</p>
<p>Successful occlusion of the PDAs was achieved in 91.5% at the first attempt, 98% at second, and 100% at third attempt. Our results are comparable to other thrombin injection series<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411431346">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411431346">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411431346">14</xref>
</sup> that reported initial success rate of &gt;90%. Similar to other series, an association between either anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet regimen with PDA recurrence could not be demonstrated in our cohort.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411431346">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411431346">7</xref>
</sup> To date, the cause of PDA recurrence remains uncertain. A study of 54 consecutive patients who had common femoral artery PDA identified 5 (9%) early recurrences that were surgically repaired.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411431346">15</xref>
</sup> The possible causes stated were either an infected puncture site or extensive arteriotomy up to 0.8 cm create at the time of puncture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411431346">15</xref>
</sup> There is a trend to perform surgical intervention on the PDA after the first recurrence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411431346">15</xref>
</sup> All patients had resolution of the PDA with repeat injections with no complications or need for surgical intervention in this series. The shortcoming of multiple reinjections is perhaps a longer hospital length of stay for observation and DUS reevaluation. As the cost and the risk of a repeat thrombin injection is low, we advocate a second or yet third PDA injection in order to avoid a surgical procedure under anesthesia in patients with significant comorbidities based on our overall success rate (100%) with no complications.</p>
<p>Distal embolization from inadvertent intra-arterial injection remains the most cumbersome complication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411431346">16</xref>
</sup> None of our patients had distal embolization. It is important while performing thrombin injection to have precise needle tip placement by DUS, gentle and slow injection, and favorable PDA anatomy (ie, neck width &lt; 0.5 cm). In addition, injections aiming the neck of the PDA in an attempt to stop the incoming flow cause arterial thrombosis and therefore should be avoided.<sup>

<p>Bovine thrombin preparations have been utilized for decades although most recently a concern about allergic reactions and antibody formation has been raised.<sup>

</sup> The use of bovine thrombin sealants to achieve hemostasis in peripheral arterial bypass, liver, spine, and hemodialysis access surgery has been compared with recombinant human thrombin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411431346">8</xref>
</sup> A phase 3 trial demonstrated that antibodies were detected in 22% of patients following bovine thrombin injection compared to only 1.5% of those who underwent recombinant thrombin injection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411431346">8</xref>
</sup> Pooled data analysis of 8 studies (n = 583 patients) has also found that &lt;1% of the patients who had topical recombinant thrombin developed antibodies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411431346">17</xref>
</sup> In addition, the antibodies formed did not neutralize the native human thrombin. The limitations of our study include a retrospective design and no control groups for comparison with different modalities of treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of thrombin sealants for treatment of arterial PDA has replaced the surgical approach as first line due to high successful and low recurrence rates with reduced morbidity. Recothrom is a new recombinant human thrombin preparation that is an effective and less immunogenic option showing great results as the other thrombin sealant preparations.</p>
