<p>Newsflash! The health care environment is changing! And, whether we like it or not, so is AADE. We will always need to adjust in response to external changes, but do we constantly want to be in the position of having to react to what has happened? I think not. Instead, we want to have a proactive approach that positions us well to thrive not only in today’s environment, but also in the health care system of tomorrow.</p>
<p>AADE is a mission-driven association. We stay on target by focusing on our vision of <italic>optimal health and wellness for all people with diabetes and related chronic conditions</italic>. To achieve this vision, we concentrate our efforts on our mission of <italic>driving practice to promote healthy living through self-management of diabetes and related chronic conditions</italic>. And, we bring our mission to life through a strategic plan.</p>
<p>AADE’s current strategic plan concludes at the end of 2012, and your board of directors is actively engaged in developing the association’s next 3-year plan. This is the proactive part of what we do! As we plan for the future, we continue to work on our existing plan. As a reminder, public affairs, practice and research, and membership are the three overarching strategic goals guiding our current plan.</p>
<p>I’d like to highlight just a few of the accomplishments we achieved in 2011.</p>
<list id="list1-0145721712439860" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the public affairs arena, our Congressional sponsors have introduced bills in the US House and Senate. Have you spoken to your legislators in support of the Diabetes Self-Management Training Act yet? We also have ongoing activity toward state licensure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the practice and research front, we continue to gather information and add to the evidence base. Our 2011 Workforce Analysis was a core addition to the evidence base that will help us set the future strategic direction of the profession and the association. The key findings are available on the website for your review. AADE is also involved in some demonstration projects that examine the use of mHealth and evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes education in patient-centered medical home models of care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As for membership, this has certainly been one of our most visible changes. We added more than 1000 members last year! Many of our Coordinating Bodies are fully functional and others are well into the development process. Our SPGs transitioned into Communities of Interest, which are all accessible to every member. And, you voted to change our bylaws, so the Board now has a Member Affiliate Liaison who serves a 2-year term.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A full report of our activities in 2011 has been posted on the AADE website.</p>
<p>As you know, we are in the process of conducting a search for a new Chief Executive Officer for AADE. During this period of change and uncertainty, some would say that our association is vulnerable. Please be reassured that our association is in good hands. Our vision, mission, and strategic plan will continue to guide us throughout 2012. We are fortunate in that our staff team is stable and under the direction of a highly capable interim CEO.</p>
<p>You can continue to keep informed about AADE activities by reading eFYI, regularly checking the AADE website, engaging with us on social media outlets, and staying connected with your colleagues using the MY AADE NETWORK. I would also encourage you to attend one of the six regional meetings we have planned for this year. To find out which regions will host a meeting, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myaadenetwork.org/regionalprograms">www.myaadenetwork.org/regionalprograms</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Finally, please keep in mind that your elected board of directors and officers are committed to serve AADE. Each of us has a role as liaison to our Coordinating Bodies. If you do have questions or concerns, we are just an email or a network post away!</p>
