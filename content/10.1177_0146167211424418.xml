<abstract>
<p>Regulatory mode is a psychological construct pertaining to the self-regulatory orientation of individuals or teams engaged in goal pursuit. <italic>Locomotion</italic>, the desire for continuous progress or movement in goal pursuit, and <italic>assessment</italic>, the desire to critically evaluate and compare goals and means, are orthogonal regulatory modes. However, they are also complementary, in that both locomotion and assessment are necessary for effectual goal pursuit. In the present research, the authors sought to demonstrate that multilevel regulatory mode complementarity can positively affect individual-level performance on goal-relevant tasks. The authors recruited 289 employees (177 men, 112 women) from preexisting work teams in workplace organizations in Italy and obtained (a) employees’ individual-level scores on the Regulatory Mode Scale and (b) supervisor ratings of each employee’s work performance. The results supported the multilevel complementarity hypothesis for regulatory mode. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Consider briefly a tale of two companies. The ABC Company’s executive team is composed of some real go-getters. When they see an opportunity to take action, they move on it as quickly as possible, and they all like the feeling of getting things done; that is, all except Tom. Tom often brings an abrupt halt to the team’s lightning-speed progress by playing devil’s advocate or suggesting that the team slow down and consider their options. Meanwhile, at the XYZ Company, the executive team consists almost entirely of Toms. They hesitate before taking action and carefully scrutinize every option before deciding on a particular course to follow; that is, all except Terry. Terry often grows impatient with the team’s lack of progress, and many times she has pushed the reluctant team toward decisions they have not felt entirely prepared to make.</p>
<p>The above situation illustrates some important within-group differences in motivational orientation, differences that have the potential to undermine the team’s progress toward their goals. These differences could push a team member who possesses an opposite motivational orientation from that of the team (i.e., Tom or Terry) to stop contributing or leave altogether. However, it is also possible that team members’ differences in motivational orientation could, in some cases, actually <italic>enhance</italic> the performance not only of the team but also of certain individual members within it. In particular, the unique perspective of those individuals who are the most at odds with the “team personality” may, in fact, afford them certain advantages over those who already “fit” the team’s overall orientation. In what follows, we propose the theoretical basis for this idea and present original data relevant to the theory.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167211424418">
<title>Regulatory Mode and the Complementarity Hypothesis</title>
<p>The above tale of two companies demonstrates individual differences in a type of self-regulatory orientation known as <italic>regulatory mode</italic>. Regulatory mode is a psychological construct that pertains to the motivational or self-regulatory orientation of individuals and groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211424418">Higgins, Kruglanski, &amp; Pierro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Certain individuals or groups are much like the ABC Company’s executive team, characterized by the desire to move quickly toward their goals. Individuals or teams high in this self-regulatory orientation, known as <italic>locomotion</italic>, view the <italic>pursuit</italic> of goals as an end in itself; making progress <italic>is</italic> itself the goal, rather than the means to some other end. By contrast, some individuals or groups are more like the XYZ Company’s executive team, characterized by the desire to use the right or best means to reach one’s goals (or to determine which goals would be right or best to pursue). Individuals or teams high in this self-regulatory orientation, known as <italic>assessment</italic>, are most concerned with the evaluative aspect of goal pursuit; for high assessors, doing it fast is not nearly as important as doing it right.</p>
<p>Regulatory mode as a psychological construct was initially developed and validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al. (2000)</xref> in a series of studies. Specifically, their research established content, construct, and predictive validity for two 12-item scales measuring locomotion and assessment (provided in the appendix). The scales were each found to be internally consistent, unidimensional, and only weakly correlated with one another. Likewise, locomotion showed convergent validity with such constructs as conscientiousness, intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations, and mastery goal orientation, whereas assessment showed convergent validity with fear of invalidity, neuroticism, and extrinsic motivational orientation. However, none of the correlations reported across 13 samples, and no fewer than three dozen constructs accounted for more than 32% of the variance in either scale.</p>
<p>The regulatory mode scales of locomotion and assessment have been widely used in subsequent research and have shown extensive predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211424418">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Both high assessors and high locomotors possess certain strengths, as well as particular weaknesses, in the self-regulatory aspects of goal pursuit. For instance, high locomotors and high assessors exemplify a trade-off between speed and accuracy in goal-relevant tasks, where locomotors are more concerned with speed and assessors more concerned with accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, although high locomotors are particularly decisive, task oriented, and prone to faster paced goal pursuit activities, high assessors are skilled at prioritizing among multiple goals, generating a variety of means that could be used in goal pursuit, and carefully evaluating the various goal pursuit paths before choosing one on which to embark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211424418">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has generally supported the notion that locomotion and assessment are largely orthogonal regulatory modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211424418">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>; Kruglanski, Pierro, Mannetti, &amp; Higgins, ); therefore, individuals can be high on locomotion alone, high on assessment alone, high on both, or high on neither. Moreover, the unique strengths (and weaknesses) of individuals high on either regulatory mode alone suggest that both high locomotion and high assessment may be necessary for optimally effective goal pursuit. This idea, known as the <italic>complementarity hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2010</xref>), could hold within individuals, across individuals within the same team (e.g., the ABC or XYZ companies above), or across multiple levels of analysis (e.g., leaders and subordinates). A small but growing body of research supports the complementarity hypothesis at multiple levels of analysis and demonstrates the critical roles of both locomotion and assessment for self-regulation and similar goal-relevant activities. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al. (2000)</xref> showed that individuals who are high on both regulatory modes tend to perform exceptionally well in goal pursuit and achievement. One study found that a main effect of locomotion on college GPA was qualified by an interaction with assessment (Study 7). The effect of locomotion was observed only among those high in assessment; this effect disappeared for those low in assessment. The same pattern held for individuals in rigorous and challenging Army Ranger training; locomotion scores predicted success rates only for those high in assessment (Study 8). These findings demonstrate that locomotion and assessment can act as complementary self-regulatory orientations within individuals, thus enhancing the goal-relevant performance of those who are high on both regulatory modes.</p>
<p>Although much of the research on regulatory mode has examined such <italic>within-individual</italic> complementarities in locomotion and assessment strength, recent theory and research have shown that similar phenomena can also occur <italic>between</italic> individuals to affect goal-relevant outcomes. For instance, researchers have theorized that <italic>group-level</italic> complementarities in locomotion and assessment strength could affect various goal-relevant outcomes, including group-level performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2010</xref>). In one study that tested this hypothesis, groups composed entirely of assessors or locomotors alone were at a disadvantage with regard to either speed or accuracy, respectively, Pierro, Mannetti, Higgins, &amp; Kruglanski, 2009). However, groups composed of equal parts locomotors and assessors performed (a) just as quickly as groups entirely composed of locomotors and (b) just as accurately as groups entirely composed of assessors.</p>
<p>Both the within-individual and within-group complementarity effects outlined above are characterized by one common feature: The independent and dependent variables operate within the same level of analysis. That is, within-individual complementarity affects individual-level performance, and within-group complementarity affects group-level performance. What these studies did not address is whether <italic>cross-level</italic> complementarity effects occur, such that group-level complementarity in regulatory mode affects individual-level performance. These cross-level effects should manifest as statistical interactions of group-level locomotion or assessment and individual-level assessment or locomotion, respectively. This study is the first to our knowledge to hypothesize a cross-level complementarity hypothesis for regulatory mode. In the present research, we tested this hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167211424418">
<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>The notion that complementarity effects can occur across levels of analysis is important for several reasons. For one, people are often rewarded for their work in a variety of settings at the <italic>individual</italic> level, rather than the team level, necessitating the creation of an entire field dedicated to organizational justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167211424418">Greenberg, 1990</xref>). In the workplace, individuals receive bonuses, promotions, and other perks that reward them for their team’s efforts, or for their individual contributions to the team. Cross-level complementarity effects for regulatory mode would demonstrate that the motivational orientation of the group can effect important outcomes for individuals who compose the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211424418">Johns, 2006</xref>). If such effects occur, it is critical to understand how regulatory mode composition of the team can reflect on, or directly affect, the performance of individual team members. This will enable organizations to design more effective and fair individual-level reward strategies for team work.</p>
<p>In addition, cross-level complementarity effects would illustrate advantages and disadvantages to having a specific type of deep-level diversity in teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211424418">Harrison, Price, &amp; Bell, 1998</xref>), namely, diversity of regulatory mode. Organizations may wish to screen individuals for motivational personality characteristics such as regulatory mode to determine their fit to a preexisting team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211424418">Tett &amp; Burnett, 2003</xref>). These organizations would need to consider the current composition of the team in terms of regulatory mode and then assess which strengths are still needed to maximize the efficacy of the team as a whole as well as the efficacy of its individual members.</p>
<p>In the present research, we explored the cross-level hypothesis that team-level complementarity in regulatory mode would affect individual-level performance. To address this question, we examined preexisting work teams composed of various combinations of locomotors and assessors. These preexisting team compositions resulted in some teams (at the aggregate team level) being high on one regulatory mode, some high on both, and some high on neither. Likewise, individuals within these teams were free to vary on regulatory mode strength as an individual differences variable; therefore, some individuals possessed the same regulatory mode strength as the rest of their team, whereas others did not.</p>
<p>In this study, we were interested in testing a cross-level complementarity hypothesis, and so we were primarily concerned with the cross-level interaction effect of (a) individual-level regulatory mode strength and (b) team-level regulatory mode strength on individual-level performance. Specifically, we hypothesized that complementarity effects on individual-level performance would occur for those individuals who possess the <italic>complementary</italic> regulatory mode relative to that of their team. In other words, we should see two cross-level interactions, one for high assessors in high locomotion teams and one for high locomotors in high assessment teams. In teams that were high on team-level locomotion, we predicted that individuals high on assessment would perform best, as compared with individuals high on locomotion or low on either locomotion or assessment. Likewise, within teams that were high on team-level assessment, we predicted that individuals high on locomotion would perform best, as compared with individuals high on assessment or low on either locomotion or assessment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0146167211424418">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>On a voluntary basis, 289 employees (177 men and 112 women) from four Italian organizations (a bank, <italic>n</italic> = 120; a social security public institution, <italic>n</italic> = 51; a mechanical industrial group, <italic>n</italic> = 57; and a hospital, <italic>n</italic> = 61), and divided into 42 teams (work groups) participated in this research. Employees’ mean age was 43 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.67), their mean job tenure was about 18 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.52; min = 1, max = 38), and the mean group size was 7.98 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.63).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0146167211424418">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The questionnaires administered to participants included an introductory letter in which the purpose of the study was explained. Anonymity was guaranteed.</p>
<p>Participants filled out the Regulatory Mode Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>) inquiring into their locomotion and assessment tendencies; this was followed by a number of filler questionnaires to distract from the purpose of the study. As a major dependent variable, we used an independent outcome index, namely, a measure of subordinates’ performance as rated by their supervisors.</p>
<sec id="section6-0146167211424418">
<title>Assessing locomotion and assessment</title>
<p>The Italian version of the Locomotion and Assessment Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>) constitutes two separate 12-item self-report measures designed to tap individual differences in these tendencies (see the appendix). Specifically, respondents rate the extent to which they agree with self-descriptive statements reflecting <italic>locomotion</italic> (e.g., “By the time I accomplish a task, I already have the next one in mind”) or <italic>assessment</italic> (e.g., “I spend a great deal of time taking inventory of my positive and negative characteristics”). Ratings are made on a 6-point Likert-type scale with the response alternatives anchored at the ends with 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) and 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). We computed two composite scores (one for Locomotion and one for Assessment) by averaging across responses to each Locomotion and Assessment item, respectively.</p>
<p>Previous studies including Italian samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>) have demonstrated that the Locomotion and Assessment scales have satisfactory reliability (Cronbach’s α = .82 for the Locomotion scale and .78 for the Assessment scale). In this sample, the alpha for the locomotion scale was .79 and the alpha for the assessment scale was .70. The mean locomotion score was 4.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.64), and the mean assessment score was 3.56 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.70). In this sample, the two scales were only weakly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), consistent with previous studies that have generally found a mixed pattern of weak correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0146167211424418">
<title>Team regulatory mode orientations</title>
<p>Although the regulatory mode orientations were measured at the individual level, for the purposes of this study, we also aggregated these orientations at the team level. In general, researchers typically compute group-level variables by using the within-group average for each group as a whole, i.e., the group mean of the construct. However, a major problem this method poses for our cross-level research question is circularity or dependence of the data, because the individual is also a member of the group (see for discussion of this problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211424418">Kenny, Mannetti, Pierro, Livi, &amp; Kashy, 2002</xref>). To model group effects differently than the traditional approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211424418">Kenny et al. (2002)</xref> have suggested that researchers incorporate in their multilevel modeling a model known as the actor–partner interdependence model (APIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211424418">Kashy &amp; Kenny, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211424418">Kenny &amp; Cook, 1999</xref>), originally proposed for the analysis of dyadic data. When applied to the study of groups, this model is known as the group actor–partner interdependence model, or GAPIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211424418">Kenny &amp; Garcia, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211424418">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the GAPIM, the group effect is viewed as the mean of the other members of the group (i.e., the group mean, but excluding the focal individual). We believe that this method provides a more appropriate way of modeling the group effects in our “frogs and ponds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211424418">Davis, 1966</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211424418">Kenny et al., 2002</xref>) or cross-level complementarity model, where we hypothesized that complementarity effects on individual-level performance would occur for those individuals (i.e., Tom or Terry in our example) who possess the <italic>complementary</italic> regulatory mode relative to that of their team (i.e., the remaining members of the team in this case). Accordingly, in this study the team locomotion and assessment orientations were computed as the within-group average, but excluding the focal individual for each team (for similar approach, also see the person–team fit tradition studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211424418">Kristof-Brown, Barrick, &amp; Stevens, 2005</xref>). To reduce confusion with terminology used in the dyadic version of the APIM (in which there is a term called <italic>partner</italic>), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211424418">Kenny and Garcia’s (2010a)</xref> suggestion, from now on we use the term <italic>others</italic> (i.e., the remaining members of the team) to refer to the team regulatory mode orientations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167211424418">1</xref></sup> Finally, to control for the degree of nonindependence between pairs of group members the compound symmetry assumption was imposed on the variance–covariance matrix of random effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211424418">Kenny et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167211424418">
<title>Supervisors’ ratings of subordinates’ performance</title>
<p>Participants’ performance was measured by supervisors’ ratings on a two-item instrument. Specifically, we asked supervisors to appraise the performance of their employees (i.e., research participants) over the past year (note that, as mentioned above, the minimum of participants’ job tenure was 1 year), by responding to the following items: (a) “In terms of percentage, to what extent were the employee’s objectives reached during the last year?” This item was rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>10%</italic>) to 10 (<italic>100%</italic>). (b) “How do you evaluate the employee’s performance in the last year?” This item was rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>extremely negative</italic>) to 10 (<italic>extremely positive</italic>). We computed a composite performance score by averaging across responses to each item (Cronbach’s α = .95). Mean performance score was 7.01 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.65).</p>

<p>To test our cross-level complementarity hypothesis (i.e., an interaction between individual and other team members’ regulatory modes), we used multilevel modeling. In the analysis, we entered as fixed the main effects of (a) locomotion and (b) assessment at the <italic>individual</italic> level, the main effects of (c) locomotion and (d) assessment of the other members of the team, and (e) the <italic>interactions</italic> between individual and others’ regulatory mode orientations (i.e., individual-locomotion × others-locomotion, individual-locomotion × others-assessment, individual-assessment × others-assessment, individual-assessment × others-locomotion). Although we are interested in this study in the <italic>individual–others interactions</italic>, to separate (and control for) them from within level interactions, we also entered the individual-locomotion × individual-assessment and the others-locomotion × others-assessment interactions. To reduce multicollinearity and facilitate the interpretability of the effects, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211424418">Kenny and Garcia’s (2010b)</xref> suggestions, we first grand mean centered the individual regulatory mode scores, and then we also grand mean centered the others’ regulatory mode scores. Thus, the interaction terms were based on these centered scores. In addition, as control variables, we also entered the gender, age, job seniority, organization (represented by three dummy variables: organization A vs. B, C, D; organization B vs. A, C, D; organization C vs. A, B, D) and the team size (team-level variable). Finally, only the intercept was a random effect, entered at the team level. Therefore, our presentation of results focuses on the fixed effects.</p>
<p>We estimated the above “complete” model, which is referred to as Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167211424418">Table 2</xref>. To further test competing models with individual-others complementarity effects, we also estimated two other submodels: (a) first a base model including only the main effect of control variables and the main and interaction effects of individual regulatory mode orientations, without the main and interaction effects of other-members’ constructs (only individual effects model, Model 1) and (b) a second model adding to the first model the main and interaction effects of other-members regulatory mode, without the cross-level interaction effects (individual and others’ effects model, Model 2). Thus, in Model 3 we added to the second model the interaction effects between individual and others’ regulatory mode orientations. These multilevel models were analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. To assess the improvement in model fit by passing from Model 1 to Model 2 and 3, we considered the reduction in deviance and SABIC (sample-size-adjusted Bayesian information criterion) statistics. These indices assess the global fit of each of the proposed three models: The smaller deviance and SABIC means a better fitting model. Results of analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167211424418">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167211424418">Table 2</xref>, the analysis estimating the first model (only individual level effects) yielded a significant and positive main effect of individual-locomotion on performance (<italic>b</italic> = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that performance ratings were more positive for higher locomotion individuals. More importantly, there was also a significant and positive interaction effect of individual-locomotion × individual-assessment (<italic>b</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thus supporting Kruglanski et al.’s (2000) results. Note that these main (<italic>b</italic> = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and interaction effects (<italic>b</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) remained unchanged when we also entered, in the second model, the effect of other-members’ locomotion (<italic>ns</italic>) and other-members’ assessment (<italic>ns</italic>) scores and the interaction between them (<italic>ns</italic>). Finally, the analysis estimating Model 3 (individual by others interaction effects model) yielded, again, a significant and positive main effect of individual-locomotion (<italic>b</italic> = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). No main or interaction effects of individual regulatory modes emerged in this analysis. Thus, the within-individual interaction effect present in the first two models vanished (<italic>b</italic> = .10, <italic>ns</italic>) in Model 3. Also, the main and interaction effects of other-members’ regulatory mode were all nonsignificant. Of greater interest, the two-way interaction between individual-locomotion and other-members’ assessment was significant and positive (<italic>b</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> = .03). Also, the two-way interaction between individual-assessment and other-members’ locomotion was significant and positive (<italic>b</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .01). No other <italic>cross-level</italic> interactions were significant.</p>
<p>To explore the obtained interaction effects, we performed simple slopes analyses, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211424418">Aiken and West’s (1991)</xref> recommendations. These analyses revealed that (a) the relationship between individual-locomotion and individual performance ratings was significant and stronger when the other-members’ assessment was high (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean; <italic>b</italic> = 0.53, <italic>t</italic> = 6.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas this relationship become nonsignificant when the other-members’ assessment was low (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean; <italic>b</italic> = 0.10, <italic>t</italic> = 1.32, <italic>p =</italic> .19) and that (b) the relationship between individual-assessment and individual performance ratings was significant and stronger when the other-members’ locomotion was high (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean; <italic>b</italic> = .20, <italic>t</italic> = 2.36, <italic>p</italic> = .02), whereas this relationship become significant and negative when the other-members’ locomotion was low (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean; <italic>b</italic> = –.21, <italic>p</italic> = .025). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167211424418">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211424418">2</xref> show the patterns of predicted mean values for these cross-level interaction effects at one standard deviation above and below the means of the relevant variables in the regression equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211424418">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). These patterns suggest that performance ratings were maximized for individual locomotors embedded in high assessment teams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167211424418">Figure 1</xref>) and for individual assessors embedded in high locomotion teams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211424418">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide clear support for the important role of team-level regulatory mode complementarity in individual-level performance ratings, specifically for individuals whose self-regulatory orientation was complemented by that of the other members of their team. Workers who possessed a complementary regulatory mode orientation (locomotion or assessment) from that of the other members of the team were judged better than in teams that already had plenty of that type of worker. Within teams in which other members were high on locomotion, individuals high on assessment were rated as the best performers, whereas in teams in which other members were high on assessment, individuals high on locomotion were rated as the best performers. These findings demonstrate intriguing multilevel complementarity effects on goal-relevant performance and have several significant theoretical and practical implications.</p>
<p>First, this study demonstrated the critical mutual dependence of locomotion and assessment for effectual goal pursuit and relevant self-regulatory activity within team or group life. Just as Mauro et al.’s (2009) study demonstrated the beneficial effects of regulatory mode complementarity on group-level performance, this study showed that group-level complementarity can also have a positive effect on <italic>individual-level</italic> performance. Individuals high on either locomotion or assessment but embedded within similarly oriented teams enjoyed no particular benefit for their individual-level performance. This was illustrated by the null interaction effects of individual- and team-level locomotion, and of individual- and team-level assessment. Rather, the only interaction effects obtained were those that signified complementarity between the individual’s regulatory mode and that of the team. This supports a multiplicative model of cross-level complementarity effects for regulatory mode, in addition to previous research findings at the individual-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, this study showed that regulatory mode complementarity can operate in somewhat complex ways at multiple levels of analysis and may operate differently within and across these various levels. Examining within-individual complementarity effects on individual-level performance is perhaps simplest because of its examination of predictors and criteria contained within a single level of analysis (that of the individual). Indeed, across several domains, research has shown that those who perform best are those who possess both high locomotion and high assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211424418">Pierro, Kruglanski, &amp; Higgins, 2006</xref>). Likewise, examining group-level complementarity effects on group-level performance involves only one level of analysis, and so the predicted and obtained patterns here are also relatively simple: Those groups composed of equal parts high locomotors and high assessors perform better than those composed of high locomotors or high assessors alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211424418">Mauro et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in this study, we moved from examining within-individual or within-group complementarities into new territory. Specifically, we explored the interaction effect of <italic>group-level</italic> (<italic>others’</italic>) regulatory mode and <italic>individual-level</italic> regulatory mode on individual-level performance, thus crossing multiple levels of analysis. As such, we did not expect to (and, indeed, did not) find such simple relationships as those previously obtained within a single level of analysis. In fact, we found that these simple within-level effects were <italic>overpowered</italic> by cross-level complementarity effects. The usual interaction of individual-level locomotion and assessment (i.e., those high in both regulatory mode orientations perform best) was eliminated when cross-level effects were entered into the model. Although this does not indicate that those high in both locomotion and assessment are at a <italic>dis</italic>advantage under conditions of cross-level complementarity, it does suggest that they do not enjoy any special <italic>advantage</italic>, relative to those high on only one regulatory mode orientation but embedded within a team that complements their own. In other words, those high in both locomotion <italic>and</italic> assessment may perform equally well as those high in only locomotion <italic>or</italic> assessment, so long as the rest of the group’s regulatory mode orientation complements their own.</p>
<p>In accordance with the foregoing analysis, we obtained a more complex interaction consistent with our multilevel approach to the complementarity hypothesis. The complementarity of team- and individual-level regulatory mode leads to enhanced performance for individuals who complement the rest of the team in self-regulatory orientation. The most readily apparent explanation for this interesting pattern is that within-team complementarity operates across multiple levels of analysis to bolster the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of individual team members, thus affecting their performance. When high locomotors are embedded in high locomotion teams, or high assessors in high assessment teams, it is likely that individual members will become mired in the same pitfalls that characterized homogeneous groups in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211424418">Mauro et al. (2009)</xref> study. For instance, individual assessors in high assessment teams may be too slow in accomplishing tasks to be regarded as high performers, and locomotors in high locomotion teams might rush through tasks and miss important details that could have helped them to avoid impending doom. When the individual members are too much like the team they compose, there is no room for the team to serve as a “check and balance” on individual members, and so individual-level (and team-level) performance in such groups may suffer.</p>
<p>However, when the team and individual members have complementary regulatory mode strengths, the team can compensate for the individuals’ weaknesses, thus allowing individuals’ strengths to facilitate, rather than impede, their overall performance. For high locomotors in high assessment teams, the team may serve as a check on their haste and eagerness, particularly in situations where such inertia is detrimental to long-term performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211424418">Klem, Higgins, &amp; Kruglanski, 1996</xref>). For instance, a locomotor left to her own devices may rush into an ineffectual course of action simply because it is available at the moment, whereas assessors in the team may bring to her attention that a different course of action could save a substantial amount of time at a later stage in the project. Indeed, the only significant main effect we obtained, a positive relation between individual-level locomotion and performance, was eliminated when the locomotor was embedded in a low assessment team. This suggests that in a low assessment team, the high locomotion tendency of the individual may be compounded by the group’s common disregard for assessment, and hence rendered even more extreme to the detriment of performance.</p>
<p>Likewise, for high assessors embedded within high locomotion teams, the team may help to temper the assessor’s inability (or unwillingness) to make critical decisions at important times during goal pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211424418">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>). For instance, an assessor left to his own devices might spend hours pondering 10 different ways to compile a spreadsheet, whereas the locomotors in the team would politely suggest that he just pick one and move on to more pressing tasks. These are extremes, of course, presented for illustrative purposes, but nonetheless one can imagine (and our findings demonstrate) that a team-level regulatory mode strength that complements one’s own can have quite positive effects on one’s individual-level performance.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that organizations should consider regulatory mode complementarity issues in designing their individual-level reward structures for work conducted in group or team settings, and in constructing the teams themselves. Possibly, not everyone in the team will be delighted that individuals who possess a complementary regulatory mode to that of the majority will be rated higher on performance than everyone else in the team. This performance rating boost for unique individuals could be the result of a contrast effect, that is, oppositely oriented individuals simply <italic>seem</italic> to outperform the majority by virtue of their uniqueness. However, this uniqueness or contrast from the majority of the team also makes the unique individual a real asset to the team. Without a locomotor, a team of assessors might grind to a halt; without an assessor, a team of locomotors might locomote right into a poorly conceived course of action.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>As with many studies that use performance as a criterion variable, our measure may contain reliability and validity issues. We used a simple two-item questionnaire, and only the employee’s immediate supervisor provided performance ratings for our participants. In future research, it may be useful to elicit performance ratings from more sources (raters), for instance, using a multirater or 360° feedback approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211424418">Atwater, Ostroff, Yammarino, &amp; Fleenor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211424418">Austin &amp; Villanova, 1992</xref>). Future studies could also include behaviorally anchored rating scales to obtain more reliable and valid measures of employee performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211424418">Bernardin &amp; Smith, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211424418">Smith &amp; Kendall, 1963</xref>). Likewise, it would be interesting to explore how cross-level complementarity of regulatory mode affects different types of performance. For example, as locomotion and assessment are concerned with self-regulatory processes in goal pursuit, would the effects be stronger for task-related performance than contextual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211424418">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>)?</p>
<p>It might also be interesting and informative for researchers to explore the effect of our predictors on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211424418">Mauro et al.’s (2009)</xref> criterion. Here, we have shown the interactive effect of <italic>cross-level complementarity</italic> on individual-level performance, whereas Mauro et al. demonstrated the affect of within-group complementarity on <italic>group-level performance</italic>. What remains to be tested is the affect of cross-level complementarity on group-level performance. In this design, other group-level phenomena (e.g., conformity pressures, groupthink) may impose boundary conditions on complementarity effects on group performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211424418">Asch, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211424418">Janis, 1972</xref>). After all, complementary groups are by definition composed of members diverse in regulatory mode strength, with some high on locomotion and some high on assessment. On the other hand, complementarity effects could be robust to any group-level phenomena that might reasonably be expected to impose such boundary conditions. Future research can address these important issues.</p>
<p>A related direction for future research concerns the practical implications of regulatory mode complementarity for team building in organizations. Trait activation theory suggests that the social structure of the team in terms of members’ personality traits provides trait-relevant situational cues that affect team members’ work behavior and, thus, evaluated job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211424418">Tett &amp; Burnett, 2003</xref>). Although much research suggests that similarity with other team members predicts important work outcomes, recent efforts have been directed at clarifying the processes by which complementarity in teams can lead to valued work behaviors and job performance outcomes for the team and its individual members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211424418">Tett &amp; Murphy, 2002</xref>). The present research is another step toward illuminating those processes, and it suggests that organizations may wish to examine the way in which the within-team distribution of goal-relevant personality traits like locomotion and assessment affects work behaviors and job performance. Particularly for task-relevant, motivational traits such as locomotion and assessment, which bear important similarities to other task-relevant traits like industriousness and methodicalness (respectively), structuring teams in a manner that maximizes individual-level and/or team-level performance may prove useful.</p>
<p>In addition, it is worth noting that our sample was drawn from workplace organizations in Italy, a country characterized by generally high locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211424418">Higgins, Pierro, &amp; Kruglanski, 2008</xref>). This could account for the sole main effect we obtained, that of individual-level locomotion on performance. However, this effect was qualified by an interaction with group-level assessment, which implies that complementarity effects may be robust even to such strong situational pressures as culture-level regulatory mode. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to replicate this study in a culture characterized by high assessment, for instance Japan or Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211424418">Higgins et al., 2008</xref>). We might expect to see a similar main effect of individual-level <italic>assessment</italic> on performance, and this relation should be qualified by an interaction with group-level locomotion.</p>
<p>Future research may also wish to explore dynamic processes in cross-level regulatory mode complementarity and both individual- and group-level performance in work teams. The influence of a lone assessor or locomotor in a complementary team may differentially help or hinder team performance (and individual-level performance) at different stages of the team task process. For instance, assessment may be more useful in a work team in the early transition stages of a project, which involve mission analysis, goal specification, and strategy formulation and planning; by contrast, locomotion should be of greater help in the later action phases of a project, which involve activities designed to facilitate goal progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211424418">Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001</xref>). The inverse implication is that a locomotor exerting undue influence in the early stages of the task could result in insufficient planning, and an assessor could hinder the team’s ability to meet deadlines if he or she refuses to move ahead.</p>
<p>This raises another interesting question about how cross-level complementarity would affect leadership in teams. Locomotion (vs. assessment) is uniquely positively related to several personality traits often included in implicit leadership schemas (and, thus, leader emergence) or actual leader effectiveness (e.g., extraversion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211424418">Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211424418">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, one might expect locomotors embedded in high assessment groups to particularly emerge as leaders because of their <italic>stereotypical</italic> leadership characteristics, which match group members’ and managers’ implicit theories of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211424418">Rush, Thomas, &amp; Lord, 1977</xref>). However, previous research on the social identity theory of leadership suggests that a leader’s <italic>prototypicality</italic> of group characteristics can also affect their perceived effectiveness and longevity as a leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167211424418">Hogg, 2001</xref>). It would be interesting to explore whether leadership stereotypicality or prototypicality exerts a stronger influence on the performance of individuals with complementary regulatory mode to that of the team. For instance, locomotors’ stereotypical leadership qualities may override a lack of prototypicality where the locomotor is embedded in a complementary high assessment team. By contrast, assessors may have a harder time emerging as leaders or maintaining leadership status where they are nonprototypical of the (high locomotion) team because they do not possess stereotypical leadership characteristics.</p>

<p>In this study, we obtained support for the complementarity hypothesis of regulatory mode in diverse workplace settings across multiple levels of analysis. This particular test of the complementarity hypothesis involved a more intricate design and resulted in more complex conclusions than any previously obtained complementarity findings. Furthermore, these findings bolster the utility of regulatory mode as an explanatory social psychological construct across multiple domains and levels of analysis. That the regulatory mode composition of a team can work to the benefit of individual members, even and perhaps especially when those members are most unlike the team, is intriguing. This interesting and perhaps even counterintuitive notion may hopefully inspire researchers to investigate the complementarity hypothesis and its implications further, in new contexts and across multiple levels of analysis.</p>
