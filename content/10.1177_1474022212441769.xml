<abstract>
<p>In an era in which the imperatives of global economic competition prompt institutions of higher education to promote vocational practicality and efficiency over all else, advocates of the humanities have struggled to articulate the distinctive value and contribution of our disciplines. This article seeks to develop an argument directed not at fellow academics, but at friends and parents who ask incredulously, ‘What are you going to do with a degree in that?’ After discussing the historical shifts that have led to the present-day predicament in which majoring in English, philosophy, religion, art or a foreign language seems supremely impractical, I argue that the most important resource necessary to succeed in today’s competitive marketplace is a clear, eloquent, impassioned voice. The learning exercises at the foundation of excellent humanities-based education may appear to lack any utilitarian benefit, but their long-term effect is the development of each student’s individual voice, which is priceless.</p>

<p><sc>As many educators have recently lamented</sc>, the humanities, once regarded as the essential core of higher education, are now often seen as a luxury item, a ‘frivolous’ indulgence that one consumes only when all other basic needs have been met. Indicators such as student enrollments, new faculty lines and grant funding in the humanities have pointed to a decades-long decline in our disciplines; since the economic downturn of 2008, however, matters have become urgent as whole departments of theater, French and Russian have been eliminated in order to ease financial pressures on other, presumably more valuable and socially relevant, parts of the university. The decline is also apparent in less tangible forms such as diminishing prestige, which is manifested every time some well-meaning relative or stranger asks our students dumbfoundedly, ‘What are you going to do with a degree in <italic>that</italic>?’</p>
<p>Some have argued for the humanities by stressing its importance in fostering citizenship in democratic, pluralistic societies. Martha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022212441769">Nussbaum (2009)</xref>, for example, stresses the ways in which focused, systematic study in the humanities equips young people with skills and habits of mind necessary for human flourishing in an increasingly complex and diverse world. The distinctive value of the humanities, she argues, lies in its ability to cultivate empathy and the moral imagination. These capacities have always been of vital importance, but they are especially so now. In the twenty-first century, the imperatives of global economic competition tempt governments around the world (including the US) to promote a narrowly technical sort of education that creates what she has aptly characterized as a technically proficient but morally obtuse labor force that is numb to the suffering and inequity within its own society and the world. Suffering, however, does not go away just because one fails to pay attention to it. Nussbaum identifies the signal benefit of the humanities as the cultivation of the empathetic moral imagination – the ability to richly imagine points of view besides one’s own, and to understand why someone placed in different circumstances would have the thoughts and emotions that they do. Study in the arts and humanities offers opportunities to enter into other people’s imaginative worlds, learning how to suspend one’s egoistic self-absorption for a moment through close study of philosophy, literature, religion, music and the visual and performing arts. Exploring new worlds in this way fosters an appreciation for being surprised, so that having one’s taken-for-granted assumptions challenged is experienced as pleasurable rather than threatening. In the pluralistic worlds we increasingly find ourselves in, this may be the humanities’ most valuable contribution to global citizenship.</p>
<p>Jon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212441769">Jacobs (2009)</xref> argues for the humanities by delineating the ways in which it provides access to a realm of truth not ordinarily accorded sufficient value within narrowly empiricist understandings of reality – the realm of normativity. Jacobs challenges views of the arts, literature, music, philosophy and religion which see these disciplines as having to do with highly subjective and speculative matters – consoling fictions at best and self-indulgent navel-gazing at worst. In contrast, he positions the humanities as a parallel search for reality alongside the staunch empiricism of science (whether natural or social). Even while he expands our understanding of what constitutes the realm of the real, that about which we should care deeply, he eschews a preacher’s impulse to prescribe <italic>what</italic> norms or values we ought to uphold, and instead points us towards greater understanding of the ways in which our lives, like those of others throughout history and across cultures, are ‘shot through with normativity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212441769">Jacobs, 2009</xref>: 27). Sustained study in the humanities, he argues, hones our ability to discern what is truthful and enduring in the realm of norms or values, and thereby helps us to live richer, ultimately more satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Such accounts are invaluable for helping educators in the humanities make prominent and explicit the contributions our teaching and scholarship make to societal well-being and our students’ personal growth. Indeed, in order to become better advocates for the humanities, we must become clearer about the specific and distinctive contribution our disciplines make. But these excellent arguments, like so many raised in the pages of scholarly journals like this one, do not, I fear, really address the audience we most urgently need to persuade – our students. Freed by more open curricula that are less structured by breadth requirements or humanities-heavy general education courses, and driven by vocationalist trends in higher education that inevitably intensify in a weak economy, students are drifting away in alarming numbers from the courses of study we work so hard to craft. In an academy ever more sensitive to ‘market forces’ the loss of our customer base should be a matter of urgent concern. For the sake of those students who do find their way into our classrooms, and even more so for those who are inspired by the love of philosophy, music, art, religion, and languages to concentrate in our disciplines, we need to have good answers readily at hand to the anxiety-laden question so frequently asked by solicitous friends, relatives and strangers: ‘What are you going to <italic>do</italic> with a degree in that?’</p>
<p>The positioning of the humanities as a luxury item suitable for consumption only by the elite, or after all more fundamental educational needs have been met, is part of a deep, long-standing bifurcation between the vocational and avocational aims of higher education. It is important in the face of demands for more ‘practical’ education that we continue to advance arguments for a more holistic, multi-faceted vision of higher education. I can think of none better than this passage from John Henry Newman’s classic text, <italic>The Idea of a University</italic> (1858).
<disp-quote>
<p>It is [a liberal] education that gives a man a clear conscious view of his own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches him to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to disentangle a skein of thought, to detect what is sophistical and to discard what is irrelevant. It prepares him to fill any post with credit, and to master any subject with facility . . . He is at home in any society, he has common ground with any class. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022212441769">Urgo, 2008</xref>: 9)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As educators, we do more than just prepare people to carry out certain tasks in society. But I wonder if the arguments most persuasive to those whom we either enlist in our mission or lose to the natural and social sciences are those that seek to reconcile the split between the pragmatic and the personal, demonstrating that what is avocationally beneficial will also have vocational advantages for the individual down the line. The most common argument of this type is one that Derek Bok, Francis Oakley and others have long advanced, building on Newman’s assertion that a well-educated person is able to ‘master any subject with facility’ – namely, that in a volatile economy where people will be changing jobs every ten years, a broad liberal arts education that teaches writing, communication and critical thinking skills has the most long-term value. I propose a similar argument, which is that in a competitive economy – and in a world constantly changing under our feet – where the marketplace will always be intensely competitive, the most important resource you have is your voice. Your ability to articulate clearly and well what you stand for is precisely what allows you to stand out from the thousands of job applicants and entrepreneurs seeking seed money. As I seek to demonstrate below, the development of a clear voice – critical, eloquent and impassioned – is the signature contribution of a humanistic education.</p>
<p>In order to argue persuasively for the value of our disciplines, we need to have a solid understanding of the causes for our predicament, in which advocates for the humanities need to ‘justify the worth’ of disciplines that have been constituted as subjects of study precisely by divorcing them from direct applicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212441769">Cohen, 2009</xref>). I begin, then, by discussing several explanations for the skepticism and even contempt with which many people regard the humanities. Analyses of the historical decline of the humanities abound, but I find particularly useful two that take the long view, and locate the origins of the present ‘crisis’ in the very structure of the modern university. In their analyses of trends in higher education and society, Louis Menand and Frank Donoghue both trace its roots to the tension, even rivalry, between the avocational and vocational purposes of higher education.</p>
<p>In his book, <italic>The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University</italic>, Louis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand (2010)</xref> argues that the vulnerable, even tenuous, position of humanities disciplines is a by-product of a restructuring of the modern university, which took shape, along with so many other things in our world, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Menand, professor of English and historian of ideas at Harvard University, argues that one man was particularly influential in creating a division between avocational and vocational higher education. In 1869 Charles William Eliot became president of Harvard. At this time, young people could enter the professions directly from secondary or high school with relatively little fanfare. No four-year degree was required for admission to study law, medicine or the ministry, and the result was a relatively lax set of entrance requirements to the professions themselves. Licenses to practice law or medicine could be obtained in exchange for basically sitting through a few years of specialized training and the payment of a fee. Eliot up-ended this ‘scandalous’ state of affairs by requiring four years of college before students could gain admission to Harvard’s schools of law, medicine, divinity and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand, 2010</xref>: 45–6). Through Harvard’s influence on America’s other institutions of higher education, Eliot formalized a relationship between four-year colleges and the professions which we have inherited and now take entirely for granted. Four-year colleges essentially serve the function of credentialing institutions – guaranteeing that people entering the professions have basic skills and are equipped with certain kinds of knowledge.</p>
<p>By requiring four years of college before entry to the professional schools, Eliot helped raise the status of professions by making them more selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand, 2010</xref>: 47). This was a particularly important change given the rapid pace at which the nation was expanding in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Prior to Eliot’s innovation, ambitious men could gain access to wealth and power simply through the acquisition of specialized expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand, 2010</xref>: 49). Now, they had to pass through the gates of a four-year college where they would be not only educated but also socialized into the culture and norms of middle-class society. I would submit that this socialization function is still a huge, and mostly unacknowledged, aspect of what colleges do for individuals and society. It is often euphemistically referred to as ‘preparation for leadership’, disguising its connections to the reproduction of social class in this country. In such a context, training in the humanities can be reduced to the application of the veneer of culture that young people need – but just in a small dose – in order to mix well in society. The failure of advocates of the humanities to articulate clearly what it is gained by substantive training in our subjects leaves this false assumption untouched.</p>
<p>Another important consequence of Eliot’s restructuring was the anti-utilitarian ethos surrounding college education. As Eliot wrote in an <italic>Atlantic Monthly</italic> article, the ideal in college was ‘the enthusiastic study of subjects for the love of them without any ulterior objects’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand, 2010</xref>: 49). Since Eliot, what distinguishes liberal arts college education from professional training is its disinterestedness. Here knowledge is pursued without regard to political, economic or practical benefit. You do not study religion in order to invent a better religion – although I have had a few ambitious students who had just that goal in mind – but in order to understand why this realm of life is so personally and socially significant. For Menand the disinterestedness of a liberal arts education is not merely its main distinguishing feature, but its glory. The disinterested pursuit of knowledge is valuable because it can ‘expose the contingencies of present arrangements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212441769">Menand, 2010</xref>: 56). It can closely examine, critique and explore what is, and it can imagine alternatives. Given its remoteness from pragmatic fields of application, education in the humanities could be considered the most disinterested of all, and perhaps that accounts for why thorough training in literature, the arts, and philosophy traditionally has been central to liberal arts education.</p>
<p>Yet Menand’s main point, if I understand it rightly, is that securing this little bubble for the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake during college came as a trade-off with the professions. Give us your sons and daughters and your money for four years, and we will raise the social status of your profession and improve the quality of your workers, but we won’t try to teach them law, medicine, or the nuts and bolts of government. If Menand’s interest is in the relationship between colleges and the professions, Frank Donoghue’s much more pessimistic evaluation of higher education and specifically the predicament of the humanities, <italic>The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">2008</xref>), focuses on the relationship between businessmen and colleges.</p>
<p>Donoghue, professor of English at the Ohio State University, draws our attention to some early manifestations of the intense and vituperative criticism of college envisioned as four years of life governed largely by intrinsic motivation. Almost as soon as four-year colleges were set aside as places dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, the value of that pursuit came under sharp attack. Donoghue locates the origins of the decline of the humanities in the hostility toward higher education exhibited by self-made, anti-intellectual, early twentieth-century industrialists. Andrew Carnegie, Clarence Birdseye, and others, he argues, relentlessly criticized the ‘uselessness’ of college education. As they gained influence by serving on university trustee boards, they lobbed their criticism from inside the ivory tower, calling on colleges and universities to behave more like businesses – prioritizing efficiency and productivity. Birdseye urged college administrators to act like a ‘good manufacturer [who] studies more carefully than almost anything else the wastes of his factory and the points wherein he can avoid those. You should learn from him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Over time, faculty too internalized this ethos of efficiency and productivity, as institutions of higher education capitulated to corporate values, changing their institutional culture to match the output of product of capitalist industry, whether measured by students taught per class (enrollments) or scholarly productivity. Donoghue points to the widespread casualization of labor in the academy today as one of the most potentially threatening aspects of this century-long transformation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue (2008: 26)</xref> estimates that nowadays 65 percent of college teaching personnel comprise low-paid teaching assistants and adjuncts, who are ineligible for tenure and can be hired and fired as demand shifts for their teaching specialization. From the point of the view of university administrators seeking to control costs, the increased reliance on adjuncts and teaching assistants is a great way to maximize efficiency. Donoghue also finds a perverse and ultimately counter-productive assimilation of this ethos in the ‘publish or perish’ environment surrounding the race to tenure, in which faculty on the tenure-track are driven to produce more and more scholarship (scholarship, it should be noted, that fewer and fewer people actually read). Even the university presses that are relied upon to publish the scholarly monographs on which many an assistant professor’s tenure case rests are calling for reconsideration of publishing standards for tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 41–6). And yet, so long as sheer productivity (after the manner of corporations) remains the ‘objective’ standard by which scholarly excellence is measured among academics, reasonable arguments to reduce the emphasis placed on the scholarly monograph will continue to fall on deaf ears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 48–9).</p>
<p>Donoghue identifies an additional factor leading to the decline of the humanities in higher education, besides the corporatization of the boards of trustees, administrators, and faculty, namely that students are less persuaded by the value of four years dedicated to the pursuit of disinterested knowledge. As many observers have noted, college students today are drawn from a wider demographic spectrum than ever before; indeed, with the collapse of the manufacturing industry in the US over the last five decades, young men and women with middle-class aspirations have little chance in the job market without a college degree. Considering the ballooning costs of a college education and the necessity of paying back enormous student loans, it is understandable that today’s students are anxious to see their college degree translate quickly into a well-paying job. The clearest evidence for students’ own apparent preferences for more explicitly vocational higher education is found in the meteoric rise of for-profit colleges. The growth of this sector over the past twenty years is truly astonishing. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022212441769">Lewis (2010)</xref>, ‘While overall postsecondary enrollment increased 31 percent from 1998 to 2008, the for-profits’ enrollment grew by 225 percent.’</p>
<p>Donoghue grants that selective colleges and universities can shield themselves from the market forces that have driven demand for more directly vocational education. Given that they cater to elites with a more secure class position, these schools continue (and he predicts, will continue) to staff and support departments that grant majors in the traditional liberal arts. It should be noted, though, that even in elite schools one sees evidence of rising vocationalism among students in the popularity of majors perceived as being fast-tracks to a well-paying career (economics-into-business, political science-into-law) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022212441769">Engell and Dangerfield, 1998</xref>). Donoghue predicts that the next sixty years will witness the consolidation of an even more rigidly stratified version of higher education, as elites end up in private schools and prestigious ‘flagship’ public universities with a commitment to the liberal arts (and solid support for the humanities), while the rest attend for-profit institutions that promise upon graduation a solid paycheck in a clearly defined professional field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 92). Meanwhile, at for-profit schools and fiscally strapped public universities, adjuncts will do the vast majority of the teaching labor; willing to work for minimal pay and unable to demand the job security afforded by tenure, they will have less and less in common professionally and intellectually with the ‘last professors’ holding out against the red-rimmed tide of corporatization. ‘Over time’, he writes, ‘and it may take two or three generations, humanists will thus become an insignificant percentage of the country’s university instructional workforce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 92).</p>
<p>Donoghue’s depressing vision is persuasive insofar as it describes the already deeply class-stratified nature of higher education in this country. And yet much of his analysis rests, in my view, on the spectacular recent growth of for-profit institutions, which epitomize the ruthless pragmatism and vocationalism engulfing higher education at large. He writes: ‘The astonishing rise to prominence of the for-profit universities is the single most important recent development in American higher education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441769">Donoghue, 2008</xref>: 87). But like so many other high-growth sectors of the economy, from the financial services industry to the real-estate market, the almost incredible success of for-profit institutions like Kaplan College and the University of Phoenix now seems attributable less to their ability to deliver the goods to eager consumers, than to widespread deception and fraud, along with exploitation of government largesse on a huge scale. In August 2010, an undercover investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) exposed pervasive fraud in the recruiting strategies of admissions officers at these institutions, and the GAO began tugging at the loose threads binding these institutions together. According to the GAO report, admissions officers at some of these colleges told GAO officers posing as applicants that the college had the same accreditation as Harvard and expressed a cavalier attitude towards the paying back of student loans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212441769">Field, 2010</xref>). In the years since, they have been under increasing scrutiny and regulation, as data collected by the Department of Education reveal that graduates from for-profit and trade schools have a much higher rate of default on their loans than those at public and private institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212441769">Blumenstyk and Richards, 2011</xref>). But the point of citing such articles is not just <italic>schadenfreude</italic> on the part of those of us directly competing for students with for-profit degree mills. These default rates point out the terrible inadequacy of the narrowly conceived type of vocational higher education they offer. The promise to provide cheap, quick, efficient education that leads directly to a high-paying job is an empty one. The failure of narrowly conceived practical or ‘career-oriented’ education to deliver on that promise should prompt us to consider afresh what is gained by ‘slow learning’, that inefficient, avocational approach to higher education which finds its epitome in liberal arts disciplines with no clear career path attached. What <italic>are</italic> you going to do with a degree in that?</p>
<p>College graduates now entering one of the toughest job markets in several generations are no doubt asking themselves what they have really gained from their educations, especially those who hold a degree that does not clearly translate into a job, like History, English, Philosophy, Art History, or Religion. Judged by the standard of efficiency which reigns supreme in our historical moment, the work that students do in the humanities is woefully inadequate. The questions we wrestle with in class have no conclusive answers, or they can be answered in innumerable equally satisfying ways. One critic quipped that philosophy must surely be the most inefficient intellectual discipline of all because it has been asking the same questions for more than 2,500 years! Students taking our courses are asked to arrive at conclusions or opinions on matters on which they lack even basic expertise. Moreover, they (or the dedicated ones anyway) spend hours laboring over papers that only one person will read.</p>
<p>First of all, I worry that many educators in the humanities, especially at resource-strapped public institutions, simply do not have the time to assign let alone read student papers, or to ask impossible questions or keep their students’ minds focused on them in sufficient depth to obtain their payoff. In the era of ‘outcomes-based assessment’, people often downgrade their pedagogy in order to teach to tests that measure something measurable, and much of what is most valuable in what we teach in the humanities is simply not measurable, or not in a clearly standardizable way. But suppose one does have class sizes small enough and teachers sufficiently motivated and compensated to offer the kinds of exercises that foster excellent learning in the humanities. What good <italic>is</italic> it to break your head over questions that have no answer, to enter into speculative debates with insufficient evidence, to stay up all night sweating over a paper only your professor will read? What do you really gain from this kind of education?</p>
<p>Following Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022212441769">Urgo (2008)</xref>, I would submit that one of the most important things students gain is a voice. Contrary to the fantasies of right-wing critics of the supposedly arch-liberal professorate, if professors have done their jobs well, students will not be walking mouth-pieces spouting the values and politics of their instructors. Rather, by immersing themselves for four years in debates over unsolvable problems (What is religion? Why do we think we know what we know?), as generations of students have done before, they will find their voices. Students will learn to articulate <italic>what</italic> they believe, in words that are their own, not plagiarized from a website or cribbed from the latest amusing talk-show host. By assessing the arguments of historians about what happened long ago and far away, they will learn to critique the way evidence is used to substantiate claims. They will learn to ask <italic>why</italic> they believe what they believe and cultivate the habit of patiently re-evaluating those beliefs in the face of new evidence. And they will do this throughout their lives – in the polling booth, in the emergency room, whenever they are faced with tough choices in their personal, professional and civic lives.</p>
<p>And why expend all this energy writing papers only one person will read? In the wee hours of the night, when the siren song of Facebook or the party down the hall tempts, students everywhere inevitably ask this very question of themselves. Actually, in every instance, at least two people read a student’s papers – its author and the student’s professor. And in that dialogical exchange, I would submit, something magical happens. Through it, students become more themselves. When the vocationalism, pragmatism, and efficiency-minded ethos of the present moment overtakes, and students find themselves writing papers only for the grade, trying to work out what the professor thinks or ‘likes’, or worse yet downloading a paper from the internet, then the process will be short-circuited. This brings me to another point, which deserves more attention than I can give it here, namely the contradiction felt by both students and faculty between the ideal of learning for personal growth and the necessity of grades. The avocational ideals of a liberal education are, in my view, inevitably distorted by the fact that college plays the credentialing function that it has ever since Charles Eliot restructured the pathway through Harvard to a professional career in medicine, law, the church or science. Employers and professional schools need to know that a GPA of X from Y school means something, hence professors have to rank and grade students, which in turn leads to anxiety and disingenuousness on all sides. This comes home especially hard when competition for jobs and spaces in professional schools is intense, as it is now. But if we can take the long view, the student’s distinctive ordeal of writing papers for ‘just one person’, when undertaken with sincerity, is part of an educational process that helps bring out a voice, that student’s own voice. This is an invaluable asset wherever students end up after graduation.</p>
<p>To some, this may seem like more of the kind of ‘rah-rah’ liberal arts rhetoric that rings hollow for our anxious students primed to seek efficiency in all matters. For them, I have another thought: the trajectories of liberal arts college graduates, especially with degrees in the humanities, are not usually linear. Typically, people graduate, they work at some kind of job, and then another, and then another. Through social networks (established with help from the well-educated, well-socialized, and sometimes wealthy friends they have met in college) and often through further education, they parlay that on-the-job work experience into the career or careers that ultimately bring them both meaning and money. But those personal networks do not work very well unless a person can present him or herself authentically, using her hard won individual voice to articulate who she is, what she believes in and why.</p>
<p>If we professors in the humanities are going to avoid the dismal fate of becoming the Last Professors whom Frank Donoghue envisions in his dystopic future, we need to ensure that the kind of education we deliver actually does help to cultivate each student’s voice.</p>
