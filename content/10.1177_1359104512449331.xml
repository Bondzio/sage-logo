<p>Resilience is one of those psychological concepts that appear irresistible to parents, carers, teachers, youth workers, in fact anyone who works closely with children and young people. Part of its attraction lies in its immediate recognisability (every adult can name children who despite high odds on failure and dire predictions of a bleak future manage to rise above adversity and make a startling success of their life). The other attraction held by resilience is its high utility factor: the tantalising possibility that significant adults in a child’s life can help children to become more resilient by building up their resilience skills.</p>
<p>In this book, what Everly has attempted to do is to highlight some of the key features of a resilient child or young person and to offer advice on how such features can be enhanced. The apparent task of his associate author, Brown, has been to make sure that the text is reader friendly and written in plain English. In all of these objectives, this pair has succeeded to a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>As part of the drive towards clarity and simplicity, the seven essential lessons for a resilient child are divided into the following categories:</p>
<list id="list1-1359104512449331" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ <bold>Actions</bold> – valuing friends, mentors and the support of others;</p>
<p>  – making difficult decisions;</p>
<p>  – taking responsibility for your own behaviour;</p>
<p>  – investing in your health;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>○ <bold>Beliefs</bold> – developing optimism;</p>
<p>  – believing in something greater than yourself;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>○ <bold>Codes</bold> – striving for integrity.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Of course, it is the last of these resilience-enhancing ‘lessons’ that is the most challenging to achieve and Everly and Brown wisely focuse on two important, but difficult to install principles for children and young people: happiness in life is a journey not a destination (an axiom which is constantly being challenged by our ‘things-mean-happiness’ culture) and <italic>how</italic> you achieve what you get is just as important as <italic>what</italic> you get (in other words, personal integrity counts as much as outcome).</p>
<p>The advice on how to help children to acquire such high ethical principles turns out to be homely, sound and certainly not new: be honest, kind, self-responsible and learn from mistakes and misjudgements. However, these often appear as radical codes in today’s materialistic and highly competitive culture and certainly bear restating.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to this book was one of irritation: it is very light in psychological research and theory, important links between the quality of family relationships and the growth of resilience are ignored, it offers simple answers to complex issues and some of the over-the-top case histories will probably grate more than a little with a European readership.</p>
<p>However, as I got into the spirit of the text, it was the clarity and unpretentiousness of the advice on bringing up children in a rapidly changing world that began to win me over. As a result, I have ended up not only recommending ‘The Resilient Child’ to those adults who work directly with children and young people, but also to supporting professionals such as psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, as a reminder of the knowledge, skills and abilities that children require to develop high levels of wellbeing, social competence and social responsibility.</p>
