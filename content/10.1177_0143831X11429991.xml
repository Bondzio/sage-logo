<abstract>
<p>Union density and collective bargaining coverage is on a downwards trend in many developed countries, and this is evident in New Zealand. Some suggest this decline is resulting in traditional approaches to collective bargaining being replaced with a more collaborative style. This article empirically explores the nature of collective bargaining and examines the attitudes and behaviours of managerial negotiators, in the New Zealand environment, which has seen unions marginalized then recently afforded some degree of legitimacy. The study supports the traditional vs collaborative dichotomy, and the attitudes and behaviour comprising these styles is consistent with the literature and managerial self-reports.</p>

<p>It would come as no surprise to observers of industrial relations to hear that union density and collective bargaining coverage have declined dramatically in New Zealand over recent decades. That is a storyline common to a number of other developed democracies. In some respects, the New Zealand story mirrors that in other countries; in other respects, it has its own twists and turns. Comparisons with Australia are inevitable, but even then, there are some differences.</p>
<p>This article is not so much about the declining coverage of unions and collective bargaining in New Zealand as it is about the nature of the collective bargaining that remains. The purpose of the article is to report research on current New Zealand employer strategies, attitudes and behaviours in and around collective bargaining in an environment now generally favourable to collective bargaining, but following a period in which employer ascendancy in the industrial relationship was established, and emphatically so.</p>
<sec id="section1-0143831X11429991">
<title>Collective bargaining styles and approaches</title>
<p>Collective bargaining is the collective representation of employees’ interests by unions in negotiating with the employer over terms and conditions of employment. It is the countermeasure to the perceived imbalance of bargaining power between employer and employee. The alternative is employees dealing with employers individually for the negotiation or dictation of employment terms. Collective bargaining, and the unions that deliver it, have been central institutions of labour relations scholarship and practice in many countries over many years.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of wisdom to be found in early analyses of American employers’ essentially defensive attitudes towards unions and collective bargaining. Prominent among these is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11429991">E Wight Bakke’s 1946</xref> pamphlet <italic>Mutual Survival: The Goal of Unions and Management</italic>. The essential theme was that, whatever their education or ideology or empathy for workers, managers will ‘get tough’ over union presence, and in their collective bargaining behaviours, when unions and collective bargaining are perceived to threaten productivity and profitability, and most especially when they are perceived to do so to the point of threatening the survival of the enterprise. Internally, both the rate of negotiated remuneration and negotiated work rules governing the job are relevant. Externally, features of product markets, including product price elasticity and scope and extent of competition, are important components of the environment within which collective bargaining occurs.</p>
<p>What was projected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11429991">Bakke (1946)</xref> and others was management’s essential wariness of unions and collective bargaining as restraints on management’s freedom to manage productively and profitably, as they saw it. Given that putting restraints on management’s freedom to do as it likes is essentially the point of collective bargaining from the employees’ perspective, that traditional defensive, arm’s length posture makes a lot of sense as the default position for employers. The more so under circumstances where the survival of the enterprise is at issue. Why would employers voluntarily invite constraints on their ability to act? Arguably, legislation supportive of collective bargaining is warranted because the answer is, ‘they would not’.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11429991">Kaufman (2004)</xref> observes, the middle decades of the 20th century represented a period of stable collective industrial relations in the United States and other western democracies, including New Zealand, and a period in which employers welcomed and embraced their involvement with labour unions in collective bargaining and day-to-day stewardship of the workplace. However, astute observers have accepted that what might have appeared to be a willing corporate acceptance of a legitimate role for unions and collective bargaining during this ‘golden era’ of industrial relations was often, in fact, a pragmatic but reluctant tolerance of something seen as at least temporarily inescapable. And that even that reluctant level of acceptance was driven by professional labour relations operatives rather than senior corporate executives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11429991">Kochan et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>So again, the default position of employers towards unions and collective bargaining has been seen to be the defensive, arm’s length position. By the 1980s, the ‘golden age’ of unions and collective bargaining was pretty well over in some western democracies and becoming tarnished in others. Kochan et al.’s <italic>The Transformation of American Industrial Relations</italic>, first published in 1986, sought to appraise collective bargaining in the US in the wake of the dramatic slide in union membership and collective bargaining coverage over the previous decades, and the concomitant employer ascendancy in the industrial relationship.</p>
<p>This important work recognized that new non-union competition, both domestically and abroad, put unprecedented cost pressures on unionized American firms that, in many instances, rendered the old collective bargaining processes and outcomes impossible to continue. With unions unable to organize the new competitors, some of them being overseas and out of the reach of unions, others being in greenfield sites that seemed equally out of reach, the traditional union effect of taking labour costs out of competition was often no longer viable. Cost containment became a critical focus for employers. Unions lost power, as did the corporate labour relations specialists who had traditionally, and comfortably, dealt with them. The consequences of these developments included still more work and workers leaving the unionized sector. But, for those remaining, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11429991">Kochan et al. (1986)</xref> argued that there were pressures for change in collective bargaining, driven by senior executives and a wider cadre of human resource management strategists than had historically taken the lead in industrial relations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> took the analysis further, extending and updating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11429991">Walton and McKersie’s (1965)</xref> seminal <italic>Behavioral Theory of Labor Negotiations</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> maintained that labour relations were changing because of changing global competitiveness, and they identified two sets of contracts and outcomes that matter in these change efforts: substantive and social. By substantive contracts and outcomes they mean collective or individual employment agreements and the terms of the relationships set out there; by social contracts they mean the nature of relationships between employers and unions at the institutional level, and between employers (through supervisors and managers) and employees at the individual level.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the dominant social contract at employer union level in the US was the arm’s length accommodation that Bakke documented, characterized by periodic rule making through collective bargaining with the union as the moving party, while the dominant social contract between employers and employees was compliance with the rules. The authors argued, as had Kochan et al., that the parties’ substantive priorities had changed in the new global competitiveness. Management’s focus was now on cost containment, labour flexibility, quality improvement and product responsiveness to the needs of the market. Labour was now on the receiving end, its substantive needs being largely reactive, trying to hang on to hard earned gains now under threat.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> argued that achieving the substantive changes management needed required a change in the social contracts at both union and employee levels. Among the several combinations of institutional and social contracts possible, the authors focused on what they projected as the two dominant combinations replacing the arm’s length accommodation and individual compliance regime: on the one hand, union–management cooperation coupled with employee commitment to the employer; on the other hand, union containment or avoidance coupled with tighter employee compliance in the workplace.</p>
<p>The authors didn’t ignore other possible combinations of institutional and individual social contracts. However, they theorized that, in a globally competitive environment, employers would increasingly opt for either cooperation–commitment contracts or containment/avoidance-tightened compliance contracts in lieu of the traditional defensive relationship that was tolerable in earlier times.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> contended that employers’ broad negotiation strategies are central to revising the social contracts and achieving substantive outcomes. They identified three broad strategies towards the union: forcing, fostering and escape, the first two being negotiation strategies, ‘escape’ being a union avoidance strategy. Recalling components from Walton and McKersie’s earlier behavioural theory, forcing strategies combine distributive bargaining, structuring hostile attitudes towards the other side and the promotion of internal differences in the other side but solidarity on one’s own side. Fostering strategies incorporate integrative or interest-based bargaining, building trust in institutional and individual relationships and managing for consensus in both parties.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that management’s choice of negotiation strategy was as often as not dictated by what was feasible rather than pure preference. Where there was room to choose, the choice of forcing or fostering strategies would turn on the substantive gains management felt it needed from unions and workers, how immediate was the need for concessions and what changes in the social contracts with the union and workers the employer desired. In other words, is the employer looking for quick substantive gains, or longer term cooperation from employees and the union? Management would also factor in its perception of the union’s and employees’ receptiveness or resistance to management’s substantive and social contract aims, and management’s assessment of the parties’ relative bargaining power.</p>
<p>In short, Walton et al. theorized that, in the increasingly competitive environment of the 1990s and beyond, American managements would move to either collaborative or containment relationships with unions, coupled with demanding high commitment or high compliance from employees, while allowing the possibility of other contractual combinations arising in the minority. The traditional defensive, arm’s length accommodation of unions was seen as increasingly redundant. And again, as with the analyses of Bakke and his contemporaries in the earlier studies of collective bargaining, there is a lot of wisdom to be drawn on in the work of these later American scholars. Their theories provide a range of models of collective bargaining relationships that can assist in making sense of New Zealand developments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11429991">Kochan and Osterman’s (1994)</xref> work on mutual gains bargaining is also relevant, highlighting the difficulties confronting parties looking to take the collaborative path. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, which constitute a substantial part of the New Zealand employment landscape, face problems of short time frames, capital limitations, lack of managerial skills and time and a low skill labour force, all contributing to discouraging uncertain or long-term investment in new, collaborative practices and revised social contracts with unions and employees.</p>
<p>Our research in what follows is focused around examining approaches to collective bargaining in New Zealand. In particular, we are interested to see if a style reflective of a collaborative strategy, or something like it, has emerged in the landscape shaping collective bargaining. Post-2000, the legal framework in New Zealand can be considered one which encourages a social contract with unions built on fostering strategies and collaborative collective bargaining. However, this follows closely on the heels of a decade of state-sponsored forcing strategies, union containment or avoidance, and employer ascendancy in the industrial relationship. In order to make this assessment we explore empirically both the behavioural and attitudinal characterizations employers themselves ascribe to their engagement in the collective bargaining process.</p>

<title>Historical overview of collective bargaining in New Zealand</title>
<p>While the drop in union density and collective bargaining coverage in New Zealand in recent decades might be said to mirror the same developments in the US and elsewhere, there are some differences in systems and circumstances worth noting. A review of labour relations in New Zealand over a period spanning nearly 120 years reveals there to be four distinct chronological periods, each reflecting a very distinctive and unique collective bargaining focus.</p>
<p>From 1894 until 1984, but particularly from the 1930s, the system for fixing pay and other conditions in New Zealand was one of conciliated collective bargaining and contingent arbitration. Features included blanket coverage of employers and employees, centralized collective bargaining remote from most employers and employees, relatively automatic cost of living based wage movement, universal flow-on through arbitration if necessary and a narrow definition of negotiable matters.</p>
<p>There were exceptions to the centralized bargaining norm, principally in transportation and agriculture processing where robust forms of enterprise bargaining were practised. In addition, particularly in manufacturing, unions singled out leading firms for second-tier negotiations once wide-application awards were settled. In these important but limited exceptions, there tended to be periodic engagement between unions and employers, in the manner described by Bakke in the US, with the institutional relationship best described as defensive, arm’s length and often confrontational.</p>
<p>Beyond those exceptions, however, the centralized industrial relations system was remote from the covered employers and employees with little encouragement or opportunity for union–management collaboration, and in many instances little intrusion by unions into the workplace at all. The public sector operated under a separate, civil-service type system for most of the 20th century, without collective bargaining, and with no instincts for collaboration with unions or involvement of workers.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, the New Zealand economy was struggling to compete in the new global economy with institutions and values that dated to the 1930s and earlier. The situation was perhaps ripe for the sort of sea-change in industrial relationships contemplated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11429991">Kochan et al. (1986)</xref> and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref>. A Labour government elected in 1984 deregulated and opened up much of the economy to the world, a policy response to the growing globalization of markets in general and in particular events such as Britain’s economic ‘defection’ to Europe that destabilized the basis of New Zealand’s primary-export-based wealth.</p>
<p>The removal of the compulsory availability of arbitration of wage disputes opened the path to a new voluntary and decentralized, power-based collective bargaining system, although the reality of such a system took some time to materialize. A wider range of employers now had collective bargaining in their own hands and the opportunity to develop their own strategies to shape or reshape their ‘social contracts’ with unions. However, while the government toyed intellectually with notions of ‘industrial democracy’, no new policy initiatives were launched promoting collaboration and little change in private sector bargaining structures or approaches actually occurred. The government did, however, actively promote enterprise-level collective bargaining on ‘good employer’ principles in the state and local government sectors.</p>
<p>The most dramatic changes awaited the return of a conservative government in 1990. The new government passed into law the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (ECA), prioritizing individual contracting over collective contracting, and effectively removing all legislative support for collective bargaining. There was no obligation to negotiate, and certainly no statutory prescription to do so in good faith, so parties were left to their own devices.</p>
<p>This deregulation engendered a relatively immediate retreat in unionized collective bargaining coverage from about 60% workforce coverage and 40% union membership under the conciliation and arbitration system down to about 20% union membership and unionized collective bargaining coverage. The union density figure continued to decline, albeit more slowly, during the decade of the 1990s. For the first time, employers had the strategic option of seeking to be entirely free of union involvement, so ‘escape’ strategies for union avoidance were to the fore.</p>
<p>What emerged in this essentially deregulated environment for collective bargaining were enterprise-based private sector union–management relationships in firms where union membership had been strong and enthusiastic and not reliant on legislative enforcement of membership and coverage. Collective agreements covering multiple employers were not prohibited, but there were significant obstacles to achieving them, and they all but disappeared.</p>
<p>As has been experienced elsewhere, union membership remained higher in the public sector, where collective bargaining and unions had only recently been forced into enterprise structures. In essence, public sector workers and unions, and pockets of workers and unions in the private sector where unions were strong and enterprise-level relationships were well established – whether harmonious or otherwise – now formed the basis of the New Zealand collective bargaining system, surviving deregulation of the collective bargaining environment.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining pattern that emerged now as the predominant one was a more recognizable voluntarist, enterprise-centred collective bargaining, replacing the long history of predominantly remote, centralized arbitration-backed bargaining, albeit a new collective bargaining system that covered only about one-third of the workers covered by the previous system. The model that had been the exception became the norm in what remained of the collective bargaining sector.</p>
<p>But that is not yet the end of the story. A new Labour government elected in 1999 changed the regulatory framework for collective bargaining yet again, and substantially, although the consequences for union density and collective bargaining have been less positive than many would have anticipated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0143831X11429991">
<title>The legislative environment for collective bargaining since 2000</title>
<p>The previous vacuum, vaguely hostile to collective bargaining, gave way to a piece of legislation, the Employment Relations Act 2000 (‘the ERA’) that lauded and encouraged collective bargaining, although without discouraging the continuation of individual contracting in the alternative. It provided protections for unions to exclusively negotiate collective agreements on behalf of their members. It provided for the re-emergence of multi-employer collective agreements without discouraging the continuation of what had emerged as the predominantly enterprise-based pattern to collective bargaining. It required parties to collective bargaining relationships to bargain in ‘good faith’, defined quite prescriptively and elaborately, and backed by an overarching statutory obligation on all parties to employment relationships to deal with all other parties in ‘good faith’.</p>
<p>The legislative ‘mandate’ to collaborate in collective bargaining under the ERA is based in this obligation on parties involved in collective bargaining to bargain in good faith, as that obligation has been given motive by government, and definition by statute, by more explicit and prescriptive codes of good faith developed under statutory authority, by elaborations promulgated by officials and by court interpretations. The term ‘mandate’ has two dictionary meanings – a command or an authorization. The mandate to collaborate in collective bargaining under the ERA probably lies somewhere between those two meanings. It promotes a collaborative approach, but leaves room for a more traditional adversarial approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11429991">Wilson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The statute itself sets out the most basic obligations of the parties to collective bargaining relationships incorporated in the good faith concept: to try to reach an initial agreement on bargaining process or ground rules to facilitate the substantive negotiations, to meet with one another and to give proper consideration and a response to each other’s proposals, including providing reasons when opposing proposals put forward by the other party, to provide information to the other party that is reasonably necessary to support proposals or positions, to respect the role of parties’ representatives, to do nothing – including communications with the principals of the other party – to undermine the representatives or the collective bargaining process more generally.</p>
<p>Following a 2004 amendment, there is an obligation to continue bargaining despite reaching deadlocks at times, and to come to an agreement ‘unless there is a genuine reason, based on reasonable grounds, not to’ where ‘reasonable grounds’ are objective factors, not mere beliefs or philosophical objections to bargaining or unions or having collective agreements. This last obligation falls short of an absolute obligation to reach an agreement, but apparently not far short.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the good faith obligation as applied to collective bargaining is to require bargaining parties to engage constructively and to take a collaborative, problem-solving approach to collective bargaining. Coming off a decade of emphatic employer ascendancy in labour relations during the 1990s, sponsored by the government of the day, the ERA certainly provided a legislative framework and political encouragement for collaborative approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0143831X11429991">
<title>The economic environment for collective bargaining since 2000</title>
<p>New Zealand emerged from the Second World War with an expanding and successful agriculture-based economy. In the late 1960s, faced with growing balance of payments problems, governments adopted increasingly protective economic policies. As noted above, problems mounted for the New Zealand economy from the 1970s as access to key world markets for agricultural commodities became increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>From around 1984 onwards, initially under the Labour government, the direction of economic policy in New Zealand turned away from intervention and protectionism towards deregulation. The reforms included the floating of the exchange rate, abolition of controls on capital movements, the ending of industry assistance, the removal of price controls, deregulation across a number of sectors of the economy, corporatization and privatization of state-owned assets, and of course labour market reforms. With challenging export markets, domestic markets opened up to international competition and new overseas corporate players, and public sector reforms, New Zealand employers necessarily developed a new cost consciousness across all sectors.</p>
<p>On the macroeconomic level, policies were aimed at achieving low inflation, while microeconomic reforms were introduced to open the economy to competitive pressures and world prices. After a period of weak growth during the late 1980s, New Zealand’s economic performance improved significantly during the 1990s, and growth continued, albeit at a slower rate, until the global economic downturn of 2008, annual growth rates varying in the range of 1–4%.</p>
<p>New Zealand is essentially an open, trading economy, still led by agricultural exports, with some niche manufacturing exports, but operating these days under considerable pressure to identify, consolidate and expand export markets for its products. This is the economic environment in which New Zealand employers have operated in recent years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0143831X11429991">
<title>Labour relations in New Zealand since 2000</title>
<p>So, after a decade of employer ascendancy in the 1990s, what has become of New Zealand labour relations since 2000 under a legislative and political regime supportive of collaborative collective bargaining and in a generally positive but competitively challenging economic environment? Our primary concern is with the nature of collective bargaining, but some other industrial relations indicators are also relevant.</p>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11429991">
<title>Union membership</title>
<p>At the time the conservative government’s Employment Contracts Act 1991 was implemented, the total employed labour force in New Zealand was 1,518,800, of whom 1,196,100 were wage and salary earners. There were at the end of year count, 514,325 union members in 66 unions. Union density as a percentage of the total employed labour force was 33.9%; as a percentage of wage and salary earners, union density at the end of 1991 was 43.0%.</p>
<p>Union membership dropped by 16.75% in the year to December 1992. By the end of the decade, December 1999, there were 302,405 union members in 82 unions, for a union density figure against wage and salary earners of 21.1%. Some of those ‘unions’ would have been employer-sponsored organizations, hence the increase in the number of unions despite the anti-union legislative regime.</p>
<p>The end of 1999 was the low point to date for union membership numbers, but in terms of union density it set the bar between 21.0 and 22.0% of wage and salary earners, and it has remained in that range ever since. Under the ERA, all collective agreements must be negotiated by a union. This led to the creation of a large number of small enterprise unions to abide by the legislative requirement. However, union membership has grown much less proportionately than the reported number of unions. Under the ERA, union membership has grown by about one-quarter to 373,327 in March 2008, but with an expanding workforce, density remains in the 21.0–22.0% range of wage and salary earners throughout the period of the ERA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11429991">Feinberg-Danieli and Lafferty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11429991">New Zealand Department of Labour, 2008</xref>). As a percentage of the total employed labour force, union density is about 17.0%, but is likely below 10% in the private sector.</p>
<p>The structure of unions is such that the largest 10 unions, the only ones reporting over 10,000 members, represent fully 75% of union members as of March 2008. At the other end of the scale, the number of small enterprise unions has continued to proliferate, although the numbers of employees represented by these unions are very small.</p>
<p>So there has been a gradual growth in union membership under the ERA, but no recovery in union density. Unions remain strong in the public sector and in some concentrated areas of the private sector where union support has historically been strong. The long-term forecast is not good. There has been little spread of union membership to industries or occupations that were divested of union coverage in the 1990s, and a recent survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11429991">Haynes et al. (2006a</xref>: 212) found, ‘indifference or scepticism on the part of the majority of private sector workers’ towards unions – and so by extension towards collective bargaining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0143831X11429991">
<title>Collective bargaining coverage</title>
<p>While union membership has increased by close to one-quarter during the ERA period, the number of employees covered by collective employment agreements has headed in the opposite direction. In 1999, there were 421,400 workers covered under collective agreements (compared to a reported 302,405 union members at the time). By 2008, there were 331,800 workers covered by collective agreements and 373,327 union members. As stated above, under the ERA, virtually all employees covered by collective agreements are union members. One explanation for the decline in the number of workers covered by collective agreements is that employer-sponsored collective agreements that emerged in the 1990s, often with no union involvement of any sort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11429991">McAndrew and Ballard, 1995</xref>), have lapsed under the ERA.</p>
<p>In the 2008 data survey conducted by Victoria University of Wellington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11429991">Lafferty and Kiely, 2008</xref>), there are a total of 2684 collective agreements. However, 62% of these employees are covered by collective agreements that cover 500 or more employees, and there are fewer than 100 of those agreements, 60% of them in the public sector. Fifty-four percent of covered employees are in the public sector, so large employers account for much collective bargaining coverage. In terms of the structure of collective agreements, 59% of agreements in 2008 involved a single employer and a single union (known colloquially as SECA-SUCAs), up somewhat from earlier years under the ERA. About one-quarter of agreements involve multiple employer parties; about 15% involve one employer with multiple union parties. These structural numbers are not significantly different to what existed in 1999.</p>
<p>In short, there has been a contraction of collective agreement coverage since 2000 under the ERA.</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11429991">Haynes et al. (2005</xref>: 250) suggest ‘a greater proportion of the New Zealand workforce appears to be covered by joint consultation than by collective bargaining’. However, they do acknowledge that their data on consultation are likely to be an overestimate ‘given the widespread adoption of occupational health and safety committees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11429991">2005</xref>: 239), sometimes the result of health and safety legislation. The number of workers covered by ‘real’ collective agreements derived from collective bargaining by unions independent of employers might, at a guess, be roughly what it was in 2000. It remains concentrated in large employers, where unions were well supported going into the 1990s decade of employer domination. A little over half of covered workers, and over 60% of collective agreements, are in the public sector.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11429991">Alan Fox (1966a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11429991">1966b)</xref> is the seminal writer differentiating between unitarism and pluralism as managerial ideologies, with his early works strongly criticizing unitarism in favour of pluralism. These terms are frequently used, and rarely explicitly defined. An exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11429991">Geare (1994</xref>: 120) which gives:</p>
<speech>

<p>The organization is a team, with common objectives. General acceptance of managerial authority and managerial prerogatives. Unions are unnecessary. Conflict is pathological.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pluralist:</speaker>
<p>The organization comprises sectoral groups with objectives which sometimes coincide, sometimes clash. Unions help achieve more equal bargaining power. Conflict is inevitable.</p></speech>
<p>Furthermore, ideologies – or beliefs, attitudes and values – have three elements,</p>

<p>It is clearly possible that one’s beliefs, attitudes and values could be, for example, unitarist in the normative sense, but pluralist in the empirical sense.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that unitarism is on the rise among New Zealand managers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11429991">Geare et al.

(2009</xref>: 510) supported those findings with their study demonstrating ‘the continuing preference employers’ [<italic>sic</italic>] have for an individualistic unitarist approach to industrial relations’. In a later study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11429991">Geare et al.

<title>Strikes and lockouts</title>
<p>This article focuses principally on the nature of collective bargaining relationships under the ERA. The data on which we rely are largely attitudinal and behavioural. However, one measure of the nature of collective bargaining relationships is the incidence of strikes and lockouts. Having operated for so long under an arbitration-backed system that supported predictable wage and conditions relativities, New Zealand does not have an extensive history of contract negotiation strikes in the North American pattern. That is not to say that there were not vigorous strikes and lockouts, including in the context of collective bargaining. The 1951 waterfront dispute that continued for 151 days and deeply divided the nation is the prime example. More typically, however, strikes in New Zealand tended to be short and finite – almost demonstration strikes – in support of wage claims or as a protest against working conditions, or as often as not in the old days, in support of some political cause. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11429991">Table 1</xref> shows the extent of work stoppages for each 10-year period for the past 60 years, as well as two ‘high strike’ years (1951 and 1986).</p>

<p>For the past 20 years, unions and workers have had to negotiate on the basis of bargaining power, without the backstop of arbitration, and in a more decentralized collective bargaining environment, initially hostile to collective bargaining in the 1990s but more supportive since 2000. While there was a minor upsurge in the early years of the ERA, strikes have remained infrequent despite the more accommodating political climate. There have been some prominent lockouts of workers in recent times, but they too have been infrequent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11429991">Table 2</xref> shows strike statistics for the period from 2000 to 2007, the latest full year for which data are available (Statistics New Zealand).</p>

<p>It is apparent that work stoppages remain relatively infrequent and are generally of short duration. An exception in 2006 was an intended short strike of about 500 distribution workers for a major supermarket chain which was countered with a lockout that lasted close to one month. Even long-running disputes, such as a national salary dispute between resident junior doctors and the country’s public hospitals that ran for many months in 2008, is more likely to see a series of short, finite stoppages than a strike intended to last to the point of reaching agreement.</p>

<title>This study: Behaviours and attitudes in collective bargaining</title>
<p>The research on which the data below on attitudes and approaches to collective bargaining are based was conducted in late 2005, five years into the ERA period, following the 1990s decade of union bashing and pronounced employer ascendancy. As noted earlier, the ERA is not overtly anti-union as was the ECA. However, the actual changes are not great. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11429991">Cooper and May (2005</xref>: 4) state, even including the 2004 Amendment, the ERA represents ‘moderate reform, a degree of re-regulation within a clear ECA context’. Thus, employers bargaining in 2005 were doing so in an environment created back in 1991, with fundamentally cosmetic changes in 2000 and 2004. All employers with single employer collective agreements (SECAs), which is to say employers who had signed collective agreements covering only employees of their organization – whether all or only some of them – were surveyed for this research. They numbered 904 employers; some were party to more than one SECA.</p>
<sec id="section11-0143831X11429991">
<title>The method</title>
<p>The research surveyed only parties involved in SECAs which, as previously noted, are the majority of collective agreements, and cover the substantial majority of covered employees. Employers are required to register collective agreements with the Department of Labour and the population to be surveyed was identified using the Department of Labour database. The Department of Labour funded the project. Employers were sent letters explaining the project and inviting them to visit a website where they could complete the survey. The overall response rate was 22%. Fully completed, useable responses numbered 192.</p>
<p>Employers were asked about a series of behaviours in collective bargaining and attitudes towards unions and collective bargaining that were identified as being consistent with either traditional (i.e. defensive) or collaborative approaches to bargaining. These behaviours were drawn from an extensive review of relevant literature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11429991">Bakke (1946)</xref> was an important starting point for the development of the table of behaviours and attitudes projected to be associated with a <italic>traditional</italic> employer approach to bargaining. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11429991">Kochan et al. (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> were an important influence on the table of behaviours and attitudes projected to be associated with a <italic>collaborative</italic> approach to collective bargaining, together with the now substantial body of literature on union–management workplace partnership, mutual gains bargaining and union avoidance.</p>
<p>Given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11429991">Haynes et al. (2006b</xref>: 225) found that in the private sector ‘formalized partnerships relations between management and unions at workplace level are virtually unknown’, we anticipated finding few ‘pure’ cases of union–management collaboration or partnership in bargaining, and we were not convinced we would find a lot of ‘pure’ traditional arm’s length strategies either. Our methodological approach, instead, was to drill down into the behaviours until we found subsamples of our respondent employers that represented defensively and collaboratively inclined groups of employers, at a level that allowed for subsamples of a size suited for comparison, but that also exhibited sufficient behaviours in common to be consistent with the traditional and collaborative strategies. Where to strike that balance was a matter of our judgement (the determinants and specifics of which are the subject of the following section).</p>
<p>Having identified predominantly traditional and predominantly collaborative subsamples, we then used <italic>only</italic> these data to develop a more complete, comparative picture of collective bargaining behaviours and attitudes for these two groups. And finally, we sought to examine internal and environmental factors to establish any links between those identified by the literature as potentially influential to the choice of bargaining strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0143831X11429991">
<title>Defining strategic approaches</title>
<p>Employers were asked about 27 statements of behaviours in and around collective bargaining. We factor analysed the 27 statements. Statements which loaded on to Factor 1 were clearly collaborative, and statements which loaded on to Factor 2 were clearly traditional. Seven statements loaded on to Factor 1 at .547 or above, while only four statements loaded on to Factor 2 at that level. Accordingly, we used the four highest statements loading on to each factor to classify the collaborative and traditional subsamples respectively.</p>
<p>The subsamples were defined to include those respondents who reported that they practised the four behaviours defining the subsample in their most recent negotiations with the union representing their employees or, if more than one, the union representing the largest number of their employees. Those few who qualified for both subsamples were omitted, so that the subsamples are mutually exclusive and represent relatively ‘pure’ collaborative and traditional subsamples. The defining statements and their loadings are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11429991">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>By these definitions, as noted about one-half of the total sample of employers could be classified as either ‘purely’ ‘traditional’ or ‘purely’ ‘collaborative’ in their approaches to collective bargaining – 36 employers were in the ‘traditional’ group and 66 employers were in the ‘collaborative’ group. It is our contention that in analysing only these data we were able to glean a more refined view as to what these bargaining approaches looked like in terms of specific behaviours and attitudes. It also enabled us to identify those factors that likely motivated employers still in the collective bargaining system to follow one course or the other in the wake of a period of emphatic employer dominance.</p>

<p>A chi-square test has been used to indicate if a statistically significant difference exists between levels of agreement/disagreement between the ‘traditional’ and the ‘collaborative’ samples across each of these statements.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>Responses show the collaborative subsample to display a strong suspicion and distaste for unions (statements 5 and 9) and weak support for the efficacy of the relationship (statements 1 and 4). At the same time (and very possibly for pragmatic purposes only) however, they display an apparent willingness to engage in participative behaviours if and when required (statements 6 and 7). The collaborative subsample appears to feel it should do the ‘right thing’ (statements 6 and 7) – but reluctantly (statements 1, 5 and 8). The traditional subsample is more accepting of unions – more trusting of unions (statements 1 and 8), even though less inclined to consult with them (statement 6). To an extent it appears they view unions as worthy adversaries in the combat (statements 4 and 5).</p>
<p>There were a number of additional propositions on which the two subsamples did not differ significantly in their opinions, although some of the margins are suggestive. For example, about two-thirds of each subsample agreed with the statement that, ‘collective bargaining is probably the best way to settle differences between the organization and its employees’. There was majority support in both camps for the view that ‘the union is a legitimate representative of employees, but not part of our team’. That last statement might be seen as containing two sentiments, and so being a little ambiguous. On the other hand, very few of either subsample (4% traditional and 12% collaborative) accepted the proposition that, ‘the union is in partnership with management and employees’. There is nothing ambiguous about that. And high numbers (69% of the traditional subsample and 58% of the collaborators) expressed a preference for ‘dealing less with the union and more directly with employees’.</p>
<p>It was felt by 19% of traditional employers but 33% of collaborators that ‘having union involvement enhances the operation of our business’, but few employers (2% of the traditional subsample and 11% of the collaborative subsample) would agree that ‘the union creates a better workplace environment for employees’. Traditional employers were slightly less likely than collaborative employers (26% vs 49%) to see the union as ‘a source of conflict and division in the organization’.</p>

<p>To complete the profiles of the two subsamples of employers, we asked about the contents of collective bargaining agreements. Employers in the traditional subsample were not significantly more likely than those in the collaborative subsample to have negotiated language into the collective bargaining agreement on any of the list of issues we asked about.</p>
<p>On the other hand, collaborative employers were significantly more likely than traditional employers to report having a couple of provisions in the collective agreement: a statement of the organization’s purpose, ‘vision’ or guiding principles, and a provision for ongoing consultation between management and the union. Otherwise, the likelihood of having collective agreement content covering any of the range of issues we asked about was roughly even between the two subsamples.</p>
<p>Employers in the collaborative camp were also significantly more likely to report having unions involved in ‘participatory working parties’ and health and safety committees than employers in the traditional category. They also more often reported union involvement in ‘general issues consultative committees’ (32% vs 16%), but these numbers fell a little short of being statistically significant.</p>

<title>Factors associated with collective bargaining strategies</title>
<p>Much of the thrust of the theoretical and empirical literature, old and new, on collective bargaining approaches or strategies has to do with factors – internal and environmental – that may cause employers to move in particular directions, including perhaps to pull back traditionally, push forward more aggressively or open up collaboratively. Most often mentioned among environmental factors are economic or market conditions, and the political or legislative environment. The greater involvement of senior management and strategic human resource managers in the collective bargaining function, and in managing its relationship to both the overall organization strategy and the operation of the workplace is one key internal factor that has been flagged, perhaps coming at the expense of more traditional labour relations operatives. A range of organizational and union factors have also been hypothesized as having a bearing on employer strategies in collective bargaining. We ran some analyses looking for linkages that might support those or other hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section17-0143831X11429991">
<title>Organizational factors</title>
<p>First, a higher percentage of public sector employers (77.3%) than private sector employers (61.3%) were in the collaborative subsample, as defined, but the difference in those percentages was not significant. The differences when looking at a more detailed categorization of industry classifications did not show a statistically significant distribution either. Nor were there any significant differences by size of business or number of work locations.</p>
<p>We asked employers to describe the nature and scope of the markets in which they plied their products or services. The distribution between collaborative and traditional strategies was generally in proportion to the relative sizes of the subsamples (67 vs 37 respectively) across all types of markets, except that employers who said that they competed across the Australia and New Zealand marketplace were reversed, with two-thirds of that group being in the traditional strategy camp.</p>
<p>We asked employers to rate the level of pressure their organizations were under from any of the following sources: competition in the marketplace, difficulty in recruiting or holding staff, increasing customer demands, changes in the technology of the industry, existing labour costs, union demands for further improvements and compliance with legislation or regulations. Respondents were asked to say whether they experienced ‘intense’, ‘some’ or ‘no’ pressure from each of these sources.</p>
<p>There were some differences between the two subsamples of employers on felt pressures, but the differences were remarkably small in relation to each of the sources of pressure. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant relationship between reported pressures on costs, or from markets, and choosing traditional or collaborative strategies in dealing with labour unions.</p>

<sec id="section18-0143831X11429991">
<title>Union and negotiation factors</title>
<p>Turning to union considerations, employers with more than 50% union membership among their workforces were significantly more likely to be in the collaborative subsample than employers with less than 50% membership (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Time spent in negotiating the most recent agreement with the union was not a predictor of strategy at all.</p>
<p>We asked employers to tell us the most influential reason why they continue to deal with the union, and their responses are set out for each of the subsamples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0143831X11429991">Table 6</xref>. While the differences are not sufficient to be significant, it is of interest that 60% of employers in the collaborative camp cited the desires of either employees or the employer, whereas over 60% of the traditional subsample cited the ‘default’ options – essentially, the union had always been here and the could not avoid it.</p>

<p>We asked employers to nominate any and all of the above reasons that contributed to the fact they continued to deal with a union. Employers in the traditional camp were significantly more likely (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to cite ‘because it can’t easily be avoided’ as a contributing reason than were employers in the collaborative camp, while the latter were significantly more likely to cite ‘because it is beneficial to the organization’ as a contributing reason than were traditional employers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, there was no clear prediction of strategies by the length of time that the employer had been negotiating collective bargaining agreements with the particular union. Those few organizations that were in the first couple of years of a relationship were all in the traditional camp. Those in a three- to five-year relationship were the only group disproportionately represented in the collaborative subsample (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with those who had been involved with the union for more than five years distributed between the collaborative and traditional subsamples in proportion to the relative sizes of the subsamples.</p>
<p>We asked who was involved in the negotiations with the union on behalf of the employer. The chief executive or general manager was no more likely to be at the bargaining table for employers in one subsample vs the other. In both subsamples, 45% of respondents said that the senior executive was always present in negotiations, and about another 30% said he or she was there some of the time.</p>
<p>Likewise, the presence of an in-house employment relations specialist or lawyer had no predictive value, but few of the employers in either subsample reported taking in-house employment relations people to the bargaining table, even some of the time. One or more operations managers were reported by most employers in both subsamples as being present at collective bargaining on behalf of the employer, so again their presence was not reflective of one strategy over the other. To some extent these indicators of the makeup of employer negotiating teams reflects the relatively small size of many New Zealand businesses.</p>
<p>Of more interest was the presence in negotiations of in-house human resources managers or specialists (as distinct from employment relations specialists), on the one hand, and contracted employment relations lawyers or lay specialists, on the other. The involvement of employment relations ‘hired guns’ was reported as being statistically significantly more likely on behalf of employers in the traditional category, with a third of these employers always having them at the table. Three-quarters of the collaborative employers never engaged such outside specialists for negotiations. Sixty-five percent of employers in the collaborative category also reported never using in-house employment relations specialists in negotiations.</p>
<p>The involvement of human resources managers or specialists seems to point in the other direction. Employers in the collaborative subsample were significantly more likely (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) to have human resources people at the bargaining table than were employers in the traditional subsample, with 90% of collaborative employers having them there at least some of the time, and over 75% never going to the table without them. Human resources specialists were also present at the table on behalf of some employers in the traditional category, but they were more often missing, and when present, they were more likely to be in the company of employment relations specialists.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences between the collaborative and traditional subsamples in terms of who came to the collective bargaining table on behalf of the union. In almost all cases, the union bargaining teams included both outside union officials and delegates from the workforce.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Unions and collective bargaining have had a rough run in New Zealand since the conservative government came to power and passed the Employment Contracts Act in 1991, wiping out the remnants of the decades-long conciliation and arbitration system, removing the term ‘union’ from the legislative language, and removing all supports for collective bargaining. The ECA began a decade of emphatic employer ascendancy in industrial relations.</p>
<p>A new Labour government came to power at the end of the decade, and its Employment Relations Act 2000 was heralded as the legislation to turn around the fortunes of unions and collective bargaining. Most observers would agree that those were false expectations, and that the ERA has certainly not lived up to them. When it comes to ascendancy, conservative governments do it better. The ECA was, and was seen as, a licence for employers to ‘put the boot in’ in their dealings with unions, and to some extent with employees. The 1990s in New Zealand was not a period of advancement in wages and conditions for workers. It was a period of aggressive clawbacks in labour costs, particularly benefits, allowances and conditions, but without any concomitant quid pro quos for unions. Such fundamentals as the eight-hour day disappeared for many workers.</p>
<p>The ERA has not reversed that decade of employer dominance. What it has done is change the political environment to convey an expectation that employers and employees will treat one another decently, and most probably make the effort to do so. But the pay and conditions basis on which the ERA seeks to ‘build positive employment relationships’ is quite different – much reduced – to that which existed in 1990. So too is the balance of power between employer and union, and between employer and employee. As for the structure of bargaining, whatever the intentions, the ERA has done little to reverse those things.</p>
<p>So what are the consequences of the employer ascendancy for the New Zealand industrial relations system? First, if by industrial relations we mean the system of collective employment relations, it has shrunk by more than 50%. About 20% of New Zealand workers are now covered by collective bargaining, less in the private sector. The rest are now under individual contracts largely drafted by employers.</p>
<p>Our interest has been those parties remaining in the collective system, and in particular trying to gain insights into employer strategies in collective bargaining in a political environment more favourable to collective bargaining, but on the heels of a decade of employer dominance.</p>
<p>We used a series of behavioural statements pertaining to collective bargaining styles to identify what could be characterized as two reasonably ‘pure’ bargaining groups – one reflective of a traditional (comprising elements of the arm’s length approach) collective bargaining style; and the second representing a collaborative style. Analysis of behavioural, attitudinal and also bargaining outcome content data from these two groups, when put together, paints a fairly compelling and interesting picture of how the ideology of the parties has influenced the nature of these interactions.</p>
<p>First, our data reveal that those employers who belong to the ‘collaborative camp’ allow for a broader range of issues to be brought to the bargaining table, and report a much higher degree of participative and consultative mechanisms is present and used in the bargaining process, albeit the relationship is a tense one and one that is not necessarily considered that efficacious. Although intuitively one could assume that ‘collaborative’ employers were pluralist, there is a lot to suggest the reverse, particularly in the normative sense. The collaborative subsample clearly did not see unions being a necessary part of society – the view of normative pluralists. In the normative sense, they were clearly unitarists, basically seeing unions as unnecessary. Since unions are present, the collaborative subsample will try to do the right thing – with reluctance. It is possibly no coincidence that the collaborative group also engages human resource management specialists, with their frequently more unitarist outlook than those from an industrial relations background, in the bargaining process.</p>
<p>A more traditional approach, on the other hand, sees employers opt for a more positional stance at the outset of the negotiation process, and a greater importance being placed on the use of typical ‘offer’ and ‘counter-offer’ strategies and tactics – these often being associated with distributive bargaining activity. One might also conclude from our data that this group does not see the relationship as particularly effective either. The ‘traditional’ sample, certainly in an empirical sense, seemed more pluralist, with unions having a role – albeit to further the interests of employees rather than the organization.</p>
<p>The general profile, we believe, is based in what we have referred to as the ‘default’ employer position – essentially a traditional one, accepting unions where they appear to be entrenched, but limiting their intrusion into matters beyond basic pay and conditions. But given the conflicting attitudinal data, the general profile also seems to include a pragmatic willingness by employers to engage in what would be considered collaborative behaviours when it suits their purposes.</p>
<p>From our research sample of about 200 employers, we drew out about half who were able to be defined into two ‘pure’ strategic approaches to unions and collective bargaining. One group reported employing traditional ‘arm’s length accommodation’ behaviours; the other group reported to be attempting collaborative behaviours. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11429991">Walton et al. (1994)</xref> suggested that in the US there would be the traditional ‘arm’s length accommodation’ along with two new alternatives: collaborative relations or containment and union avoidance policies, this New Zealand sample sees the ‘arm’s length accommodation’ and attempts to develop collaboration. The collaborative group experiences the difficulties with collaboration as referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11429991">Kochan and Osterman (1994)</xref>. It is perfectly possible that employers inclined to union avoidance escaped from the collective bargaining environment during the 1990s.</p>
<p>When we referred back to the raw data on behaviours and attitudes we again found that their reported behaviours and attitudes were generally consistent with the traditional and collaborative characterizations. We tested those two groups for environmental differences, but we found no significant differences in the markets in which they operated or the competitive or cost pressures to which they were subjected. Those things do not appear to be pushing them in the directions that they have chosen. Likewise, organizational differences – size of the workforce and that sort of thing – showed no relationship to strategic choices in collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Employers in the ‘default’ traditional subsample seemed pluralist in their views, more likely than others to not accept that what was in the best interests of the organization was necessarily also in the best interest of employees. On the other hand, they were inclined to believe that they would take care of employees’ interests just as well without the union representing them. They were most likely to be dealing with the union because it could not be avoided. They were more likely to be dealing with a minority union that represented less than half the workforce. But they were more likely than employers in the collaborative subsample to be comfortable in their relationship with the union, and trusting of union officials to do the right thing by the organization.</p>
<p>Employers in the collaborative subsample were more likely to be dealing with a strong union – one with more than 50% membership in its target workforce. These employers were more likely to see union involvement as beneficial to the organization and, at least to a greater extent, than the other subsample, as beneficial to employees. They were more likely to be willing to compromise, to invest in building and protecting the relationship with the union and to consult with the union before making decisions. They were also more likely to have the union involved in other consultative forums beyond the collective bargaining table.</p>
<p>But, they were significantly less likely than the traditional subsample to say that their relationship with the union was an effective one, and significantly less likely to express confidence that the union officials would do the right thing by the organization. And indeed, they were significantly more likely to say – and more than four out of five of them did say – that their relationship with the union was ‘tense and unproductive’.</p>
<p>Our analysis of our data has thus far unearthed only one pair of variables that may offer some explanation for employers’ strategic choices in how they approach collective bargaining. Neither market nor organizational factors carried any explanatory value. In terms of industrial relations variables, employers trying collaborative approaches were, as noted, more likely to be dealing with stronger unions, in terms of higher union density. It is also of interest that a collaborative approach was more likely to be attempted by employers who had been dealing with the employer for three to five years. These would be relationships developed under the more union-friendly environment of the ERA.</p>
<p>The only other potentially influential variable involved ‘who’ came to the bargaining table on behalf of employers. Employers in the traditional subsample were significantly more likely to send to the table outside employment relations consultants or lawyers, presumably adopting ‘traditional’ approaches. Employers in the collaborative subsample were significantly more likely than the traditional camp to bring to the bargaining table human resources managers or specialists. It is consistent with some literature that the greater involvement of human resources strategists, particularly at the expense of traditional adversarial industrial relations views, might lead employers away from the traditional defensive approach to collective bargaining towards more collaborative engagement with unions.</p>
<p>Industrial relations scholars have long taken the pluralist position of acknowledging that employers and employees have different interests, in the sense that while they value their relationship, to some extent they want different things out of it. Collective bargaining is one way that parties recognize and deal with those differences, arriving at workable accommodations. In this process, the default defensive position identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11429991">Bakke (1946)</xref> and so many others down through the decades makes a lot of sense. Our evidence indicates that employers who take that approach tend to be reasonably comfortable with it. They do not welcome unions; but they accept them when they have to deal with them, they set up a perimeter to protect their managerial turf, and they negotiate defensively. The profile of the broader sample would suggest that they do that without too much hostility and with only very occasional strikes or lockouts, and that they are prepared to pull the union in tighter in a collaborative way when it suits their purposes.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, of course, but New Zealand employers in our study who are following more collaborative approaches seem, on the other hand, to be significantly less comfortable with their relationships with unions than the traditional defensive employers. We can only speculate that some of these employers might have been pushed in the direction of collaborative approaches by reference to the mandates of the ERA and by their human resource management strategists. Again, it is noteworthy that employers in relationships newly formed under the ERA were those most likely to be taking collaborative approaches. Whether because employers were ill-equipped to implement collaborative approaches, or because unions or employees were unwilling to respond on the terms offered, or perhaps for other reasons, collaborative approaches do not appear to have led to effective or harmonious relationships, not at this stage anyway.</p>
<p>While the period of employer ascendancy has clearly resulted in de-unionization of many workers and workplaces in New Zealand, the substantial shrinkage of collective bargaining coverage and a lessening of overt strike activity, it has not yet shown through in any clear imprint on employer collective bargaining strategies.</p>
