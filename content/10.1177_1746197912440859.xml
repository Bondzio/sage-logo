<abstract>
<p>Participatory citizenship education has been highlighted as a strategy to promote social cohesion in divided societies whereby collaborations with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and inter-school links have been proposed as tools to improve social networks between schools and communities. This article explores the role and meaning of citizenship education and cross-community participation in promoting social capital and social cohesion. School survey findings, focus groups and interviews with young people and educators indicated that differences between school sectors and established allegiances with particular communities and NGOs may limit the potential for citizenship education to produce bridging social capital and serve to reproduce bonding social capital. It is argued that the introduction of citizenship curricula into segregated schools systems in divided societies may be useful to promote citizenship values and positive attitudes to the other but insufficient to promote the development of bridging social capital and, ultimately, social cohesion in the long term.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite its recent (re-)emergence in curricula around the world, citizenship and citizenship education remain contested concepts (Osler and Starkey, 2003) and considering them within the context of divided societies such as Northern Ireland, Israel, South Africa, Quebec and Rwanda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197912440859">Arlow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197912440859">Enslin and Horsthemke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197912440859">Lemish, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197912440859">Niens and Chastenay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1746197912440859">Pedahzur, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197912440859">Rutayisire et al., 2004</xref>) is particularly problematic.</p>
<p>Therefore, citizenship education in divided societies is often conceived around broad interpretations of citizenship which recognize that modern societies are rarely composed of a homogenous population with a common notion of cultural identity but that they are often constituted from heterogeneous groups and individuals bearing multiple and potentially contradictory identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197912440859">Banks, 2007</xref>). These understandings of plural societies lead to interpretations of citizenship that focus on specific elements, such as human rights, social equality or democratic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197912440859">Faulks, 2006</xref>), which allows the concept to be constructed in a way that may transcend national, ethnic and cultural boundaries in divided societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1746197912440859">Smith, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Building social cohesion in divided societies is important for ensuring stability and sustainable peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197912440859">Colletta and Cullen, 2000</xref>), which are characterized by an absence of conflict and strong social bonds across different social sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197912440859">Berckman and Kawachi, 2000</xref>) and often gauged in terms of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2000</xref>). One of the main aims of citizenship education in divided societies is to promote social capital and peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746197912440859">Kymlicka, 2001</xref>) through the development of democratic values, attitudes and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1746197912440859">Smith, 2010</xref>). Schools are seen as a tool to disseminate such ideas at a national scale whereby it is hoped that the impact of citizenship education reaches beyond the school gates. Hence, it has been argued that there should be a strong focus on the participatory element of citizenship education, experiential learning and extending citizenship education beyond the classroom and into the community. Central to this is the collaborative role that schools and non-governmental organizations can play in building school-community partnerships that extent beyond traditional sectarian boundaries supporting citizenship education and active citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197912440859">Ilcan and Basok, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The rationale for this approach is supported by the literature, which suggests that through participation in the community young people can generate bonding, bridging and vertical social capital that can help to build more socially cohesive communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746197912440859">Kisby, 2009</xref>). In the context of divided societies, where the majority of young people are educated in segregated schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1746197912440859">Smith, 2010</xref>), such participatory learning can provide a rare opportunity for the development of interpersonal relationships across community divisions and thereby generating bridging capital in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197912440859">Print and Coleman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in divided societies where citizenship education curricula have been introduced there is little known about the extent to which schools may engage in cross-community participation that might foster bridging social capital and how educators and students may view such activities.</p>
<p>It was therefore the aim of this article to explore educators’ and young people’s views of the role and meaning of cross-community participation through the citizenship education curriculum in the context of Northern Ireland, a divided society with a well supported citizenship education curriculum that is a statutory subject area for all post-primary schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746197912440859">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Northern Ireland is commonly portrayed as a divided society comprising two main communities namely, a British/unionist/Protestant community and an Irish/nationalist/Catholic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197912440859">McGarry and O’Leary, 2009</xref>). This view is reinforced by structural divisions in social housing, civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197912440859">Hughes et al., 2003</xref>) and in the education system, with the majority of children attending Controlled (de facto Protestant) or Maintained (de facto Catholic) schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197912440859">Gallagher, 2004</xref>). Despite the signing of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in 1998 the constitutional status of Northern Ireland remains contested and differences in national/religious identity may continue to define traditional divisions between the two communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197912440859">Farry, 2009</xref>). However, increased immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746197912440859">Mussano, 2004</xref>) and perhaps, a growing recognition that individuals can bear multiple identities, such as age, gender and sexual orientation, highlights the fact that Northern Ireland is also a multicultural and diverse society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197912440859">Jarman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to other divided societies Northern Ireland is considered to have high stocks of bonding social capital but lacks the bridging social capital necessary for building a more cohesive society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197912440859">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197912440859">Cairns, et al., 2003</xref>). Even though bonding and bridging social capital are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2000</xref>), divisions in Northern Ireland society between Catholics and Protestants have tended to create the type of exclusive intra-community social networks that generate bonding social capital and inhibit the development of wider social networks across communities which might produce bridging social capital. Research also suggests that there is a need to take greater account of increased immigration and diversity within local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197912440859">McGarry and O’Leary, 2009</xref>) and its impact on generating social capital. Hence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197912440859">Campbell et al. (2010)</xref> argue in relation to Northern Ireland it would be important to develop strategies to generate social capital that reaches beyond traditional sectarian boundaries and incorporates links across cultural divisions.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop Local and Global Citizenship (LGC) was developed as a result of a Northern Ireland curriculum review undertaken by the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197912440859">Gallagher, 2006</xref>). Divisions in Northern Ireland society and its contested constitutional status ruled out the possibility of citizenship education being based on a nation-state model of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1746197912440859">Smith, 2003</xref>). Instead, LGC was conceived as an inquiry-based model of citizenship education that promotes the importance of multiple identities, human rights values and democratic participation and introduced as a statutory curriculum entitlement from September 2007 for years 8–12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197912440859">Arlow, 2004</xref>). This mirrored similar world-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197912440859">Biesta and Lawy, 2006</xref>) and European developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746197912440859">Naval, et al., 2002</xref>) where in many countries and divided societies such as South Africa (Enslin, 2003), Quebec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197912440859">Niens, and Chastenay 2008</xref>) and Rwanda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197912440859">Rutayisire et al., 2004</xref>) citizenship education is seen as a way to build social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197912440859">Print and Coleman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>At a local level two of the main Department of Education for Northern Ireland (DENI) policies namely Every School a Good School (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197912440859">DENI, 2009</xref>) and Community Relations, Equality and Diversity (CRED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197912440859">DENI, 2011</xref>) as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1746197912440859">Oxford Economics Review (2010)</xref> highlight the importance of education in building social cohesion. Perhaps, significantly they commonly identify the need for greater collaboration between schools and communities and highlight the curriculum as one mechanism for developing these links.</p>
<p>This study thus investigated how educators and young people saw the role of LGC and cross-community participation in promoting social capital and social cohesion and in enabling active citizenship to reach beyond the school gates in order to impact on the wider society in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>It is argued that citizenship education as a curricular activity on its own, even if supported through non-governmental organization (NGO) collaborations, may only serve to foster bonding social capital in the context of societies with traditional community divisions and, unless supported through a structured cross-community programme, may not be sufficient to develop bridging social capital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1746197912440859" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The research focused on the potential for participatory citizenship that involved the local community to promote social capital for young people in the various post-primary school sectors in Northern Ireland. NGOs that have been suggested to provide a potential vehicle for school- community collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197912440859">Gearon, 2006</xref>), were considered as a starting point to explore this main research focus. As there was limited information on the stage schools were at in delivering LGC and their level of engagement with NGOs a questionnaire survey was used to identify interview schools. A sample of 70 post-primary schools indicated that 27 had some level of engagement with NGOs while 43 had none.</p>
<p>Based on the survey findings 13 schools from the sample were selected for interviews, comprising seven with the highest levels of engagement with NGOs and six schools which had no experience of engaging with NGOs. The sample consisted of four Catholic maintained secondary schools, four Catholic voluntary grammar schools, three Protestant controlled schools, one of which was a grammar school and two other Protestant voluntary grammar schools. As this article focuses on community divisions, in the following we will refer to Catholic maintained and voluntary schools as Catholic and to controlled and voluntary Protestant schools as Protestant, based on religion of the majority of pupils who attend the particular types of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197912440859">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings presented in this article are based on a series of 26 semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with the principal or vice-principal and the citizenship coordinator and 13 focus groups involving Year 12 pupils (aged 14–16) in each of the schools. Additionally, 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with NGO representatives who were selected based on their different levels of engagement with schools. Interviews and focus groups took around 45 to 60 minutes and were audio recorded. All data was anonymized, fully transcribed and analysed thematically following the six-step guide outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197912440859">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, the interpretation of the findings will focus in depth on two of the emergent themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197912440859">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The first part of the discussion focuses on how citizenship as taught through schools relates to social networks, NGOs and various communities in society. The second part explores if and how participatory citizenship education, which is based on cross-community engagement, can contribute to developing knowledge, and skills and shared values that may facilitate young people’s negotiation of identities in divergent context and social capital. The notion of identity interweaves both themes, which are thus partly overlapping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746197912440859">
<title>Citizenship education: social networks, NGOs and community links</title>
<p>Survey results and school interviews showed that the majority of schools in the sample delivered LGC through discrete curricular provision and that LGC has not been used to promote the development of social networks between schools and local communities. Although, the majority of principals, vice-principals and teachers interviewed agreed that LGC could be used to develop links with NGOs and the local community only one third of schools reported engaging with NGOs and no schools had used LGC or their work with NGOs to develop cross-community links. Although, some schools may have developed links with NGOs through other areas of the curriculum or school activities, such as the Schools Community Relations Programme (SCRP), possible connections were not made with LGC. These findings are supported by previous research which concluded that school structures, including timetabling, have hindered the development of active citizenship in Northern Ireland (UNESCO Centre, 2008). While there is a growing support for shared education and greater inter-school and school/community collaboration in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746197912440859">Ipsos Mori, 2011</xref>) there appear to be few opportunities in school for young people to participate in cross-community activities that are based on civic and political engagement.</p>
<p>While this lack of collaboration relating to citizenship affected all school sectors, distinctions between maintained and controlled schools became evident when principals/vice-principals discussed school ethos and values. Interviewees from both, Protestant and Catholic schools, agreed that citizenship education helped to promote a variety of values within their school, such as social responsibility, community spirit, compassion, social justice, respect, diversity, human rights. However, respondents from maintained schools were more likely to link these to their school’s Catholic ethos, as the principal of a Catholic secondary school explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I do feel strongly that young people need to have a sense of social responsibility and of the contribution that they can make to their community … We have a very strong Catholic ethos at this school, we’re reaching out to others for justice and compassion which are fundamental core values for the school … and therefore citizenship fits nicely into that.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While this view reflects some key ideas underpinning citizenship education including, community, social responsibility and values it also suggests that they are likely to be presented in ways which promote the school’s Catholic ethos. In another case the principal of a Catholic grammar school explained how values such as community spirit and human rights were being promoted as part of a whole school initiative to promote the tradition and identity of the Christian Brothers in Ireland, which are associated with support for Irish nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197912440859">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). The interviews also indicated that maintained schools were more likely to work primarily with NGOs which supported the school’s Catholic ethos such as St Vincent de Paul and Trocaire, a charity organization based in Ireland. This did not appear to be a conscious decision as illustrated by the comments of the vice-principal from a maintained grammar school: ‘I suppose we work with organizations that would have similar aims to ourselves.’</p>
<p>As such, there appeared to be an overlap between religious, political and national values explicitly transmitted in these schools. Conversely, Protestant schools preferred to collaborate with NGOs with no religious affiliation such as the Simon Community or with other Christian-based organizations, such as Christian Aid.</p>
<p>This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1746197912440859">Smith and Montgomery’s (1997)</xref> findings that suggest that while controlled and maintained schools were based on common Christian values, maintained schools were more inclined to explicitly promote these as part of the school’s Catholic ethos. The findings clearly suggest that school culture and the hidden curriculum differ in both types of schools, which in turn may reinforce religious identity and differences between communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1746197912440859">Niens and Reilly, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Owing to the segregated nature of the education system in Northern Ireland social interactions mainly occur within the school community among young people who share the same community background and are often reinforced by intra-community collaboration with NGOs and like-minded schools. However, interviewees suggested NGOs as a link between the school and community and viewed NGO practitioners as having more experience of working on civic and political issues across the formal and informal education sectors with people of different ages and community backgrounds, as a teacher from one school said:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the main advantages of working with NGOs is that they have a range of experience of working with different groups of people and dealing with a variety of social issues. They can share their experience with young people and help them to connect this to the community. (Protestant school citizenship coordinator)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some interviewees thus suggested that one way for NGOs to contribute to LGC is by sharing their experience with schools to develop a model of LGC based on cross-community participation. However, others were more sceptical about certain NGOs which were perceived to have hidden agendas or to be interested in self-promotion and fundraising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197912440859">Gearon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some principals and vice-principals questioned the credibility of specific NGOs because of their perceived association with paramilitaries, as one principal commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of these so called NGOs are recycled paramilitaries who live of the back of communities. They only want to get involved with schools to claim government funding. I doubt if any parents or teachers would appreciate me bringing these people into the school. (Catholic school principal)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this case rather than focusing on the quality or type of work they were engaged in the principal viewed the NGOs efforts as a ‘front’ for obtaining funding. Arguably, this reflects the tensions and scepticism which exist in some quarters of Northern Ireland around the motives of those with perceived paramilitary associations. Divergent school sector approaches to and views of NGO collaboration in addition to the lack of cross-community links with other schools may thus create bonding social capital and reinforce young people’s sense of traditional community identity. However, it appears that social networks which extend across communities and which are required for generating bridging social capital are underdeveloped in schools in general and in relation to LGC in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197912440859">Cairns et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The study reflects other research, focusing on non-educational settings, that highlights sectarian communal divisions and a lack of horizontal bridging and vertical linking social capital in the province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746197912440859">Leonard, 2004</xref>). In Northern Ireland, traditional notions of religious/national identity have tended to reinforce communal divisions between Catholics and Protestants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197912440859">McGarry and O’Leary, 2009</xref>) and to promote the development of bonding social capital. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197912440859">Campbell et al. (2010)</xref> acknowledge that in a divided society like Northern Ireland, high stocks of social capital might reinforce societal divisions, they also argue that it can facilitate bridging social capital and that a strong intra-community network can provide a sense of security to community members which may support cooperation across communities. This suggests, that bonding and bridging social capital are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguably, the potential for LGC to promote bonding social capital through different allegiances and approaches between school sectors may be extended to include bridging social capital if activities are characterized by cross-community participation and the promotion of inclusive values.</p>
<p>Divisions between communities were acknowledged by the majority of research participants. While most young people interviewed acknowledged that Northern Ireland society was culturally diverse and associated with increased immigration and ethnic minority groups they also tended to view their society as divided between Catholics and Protestants. Typically, young people viewed themselves as belonging to the school and to the local community which they associated with being either Catholic or Protestant. Young people also recognized the importance of citizenship as a ‘practice’. They viewed cross-community participation as working on shared activities which extended beyond traditional community divisions a group of young people mainly Catholic and Protestant communities and which could include young people from ethnic minority groups. These understandings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746197912440859">Osler and Starkey’s (2005)</xref> notion of citizenship and community and the idea that they comprise both, a ‘feeling’ and a ‘practice’.</p>
<p>Young people agreed that cross-community participation could change attitudes to the other community as well as promote social cohesion; two student interviewees, one Catholic and one Protestant, explained their view:
<disp-quote>
<p>You will meet other young people and learn to work together as a team. It shows you the way people live too like Protestants. There is actually no difference between them and us. (Catholic school pupil 1)</p>
<p>It kinda brings the two communities together and helps you to understand Catholics better and be tolerant. (Protestant school pupil 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The quotes highlight a tension between the recognition that cooperation between communities may lead to better understanding of the out-group, and a sense of otherism of the outgroup that is somehow distant and needs to be tolerated. While these young people interviewed had no direct experience of the conflict in Northern Ireland, collective memories and social norms are likely to have influenced their perceptions of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197912440859">Barton and McCully, 2007</xref>). Despite this, they clearly expressed the need to move beyond community boundaries and prejudice. Sectarian attitudes in society in general were clearly acknowledged among young people and generally seen as a result of lack of knowledge, rather than being framed in the context of emotional responses to identity threat, conflicting interests or past conflict as seen in the following quote:
<disp-quote>
<p>People don’t like Catholics or Protestants because they don’t know them and are sectarian they think they (the other community) are all the same. (Protestant school pupil 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On the basis of this conceptualization of sectarianism as lack of knowledge, cross-community collaboration was regarded as a means to learn more about the other and, in turn, reduce sectarian attitudes. Young people identified lack of knowledge as the root of sectarianism as well as racism as this student explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>When new people [immigrants] come into the community some people don’t understand them and think they might take our jobs and don’t trust them in case they do something. (Catholic school pupil 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The quote highlights a more complex understanding of racism than was evident in the quotes relating to sectarianism, whereby in line with social capital theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2007</xref>) trust is conceptualized as an important component of racism as well as divergent economic interests. Arguably, participation could also enable young people to develop knowledge based trust and a greater sense of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197912440859">DENI, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746197912440859">Laurence, 2011</xref>).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… it helps building relationships with other people whether they are of the same race or of the same religion and kinda brings the two communities together … (Catholic school pupil 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the division between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland may bear the risk of marginalizing young people who do not identify with either community or with both as well as those from other minority groups, including those from immigrant families, this quote indicates that students understand sectarianism and racism as closely connected and that the same mechanisms should work to ameliorate both types of prejudice. Interviewees agreed that participation might encourage young people from Catholic and Protestant backgrounds and ethnic minority groups to work together. This, young people said, would help to reduce racism and sectarianism, both of which they viewed as possible causes of tension within local communities and wider society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197912440859">DENI, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that community identity can contribute to reinforcing divisions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197912440859">McGarry and O’Leary, 2009</xref>) and support the development of bonding social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197912440859">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197912440859">Putnam (2007)</xref> argued that greater ethnic diversity undermines trust and social capital, others proposed that it may contribute to breaking down the traditional emphasis placed on religious/national identities and promote the idea of multiple cross-cutting identities and may promote a more inclusive form of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197912440859">McGarry and O’Leary, 2009</xref>). As such it may help to build social trust, reciprocity and cooperation across communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746197912440859">Kymlicka, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The study’s findings on school and community collaborations and social capital tend to reflect the wider societal context. The research illustrates that young people recognize diversity within their communities and society, the need to challenge community divisions and the potential for citizenship education to contribute to this. However, the segregated school system, school culture and the hidden curriculum appear to curtail such efforts and may reinforce young people’s attachment to their respective national/religious identities. This and a lack of opportunities for civic and political engagement that bridges community divisions and reaches beyond the schools gates through NGO or inter-school collaborations are likely to inhibit the development of bridging social.</p>

<title>Knowledge and skills</title>
<p>The majority of interviewees including pupils were in favour of a structured citizenship education programme that was based on regular cross-community participation which enabled young people to work together on shared community based projects, as one principal stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>If this is to be of benefit to the pupils and communities it needs to be structured and managed and match the citizenship curriculum. If it is to work it needs to be sustainable over time so that pupils can build relationships with each other. (Protestant school Principal)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The comment reflects educationalists’ awareness that the success of a participatory programme depends on it being well planned and structured to ensure that the knowledge, skills and values gained from community-based learning are relevant to citizenship education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197912440859">Arthur and Davidson, 2002</xref>). Importantly, the principal also recognized that building relations between young people from different communities takes time and requires multiple opportunities for working together. This approach was seen to allow young people from different backgrounds and abilities to collaborate on real cross-community issues that provide unity and purpose outside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197912440859">Annette, 2000</xref>), as one pupil said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because if you bring people together there is going to be less tension between people. If they work together then obviously things get done better because it has everybody’s support for it … if people want to get a hall built for youth and if the community was like Catholic and Protestant may be they could work together to get it built for both. (Catholic school pupil 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Young people thus recognized that collective action through shared goals can be used to mobilize bridging social capital and to achieve social goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197912440859">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>). The educationalists interviewed also highlighted community based learning as a way to build and extend social networks between schools and communities, whereby NGOs were seen as crucial in facilitating skills and attitudes required for such collaborations.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the wider community needs to see the school working with NGOs, other groups and communities … Young people working across communities is a way of making links with others. In the future schools and communities are going to be more interlinked and NGOs can play a role in introducing the community to school children and allowing them to work together, inter-relate and become more interdependent. (Catholic school vice-principal)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rationale given by interviewees for supporting cross-community participation through LGC was presented in terms of its perceived benefits. In line with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197912440859">Arthur and Davidson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746197912440859">Ireland et al., 2006</xref>), these included developing young people’s knowledge, skills, norms and values that interviewees agreed were necessary for active citizenship and social cohesion. Most young people agreed that cross-community participation would help to improve their citizenship knowledge and consolidate their classroom learning by providing them with ‘real life’ experiences of community issues such as, social justice and social equality, as one young person stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you work in different communities you would see that people have the same problems like poverty and homelessness and this would help you to learn about things like social justice and equality. (Catholic school pupil 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Young people in this study also saw cross-community based learning relating to citizenship as a way to better understand their own identity and other communities within society.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a good way of learning more about your community and other communities. You would learn more about other young people from different communities and get to know them better. (Protestant school pupil 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Pupils’ reports of the potential benefits of cross-community based work relating to citizenship thus reflects the literature which proposes a theoretical assumption that it may help pupils to understand and value differences between individuals and communities and would allow learners to examine their own and others’ identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197912440859">Banks, 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that a better understanding of diversity could form the basis for exploring the idea of multiple cross-cutting identities and building ‘good’ relations between young people from different communities and ethnic minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197912440859">DENI, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197912440859">DfES, 2007</xref>), which is seen as essential for promoting bridging social capital and reconciliation in post-conflict societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197912440859">Niens and Chastenay, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, if young people are to mobilize bridging social capital they need to be able to make use of certain skills (Helve and Brynner, 2008). The young people in this study said that the skills they were likely to develop as a result of cross-community participation included communication, working with others, problem solving and decision making as the following quote illustrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>You develop communication skills by talking and listening to other people’s views. You have to work together as a team and agree on what to do and you depend on each other to get things done. (Protestant school pupil 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The student’s quote echoes the skills as defined in the Northern Ireland Curriculum and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1746197912440859">Lin (2002)</xref> argues that individuals who possess such skills are more likely to utilize the embedded resources in relations and generate a return. These skills may therefore enable young people to be more successful in developing relations with others from different traditions and backgrounds, which could mobilize bridging social capital in the future.</p>
<p>The quote clearly shows an appreciation that group participation, where it is characterized by cooperation and shared goals, creates interdependence and, in turn, may promote a sense of respect and trust between members. These have been proposed as prerequisites of bridging social capital and social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1746197912440859">
<title>Shared values and social responsibility</title>
<p>Social capital theory emphasizes the significance of shared norms and values such as trust, cooperation and reciprocity in creating and maintaining social networks, building relations and generating social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam, 2000</xref>). These norms and values can be related to the functional efficiency of a group, community or society and their ability to achieve shared objectives and gain social benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197912440859">Coleman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>This study’s findings suggest that the idea of young people having a sense of social responsibility tended to be interpreted as a norm connected with LGC and cross-community participation by the majority of interviewees. Typically, young people and teachers associated social responsibility with active participation and a sense of duty to contribute to the wider society as illustrated by the following two comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>Social responsibility is about your responsibility to help others you could volunteer to help the homeless or people in poverty. Everyone has to help each other Catholics and Protestants can work together to do this. (Catholic school pupil 10)</p>
<p>Citizenship helps pupils to understand that they have a responsibility to contribute to their community and society and to help other people in need. (Protestant school citizenship coordinator)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Social responsibility was thus clearly located within LGC and strong support was expressed for the idea that individuals have an obligation to support vulnerable groups in society and the view that cross-community participation was a way to contribute to wider society.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197912440859">Kiwan (2008)</xref> suggests that a participatory experience which provides young people with a sense of belonging to the community may motivate further engagement in society and the findings from this research indicate young people’s motivation to participate is also connected to gaining a sense of empowerment. The majority of young people emphasized the need for participatory activities to be meaningful, interesting and to contribute to their sense of worth and achievement by being goal orientated and more than as one young person puts it, simply ‘… standing behind a till in a charity shop’. This shows that young people’s motivation to participate may not be entirely altruistic but also seen as a way of enhancing their personal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197912440859">Irvine and Schubotz, 2010</xref>). Associated with meaningful participation was the notion of empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197912440859">Benton et al., 2008</xref>) as young people were keen to stress the importance of working with others to make a difference in society and to feeling that they can change things for the better, a view reflected by the following student’s quote:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s important to know that you can make a difference by doing something useful for the community, like helping others and you feel you are doing some good. (Catholic school pupil 11)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This, they said, would give them a sense of satisfaction and achievement, build their self- confidence and self-esteem and make them feel that they are a valuable member of the community.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When you do something to help others it makes you feel good. It makes you feel that you are more a part of the community. (Protestant school pupil 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed by some students interviewed, if participation occurs in a cross-community context, young people in Northern Ireland may thus experience for the first time a sense of belonging to a group that unites Catholics and Protestants. This sense of belonging, that overcomes the community divisions within the context of a participatory activity, may be particularly important in a heavily segregated society where many young people have limited opportunities to meet others beyond their community boundaries. It is therefore argued that a positive participatory experience may enhance young people’s self-esteem and develop a sense of collective belongingness that may bridge community divisions and be a motivating factor for future participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197912440859">Kiwan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Young people commonly cited their wish to contribute to the wider good of society as the main reason for participating in cross-community activities as illustrated by the following student’s comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it is a good idea for Catholics and Protestants to work together. It’s a good way to get to know each other and make friends and it would help to stop arguments and fights over religion and you could help to make society better. (Protestant school pupil 14)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Underpinning the seemingly divergent altruistic and self-serving rationales for participation might be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197912440859">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> notion of reciprocity and the expectation that young people’s willingness to act for the benefit of others in the community would influence others to do likewise. This implicitly pragmatic approach could also be seen in the mode of activism that responding students appeared to favour. Students’ understandings of activism were often based on the identification of those who could not ‘help themselves’ and themselves as helpers. There was less evidence of a more radical mode of activism fuelled by outrage (Davies, 2006) that would focus on the identification of the social circumstances which may render some people helpless and that aims to challenge inequality and social justice at a societal level. This apparent gap between the individual’s responsibility to help others and to affect socio-political change in the wider society appeared to be filled by notions of community and its purpose. One student explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>If we want closer communities then we have to be responsible for helping other people in our communities. (Catholic school pupil 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The reference to ‘our communities’ highlights the value that the student attaches to a sense of belonging to a group and the acknowledgement that this group is different from other communities within society and it therefore could be seen as reflecting the idea of bonding social capital. Students’ understandings of social responsibility thus appeared to focus on individual action and were located first and foremost within their own communities. However, their emphasis on the importance of cross-community participation may have signified their recognition that reaching beyond community realms may enable greater security and more opportunities within their own community. Conceptualizations of social responsibility thus appeared to be rooted in the notion of bonding social capital whereby reaching beyond community boundaries which could enable the development of bridging social capital appeared to be more of a tool to benefit their own community. While this signifies the continued parallel existence of separate communities, it also highlights that these student respondents appeared to have embraced the idea that all sides may gain from cross-community work and thereby moved beyond a zero-sum mentality, where a win for one group automatically means a loss for the other and which has often been cited as characterizing the Northern Ireland conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746197912440859">Maney et al., 2006</xref>). As such, respondents’ understandings of participation implied an acknowledgement that bridging social capital could complement rather than replace bonding social capital.</p>
<p>Interviewees in this study saw a structured citizenship education programme which provided multiple opportunities for young people to participate in shared cross-community activities as allowing young people to develop the knowledge, skills and values required to actively engage in their own community as well as to reach out to others. Understandings of social responsibility appeared to be rooted within interviewees’ own communities but extend beyond those boundaries to include others in need of support whereby the emphasis was on helping individuals rather than challenging societal structures. Interviews indicated some tensions between motivations for active engagement in citizenship based on the wish for personal development, community belonging and societal cohesion which reflected divergent notions of social responsibility, social trust, cooperation and reciprocity which are considered essential for generating bonding and bridging social capital in divided societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197912440859">Print and Coleman, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It has been argued that it is crucial to develop bridging social capital in divided societies such as Northern Ireland in order to build social cohesion and that strategies need to be devised to achieve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197912440859">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197912440859">Colleta and Cullen, 2000</xref>). While participatory citizenship education has been highlighted as a possible strategy that could contribute to the promotion of social cohesion in such contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197912440859">Annette, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197912440859">Print and Coleman, 2003</xref>), this study also indicated its potential merely to reinforce bonding social capital unless conscious efforts are made to reach beyond traditional community divisions and to promote bridging social capital. Differences between school sectors in terms of school ethos, values and established allegiances with particular communities and NGOs may thus serve to reproduce bonding social capital and to maintain existing community differences.</p>
<p>Current education policies on school improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197912440859">DENI, 2009</xref>) and community relations, equality and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197912440859">DENI, 2011</xref>) in Northern Ireland emphasize inter-school and community collaboration and suggest the school curriculum as a potential mechanism for improving social networks between schools and communities. In this study, young people’s understandings of participatory, cross-community citizenship indicated tensions in their motivations to engage in it and betray a clear-cut differentiation between bonding and bridging social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197912440859">McGrellis, 2009</xref>). However, the current findings also clearly demonstrate young people’s awareness of community divisions in Northern Ireland as well as their belief in the value of participatory cross-community citizenship and its positive impact on them individually, their respective community as well as wider society. While their experiences of identity and social capital outside of the school context may be more nuanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1746197912440859">Weller, 2009</xref>) and with strong roots in sub-cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197912440859">Leonard, 2008</xref>), notions of bonding and bridging social capital were clearly incorporated in their conceptualizations of citizenship and community relations in Northern Ireland. In such a context of support, it is argued that using LGC as a curriculum link between schools and communities and as a framework for developing a structured programme for cross-community based learning could provide young people from all sectors and divergent community backgrounds with greater opportunities for meaningful civic and political participation, to enable the development of the knowledge and skills related to citizenship and the promotion of shared values and goals.</p>
<p>Participatory cross-community citizenship could enable young people to develop the social skills and negotiate shared norms and values, such as cooperation, trust and reciprocity, which are essential for building relations and mobilizing bridging social capital in a divided but increasingly diverse society such as Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197912440859">Print and Coleman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In divided societies such as Northern Ireland, which are scarred by community tensions and segregation, the introduction of citizenship curricula may be useful to promote citizenship values and positive attitudes to the other but insufficient to promote the development of bridging social capital and social cohesion. While bonding social capital appears to reproduce itself automatically unconsciously within a segregated education system and may be supported through the curriculum, additional efforts, which aim to reduce structural divisions, seem required to mobilize bridging social capital.</p>
