<p>Dr. Gerald L. Stone died at the age of 69, on April 14, 2011 in Reno, Nevada. Jerry was a counseling psychologist whose career affected numerous people in multiple situations, and a person who lived life to the fullest.</p>
<p>Jerry was born in Los Angeles, California. He received his bachelor’s degree in psychology from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); his bachelor’s in divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary; and two graduate degrees from Michigan State University—a master’s in counseling and a doctorate in counseling psychology, completing his doctorate in 1972. Jerry’s career spanned almost three decades. He began his career as an assistant professor at the University of Western Ontario in 1972. In 1979, he arrived in Iowa City and began a career that lasted over 20 years at The University of Iowa. The years in Iowa City included an initial appointment as the coordinator of the Counseling Psychology Program and a second period where he served as director of the University Counseling Service (UCS). He retired as director of the UCS in 2001, and spent his retirement years primarily in California doing some affiliative academic work, consulting, and playing tennis, a sport that he loved.</p>
<p>Jerry was an outstanding counseling psychologist, and he excelled in multiple ways and in multiple venues. He served as president of Division 17 (Society of Counseling Psychology) and as editor of <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic> (TCP). For his exemplary work as director of the UCS, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors in 2004. He was also the recipient of the Distinguished Alumnus Award, College of Education, Michigan State University. He was a prolific writer, therapist, and researcher, as well as a highly skilled teacher and administrator. Much of his scholarship focused on the mental health issues surrounding college students and crisis response on college campuses.</p>
<p>Perhaps the defining moment of Jerry’s career came unexpectedly on November 1, 1991. In the span of roughly 10 min, a former student named Gang Lu attended a weekly research meeting and gunned down several faculty members from the physics and astronomy departments as well as a recent graduate who had won a prestigious award for his doctoral dissertation. Lu, who had also recently received his PhD in physics and astronomy, felt that he was more deserving of this award and had previously brought his complaint before the vice president of Academic Affairs several times. After he killed the three faculty members and former graduate student, he walked three blocks across campus and murdered the associate vice president of Academic Affairs and paralyzed a student employee. He then moved into an empty conference room and took his own life.</p>
<p>Jerry Stone led efforts across the university and the community as he and the staff at the UCS coordinated a swift response to the tragedy. He and his team quickly reached out to the student body, administration, faculty, and the Chinese community, providing support to a grieving, frightened community. Martha Christiansen, who at the time was a psychologist at the UCS, noted that when Jerry spoke to the media, he was “calm, matter-of-fact, and comforting.” Jerry effectively set the standard for how college campuses respond to crisis and tragedy, as these type of shootings were relatively rare at the time. He became a prolific leader in college campus crisis response, publishing several articles and giving presentations at an array of conferences. Many have said that Jerry’s coordination of the mental health response to the 1991 tragedy was his finest hour.</p>
<p>Bruce Walsh, who followed Jerry as Division 17 president recently said, “Jerry very much cared about . . . students . . . To Jerry the nature of student care was a core challenge to be addressed in national conversations on campus mental health.” Puncky Heppner, who is also a former Division 17 president, and who succeeded Jerry as editor of TCP, also recently reflected on his relationship with Jerry:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of my most powerful memories of him . . . was his staunch support in promoting the Multicultural Guidelines . . . Jerry was also a very effective leader . . . I learned a great deal from him about the many intricacies of being a fair and judicious editor.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jerry also liked to have fun. Sam Cochran, a longtime colleague of Jerry’s and the person who succeeded Jerry as director of the UCS, recently said,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I think of Jerry Stone, I recall his hearty laugh. He was a man who vigorously enjoyed all that he did, from advising his students to working with the staff of the counseling service to getting out and working with colleagues across campus. He had fun, and he was a fun guy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jerry’s commitment to multiculturalism and diversity was evident in his time as director of the UCS. He showed a keen awareness and sensitivity to the explicit and implicit appearance of the UCS, ensuring that clients would experience the agency as a place of welcoming and acceptance. He formed a committee at the UCS with the aim of discussing and implementing agency policies that would further the value that Jerry placed on diversity. This multicultural dedication was exemplified by the diversity committee’s decision to place art from all over the world throughout the agency. Jerry wove this emphasis on multiculturalism into the entire fabric of the agency. Martha Christiansen noted that Jerry was committed “to expectations of inclusion and embedding diversity in all aspects of the agency, including hiring.”</p>
<p>Jerry was a very caring person who also tried to make sure he exemplified fairness, that standards were established and observed, and that there were consequences of behavior. This combination of traits—which some have characterized as “tough love”—made Jerry a person who was loved, admired, respected, and very effective in his multiplicity of roles.</p>
<p>Jerry is survived by his wife Cheryl of 48 years, children Carrie and Corbin, and grandchildren Eleanor and Truman. Be it at work with students and colleagues, at home with family and friends; be it as a therapist, an administrator, a teacher, or a researcher, Jerry left a significant legacy—He made a difference.</p>
