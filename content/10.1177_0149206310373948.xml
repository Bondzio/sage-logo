<abstract>
<p>The authors leverage insights and theories from the extensive interfirm (business-to-business, or B2B) alliance literature to explore the effect of the sectors of the partners on the governance of infrastructure public–private partnerships (PPPs) as compared with B2B alliances. Their analysis suggests that the sectors of the partners have an important impact on PPP governance, not only because the sector constrains the availability of some governance mechanisms but also because it makes alternative mechanisms available or relevant to the partners. Specifically, the authors predict that PPPs will avoid equity structures and will rely, instead, on less complete and more complex alliance contracts; a restricted scope of activities; and nonequity hostages, such as metagovernance mechanisms or stakeholder involvement. Contrasting with B2B alliances, their analysis also suggests that trust-based governance mechanisms will play a minimal role in the governance of PPPs.</p>

<p>Public–private partnerships (henceforth, PPPs) are rapidly becoming as popular in the fields of public management and public policy as are alliances in the fields of business management and strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>), fulfilling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310373948">Sternberg’s (1993)</xref> prediction about the increasing prevalence of PPPs in the economy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310373948">Domberger and Fernandez (1999)</xref> analyzed more than 7,500 PPPs in Australia alone (and covering only the federal government and three state governments) for the 1995-1998 period. A study of PPPs in the United Kingdom documented 617 PPPs concluded by the central government over the 1990-2003 period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310373948">International Financial Services, 2003</xref>). The World Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure database compiles data for almost 2,500 PPPs initiated over the 1990-2001 period in the energy, transport, telecoms, and water and sewerage industries in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206310373948">World Bank, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310373948">Allard and Trabant (2006)</xref>, the reported value of PPP-related investment exceeded 0.5% of gross domestic product during 2003-2004 for six European countries (Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Austria, and Germany). While PPPs can be created to pursue a variety of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>), recent empirical evidence suggests that they are most commonly used by governments for infrastructure projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The growing importance of PPPs has led to a large and growing literature in public management. A PPP is defined as “an arrangement of roles and relationships in which two or more public and private entities coordinate/combine complementary resources to achieve their separate objectives through joint pursuit of one or more common objectives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>: 33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310373948">National Highway Institute, 1999</xref>). Reflecting the similarity between definitions of PPPs and of strategic alliances, which are “voluntary arrangements between firms involving exchange, sharing, or codevelopment of products, technologies, or services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310373948">Gulati, 1998</xref>: 294), PPPs have been viewed as alliances between a firm and a government agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310373948">Rangan, Samii, &amp; Van Wassenhove, 2006</xref>). Studies in this literature focus mostly on two issues: from the public policy side, the desirability of PPPs as instruments for the elaboration and implementation of public policies, and from the public management side, the practical considerations regarding how agencies should manage PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310373948">Williams, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, while the business management field has produced a vast literature on business-to-business (B2B) alliances, very few studies have analyzed PPPs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310373948">Rangan et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, save for a few papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang &amp; Bunn, 2004</xref>), neither the public nor the business management field has explored how the large body of research on B2B alliances can inform our understanding of PPPs. Yet, as evidenced by their definitions, B2B alliances and PPPs constitute similar interorganizational arrangements, suggesting that their comparison can add to our understanding of such arrangements in important ways. Consider the following examples. CEZ, a Czech utility, and MOL, a Hungarian oil company, have established a strategic alliance whereby CEZ is to build power plants at two MOL refineries in different countries, with the stated goal of greater control over energy costs and refinery operations for MOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310373948">KHEM, 2009</xref>) and a foothold for international expansion for CEZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310373948">CEZ Group, 2007</xref>). The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), a public agency managing airports, ports, tunnels, and a public transportation system in two states, and KIAC Partners (KIAC), a private consortium, have created a PPP to build a power plant at Kennedy International Airport, as a source of electricity and thermal energy for the airport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310373948">Rotaship, 2009</xref>). In both examples, the partners are pursuing similar goals (power supply, investment opportunities). The distinguishing feature of the examples is the different sectors of the PPP partners, as one partner comes from the private sector, while the other comes from the public sector. Hence, the analysis of differences between these two types of relationships can yield insights into the impact of partner characteristics on interorganizational arrangements, with valuable implications for theory and practice.</p>
<p>To start filling this gap, we analyze in this article why and how PPPs may differ from B2B alliances in the way they are structured. Following the B2B alliance literature, which contends that an alliance governance structure is a mechanism designed at mitigating the risk of opportunistic behavior in the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310373948">Brouthers &amp; Hennart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310373948">Oxley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1985</xref>), we explore how the fact that the alliance partners come from different sectors, that is, private and public, influences PPP governance structures. Our goal in this article is thus to answer the following research question: <italic>In what ways (if any) does the difference in the partners’ sectors influence the governance structure of a PPP?</italic> Both the variety of country contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310373948">Grimsey &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310373948">2005</xref>) and the diversity of industries in which PPPs have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>) make generalizations applying to all PPPs particularly challenging. As a consequence, we focus our argument throughout this article in two ways: on countries with developed institutional environments, thereby following much of the public management literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310373948">Barzelay, 2001</xref>), and on infrastructure PPPs, the most common type of PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>), which are characterized by large up-front investment, very long time horizons, and a high degree of asset specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels &amp; Trebilcock, 1996</xref>). Roads, power plants, electricity grids, and even downtown shopping malls have all been the subject of PPPs in recent years.</p>
<p>Our work contributes to the emerging literature on PPPs by introducing theories and insights originating in the extensive B2B alliance literature and by highlighting the similarities and differences between both types of alliances. In doing so, we are in line with the comparative approach advocated by the new public management perspective, which calls for the introduction of businesslike practices in government agencies to improve their efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310373948">Barzelay, 2001</xref>). We also contribute to the more extensive B2B alliance literature by moving beyond this literature’s typical focus on alliances between private firms, thereby relaxing its implicit assumption that alliance partners are of a similar sector. In doing so, we provide new insights on the determinants of alliance governance and extend transaction cost economics (TCE) arguments regarding alliance governance. Finally, our work helps managers and government officials deal with an increasingly common, and yet somewhat different, type of alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, we define government agencies and use agency theory to highlight how they differ from private firms. After analyzing opportunism in PPPs relative to B2B alliances, we ground our analysis in TCE to explore how these cross-sector differences affect the portfolio of governance mechanisms available to PPPs compared with that of B2B alliances. A final section concludes. Throughout the article, we illustrate our insights by comparing and contrasting the examples of the CEZ-MOL alliance and the PANYNJ-KIAC PPP (henceforth Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership.)</p>

<title>How Do Government Agencies Differ From Private Firms?</title>
<p>Government agencies are infrequently researched by management scholars outside the field of public management and administration. The literature suggests that they differ from private companies in a number of ways beyond their stated goals, although there is a lively debate among public management scholars about the extent of, and reasons for, these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Bretschneider, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Chun, 2007</xref>). Assessing the differences between private and government-owned organizations is complicated by the fact that the public sector includes many different types of organizations, all (at least partially) owned by the government but exhibiting very different levels of “publicness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Bretschneider, 1994</xref>). Academic analyses of the public sector (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310373948">Hughes, 2003</xref>) establish a clear difference between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and government agencies. SOEs are defined as business entities wholly or partially owned by governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310373948">OECD, 2009</xref>). In contrast, government agencies are organizational units within the public sector that “advise the political leadership on the development, review and implementation of policy, and . . . manage [their] own resources so that policy may be implemented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310373948">Hughes, 2003</xref>: 25). Although some SOEs enjoy a special status, exempting them, for instance, from bankruptcy and receivership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310373948">World Bank, 1995</xref>), they share most of private-sector firms’ characteristics and, as a consequence, exhibit fewer “publicness” characteristics than do agencies, which are the basic organizational unit of the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). SOEs’ partnership strategies are therefore similar to private firms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310373948">Rondinelli &amp; Sloan Black, 2000</xref>). For this reason, we focus in this article on the canonical type of public-sector organization, the government agency, while acknowledging that other types of public-sector organizations, such as SOEs or national laboratories, resemble private firms more closely.</p>
<p>The public management literature has extensively analyzed the nature of government agencies (for a classic analysis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>), relying on a variety of theoretical lenses to explain what drives the public nature of agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Bretschneider, 1994</xref>). Agencies are typically created by an act of legislation with a well-defined organizational purpose and usually a number of support units (e.g., their own information technology support) to allow them to carry out their objectives. An agency-theoretic approach is particularly useful to understand the nature and the governance of government agencies, and the literature identifies two major characteristics of government agencies that differentiate them from private firms: the use of taxation as the agencies’ main funding source and the monopolistic public good nature of their output. Both create specific agency issues, which, in turn, have important implications for the governance of government agencies.</p>
<p>First, unlike firms, agencies are sustained through the compulsory act of taxation rather than through voluntary market exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310373948">Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310373948">Schaeffer &amp; Loveridge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). In exchange for the use of compulsion to fund their activities, agencies are subject to controls to prevent abuses of the power of compulsion. Agencies are held accountable through transparency requirements involving disclosure of their procedures and activities, and they are held in check by due process and fairness standards to ensure that no persons or entities are unduly advantaged—or disadvantaged—by agency decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310373948">Ahadzi &amp; Bowles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310373948">Grimsey &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310373948">Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). Although firms in many countries are subject to increasingly strict requirements regarding nondiscrimination, disclosure, and monitoring by the board of directors (e.g., under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States), the transparency and due process requirements applicable to agencies amply exceed corporate ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310373948">Schaeffer &amp; Loveridge, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Agency reliance on budgetary funding further creates a particular reticence regarding the profits that an agency may make through its activities. Although agencies sometimes charge fees for the services they provide, they are not structured to operate on a commercial basis, and thus, there is no requirement to account for profits or losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Chun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). Accordingly, there is no provision in government accounting for the return of profits to citizens, equivalent to the way a firm distributes dividends to its shareholders.</p>
<p>The second main difference between an agency and a private firm is that the fundamental purpose of an agency is the monopolistic production of public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310373948">Moore, 1995</xref>). Public goods, unlike goods produced by private firms, are <italic>nonexcludable</italic>, meaning that they benefit everybody without exception, and <italic>nonrival</italic>, meaning that the number of people benefiting from them does not affect the benefit of each individual. The transportation infrastructure network of a region is a good example of a public good monopolistically provided by a government agency. This network of roads is open to any user in the region, irrespective of whether the individual paid for it or not (it is nonexcludable), and up to a congestion point, its availability is the same for everybody, irrespective of the number people using it (it is nonrival). This contrasts with toll roads, which are only offered to paying customers.</p>
<p>The public good nature of government agencies’ output further enhances the emphasis on transparency and procedure as a mechanism controlling agencies. Although recent research shows that public managers themselves do not perceive their individual goals as being less clear or measurable than those of private managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>), the measurement of an agency’s performance as a whole is particularly problematic, mostly because public goods are by definition nonexcludable, meaning that a simple bottom-line analysis is inappropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310373948">Hughes, 2003</xref>: 64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310373948">Moore, 1995</xref>). Improved infrastructure facilities can, for instance, increase not only travel volume but also the direct and indirect exposure of local residents to new ideas that enhance local economic development. Where a firm’s effectiveness could be reasonably measured by the volume of profitable passenger traffic, a public infrastructure agency typically also pursues the goal of promoting local economic development through the construction and operation of basic facilities, making a simple measure of passenger volume incomplete. In addition, demonstrating that particular outcomes are the result of agency behavior can be a complex exercise. Economic development may be the result of a variety of factors linked in complex ways, including the diffusion of new ideas through travel and other means. If accountability cannot be ensured by simply evaluating the effectiveness of agency action, it can at least be enhanced by scrutinizing the processes used by agencies to make decisions and to carry out their activities. For instance, comprehensive civil service rules for the hiring, compensation, and promotion of civil servants, which may lead to red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>), are meant to prevent the abuse of public-sector employment for patronage purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310373948">Hughes, 2003</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310373948">Skowronek, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The monopolistic character of an agency’s public goods output also has important implications. As monopolies over many types of activities, like law enforcement or tax collection, agencies concentrate the attention of any stakeholder affected by agency activity, and accountability requirements place agency behavior “under the microscope” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310373948">Hughes, 2003</xref>: 202-203 ). Not surprisingly, the effect of such intense scrutiny of agency behavior is to make agency managers and staff more risk averse than managers in private firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310373948">Ahadzi &amp; Bowles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Kingsley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310373948">Goldsmith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310373948">Schaeffer &amp; Loveridge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). Another consequence is to make agencies far more responsive to stakeholder concerns than firms are. Agency managers may be unwilling to make decisions without prior consultation with powerful stakeholders to ensure their consent, leading scholars to argue that formalization of the decision-making process does not actually come from a supposedly bureaucratic nature of public managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Scott, 1996</xref>) but from the fact that public managers “receive red tape that is created for them by legislative and political superiors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>: 459). Coming on top of the greater procedural rigidity of agencies, risk aversion and stakeholder consultation render decision making in agencies typically slower than in firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310373948">Schaeffer &amp; Loveridge, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>An agency-theoretic approach to government agencies thus suggests that there are two fundamental differences between government agencies and private firms: the compulsory source of their funding and the monopolistic and public good nature of their output. The agency problems that these differences create have, in turn, important implications for government agencies. First, unlike private firms, government agencies rely more heavily on transparency and procedural requirements than on output-based performance measures to control the behavior of agency managers. Second, profit, when it exists, is typically looked upon with suspicion by stakeholders. Finally, multiple stakeholders are involved in monitoring agency activity, leading to behaviors on the part of managers that are typically more risk averse than in the private sector. In the next section, we argue that the agency characteristics uncovered in the public management literature have important implications for the governance structure of PPPs.</p>

<title>Governance Structure Implications for PPPs</title>
<p>The literature on alliance governance, strongly influenced by TCE, argues that the governance structure of an alliance is primarily determined by the partners’ desire to mitigate opportunism, defined as “self-interest seeking with guile” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310373948">Das &amp; Rahman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310373948">1993</xref>). Governance mechanisms influence the partners’ behavior by increasing the cost of opportunistic behavior and aligning the interests of each partner with the success of the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310373948">Brouthers &amp; Hennart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310373948">Hennart, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310373948">Luo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1991</xref>). The first question we need to ask, therefore, is whether PPPs entail a significant risk of opportunism for the alliance partners.</p>
<p>Research in public management suggests that the risks associated with opportunism in PPPs may actually be as critical as those in B2B alliances, even if the opportunism is of a different nature. Infrastructure-related PPPs typically display a high degree of complexity and asset specificity because they involve the construction of unique facilities under time and budget pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310373948">Jupe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310373948">Liu &amp; Cheah, 2009</xref>), meaning that opportunistic behavior is harder to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310373948">Luo, 2006</xref>). In addition to the impact of complexity and asset specificity on opportunism, which is well established in the alliance literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310373948">Luo, 2006</xref>), a firm in a PPP is also exposed to payment delays due to budgetary manipulations within the agency or the government, potentially creating financial difficulties for the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310373948">Mazouz, Facal, &amp; Viola, 2008</xref>). In fact, the combination of large up-front investments, longevity of infrastructure assets, and high asset specificity creates a high level of exposure to government opportunism for the firm. Changes in government policy can alter the conditions of the PPP in ways that diminish its profitability for the firm, including, in the most extreme cases, outright expropriation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels &amp; Trebilcock, 1996</xref>). The risk of opportunism is also acute for the government agency. A private partner that does not fulfill its obligations can create significant financial stress for the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310373948">Mazouz et al., 2008</xref>). An agency may suffer considerable criticism, even embarrassment, if its stakeholders consider that a firm allied with the agency is misusing taxpayers’ money; in fact, the public’s anger can reach all the way to the government and lead to the demise of the agency or the government itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310373948">Hodge &amp; Greve, 2009</xref>). In other terms, a significant risk associated with opportunism exists in PPPs for both partners. Following a TCE reasoning, the governance structure of the PPP will need to be designed by the partners in ways that mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>An alliance governance structure comprises a set of distinct yet interrelated mechanisms, which can be of a formal or informal nature. Much of the TCE-influenced alliance literature focuses on the formal elements of governance, including equity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310373948">Hennart, 1988</xref>) and alliance contracts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310373948">Parkhe, 1993</xref>), for instance. But many scholars have also highlighted the importance of the informal elements of alliance governance, focusing mostly on interpartner trust (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310373948">Madhok, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310373948">Poppo &amp; Zenger, 2002</xref>). In fact, many scholars view the formal and the informal elements of alliance governance as complementary dimensions and argue that they need to be studied side by side (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310373948">Das &amp; Teng, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310373948">Iyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310373948">Jeffries &amp; Reed, 2000</xref>). Following this approach, we analyze the PPP’s alliance governance structure as a portfolio of mechanisms, which includes both formal (equity, contract, scope, and nonequity hostages) and informal (trust-based) elements, and we explore each mechanism in turn in the rest of this section.</p>
<p>An important consideration in the analysis of the choice of governance mechanisms is their substitutability. Because a governance structure is a portfolio of mechanisms, alliance partners can, to a certain extent, use different combinations of these mechanisms to reach an acceptable level of risk and governance costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310373948">Poppo &amp; Zenger, 2002</xref>). To account for this flexibility in the choice of governance mechanisms, we analyze their use one at a time, holding the other mechanisms constant. For instance, we discuss the complexity of the alliance contract, holding alliance scope (and other mechanisms) constant, but we recognize that the scope of the alliance will affect the degree of complexity of the alliance contract, leading to the addition of a ceteris paribus condition in all our propositions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310373948">Table 1</xref> summarizes our arguments. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206310373948">Table 2</xref> provides additional information about the CEZ-MOL alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership, which we use as illustrations throughout this article, and presents how they differ along all the governance dimensions we discuss.</p>

<title>Equity</title>
<p>Given the potential for opportunism in PPPs, the degree of asset specificity, and the complexity of activities typically pursued by PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310373948">Jupe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310373948">Liu &amp; Cheah, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang &amp; Bunn, 2004</xref>), equity-based structures may be called for to provide effective control of partner behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310373948">Brouthers &amp; Hennart, 2007</xref>). The attributes of government agencies, however, have important cost implications on the governance options available to PPP partners. Specifically, it will be costlier for an agency to create an equity-based PPP than for a private firm to create an equity-based B2B alliance for an equivalent transaction. While the public sector as a whole can invest equity into profit-seeking ventures, reticence toward profit-making activities as well as legal constraints will severely limit an agency’s ability or willingness to make significant equity infusions into an alliance. First, as we mentioned earlier, while agencies may charge fees, they are structurally not organized as commercial ventures, due to strong stakeholder reticence toward profits accruing to agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Chun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). As a consequence, choosing to infuse equity into a PPP implies overcoming stakeholder reticence, which is likely to be challenging. Infusing equity into a PPP can also have important cost implications for the agency because of the legal constraints that typically push the public sector to use special vehicles such as SOEs, rather than agencies, to invest in profit-seeking ventures. This makes equity infusion significantly more complex for an agency than for a private firm. As a consequence, while PPP partners may choose an equity-based governance structure for their alliance, this choice implies additional costs that stem from the attributes of government agencies and will therefore be less likely than it would be for a B2B alliance governing a similar transaction. The result will be a greater reliance on nonequity mechanisms, even when similar transaction attributes would lead to an equity-based structure in a B2B alliance. The examples of the CEZ-MOL alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership illustrate the different role of equity in each type of relationship. As part of the alliance with MOL, CEZ purchased 7% of MOL’s equity; in addition, the alliance is structured as an equal-interest joint venture between the two companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310373948">KHEM, 2009</xref>). In contrast, KIAC agreed to build a power plant without any capital contribution by PANYNJ under the terms of their PPP agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310373948">Rotaship, 2009</xref>). This leads to the following proposition:</p>
<list id="list1-0149206310373948" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 1</italic>: Contrasting with B2B alliances, PPPs will be less likely to be governed by an equity-based structure, even when the characteristics of the transaction would call for an equity-based structure, ceteris paribus.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Proposition 1 has important implications for PPPs. Because equity is a significantly less attractive governance mechanism, PPPs will tend to rely on the nonequity mechanisms of governance identified in the alliance literature: contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310373948">Reuer &amp; Ariño, 2007</xref>), scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310373948">Oxley &amp; Sampson, 2004</xref>), hostages other than equity-based hostages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310373948">1985</xref>), and interpartner trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310373948">Zaheer, McEvily, &amp; Perrone, 1998</xref>). In turn, these mechanisms will be suboptimal for most of the complex transactions involved in PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310373948">Jupe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310373948">Liu &amp; Cheah, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang &amp; Bunn, 2004</xref>). PPPs will bear higher governance costs than do B2B alliances, which can use equity more easily where appropriate.</p>

<title>Contract</title>
<p>The alliance contract, in spite of being significantly less studied than equity-based governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310373948">Reuer &amp; Ariño, 2007</xref>), is regarded as the main nonequity alliance governance mechanism when it comes to formal coordination and control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1985</xref>). An alliance contract typically specifies the commitments, contributions, and benefits accruing to each partner, as well as conflict resolution mechanisms such as arbitration clauses or lawsuit provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310373948">Parkhe, 1993</xref>). Because of the impossibility of identifying all the contingencies of a relationship as complex as an alliance, it cannot provide full protection against potential opportunism and is therefore always incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310373948">Dasgupta &amp; Tao, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310373948">Hart &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1985</xref>). Prior research suggests that the inherent incompleteness of contracts can be mitigated, to some extent, by their complexity, albeit at a cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310373948">Ariño &amp; Reuer, 2006</xref>). More complex contracts incorporate more elements of the agreement and include more contingencies surrounding the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310373948">Parkhe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310373948">Reuer &amp; Ariño, 2007</xref>), thereby reducing incompleteness but also increasing the cost of contract writing and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310373948">Hart &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). While related, contract completeness and complexity are thus two distinct characteristics of an alliance contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310373948">Ariño &amp; Reuer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with B2B alliance contracts, we expect PPP contracts to be at the same time less complete and, as a reaction to this, more complex. First, the incompleteness of the PPP contract relative to the activities it governs will be higher than in B2B alliances, as PPP partners will avoid equity-based mechanisms to mitigate opportunism in complex transactions (Proposition 1) and will thus need to use contracts in suboptimal situations. Furthermore, the ability to predict partner behavior, a key determinant of the level of uncertainty surrounding the transaction, is more limited in PPPs because of the very different attributes of the partners in terms of sector, goals, and internal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310373948">Carson, Madhok, Varman, &amp; John, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310373948">Parkhe, 1991</xref>), which we discussed in an earlier section. One could argue that, while agencies will find it difficult to predict the firm’s behavior, the firm can rely on the procedural constraints of the partner agency to impose clear boundaries on the agency’s behavior and thus make it more predictable. But the agency will also be subject to policy changes dictated by its political superiors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels &amp; Trebilcock, 1996</xref>). For the firm, such policy matters will usually be unfamiliar territory or at least less familiar than the world of business. As a result, fully specifying the partners’ behavioral contingencies is more difficult, resulting in more incomplete alliance contracts. Greater contract incompleteness will, in turn, lead to more complex contracts in PPPs relative to B2B alliances for similar types of transactions, as partners in PPPs will compensate for greater incompleteness and limited alternatives to control for opportunism with greater complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310373948">Ariño &amp; Reuer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310373948">Hart, 1995</xref>: 23). The MOL-CEZ alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership reflect these differences. While the MOL-CEZ alliance is governed by a joint-venture agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310373948">MOL, 2008</xref>), the relationship between PANYNJ and KIAC is governed by three complex agreements: a 25-year Energy Purchase Agreement, a Construction and Operations Agreement, and an Agreement of Lease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310373948">New York State Division of Tax Appeals, 2004</xref>). Our reasoning thus leads to the following set of propositions:</p>

<title>Scope</title>
<p>While less studied than equity or contracts, scope is an important governance mechanism in alliances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310373948">Oxley and Sampson (2004)</xref> define alliance scope as “the range of activities . . . performed within the alliance” (p. 724). They argue that alliance scope is an understudied but important mechanism to control opportunism, for example by preventing the partner from accessing valuable knowledge within the firm. Scope as a protection mechanism can be found, for instance, in highly uncertain and fast-moving environments such as e-commerce or high-technology alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310373948">Adobor &amp; McMullen, 2002</xref>). More generally, the literature suggests that alliances associated with high uncertainty levels tend to have a narrow focus, at least initially, especially when opportunism risks are also high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310373948">Jupe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect PPPs, like other alliances associated with high uncertainty levels, to have a narrow focus, at least initially. While the environment of infrastructure PPPs may not be particularly uncertain given the long-term nature of infrastructure project, the drastically different nature and goals of the partners in PPPs are likely to create high levels of uncertainty within the partnership. As a consequence, it can be in the interest of both the firm and the agency to minimize information disclosure in the PPP. For the agency, less disclosure is consistent with the fairness requirements we discussed earlier, since it prevents the firm from gaining an advantage over other firms through the use of PPP-related information. For the firm, it prevents the agency from using such information to obtain better terms in future negotiations. In other terms, we expect the uncertainty associated with partnering with an organization from another sector to lead both partners to favor a narrow scope, at least initially. In turn, narrowing the scope of the alliance is likely to create important opportunity costs, as it will limit the activities that partners are able to undertake in the alliance. It is interesting to note that although the MOL-CEZ alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership involve the same type of transaction (primarily electricity generation), the two alliances have a different scope. Whereas the former comprises two separate refinery sites located in two different countries, with potential consideration of two other countries, the latter is limited to a single site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310373948">KHEM, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310373948">Rotaship, 2009</xref>). This may be indicative of the greater uncertainty involved in the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership. We thus formulate the following proposition:</p>

<title>Nonequity hostages</title>
<p>One of the main benefits of the use of equity is the creation of a financial “hostage,” but hostages need not be of a financial nature alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310373948">Williamson, 1983</xref>). In response to the undesirability of equity-based structures, we expect the partners in PPPs to create alternative hostage situations. A relatively simple alternative hostage is the use of nonequity financial penalties such as guarantees, surety bonds, payments into escrow accounts, and similar mechanisms, which are available to both firms and agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels &amp; Trebilcock, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>On the agency side, however, financial penalties may not provide enough mitigation of opportunism risks, given the government’s possible recourse to taxation. Indeed, while agencies themselves do not typically have the direct authority to impose new taxes, they rely on resources coming from taxation, as we discussed in an earlier section. Hence, we expect other hostage alternatives to be developed, particularly metagovernance arrangements and the involvement of stakeholders, outside governments or international financial institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels &amp; Trebilcock, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310373948">Koch &amp; Buser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310373948">Rangan et al., 2006</xref>). In line with agencies’ reliance on procedures and transparency, politicians may develop a specific set of rules applicable to PPPs in order to prevent the abuse of partnerships for the benefit of specific companies or constituencies or to offer clearer guarantees for firms. This set of rules correspond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310373948">Koch and Buser’s (2006)</xref> concept of metagovernance: “the regulatory environments of mechanisms and processes that enable or constrain the PPPs” (p. 551). While similar in concept to a firm’s dedicated alliance function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310373948">Kale, Dyer, &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>), the scope of metagovernance is wider, as it applies to any government agency’s collaboration with a firm, and its guidelines are more stringent and precise than those found in private firms (for a review of metagovernance standards, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310373948">Bourn, 2004</xref>). In addition to metagovernance mechanisms, which are national in scope, international financial institutions can create additional guarantees either through insurance schemes (like the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) or by pressuring national governments to agree to international arbitration and potential penalties as conditions for financial assistance.</p>
<p>More generally, external stakeholders can increase the cost of acting opportunistically for alliance partners if they can credibly threaten to punish free-riding or opportunistic partners. Public scrutiny of agency activity, combined with the ability of stakeholders to influence agencies through the political process, gives stakeholders particular prominence in the functioning of agencies, as we argued earlier. We expect stakeholder prominence to manifest itself in PPP governance through the involvement of key stakeholders in consultative, supervisory, or decision-making bodies, with provisions for stakeholder consultation prior to the making of important decisions within the PPP. In contrast with the joint venture established by MOL and CEZ, which follows commercial goals and is only affected by external stakeholders to the extent that private firms can be, the PPP between PANYNJ and KIAC is strongly affected by the involvement of external stakeholders, not only through metagovernance mechanisms—extensive procurement rules followed by the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310373948">PANYNJ, 2009a</xref>)—but also in the form of airlines that take plant output for the operation of their terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310373948">New York State Division of Tax Appeals, 2004</xref>). This leads to our next proposition:</p>

<title>Trust-based governance mechanisms</title>
<p>Scholars who argue that alliance governance inevitably contains informal elements typically base their argument on the role of interpartner trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310373948">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310373948">Madhok, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310373948">2006</xref>), leading to the notion of “trust-based governance” in alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310373948">Carson et al., 2003</xref>). Trust, which can be defined as “a set of expectations shared by all those involved in an exchange” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310373948">Zucker, 1986</xref>: 54), influences partner behavior in ways that differ from and complement more formal governance mechanisms. In an alliance, trust typically stems from four main sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310373948">Ariño, De La Torre, &amp; Ring, 2001</xref>): <italic>initial conditions</italic>, which refer to the common background and experience that may preexist between two potential partners, as trust first emerges in “familiar worlds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310373948">Child &amp; Möllering, 2003</xref>); <italic>negotiation</italic>, which refers to the trust that can be built during the partner selection and the contract negotiation stages; <italic>interactions</italic>, which refer to the trust that is built within the alliances; and <italic>behavior outside the venture</italic>, which refers to the influence of the partners’ behavior outside the alliance on interpartner trust within the alliance.</p>
<p>Our previous discussion suggested that the reliance on formal governance mechanisms in PPPs, compared with B2B alliances, is significantly undermined by the different sector of the partners. Following the alliance literature, a logical consequence would be the development of the trust-based elements of the alliance to compensate for the ineffectiveness of the formal structure. We expect the different sector of PPP partners, however, to make it particularly difficult for the partners to build trust.</p>
<p>The sources of initial trust are more limited for PPPs than for B2B alliances, as firms and government agencies are most often not really familiar with each other. In other terms, trust between PPP partners needs to emerge in unfamiliar, rather than familiar, worlds. Partners in B2B alliances may, of course, be unfamiliar with each other, especially in international alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310373948">Glaister &amp; Buckley, 1997</xref>), but the fact that they both compete and have profit objectives gives them some basis for mutual understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310373948">Lucea, 2007</xref>). PPP partners, by contrast, face not only the lack of familiarity that B2B alliance partners may encounter but also the lack of familiarity stemming from different goals, organizational processes, and worldviews. The degree to which “swift trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310373948">Meyerson, Weick, &amp; Kramer, 1996</xref>) may be created between PPP partners is thus extremely limited. Making this problem more acute, “swift distrust” rather than “swift trust” is likely to preexist between potential PPP partners. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang and Bunn (2004)</xref> note, “To ask a seasoned government agency to suddenly shift its mental model and trust business sellers is not a trivial task” (p. 108).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we mentioned earlier, agencies are typically characterized by a stronger emphasis on formal procedure, as a consequence of their reliance on taxation, of the difficulty to measure their performance, and of the importance of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310373948">Bozeman &amp; Bretschneider, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310373948">Wilson, 1989</xref>). This has important consequences on the partner selection stage and on the possibility to develop trust through negotiations. The selection of the partners will put a much greater emphasis on formal processes, dictated by accountability, transparency, and procedural requirements, compared with B2B alliances. Agencies will need to formally advertise their interest in partners through the publication of an official document soliciting responses in a preestablished format, rather than through direct communication between potential partners. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey and Bozeman (2000)</xref> show, agencies display much greater formalization of procedures than do firms with respect to procurement. Explicit specifications of task criteria and, as a consequence, a greater reliance on competitive tendering and on documented procedures can be expected. Thus, agencies will be required to consider all firms that meet the formal criteria and to select the firm that best meets them according to preestablished evaluation rules. An important implication is that PPPs will be able to tap into a larger pool of potential partners, but this also means that the probability of interpartner prior interaction and trust is lower than in B2B alliances.</p>
<p>Once the alliance is established, the monitoring of the partners’ behavior both inside and outside the alliance by external stakeholders is likely to add to the challenge of developing trust particularly. PPPs, which, unlike most agency activities, involve the generation of profits, are particularly susceptible to stakeholders questioning the fact that public resources are used to create profits and those profits are shared with private firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310373948">Ahadzi &amp; Bowles, 2004</xref>). As a result, we expect agencies to reinforce the formalization of their interactions with the firm to avoid any suspicion of wrongdoing by its stakeholders. This will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for informal governance mechanisms to play a major role in the everyday governance of PPPs. Of course, trust may still arise from daily interactions between employees of both partners within the PPP—contrary to what is often claimed, public managers are not structurally different from private managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310373948">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>). But the emphasis will still be on formal governance mechanisms because of the characteristics of the agency. This suggests a significantly different alliance governance structure when compared with B2B alliances, in which trust always plays a role even if limited by opportunism constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310373948">Madhok, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, scholars and consultants advising agencies on how to build successful PPPs often highlight the importance of interpartner trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310373948">Jones &amp; Noble, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang &amp; Bunn, 2004</xref>). We certainly agree that interpartner trust in PPPs would greatly facilitate interactions. Yet our reasoning suggests that the difficulty to build trust in a PPP is such that partners are likely to rely on formal procedures rather than on trust. Even if some trust can be built over time, they will rely on trust to a much lesser degree than do B2B alliance partners. Once again, the contrast between the MOL-CEZ alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership is illustrative. We observe the structuring of the former through the formation of a joint venture, with its own capital and managerial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310373948">KHEM, 2009</xref>), allowing informal interactions between firm employees and, as a consequence, trust formation to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310373948">Ariño et al., 2001</xref>). This contrasts with the strictly contract-based relationship between PANYNJ and KIAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310373948">Rotaship, 2009</xref>), in which a lack of personal interactions between employees makes the development of trust particularly challenging. Our last proposition is thus as follows:</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we explore whether the difference in the sector of PPP partners has implications for the portfolio of governance mechanisms available to the partners as they try to mitigate opportunism. We focus on infrastructure-related PPPs in developed countries. Our analysis suggests that the balance between control and trust typically found in B2B alliances will be more challenging to achieve in PPPs due to the limitations in the governance mechanisms that are applicable to these alliances and to the high transaction costs of PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>). Specifically, we argue that equity-based governance structures, while theoretically available to PPPs, entail significant costs due to the attributes of the agency and will be less common, even when the characteristics of the transactions involved in the alliance would call for an equity-based control in a B2B alliance. As a consequence, PPP contracts will be less complete and more complex, relative to the transactions they govern, than B2B alliance contracts. Furthermore, other governance mechanisms will be used to compensate for these governance challenges, particularly a restricted scope and reliance on nonequity hostages, including external stakeholder involvement and metagovernance mechanisms. Finally, we argue that trust-based governance, while theoretically desirable, will play an insignificant role in the governance structure of PPPs, creating a very singular case of alliances in which trust is not expected to play any major role.</p>
<p>Our main contribution to the PPP literature is to bring in insights and theories from the broader alliance literature to conceptually explore the differences between B2B alliances and PPPs, thereby offering a comparative approach in line with the new public management perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310373948">Barzelay, 2001</xref>). In doing so, we complement valuable prior research in the public management literature, which has focused on the desirability of PPPs from a public policy perspective and on the practical implications of PPPs for agencies, rather than on analyzing PPPs as a form of alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310373948">Mazouz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310373948">Wang &amp; Bunn, 2004</xref>). We also contribute to the alliance governance literature, and more generally to TCE applied to alliances, by moving beyond this literature’s typical focus on alliances between private firms and thus its unstated assumption that alliance partners are of a similar sector. Our analysis suggests that the sectors of partners has an important impact on alliance governance, not only because it constrains the availability of some governance mechanisms, such as trust-based mechanisms, but also because it makes alternative mechanisms, such as metagovernance, available and particularly relevant to the partners. As a consequence, the portfolio of governance mechanisms available to PPP partners differs from that of B2B alliances in systematic ways, implying different levels of protection against opportunism and different governance costs. Exploring PPPs therefore contributes to our general understanding of the relationship between opportunism, transaction costs, and alliance governance.</p>
<p>We believe our article also has implications for managerial practice. Our analysis calls for firms allying with a government agency to be prepared for much more intense scrutiny and disclosure than in other activities; to accept a greater degree of formality in the structuring and conduct of the alliance; to anticipate the direct or indirect influence of external stakeholders on the unfolding of the alliance; and to rely on different mechanisms to prevent opportunism on the part of the alliance partner, while not being able to rely on the trust-based mechanisms that alliance scholars suggest are so important to successful alliances. Furthermore, the significant differences between PPPs and B2B alliances that we uncover in our analysis suggest that development of an “alliance capability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310373948">Kale et al., 2002</xref>) by firms may not be sufficient for building successful cross-sector alliances if such a capability is focused on B2B alliances. From the perspective of government agencies, our analysis suggests that agencies may underestimate the potential benefits of PPPs. By viewing them as strategic alliances, while at the same time understanding the specificities of PPP governance structures, PPPs can allow agencies to learn from firms, manage risks, and more generally, use the private sector in ways that may go beyond simple outsourcing contracts.</p>
<p>We are aware of the important limitations that we face in pursuing this line of research, which remain to be addressed in subsequent work. An important limitation is the need to consider the trade-off between opportunism, governance costs, and opportunity costs in PPPs. The governance mechanisms we discuss in this article are part of a portfolio of mechanisms that may interact with each other. A narrower alliance scope, for instance, is likely to lead to less complex alliance contracts, thereby reducing the costs of writing and monitoring a complex contract, as it increases opportunity costs by limiting the activities of the alliance. While this is a common attribute of alliance governance mechanisms, the difficulties we identify in this article regarding the implementation of PPPs seem particularly challenging. More generally, these trade-offs have important implications for the governance structure that firms and agencies eventually choose to govern their interactions. PPPs, the focus of this article, are but one of the many different governance options that firms and agencies can choose from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310373948">Lawther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310373948">Mazouz et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding the reasons that lead firms and agencies to choose PPPs over other governance structures to manage their interactions is thus an important issue. We leave it for our ongoing research program on cross-sector interactions.</p>
<p>Our analysis, which we illustrated through the comparison of the MOL-CEZ alliance and the Kennedy Airport Power Station partnership, is drawn specifically from infrastructure-related PPPs in developed countries. Yet the use of PPPs is rapidly spreading to other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>) and to developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310373948">Grimsey &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310373948">2005</xref>). Thus, an important question is whether our propositions can be generalized to these different conditions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310373948">Daniels and Trebilcock (1996)</xref> point out, infrastructure construction and operation activities have distinct properties including large up-front investment, very long time horizons, and a high degree of asset specificity, which, as we discussed, increase the potential for opportunism. Other activities pursued through PPPs, such as the construction and operation of schools or prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>), have lower up-front investment requirements, shorter horizons, and lower asset specificity but also typically exhibit a greater difficulty of specifying and measuring outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310373948">Donahue, 1989</xref>) and may thus lead to similar PPP governance structures.</p>
<p>The application of our propositions to developing-country contexts is more problematic. Major differences in the institutional environment with respect to developed countries affect agency behavior in developing countries. We know little about differences in the degree of aversion to profit in developing-country agencies, but evidence shows that they are typically characterized by a higher level of formalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310373948">World Bank, 2008</xref>); by less democracy, transparency, and stakeholder monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310373948">Freedom House, 2009</xref>); and, correspondingly, by greater levels of corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310373948">Transparency International, 2008</xref>). The implications of these differences, particularly the weakening of rules through corruption, deserve careful consideration in subsequent research on PPPs.</p>
<p>Finally, we also leave for our pending research agenda on PPPs the empirical testing of our propositions. Many case studies of specific PPPs have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310373948">Mazouz et al., 2008</xref>), and large databases of PPPs exist, giving valuable insights regarding their importance within specific countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310373948">Grimsey &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>) or the type of activities that are typically conducted in PPPs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310373948">Blöndal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310373948">Domberger &amp; Fernandez, 1999</xref>). We believe that the propositions developed in this study can be operationalized into empirical research designs to test the validity of our claims. We hope this article will thus open new avenues for research, especially empirical, on this increasingly important type of alliances.</p>
