<p>On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet system, Mikhail Gorbachev declared at the U.N. that “imperialism has changed and is no longer threatening.” No more than a decade after this statement, the United States and allies were dropping bombs over the most populated cities and industrial/military zones of Iraq. After the attack, this <italic>holy</italic> coalition divided the Iraqi air space into three zones and imposed an exhausting embargo upon the Iraqi people. One year after 9/11 the U.S. military again led a coalition that invaded Iraq without any “legitimate” justification, that is, the existence of weapons of mass destruction, turning the country into a loose federation of ethnic and religious sects. In spite of harsh international criticism no concerted international action could stem these actions, reinforcing the idea of a uni-polar world system. This certainly had implications on the world left. Even though late Marxist studies contributed considerably to the discussion, the dominant Marxist perception of imperialism in the 20th century had been bounded by the classical texts on imperialism which overwhelmingly point to the inter-imperialist military rivalries. As alleged uni-polarity dominated the international relations, the definition of imperialism which mostly depended upon the assumption of multi-polarity began to recede to the rarely heard discourse of small leftist circles. The retreat from the concept of “imperialism” paved the way for a new understanding, based on the unrivaled, forceful peace setting and multi-centered “empire.” However, in the last couple of years, this censure has been challenged by a recovery in the interest and, to a great extent, the pervasive and insistent resistance of the Iraqi people. Ellen M. Wood (<italic>The Empire of Capital</italic>), David Harvey (<italic>New Imperialism</italic>), and many others, have successfully revived the concept of imperialism in understanding the world as we experience it today. Alex Callinicos’s contribution <italic>Imperialism and Global Political Economy</italic> is one of the latest and best contributions to the emerging debate.</p>
<p>His book first presents a theoretical conception of imperialism and then focuses on its historical development. Exploring the validity and legacy of the classical Marxist conceptualization, Callinicos argues that the classical tradition, following Marx’s methodology, introduces a new concept at each and every level of abstraction for moving to a higher one, as opposed to deducing it from the lower level of abstraction. However, this tradition generally neglected the kernel of Marx’s theory of crisis, i.e. the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Callinicos, while discussing the shortcomings and novelties of the classical tradition, attaches significance to the concept of “uneven development,” smartly draws attention to one basic structural problem of the classical tradition which may be called <italic>epitomization bias</italic>. Marx epitomized England as the pioneer in capitalist development, abstracted the main concepts from her experiences in which the organization of capital was less centralized and concentrated, and productive and financial capital was relatively less incorporated. On the other hand, the leading theoreticians of the classical tradition, Hilferding, Lenin, and Bukharin, epitomized late comer countries like Germany and the United States where capital was organized along completely different lines. According to Callinicos (and to Michael Kidron), the tension between these two approaches is liable to generate theoretical and more importantly empirical problems for the classical legacy.</p>
<p>In the light of this two-way epitomization bias, Callinicos presents his position regarding the discussion on imperialism. Callinicos, like David Harvey, assumes that imperialism is the product of the relation between two irreducible layers: economics (the logic of capital accumulation) and (geo)politics (the logic of territoriality). This relation, in the form of the state system, is introduced to theoretical framework non-deductively. However, by stressing that the territorial logic is internal to capitalism, Callinicos distances himself from David Harvey who externalizes the territorial logic. Underlying the importance of combined and uneven development, he indicates that this process allowed the drive for national capital accumulation to preserve the international state system which predated the former. Therefore, as opposed to both Wood and Harvey, Callinicos goes further to argue that the territorial logic peculiar to the capitalist world is the product of the transformation of a pre-existing state system by the advent of capitalist accumulation.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book, Callinicos, in his historical inquiry of imperialism, demonstrates his position regarding the discussion on imperialism. In the first chapter, unavoidably, the book deals with the emergence of capitalism in general, and transition from feudalism to capitalism in particular. In this framework, Callinicos attempts to show the prominence of the territorial logic and how the drive for capital accumulation coincided with the drive for territorial mastery. By this way, he also tries to reveal that the interplay of capital accumulation and territorial logics gave birth to the aggressive and expansionist states of Dutch republic and British monarchy. Especially the rivalries between these two and the continental absolutist states were destined to direct these “capitalist” states to form naval and military hegemony. Callinicos refers critically to the basic pillars of the Annales School<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0486613411423906">1</xref></sup> and state derivation theses (of Bonnefeld, Hollaway, and others)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0486613411423906">2</xref></sup> for their conception of the state and capitalism. He underlines how the expanded capitalist accumulation transformed itself into expansionist territorial hegemony by elaborating the relations between the emergence of markets and empires. Moreover, the way the ever-growing mobilization and war making capabilities of emerging capitalist states aggravated the accumulation tendency and how the requirements of capitalist accumulation enhanced these capabilities are clearly shown.</p>
<p>The text follows with Callinicos’s periodization of the history of imperialism. The basic criterion is taken as the nexus between the mode of territorial hegemony and the organizational structure of capital accumulation. Accordingly, the history of imperialism is divided into two periods. First, the period of classical imperialism, during which British hegemony and rival imperialisms, starting from the 1870s, organized themselves into formal territorial empires. And second, the era of super power imperialism, during which the United States played the leading role as the contender against the Soviet threat, in world domination.</p>
<p>Despite the dominant liberal rhetoric of the period, British imperialism, Callinicos argues, closed its imperial domain to potential rivals and this closed door policy triggered the territorial hunger of potential contenders like Germany and the United States. These tensions, with the contribution of the escalating accumulation crisis, created the seedbed for two world wars. After the Second World War, the capitalist world economy had to face two challenges: the geographical expansion of the Soviet system (and, as a consequence, the ascension of the U.S.S.R. as a “superpower”) and the collapse of traditional empires. The United States, as the new leading imperialist, found itself committed to two important functions: containing the Soviet threat and reconstructing the world capitalist economy. In this respect, the state managers of the United States began to pursue an open door policy, instead of an exclusive imperial policy. The Bretton Woods institutions acted as supporting instruments in this framework. Instead of directly governing, the United States preferred to enter into coalitions with local dominant classes. This strategy was appropriate for the historical scene in which nationalist sentiments and developmentalist strategies gained prominence. In addition, the reconstruction of European capitalism and new “planning” states served also to ease the realization problem for most U.S. industries. The territorial logic of American imperialism in this period was consistent with the accumulation requirements of U.S. capitalism. On the other hand, as Callinicos rightly emphasizes, this imperialist strategy generated “general conditions favorable to <italic>all</italic> capitals” (190). After the collapse of the Soviet system, U.S. imperialism, especially after the advent of neo-conservative governments, opted to act unilaterally. This strategy’s limits have been tested in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Callinicos warns us not to exaggerate this uni-polarity and outlines the main centrifugal powers. Even in the period of “superpower imperialism,” between 1945 and 1991, the overt hegemony of the United States was checked and limited to some extent by its own developed capitalist allies. Therefore, the designation of superpower status between 1945 and 1991, and the arrogant unilateral attitude of the United States in the post-Soviet era, do not mean that U.S. hegemony proved Kautsky right in his anticipation of ultra-imperialism. Callinicos’s attempt clearly identifies the potential inter-imperialist conflicts and threats. In this respect, Callinicos’s analysis of the invasion of Iraq is very valuable. He suggests that this invasion fulfilled three functions: first, exhibiting the military might of the United States to potential rivals (as dropping atomic bombs over the cities of nearly defeated and exhausted Japan was a show of power to the future enemy the U.S.S.R.); second, controlling the oil reserves of the Middle East; and third, initiating a social and political transformation which will eventually strengthen the local groups favoring Western capitalism. Consequently, Callinicos totally discredits the idea of imperialism without militarism and conflict.</p>
<p>Besides the above-mentioned merits of Callinicos’s approach to contemporary imperialism, there are a number of points that might be critically stressed. The first point concerns the role of the state. Even though Callinicos appreciates the contribution made by the theory of uneven development, the relation between the distinguishing features of the capitalist state and the processes of uneven development is left rather vague. Instead, the chapter on the state deals mainly with the relation between the multiplicity of states and uneven development. It is obvious that the latter argument cannot be a substitute for the former; it implies a different perception. Indeed, for Callinicos, uneven development is an explanation for the multiplicity of capitalist states, or the state system. Further, the process of uneven development is also responsible for the emergence or the transformation of the capitalist state as part of class conflict and warfare. This does not mean that, as state derivation theses imply, the emergence of the capitalist state is internal to class conflict. The capitalist state, as an external structure, is affected by and affects the pace of class warfare. The process of uneven and combined development solidifies itself in the structure, and hence tendencies, of the capitalist state. In this respect, the formation of the state system is the by-product of the historical and political process.</p>
<p>Another point concerns the historical specificity of imperialism. Callinicos, like writers in the classical tradition, assumes that the era of imperialism began in the 1870s. Therefore, he also implies that there was a period of non-imperialist capitalism, or to put it in other words, a period of a peaceful, non-aggressive, non-monopolistic, and non-expansionist capitalism. Besides the distorted political strategies and tactics that could be drawn from such a view (i.e. the possibility of a new peaceful capitalism), it is quite questionable when the historical evidence is taken into consideration. Capitalism, before the 1870s, was at least as aggressive and expansionist as the capitalism after 1870. In this sense, the stylized aspects of imperialism (monopolies, the concentration of production and capital, the merging of industrial and financial capital under the tutelage of finance capital) outlined in Lenin’s definition of imperialism are generally quantitative benchmarks, instead of being qualitative categories. Therefore, one may extend the historical boundaries of imperialism back to the origins of capitalism and adopt the view of permanent imperialism, as a structural characteristic of capitalism. Nevertheless, one has to be fully aware of the fact that such an approach may have the risk of rendering the concept of imperialism meaningless. This risk, however, is worth taking for the theoretical prospects of reinitiating a discussion on the permanency of imperialism.</p>
<p>The last sentences of Callinicos’s book read: <italic>“…[B]ut I believe that those seeking a different social world may be assisted in their efforts by a better understanding of the system they confront. I have sought in this book to contribute to such an understanding. In doing so, I hope also to have shown the kind of analytical purchase Marxist social theory has in the Twenty-first century. How well I succeeded in attaining these objectives I am happy to leave to others to judge…”</italic> (227). The readers will certainly benefit from Callinicos’s contribution to the discussion on imperialism. Easing the return of the concept of imperialism, this intervention will provide a fertile and supportive framework for those who will dedicate their lives to confront the capitalist system.</p>

<p>The Annales School is a French school of historical thought which mainly deals with the long-term evolution of economy and society rather than specific political and international issues. The most prominent members of this school were Marc Bloch, Lucien Febvre, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Georges Duby, and Fernand Braudel.
