<abstract>
<p>In Austria, gifted education and the education of highly gifted and talented children have been receiving an increasing public awareness and social acceptance over the past decade. The article highlights the existing ideas of giftedness in Austria, and it presents several initiatives having triggered and influenced this positive development. The provision of special programs for gifted education is closely linked to the general structure of the Austrian school system. This established system and its inherent opportunities for talent support will be described. The information forms the background to understand why there is still a public controversial debate on the need of specific endeavors in gifted education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Austria, the meaning and acceptance of giftedness and gifted education can be characterized as being ambivalent: On one hand, a great variety of supportive initiatives and endeavors can be listed, and on the other hand strong reservations toward the label <italic>highly gifted</italic> can be identified. Twenty years ago, these two seemingly opposing positions caused an intense dispute between two leading political parties concerning politics in general education and the support of specific programs in gifted education. Meanwhile, a consensus has been found with the help of research and scientific discourse. Generally today, the usual way of handling the fact that a person, especially a child, has exceptional abilities and shows the potential for excellent performance is to avoid the usage of the term <italic>gifted</italic>. The recurrent argument revolves around the fear of creating an outsider of the peer group or of society: Hiding above-average abilities is mainly caused by the motive to not be noticed as being “different from the others.”</p>
<p>Most recently, a new political consensus had been found. Legal conditions have been created making the establishment of networks and the realization of programs in gifted education possible. Step by step, these new regulations are helping to create an atmosphere that aims to change the described societal and personal stance toward giftedness.</p>
<sec id="section2-0162353213494502">
<title>Primary Conception of Giftedness: Definition and Usage of Terms in the German Language</title>
<p>Analyzing the definitions and usage of terms of giftedness, many differences between the German and English languages can be identified. In general, the preferred theoretical concept of giftedness in Austria is the concept of multiple intelligences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213494502">Gardner, 1993</xref>). This concept is based on a broader understanding of intelligence than IQ testing provides. Intelligence is not a single, inborn, and unchangeable capacity for which a general factor can be nominated; intelligence is the capacity to solve problems. Problem solving involves more than those skills measured in traditional intelligence tests. Another aspect of this approach of multiple intelligences is the idea that a person can be very good in a specific domain, such as mathematics, but that does not mean he or she is similarly excellent in another area, such as in writing. Particularly with regard to talent domains specifically requiring noncognitive skills (e.g., dancing, singing, sport), this concept of giftedness is more appropriate.</p>
<p>In contrast to the tradition in English/American scientific terminology, the terms <italic>Begabung</italic> (meaning “ability”) and <italic>Talent</italic> (meaning “talent”) are not used for the distinction between natural abilities and systematically developed skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353213494502">Gagné, 2003</xref>). Both terms express the potential to do something. Begabung mainly addresses exceptional cognitive thinking skills (e.g., memory, capacity, reproduction, fluency) and higher order thinking skills (e.g., critical thinking, reasoning); talent is related to physical and artistic activities (e.g., singing, dancing, drawing, cooking).</p>
<p>Concerning the usage of the term <italic>highly</italic>, a shift can be observed during the two past decades: When the issue of gifted education was brought into the focus of teacher trainers in the mid-1990s, the first training courses gave preference to the intelligence-based concept of giftedness and the usage of 130 points as the discriminating score in intelligence tests. Presently, due to the established broader concept of giftedness, this term is mainly put in parentheses. Even in diagnostic reports based on psychometric procedures, especially with IQ testing, the results avoid the label <italic>highly gifted</italic> by communicating the percentage quotation and the ranking, not the IQ number. The scores are explained as a potential and not as a fixed factor for achievement in different domains of human activities.</p>
<p>In 2006, the European Commission initiated a report on “Specific Educational Measures to Promote All Forms of Giftedness at School in Europe” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213494502">European Commission, 2006</xref>). This document gives an overview on the variety of official terms and terminologies most commonly used to denote children or young people displaying exceptional potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213494502">European Commission, 2006</xref>, p. 8). The main terms are <italic>gifted/very gifted, talented</italic>, or other terms.</p>
<p>Gifted children in Austria are described as those, “who perform especially well in intellectual, emotional, social and artistic fields, as well as in sports, as a result of their (considerable) ability and (special) talents, which are seen as evidence of very high potential of achievement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213494502">European Commission, 2006</xref>, p. 30). Above-average results are taken as evidence for very high potential in a specific talent domain. The performance in aptitude tests or in tests of potential ability and also the informal measurement of the level of attained performance are the classification criteria for the denotation of children and young people as gifted or talented. In addition, interpersonal, emotional, and psychomotor abilities as well as intellectual and artistic aspects of development are taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213494502">European Commission, 2006</xref>, p. 9).</p>
<p>Characterizing the current discourse on concepts of giftedness as a hidden endeavor can be identified in society as well as in the scientific community to distinguish between <italic>Begabungsförderung</italic> and <italic>Begabtenförderung</italic>. Begabungsförderung means nurturing any individual with all his or her talents and abilities as well as with his or her failures and shortcomings. Begabtenförderung concentrates on the special abilities and talents a gifted person can have. By definition, there is no clear distinction between these two terms concerning the idea of man and related anthropological concepts. The usage of these terms originated with the previously mentioned ideological dispute between the two political parties. Presently, a general political agreement exists concerning the practice of gifted education and talent support in Austria: Programs should concentrate on the person in general to foster and develop his or her abilities and talents as well as focusing on the developmental needs of a gifted individual. The overall objective of all educational endeavors is to support a person’s individual talent development as well as the establishment of a coherent self. The following description of initiatives and programs of gifted education shows how a bridge can be made between these two concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0162353213494502">
<title>Talent Domains Valued in Austria</title>
<p>If you search the web about Austria and what it is most well-known for, the most frequent answers may include musical references to Austrian composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Josef Haydn, Anton Bruckner, Anton Dvořák,Strauss-Family, and Gustav Mahler; or conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Karl Böhm, and Nikolaus Hanouncourt; singers such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Vienna Boys Choir, The Trapp Family, and Falco; and dancers such as FannyElsler, Grete Wiesenthal, and Gertrud Bodenwieser. Austria is well-represented musically also with the hymn “Silent Night” and the Viennese Waltz. If you ask Austrian citizens the same question, you will again hear the same names. These famous musicians highlight the Austrian tradition of promoting musical talents during the past 200 years. Several educational institutions as well as events and locations for performances have been founded and established, and Austria has achieved a leading position with international and worldwide importance in setting standards. It is home to the Viennese Opera, the Burg Theater, Vienna, the Wiener Festwochen, the Salzburg Festival, the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, the Mozarteum University in Salzburg and the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz. Clearly, music is a highly valued domain of talent in Austria.</p>
<p>Another talent domain established in the public and collective mind about Austria is winter sports, most of all skiing and ski jumping. Austrians are regular medal winners in the winter Olympics as well as in other international competitions. In 1901, the first skiing club, the Ski-Club Arlberg, was founded with its core objective being the promotion of young skiers. In 1967, the SchigymnasiumStams opened its doors as the first academic secondary school in the world specializing in the training of athletes for winter sports. Since then, many similar educational associations and institutions for the promotion of winter sports have been founded. Equivalent promotion structures exist in other disciplines of amateur and professional sports. The most popular and traditional of these is soccer. In 1894, the first Austrian soccer club was founded, and during the last decade, several soccer academies have been established, encouraging young talents. The promotion of sporting talent is sponsored by private fundraising, as well as by the Austrian government and by the Austrian lottery.</p>
<p>Beside music and winter sports, Austria is well-known for many other talents and it should be pointed out that excellent performance in these other areas are not usually considered less important than music. Hence they belong to the national cultural heritage of Austria, and therefore represent core components of the identity concept of Austrians. These domains are fine arts, design and architecture, theater and film, literature, philosophy, psychology, economy, social sciences, political theories, and natural sciences. Many of the persons working in these fields have either won the Nobel Prize in their particular domain or their work is valued as fundamental for the development of sciences. Many schools have been named after them. Austria is also famous for its traditions in cooking and food production. Since the 1980s, Austria has been a pioneer in organic farming, and holds a leading position within the European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353213494502">Eder, 2006</xref>). Nearly 20 % of the acreage in Austria is used for organic food production. Since 2001, four master plans were established to support joint efforts between research, environmental technology industry, economy, and education to attain climate protection targets and additional environmental protection objectives. Several federal, university, and private research institutes have been working on the development of organic technology since the first organic farms were established in the 1920s.</p>
<p>All these areas and the excellence of related performances are present in the shared memory of the Austrian society and in the consciousness of its citizens. Policymakers and relevant stakeholders are aware of the responsibilities they have in saving and nurturing these traditions. Special governmental structures as well as the allotment of funds and private sponsoring by economic and commercial companies and by handicraft guilds show this awareness. Additional allocation of funds is given by the nine Austrian province-governments, economic associations, public or charitable foundations, and by some private sponsors and donors. A remarkable financial base is available for the promotion of specific talents, high ability, and giftedness, related to the traditional as well as new domains of excellence, such as computer sciences, and information and communication technologies. This talent promotion is not labeled as “education for the gifted.” It concentrates on high and excellent performances symbolized by innovative products and high quality of results and outputs. This is the idea of man as the producer contributing to the increase of the competitive capacity of the nation.</p>
<p>Excellent performance cannot be simply executed. Existing knowledge and experiences regarding excellent performance have highlighted the importance of personal factors since the beginning of research on giftedness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213494502">Terman, 1925</xref>). The coherence of all aspects of personality, meaning high and low potential and abilities, is one of the most important preconditions of excellent performance. Austrian legislation and the government concentrate on this precondition. The single person having found individual happiness by the development of a reliable personality and being well integrated into the society enables a development of the anthropological background.</p>
<p>Due to the broad palette of talent domains valued in the Austrian society, the governmental endeavors aim to provide supportive conditions for the education of talented and gifted young persons in the regular school system. It must be mentioned that the nurturing and promotion of exceptional talents and abilities cannot be achieved fully in the regular school system. The development of expertise needs experts and special training programs adapted to the individual performer—A regular school in general cannot provide such special individualized programs, hence there is a huge range of governmental possibilities to support this development. Before we present details of concrete Austrian initiatives in educating highly gifted and talented children, the Austrian school system is described, because all other initiatives are connected with formal education.</p>

<title>The Austrian School System</title>
<p>Austria has two ministries which have the nurturance of cultural tradition and the promotion of talents as core topics on their agendas: Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur—Federal Ministry for Education, Art, and Culture (BMUKK) and Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung—BMWF (Federal Ministry of Science and Research). BMUKK had funds of more than 8 billion Euros as the total budget for education, art and, culture for 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213494502">Bundesministerium für Finanzen [BMF]/Federal Ministry for Finances, 2011</xref>). With this investment, the Austrian school system is ranked as the fourth most expensive educational system within Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). For science and research (BMWF) the governmental investment is more than 7 billion Euros—this is 1.13% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In total, 41% of all research and scientific activities are financed by the government. In this aspect, Austria holds the top rank within the OECD or EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213494502">BMF, 2011</xref>). The education of children and programs for the promotion of innovative research are given priority. Steps have been made to reduce pupil numbers per class (maximum 25), as well as changes in the structure and in the curriculum of the academic secondary school system. In addition, there has been improvement in day-care facilities for pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213494502">BMF, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Austria, formal education is mainly provided by governmental public schools. There are only a few private schools, which are run by clerical or commercial institutions. Regardless of their status, the structure of the Austrian school system is founded on three levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162353213494502">Figure 1</xref>): Primary School level (Grades 1-4), Secondary School level (Grades 5-13), and Tertiary Education level (after matriculation or with past professional experience). A school year starts at the beginning of September and ends at the beginning of July.</p>

<p>The legislative regulation requires compulsory formal education of all children living permanently in Austria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353213494502">Schulpflichtgesetz, 1985</xref>). Continuing the tradition of school education established in 1774, this law does not require a child to receive this education in schools or within the school system; parents and other nonprofessional educators are allowed to provide this obligatory education outside of school. In such cases (e.g., a child is homeschooled) the responsibility for evaluating the child’s knowledge acquisition is given to the school the child normally would have to attend. At the end of each school year, this school must provide exams equivalent to the curriculum of a particular class; to continue to the next higher class, all exams must be passed successfully.</p>
<p>Kindergarten attendance is voluntary, beginning at the age of 3. Since 2010, it is obligatory by law for all children to attend kindergarten in the last year before entering Primary school. Compulsory education lasts 9 years, beginning in the year when the child is 6 years old. At this age, each child must be enrolled in the primary school of the district where she or he resides. Since 2006, early admission to primary school is possible for children who will become 6 years old by March of the following calendar year and who can cope with the cognitive and emotional requirements of the first grade. Children who have already reached age 6 at the beginning of the school year, but who do not show the expected developmental stage of maturation, must attend preschool for 1 year. This year counts as the 1st year of compulsory education. Depending on the capabilities and needs of the child, she or he may require between 1 and 3 years to master the material of the curriculum for preschool and Grades 1 and 2. These 3 years are called <italic>Grundstufe 1</italic>. Within this phase, a child can also move forward from one grade to the next during the school year, not just at the end. This general regulation allows a flexible beginning to school according to the developmental level of an individual child.</p>
<p>Secondary school education starts at age 10 and provides various paths for the promotion and nurturing of talents and abilities at different levels of challenge and achievement, especially for grades 5 to 8. These paths are either general secondary school (Hauptschule/HS) or academic secondary school (AllgemeinbildendeHöhereSchule/AHS), and, since 2008, the pilot project <italic>Neue Mittelschule</italic> (NMS; New secondary school). General secondary school (age 10-14) is common mostly in rural areas and it offers instruction in three ability levels in German, mathematics, and modern languages. In these subjects, the children are grouped in classes according to their abilities, and there is a permanent support system to enable a move forward to the next level. The classes with the highest achievement level have the same curriculum as equivalent grades in academic secondary schools. Furthermore, each general secondary school can develop a special profile by creating an autonomous curriculum and setting instructional emphases on selected subjects, such as languages, music, art and design, sports, science, ecology, computer science, and the like. In addition, special types of general secondary school have been established concentrating on the professional and intensive training and education of high abilities in sports, music, or arts. For admission to these schools, the students must pass ability tests.</p>
<p>In general, academic secondary schools (<italic>Gymnasium</italic>) are found in cities; education lasts for 8 years and is divided in two levels: The lower level covers the same age group as the general secondary school; the upper level provides education leading to matriculation exams (Grades 9-12). There are three types of academic secondary school, each with a different emphasis: Gymnasium (Latin or modern languages), <italic>Realgymnasium</italic> (mathematics and natural sciences), <italic>WirtschaftskundlichesRealgymnasium</italic> (more chemistry and textiles or technical handicrafts). Similar to general secondary schools, academic secondary schools are also given partial autonomy to establish a special ability profile and to create an appropriate curriculum (e.g., concentrating on languages, sports, music or/and arts bias, trade or crafts). For acceptance, children must pass aptitude tests. Furthermore, there are two special forms of academic secondary school at the upper level (Grades 9-12), which focus either on language and arts or on science and mathematics.</p>
<p>The pilot project NeueMittelschule (NMS) concentrates on the integrated and differentiated development of abilities and talents. Providing a joint education for all children between 10 and 14 years, it covers Grades 5 to 8, and was established to avoid the negative effects of too early segregation and selection in different paths of school education. Instruction at the NMS follows the curriculum of the academic secondary school at the lower level. In these schools, teachers from general and academic secondary schools work together in teams.</p>
<p>Basic and higher vocational education is offered in several special types of schools. The Polytechnic school provides a 1-year-basic orientation in vocational training and career planning (Grade 9). The students can choose one of seven subject areas: metal work, electrics, wood construction, commerce/clerical, service, or tourism. After graduating from this school, the student passes on to a vocational education lasting 3 or 4 years and based on a dual system, combining an apprenticeship with the corresponding vocational college. After several years of professional experience, additional courses can be taken to receive the master craftsman’s diploma. Further education can be acquired in higher technical colleges.</p>
<p>Upper level secondary technical and vocational college, Kindergarten teacher training college, and teacher training college for social education and medium-level secondary technical and vocational colleges are other types of vocational education. These colleges offer full-time courses in industrial, trade, and craft areas such as commerce, nursing and health, computer sciences, tourism, beverage and food production, fashion, home economics, social work, forest, and agriculture. They start at Grade 9, and they last between 2 and 5 years. The students graduate with vocational diplomas or with vocational matriculation examinations. These diplomas open the admission to specialized courses at postsecondary level.</p>
<p>The higher level secondary industrial, trade, or technical colleges and specified colleges are very popular. They offer programs in fashion, artistic or product design, product management and presentation, tourism, and commerce, and for occupations in the food and beverage industries, agriculture, and forestry. They start at Grade 9 and last 5 years, graduating with matriculation.</p>
<p>On the tertiary level, there are specialized postmatriculation courses, higher technical colleges, and postsecondary colleges in addition to regular universities. All these tertiary educational institutions demand specific matriculation standards as a requirement for access. Several additional possibilities to achieve this qualification are provided outside of the regular school system, especially implemented for persons with previous vocational experience.</p>
<p>In Austria, studies at the tertiary level are mainly free of enrollment fees, and also free of entrance exams. Students with excellent examination results can apply for special grants and scholarships from the federal government, which do not have to be paid back after they have finished their studies.</p>
<p>Assessing the educational opportunities in Austria with regard to the promotion and the development of special abilities and talents, it can be said that the structure of the educational system offers the organization of very individualized careers, especially for students coming from underprivileged and unsupportive family backgrounds. Highly gifted persons have additional special needs for the development of their gifts and talents. These needs are supported by several specific acts and regulations concerning curriculum, admission to higher education, obligations of school education, and the like, and also by their manifestation in teacher education and teacher training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353213494502">
<title>The Legal Base of Talent Promotion and Concept of Giftedness</title>
<p>In keeping with the wide variety and diversity of excellent performance domains described in the introduction to this article, the official assistance toward the promotion of talents, high ability, and giftedness is similarly expansive. In general, the law of school organization (SchOG §2; established in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213494502">1962</xref>) dictates that education in school be organized according to the interests, needs, talents, and abilities of a pupil or student. Based on this law, the teacher is given the right and the responsibility to choose the didactic approach and the teaching method he or she considers to be the most viable for reaching this objective.</p>
<p>In 1974, skipping a grade in the secondary school was made possible for the first time. Since then, several further regulations have widened this opportunity to all school grades, especially the law of school education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213494502">SchUG §26, 2006</xref>). In 1988, the amendment of SchOG §6 implemented the organization of special programs to be run in addition to the regular curriculum. Each school was given consent to run voluntary courses explicitly for special interest and ability groups. Another regulation allowed absence from regular school lessons “because of special reasons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213494502">SchUG §45, 1998</xref>). This regulation was interpreted also with respect to the special educational needs and interests of highly gifted students provided for outside the regular school programs. Corresponding to this regulation, the law for universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213494502">UG§70, 2002</xref>) allows early access to regular studies while a student is still attending the upper level of secondary schools and before he or she has finished matriculation examination. Students can use this opportunity to enroll in courses as visiting students at any university in Austria according to their interests. They can also complete these courses with the normal exams and if they continue their studies after matriculation, these exam results are accepted toward regular study requirements.</p>
<p>In 2005, a special edict concerning developmental support was given to schools. This paper interprets developmental support, not only with respect to deficits in knowledge or development but also bringing into focus the need to support highly gifted students, whether they are underachievers or they show above-average potential of performance. Since then, schools have had the opportunity to provide additional courses for the promotion of very specific high abilities.</p>
<p>In 2007, the BMUKK introduced the initiative <italic>25 Plus</italic> addressing the need for individualization of the daily praxis of school education and to focus on the preconditions of learning for any single student in the class. This order highlights the explicit need for the promotion of highly gifted children.</p>
<p>The current base for educating highly gifted children and students within the regular school system is stated in a paper from the BMUKK, formulating principles for the promotion of exceptional talents and the education of highly gifted persons. This paper is called the “Grundsatzerlass zur Begabtenförderung” ([Decree for the Education of the Gifted]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213494502">BMUKK, 2009</xref>). It presents giftedness as a multidimensional phenomenon based on the notion of the potential of an individual to achieve exceptional performances. This potential is expounded by the interactions of the individual and his or her social background. It also depends on maturation and self-management of the person as well as on the developmental support in their environment, especially involving the family and the school. All supportive initiatives must aim at the development of the personality and should not be restricted to the development of limited skills related to a talent domain. Talent development in schools must incorporate the need to equalize social opportunities, to avert underachievement and to make aware the value of high abilities for society in general. The principles on which the education of gifted children and students must be based are the emphasis on abilities (not on deficits), the handling of stereotypes concerning highly gifted persons (e.g., avoiding the limited focus on high achievement in school exams and in all school subjects, the need for special and individualized developmental support, etc.), the variety of possible promotion programs, development of internal school organization, cooperation with family and initiatives outside of school, teacher education, and teacher training. Furthermore, the paper addresses the importance of a fair and balanced cooperation and communication between all involved groups (child, teacher, parents) as well as the potential of established instruments of talent promotion, such as enrichment, acceleration, encouraging feedback on learning outcomes, and instruments of self-organized learning.</p>
<p>Summarizing the legislative regulations for the promotion of talents and talent development in Austria, it is obvious that a holistic approach on personality development forms the primary conception of giftedness: The anthropological perspective concentrates on the tenet that a stable self-concept is well grounded in the balanced interplay between best developed abilities and well-handled performance deficits, combined with the consciousness that the individual itself—not only society—is also responsible for the discovery and the flourishing of the given talents and abilities. This concept does not favor elitism, and therefore any selective structure of talent promotion does not exist in Austria. All special measures are primarily integrated into the regular school system. The core pedagogical tenets are differentiation and individualization within the regular school class.</p>
<p>Such challenging educational goals need accompanying measures in teacher education and teacher training. The core challenge for these programs is to manage and master the heterogeneity of ability levels, especially because children with learning deficits, handicaps, and disabilities are also educated inclusively in the regular class. In such cases, an additional teacher with expertise in inclusive education teaches together with the class teacher.</p>
<p>The current law for teacher education, established in 2006, meets this egalitarian understanding of giftedness as well as the fact of diversity concerning special abilities. It highlights the fact that highly gifted and interested students have special needs of support. This law provides a general framework for all programs of preservice as well as in-service teacher training. The fact that the colleges for teacher education have the same status of autonomy as the universities means they are free to organize courses focusing on special educational needs. The analysis of the current curricula in all Austrian university colleges for teacher preservice training shows that topics related to the education of gifted students are still rare and are only marginally addressed in courses for inclusive education. This can be seen as an indicator of a lack of awareness of teachers and society that gifted learners also have special educational needs.</p>

<title>The Most Important Contributions to Gifted Education in Austria During the Past Decades</title>
<p>The last 15 years can be declared as the “golden age” for gifted education in Austria. Although many ideas and suggestions of reformist pedagogy have been realized in legislative regulations and laws, the need for specific initiatives has long been evident. Five events can be noted that have strongly stimulated gifted education in Austria: the foundation of an organization for the promotion of gifted students in Salzburg; the first implementation of a European Council for High Ability (ECHA) teacher training program at the teacher training college of Upper Austria in 1996, followed by the formation of the teacher association ECHA-Austria in 1998; the foundation of the Sir Karl Popper School in Vienna in the same year; and finally, the opening of the <italic>Oester-reichisches Zentrum für Begabtenförderung und Begabungsforschung</italic> ([Austrian Research and Support Centre for the Gifted and Talented]; OEZBF) in 1999. All five events have had the potential to influence public awareness and acceptance of special programs for gifted children. They were implemented by the dedicated initiatives of individuals involving federal governance and linking their initiatives to the regular school system. These milestones are described in detail.</p>
<p>In 1986, the first association for the promotion of gifted and talented students, Protalent, was founded by the local authorities of school education in Salzburg. The first office concerning the needs of gifted education was opened. Its aims were to draw public attention toward the necessity for gifted education and to provide special courses for gifted students in addition to voluntary interest courses in school. This office also organized the first summer camp for gifted students. Since then the so-called PLUS-courses and the Summer Academy have taken place annually.</p>
<p>In 1988, Protalent also organized the first international congress for gifted education in Salzburg in cooperation with the local and the federal ministry of education. These initiatives in Salzburg immediately led to similar groups being created in other federal states of Austria. The first Austrian teachers finished the ECHA diploma course in 1996. Several years previously, the Radboud University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, together with the international association ECHA had developed a special diploma course for teacher in-service training, the so-called ECHA diploma. The teacher training institute of Upper Austria established a close cooperation with ECHA and brought this program to Austria, because the course trainers were aware of the value of this diploma course. The ECHA diploma program includes theories of giftedness, the exploration of practice-models in schools in Austria and abroad, the realization of a project within the personal school setting, a diploma thesis on this project, and a final presentation of the project. Core concepts of giftedness in this program are the Triarchic theory of human intelligence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353213494502">Robert Sternberg (1984)</xref>, the Three-Ring conception of giftedness by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213494502">Joe Renzulli (1986)</xref>, high ability as a triadic model of interdependence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213494502">Franz Mönks (1995)</xref>, and the Schoolwide Enrichment Model by Joe Renzulli and Sally Reis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213494502">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353213494502">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213494502">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Immediately after the first batch of teachers had received their diploma, teacher training institutes in other Austrian federal states implemented this ECHA diploma course in their in-service programs for teachers. Teachers holding the ECHA diploma were asked by the government and by school boards to create similar courses and to become advising experts for decision-making processes regarding matters of giftedness.</p>
<p>Within 2 years, the number of experts in gifted education holding a specific diploma (ECHA or others) increased rapidly in nearly all of the nine federal states of Austria. In 1998, at the request of these experts, the national branch of ECHA, ECHA-Austria, was founded. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Austrian teachers and educators at all levels of formal education have been trained in diverse special programs and now hold a diploma or certificate in gifted education. ECHA-Austria was the first association in Austria acting at the national level. Its aims are to bring together all persons, either experts or those interested in gifted education including teachers, parents, students, officials, researchers, and other key figures to establish a nationwide network for this group, to provide permanent scientific input about the latest research, to promote gifted education as essential for society in general and to draw public attention to the importance of this topic. Since 2000, ECHA-Austria has organized annual national conferences in each of the nine federal states of Austria. These 2-day conferences focus on research on the 1st day and present successful best-practice models on the 2nd day. The structure of these national conferences pursues the aim of bridging the gap between science and praxis by presenting research and studies on newsworthy educational topics and linking them to educational practice. This scientific input aims to challenge the audience regarding the understanding of the enormous variety of needs of gifted children and to stimulate discussions about the innovative potential teachers have to manage the heterogeneity of a class. Another intention is to highlight the initiatives and endeavors in educating the gifted being made by the federal state. The keynotes and the models presented are published on the website of ECHA-Austria. Since 2004, ECHA-Austria has been cooperating with the University of Salzburg’s Department of Education. The joint project is the Platon Youth Forum, an international summer camp for gifted young adolescents. The program is aimed at the development of European citizenship. The challenge given to the participants is to investigate possible solutions for current problems in the EU. ECHA-Austria organizes these camps; the Department of Education evaluates the program.</p>
<p>The fourth milestone was also realized in 1998: the opening of the Sir Karl Popper School in Vienna. This school was founded as a pilot project at the Wiedner Gymnasium at the upper secondary level. Although this school concentrates explicitly on the promotion of gifted and talented students, it does not favor elitism. The principles of this school follow the vision of the philosopher Sir Karl Popper, whose dream was a school where students are inspired to raise and to discuss problems, where they are not forced to answer bland questions and where they do not study for exams but for life and for their own development. In a holistic perspective the individual person and his or her relationship to social groups and society is placed in the center of any didactical and/or educational initiative. The student is seen as an autonomous learner being fully responsible for the learning process and for the learning outcomes. The didactic approach is based on the structure of modules and fosters multidisciplinary communication, applicability of competencies, investigative learning attitudes, and open-mindedness toward practice, science, economy, expertise, and esthetic education. Approved interventions of gifted education (e.g., enrichment, acceleration, and grouping) are implemented, together with democratic participation and special methods of quality assurance. Special efforts are made toward the development of social competence by providing a diverse system of coaching, tutoring, and mentoring: Teachers as well as students take on related tasks and roles. Up to four different foreign languages can be studied. Contracting allows the promotion of individual learning interests; the applied assessment criteria refer to this individualized process. These principles pose a challenge to the teachers. The school is seen as a developing and learning system raising unknown dynamic processes of growth and development. Permanent self-reflection and immediate reaction to the outputs of the dynamics are considered to be the most important and necessary abilities of a teacher at this school. Regular internal and external evaluation supports the process of systemic development at this school. Lifelong learning in the sense of developing personal, professional, and social competencies is considered obligatory for all teachers at the school. From its beginning, the Sir Karl Popper School has greatly contributed to the practice of gifted education in Austria. The school communicated not only their successful innovations and experiences but also the problems, failures, and flops of particular initiatives and they also reported how they solved these problems. Therefore, this school has become a leading model for innovative education in general.</p>
<p>In 1999, the OEZBF was founded as an association in Salzburg. This center is financed by the BMUKK as well as by the BMWF in Austria. Its aims are to promote and support young people’s talent development according to holistic educational approaches as the basic principle for programs of gifted education in Austria. It provides a platform for the exchange of experience between research and practice. On the initiative of the center, each of the nine Austrian states has nominated an appointee to be responsible for governmental initiatives in gifted education in the province. Coordinated by OEZBF, this group of people regularly meets at a round table, and in turn contributes to the establishment of new educational strategies and concepts very successfully. The center also provides support in school quality development and quality assurance; it puts great effort into the dissemination of the latest research results to educators and teachers, with the use of publications, newsletters, handouts, as well as the organization of international conferences. It is also in close contact with international associations and is involved in many multinational networks, projects, and initiatives of talent promotion. Established as a forum for national and international networking among experts, the center aims to contribute to a better public awareness, understanding, and acceptance of the special supportive needs highly gifted students have to reach their full potential. Due to its position, the center also serves as a consultant for both ministries to whom it is responsible. Therefore, the center has a core influence on policy making in talent promotion.</p>
<p>The regional school boards in the nine states of Austria have also established a variety of opportunities for talent promotion, such as regional centers for gifted education offering special courses in pull-out-programs, or special offices and contact points for counseling and testing, in Upper and Lower Austria. Another very successful initiative in Vienna is the seal of quality for schools, providing a supportive environment and program for talent promotion in general.</p>
<p>These five core establishments have made an enormous impact on various initiatives in gifted education. The Eurydice Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213494502">European Commission, 2006</xref>) gives a comparative overview of all measures of talent promotion in Europe. Austria is one of those countries which provide specific measures and opportunities in all categories, including several forms of enrichment and differentiation within the school system (e.g., competitions, Olympiads in math, physics, or chemistry), teacher training, and challenging courses in addition to school programs, acceleration, and networks. All these measures have become an inherent part of the Austrian school system and also a constituent of the educational opportunities for talent promotion in general. As already mentioned, the main funding for all the programs for gifted learners is provided by the two Federal Ministries, the BMUKK and BMWF. Currently, the concern of educating the gifted is included in the agenda of inclusive education and special educational needs at the BMUKK. A special task force group has been implemented at the BMWF. The implementation of an endowed professorship at one of the Austrian universities is planned to carry out concrete evaluation and investigations concerning the impact of programs and initiatives in gifted education in Austria.</p>
<p>This description of the Austrian initiatives in educating gifted children and students probably gives the impression that gifted education and the special needs of highly able children are well accepted by the Austrian society. However, the many positive steps that have been made do not disguise the fact that there is still reservation and even resentment toward providing special investments in gifted education as is described in the introduction of this article.</p>

<sec id="section7-0162353213494502">
<title>Practice in the Promotion of Talent Development and Education of Gifted and Talented Learners in Schools and Other Contexts</title>
<p>The character and the structure of the Austrian school system as well as the legal base and the core principles for education of gifted and talented learners take two factors of heterogeneity of groups into account: (a) the diversity of minds and (b) the disparities in the level and dynamics of personal development. The first factor is rooted in a diagnosis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353213494502">Johann-Friedrich Herbart (1808)</xref> concerning factors of a successful school education. He claimed that didactic approaches must take into account the heterogeneity of a school class as an image of the heterogeneity of a society. Herbart recommended the provision of lessons for individual learning. His didactic recommendations became one of the core tenets for teacher education in Austria. The second factor refers to findings of developmental psychology—that excellent and outstanding performances do not necessarily evolve in a permanent progression from child genius to adult genius (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213494502">Winner, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The Schoolwide Enrichment Model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213494502">Renzulli and Reis (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353213494502">1994)</xref> gave a practical model to create an atmosphere for inclusive pedagogical approaches and programs; this atmosphere was labeled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213494502">Friedrich Oswald (2002)</xref> as <italic>begabungsfreundliche Lernkultur</italic> [an atmosphere for learning and development especially suited to nurturing talents and abilities]. Teachers in ECHA diploma courses have created a huge variety of projects and programs attuned to the special needs and interests of their bright pupils and students, which take into account the local resources of their schools. The best projects and programs are presented in conferences and in publications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213494502">Weyringer, Oswald, &amp; Pinz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213494502">Weyringer, Oswald, &amp; Seyr, 2009</xref>) sharing ideas with other teachers encouraging talent promotion and education for the gifted.</p>
<p>In most of the nine Austrian states, pull-out-programs and summer academies for gifted learners are organized regularly by school authorities. If a child or a learner wants to participate in such a program or academy, he or she is required to pass a selection procedure. The impetus for nomination and acceptance vary for each program. Most common is the nomination by a teacher or self-nomination with evidence of above-average school performance or high scores in psychometric tests. These programs and the selection procedures are also used to identify underachievers as well as overachievers.</p>
<p>The local school authorities also organize annual competitions and Olympiads in sciences and foreign languages. In other contexts outside of school, talent promotion is either specific to a particular domain, such as sports or music (related programs are mainly organized by clubs and associations), or is organized through competitions or awards. Appropriate projects are mainly organized by guilds, clubs, and by societies of economy and industry. These programs and projects are not explicitly labeled as education for the gifted learner, but they provide a strong impetus to trigger talent development. The funding for these projects and programs are given either by the organizing club, by private companies, or by the government.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0162353213494502">
<title>Most Difficult Issues for the Promotion of Programs and Services for Gifted Learners</title>
<p>One of the most persistent obstacles to the promotion of special programs and services for gifted and talented learners is people’s beliefs about gifted individuals, their needs for support, and their understanding of talent development. Since the emergence of the topic “special needs of gifted learners,” public opinion has been polarized. Three opposing positions can be identified:</p>
<list id="list1-0162353213494502" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Gifted and talented learners do not need special supportive measures, because in any case their high intellectual potential will enable them to achieve excellent and above-average performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With respect to children with handicaps, low intellectual potential, and disabilities, it is not justified to establish special programs for gifted learners because these initiatives increase the inequality of opportunity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Children with excellent intellectual potential and exceptional abilities should be provided with separate developmental opportunities because only the intellectual elite can assure the future welfare of a nation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Convincing arguments and examples can be found for any of these points and decision makers and key figures in politics, the economy and society try hard to find a compromise. The currently applied principles represent an attempt to find a compromise between these three positions.</p>
<p>As the main funding is provided by the government, politicians are particularly challenged by this dispute. Associations of economy and industry are primarily interested in the development of special abilities and talents; the holistic approach of personal development seems to be less efficient and effective in these concerns. Other private organizations providing funding in other countries (e.g., “trusts”) do not exist in Austria. So additional funding for the programs and courses for gifted learners relies very often on personal networks and relationships.</p>
<p>Scientific research might facilitate the decision making of the stakeholders, but specific calls, applications, or grants dealing with related topics are very rare in Austria. Also evaluations of established programs meeting scientific standards are not available. At the university level, there is no department dealing with issues of talent promotion and the special needs of gifted learners. Even in the influential national and international scientific associations (e.g., European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction [EARLI] or Austrian Association for Research and Development [OEFEB]), talent promotion and gifted education are not represented.</p>
<p>These weaknesses can be assumed to have a negative impact on the existing structure and measures of talent promotion in Austria. First indications can be identified: The teachers’ interest in gifted education (i.e., participation in conferences and in training programs) is decreasing; special programs for gifted learners are beginning to be cancelled; applications for scientific studies are rejected, and so forth. The public dispute concerning gifted education, the limitations of public funding and the lack of wider representation in the scientific community are the most difficult issues that need to be addressed to continue to provide appropriate programs and services for gifted learners.</p>
<p>Another difficult issue is the involvement of children who are immigrants to Austria. Cultural aspects and family traditions as well as language skills, attitudes toward education and social integration, and furthermore, preferred gender role models have an important influence on the nomination and on the decision as to whether a child should participate in a special program for gifted and talented learners.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, management of the heterogeneity in a classroom is the most crucial factor for the success of education in general. Therefore, the curricula of teacher education and also the programs for teacher training concentrate on mastering this challenge. The overall objective is the realization of inclusive pedagogy; this means the inclusion of average learning abilities, disabilities, handicaps, and special above-average abilities. The problem is to communicate that children with special above-average abilities need specific didactic approaches for their learning and their personal development equivalent to those of children with handicaps and disabilities. Another problem is to communicate that a child can have above-average abilities as well as disabilities and handicaps in another learning domain. All these problems and difficulties provide the pool for further discussions on improvement and development of educating the gifted and talented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0162353213494502">
<title>Future Directions for Research and Program Development</title>
<p>Austria has established and implemented a variety of measures regarding talent promotion and gifted education. At present, it seems that a certain level of saturation has been reached concerning the acceptance and public awareness of related governmental initiatives. This situation is very challenging for the provision of sustainable and reliable established programs and structures for learning opportunities in the existing educational system. Aiming to guarantee continuance, it is necessary to increase ways of raising awareness of the needs of gifted children to improve public opinion and not in a polemic and lopsided manner but as a fact-based discussion involving a range of diverse arguments. The principle should be “as well as,” not “either–or.”</p>
<p>Enormous efforts should be put into research to be carried out by independent scientists, who are not forced to bring results “on demand.” Gifted education as a separate scientific discipline has to be introduced to the scientific community in general, to improve funding from organizations involved in the establishment of research programs. Priority in research must be put on the evaluation of existing programs and measures.</p>
<p>Another issue is the development of instruments and tools for a dynamic identification procedure, which takes the process of personal development into account. These instruments should be practical for teachers in their daily work.</p>
<p>Finally, one target essential for the future of talent promotion and the education of gifted learners must be singled out: the EU and its enormous investment in scientific development. The current research framework program (from 2007 to 2013) has funds of 53.2 billion Euros. The budget for the next program (2014-2020) would be 87 billion Euros. Although this investment is aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the EU, basic research on the preconditions of this aim is neglected, and social science and humanities are downgraded. Research in educating gifted and talented children and students is one of many other very important scientific disciplines to provide knowledge on these preconditions. But if we analyze all recent EU research programs, none can be found addressing gifted-related topics. There is no awareness of the necessity of related scientific investigations and no understanding concerning the dependence of excellent performance in any ability domain from basic education and early talent promotion. Therefore, an international promotion campaign needs to commence to allow international program designers to realize the benefits gifted education has on the future welfare of societies and nations.</p>
