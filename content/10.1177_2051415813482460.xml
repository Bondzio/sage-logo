<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A systematic review of the literature has shown that stone prevalence and incidence rates are increasing across the globe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813482460">1</xref></sup> In the United States (US), stone prevalence has increased from 2.6% in the late 1960s to 3.8% in the late 1970s, to 5.4% in 1982.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813482460">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813482460"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813482460">4</xref></sup> This was followed by a period of stabilisation, with 5.2% being reported for 1988–1994. Other countries with documented increases in prevalence include Italy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813482460">5</xref></sup> Spain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813482460">6</xref></sup> Germany<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813482460">7</xref></sup> and Scotland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813482460">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813482460">9</xref></sup> In the Milan region, the prevalence as obtained from population surveys was shown to increase from 6.8% to 10.1% and from 4.9% to 5.8% from 1986 to 1998 in males and females, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813482460">5</xref></sup> Generally, the methodologies utilised in procuring prevalence data vary between studies, even in the same country, and therefore make it difficult to interpret the real prevalence of urolithiasis in each population.</p>
<p>Incidence also has been shown to increase over the years. In Germany the incidence of urolithiasis has increased from 120 to 720 per 100,000 from 1979 to 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813482460">7</xref></sup> The incidence in Japan has shown a step-wise increase from 1965 to 1995 of 54.2 to 68.9 per 100,000, and the incidence in 2005 reached 114.3 per 100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813482460">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United Kingdom (UK), the incidence of stones was assessed by examining case registers and hospital activity charts to report an annual rate of 28/100,000 in the year 1980. There was however, a wide variation and towns such as Canterbury had rates of 56/100,000 compared to Burton-on-Trent, which had 15/100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813482460">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database, Turney et al. have shown that the annual incidence in England has increased from 102/100 000 to 166/100 000 from 2000 to 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813482460">12</xref></sup> These data include only hospital-based episodes and exclude stones managed by physicians in the community. The mean age of stone formers attending hospital remained 49 years. The study also revealed that ureteroscopy accounted for 9.7% and 9.9% of the management of stones, whereas shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) increased by 55% over the 10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2051415813482460" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We aimed to assess whether this reported increase in the prevalence of urolithiasis as indicated by the UK HES data was true in our region. In Rotherham District General Hospital (RDGH), all patients with a stone in the urinary tract who were either referred by the primary-care physician, other specialists or admitted as emergencies are added to a prospective stone database. A proforma is completed for each patient by a urology consultant or registrar. All patients with a proven stone had their demographic and clinical details included on the database. Recurrent stones were recorded only once on the database at the time of first presentation, since the inception of the database. We obtained local population estimates from the Office of National Statistics to standardise the data. Comparisons were made between data for the years 2002, 2006 and 2011. Statistical calculations were performed using a two-sample <italic>z</italic> test for proportions comparing the proportional changes of stone incidence relative to population changes over the 10 years of study.</p>
<p>Stone composition was assessed in the laboratory using infrared spectrometry. The major stone component was recorded and changes in stone composition were assessed statistically using Fisher’s exact test. The proportion of patients undergoing surgery including ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) were recorded. Differences in the proportion of patients undergoing PCNL and ureteroscopy were assessed over the years using a two-sample <italic>z</italic> test for proportions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Urinary stone disease, presenting to secondary care, increased by 26% compared to a 2% increase in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051415813482460">Figure 1</xref>). In 2002, 103 patients were seen in the department; this increased to 117 and up to 130 in 2006 and 2011, respectively. The proportional increases are statistically significant at five and 10 years (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 two-sample <italic>z</italic> test for proportions). The average age of presentation was 52 years, and this did not change significantly over the 10 years of study. Although the majority of calculi were in men, the increase was equivalent in both genders over the 10 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2051415813482460">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The location of stones at identification has not changed significantly in the last 10 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415813482460">Figure 3</xref>). The most common location remained the kidney followed by the lower ureter. The use of intravenous urography (IVU) as the definitive investigation has decreased from 94% to 0%, and non-contrast computed tomography (CT) has increased from 2% to 99.5%.</p>

</fig>
<p>When looking at stone composition we noted only a small change. In total 36 (35%) patients had stone analysis in 2002, 51 (43%) in 2006 and 50 (38%) in 2011. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2051415813482460">Figure 4</xref> shows the major stone component of every calculus sent for analysis. In the last five years, calcium phosphate stones have increased by 10%. This is deemed statistically non-significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.38, Fisher’s exact test). Calcium oxalate calculi also decreased correspondingly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08).</p>

</fig>
<p>The proportion of patients undergoing surgical intervention remained constant over the years at 50%. This therefore translates to a 26% increase in operations for stone disease. In 2002, 31 ureteroscopies were performed (65%) compared to 17 PCNLs (35%). As a proportion ureteroscopy did not change significantly, 69% in 2006 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6), and 62% in 2011 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8); two-sample <italic>z</italic> test for proportions. Out of the whole population, 31% of patients underwent ureteroscopy and 17% had PCNL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have presented real-life data showing an increase in presentation of urinary calculi to a district general hospital in the UK over the last 10 years. The increase we have reported (26%) is lower than that reported by Turney et al. (63%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813482460">12</xref></sup> but our finding is still statistically significant compared to population changes for both the last five and 10 years. This difference may be related to geography as Turney and colleagues reported national data compared to our local data. However, it is more likely that the differences are due to differing methodology. In addition other confounders may be present such as differences in levels of obesity, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and age of patients in our region compared to nationally.</p>
<p>We would expect our database to have increased accuracy over HES data as the latter rely on correct reporting and coding of every hospital attendance, and this is not always performed by medically qualified individuals. In addition, the same patient may be coded multiple times in HES databases, increasing estimates further. Despite these limitations, our overall conclusions concur that there is an increase in urinary stone disease presenting to secondary care.</p>
<p>The underlying reasons behind this increase are not yet completely understood. We have shown that this increase is disproportionately and significantly higher than the population increase of 2%, and this is not related to gender or age. The use of CT may be leading to increased incidental diagnosis and subsequent referral. In a study of 5047 asymptomatic individuals who underwent low-dose non-contrast CT, 7.8% were reported to have at least one calculus. Over 10 years only 20.5% of these individuals had a symptomatic episode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813482460">13</xref></sup> Therefore incidental stones may be responsible, in part, for this rise. However, our data and the data by Turney et al. have shown operative intervention is also increasing, and therefore the stones that are seen in secondary care are proportionately not insignificant. The method of stone removal has not changed significantly in our practice despite the availability of a flexible ureteroscope in 2004.</p>
<p>Other reasons for the increase in stone presentation have been proposed to be related to obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813482460">14</xref></sup> and female gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415813482460">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051415813482460">16</xref></sup> The latest data, from the US, show an increase in prevalence of stones in overweight females along with greater health care resource utilisation for stone treatment in this select population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813482460">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415813482460">15</xref></sup> We did not see an increase in the proportion of women attending the RDGH urology unit over the last 10 years. However, obesity is an accruing problem in the population and the UK is only just catching up with the US; therefore further study will be required over the coming years to establish whether UK trends go in the same direction. Moreover, it has been shown that body weight correlates with urinary calcium excretion and therefore further study regarding obesity’s predisposition to stone disease is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051415813482460">17</xref></sup> The change in obesity prevalence over the 10 years for our region has increased from 20.8% to 26% (Health survey of England, noo.org.uk). This is compared to a national increase from 20.7% to 24.5%. It is now standard practice for all patients attending the outpatient clinic and the urology ward to have their weight and body mass index (BMI) calculated, and this will be an important outcome to report after another five years.</p>
<p>Stone composition did not change significantly over the last 10 years. A non-significant decrease in calcium oxalate stones was noted in the last five years with a corresponding increase in calcium phosphate stones. A report from Germany of 224,085 stone analyses from multiple centres reported a 5% increase in calcium-containing stones and a 4% decrease in uric acid stones from 1997 to 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051415813482460">18</xref></sup> Because of the large number of analyses, this was deemed significant. The authors included all components in the stone greater than 20%, whereas we reported the majority stone component. The authors also reported a great variation in stone composition rates between different regions in Germany.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are that it is not an epidemiological study, and therefore the true change in incidence of stone disease in the population over the last 10 years cannot be reported. We have, however, shown the incidence of stone disease presenting to secondary care, and by having a prospective database containing all stone episodes, our data can be considered to be more accurate than retrospective reports. Finally, stone composition was obtained only from patients who either underwent intervention or presented their stone for analysis (40% of patients); however, this is a limitation common amongst all studies presenting stone composition data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051415813482460" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study adds to the growing evidence that urinary stone disease presenting to the urologist is on the increase. Consequently, the demand for stone procedures has also increased. The mean age at presentation and patient gender have not changed significantly in our region within the last 10 years. Similarly stone composition has remained stable over the last 10 years. This information should allow for better planning of urological services to deal with this increase and should also stimulate research into the underlying reasons behind this reported increase.</p>
