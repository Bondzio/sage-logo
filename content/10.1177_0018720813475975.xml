<p>In 2010, the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society instituted the <italic>Human Factors</italic> Prize, which recognizes excellence in human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) research through an annual competition in which authors are invited to submit papers on a specific topic for that year. The topic is selected by the editor in chief in consultation with a board of referees chaired by past <italic>Human Factors</italic> editor Nancy J. Cooke. The prize carries a $10,000 cash award and publication of the winning paper in the society’s flagship journal, <italic>Human Factors.</italic></p>
<p>This special section contains the winning article and three other finalists that were selected for the 2012 <italic>Human Factors</italic> Prize on the HF/E science behind product design.</p>
