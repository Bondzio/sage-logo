<bold>Charles S. Koeber</bold>, PhD, in a previous Humanity &amp; Society (H&amp;S) article (2010) described and explored the growing importance of consumer participation in the labor process of service work. He proposed the concept, “consumptive labor,” which refers to the arrangement in which business organizations deploy consumers as quasi-workers to perform a variety of necessary tasks. His interest in this less-apparent but nonetheless important aspect of the contemporary labor process originated from his research on corporate restructuring, “downsizing,” and “outsourcing,” and the resultant problems of job loss and unemployment. He has published several articles on job loss and participated in assisting laid off workers in Wichita, Kansas. As discussed in this article, he is not only concerned that consumers are not sufficiently benefitting from self-service but, also, that self-service and other forms of consumptive labor are contributing to job loss and unemployment.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Consumers not only consume. They are increasingly being used by retail and service organizations to perform work-like tasks in the manner of quasi-employees. To explore this role of consumers in the labor process, we use the term consumptive labor and focus on one prevalent form of consumptive labor: self-service. Business organizations obviously benefit from self-service, primarily through increasing the amount of labor during the workday, without incurring additional labor costs. However, it is less apparent why consumers so willingly participate in self-service given that, unlike employees, they are not bound by a contractual agreement or compensated with a wage. What is the perceived benefit of self-service to consumers? We propose a theory of the labor process that synthesizes the works of Michael Burawoy and George Ritzer and suggests that organizations manufacture consent of consumers to self-service by appealing to their desires for a “McDonaldization” of consumer experience. From this theory, we derive and test hypotheses using data from a survey of 519 college students. Results lend support to this theory. The majority of the sample preferred to use self-service when it was available. Moreover, the stronger their belief that self-service enables them to put into practice the principles of McDonaldization, the stronger respondents’ preference to use self-service and the greater their actual use of self-service. We conclude by critically analyzing issues relating to self-service, illuminating problems and issues associated with the essence of the social relations of self-service but which consumers do not easily recognize in its ostensibly favorable appearance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Consumers often perform unpaid work in service settings. For example, one who engages in <italic>self-service</italic>—completing an online banking transaction or using self-checkout to purchase groceries—is not only a consumer but also an unpaid laborer performing tasks that could be or were formerly performed by employees. This article explores the unpaid work of consumers within the labor process of service work. Social scientific studies of work generally suffer from a <italic>productivist bias</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160597611433273">Urry 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597611433273">Edgell, Hetherington, and Warde 1996</xref>). Research tends to focus mainly on activities and relations of the labor force. The literature on consumption has addressed these shortcomings by focusing on the role of consumers in workplaces. However, it tends to view consumers as those who select, purchase, receive, and use up goods and services, rather than as consumer-laborers who perform tasks to help provide or distribute the goods and services that they themselves purchase. Evidence suggests that to more fully understand the nature of the contemporary labor process, we must also explore this third area, in which consumers act in the manner of employees, performing work-like tasks. It is becoming more common for organizations to share the opinion of the <italic>Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly</italic>, which explains to its readers that guests (consumers) can be managers/supervisors, quality inspectors, consultants, marketers, and also creators of their own experience or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597611433273">Ford and Heaton 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In a previous article, Koeber (2011:206-7) introduced the term, <italic>consumptive labor</italic>, which includes the following types of tasks performed by consumers: (1) selecting, producing, purchasing, or dispersing goods and services (consumer as quasi-employee); (2) monitoring, policing, and evaluating workers before, during, and after transactions (consumer as quasi-supervisor); and (3) marketing or advertising brand names, products, or services (consumers as quasi-marketers and advertisers). While consumptive labor is always accompanied by the process of consumption, it is simultaneously a productive activity performed by consumers, which is distinguishable from the act of consumption. An essential characteristic of consumption is that it uses up or devours something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597611433273">Edwards 2000</xref>:10). However, consumptive labor engages consumers in the opposite activity—as <italic>participants</italic> in the labor process who contribute directly or indirectly to the production of goods or services. For example, eating food from a grocery store is a form of consumption. However, the consumer must first select and retrieve the groceries, pay for them, possibly use a self-checkout station, load the groceries, transport them to one’s vehicle, unload them, and return the cart to a specified location. Here, the would-be consumer first completes several tasks, all of which are a necessary part of the labor process of grocery retailing.</p>
<p>Historically, consumers have long performed the labor involved in selecting, purchasing, and dispersing of goods or services. For example, it was once the case that consumers experienced a significant change in retail stores in which they, rather than an employee, became required to carry merchandise to the point of sale (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597611433273">Glazer 1993</xref>). Today most consumers have been socialized to think of this practice as a norm. Therefore, it is important to think of self-service and other forms of consumptive labor as an historical process, rather than a sudden event or phenomenon. However, during recent decades, both a qualitative change in the form of consumptive labor as well a significant change in the quantity of use of consumptive labor warrants our attention.</p>
<p>Several political and economic changes have contributed to an acceleration of the process by which consumers are increasingly used in place of employees. Conceptualized within the context of the “new economy,” Koeber (2011:213-18) has discussed these changes extensively. Therefore, we briefly summarize them here. Changes contributing to the increasing use of consumptive labor include an increase in the number of service providing establishments that bring customers into proximity of the labor process. Greater use of advanced electronic information technology and digitization has made possible the technology that is often used to enable consumers to perform self-service. Globalization and the growth of large corporations in the retail and service industries have produced a mass of standardized goods and services that can be distributed and purchased using routinized forms of self-service (e.g., self-checkout stations at Wal-Mart and other retail stores). Finally, within these corporate retail and service settings, employees are often not represented by a union and, as a result, have less control over the organization of work. Henceforth, new forms of self-service have made use of consumptive laborers in a wide variety of self- service/service settings. As a result, new issues of control, exploitation, and resistance, as related to consumptive labor, confront our understanding of consumption, work, and the labor process. This research explores why consumers consent to performing self-service, even when they are not formally employed or monetarily compensated for these activities.</p>

<title>Self-Service in the Labor Process</title>
<p>Consumptive labor can be found in differing types of customer self-service. And the use of information technology is required in many of these activities. Every year more people use their personal computers to complete their holiday shopping online. According to a quarterly report of the U.S. Department of Commerce (King, Kinyon, and Scheleur 2007), during the fourth quarter of 2007, online sales were up 18 percent from a year prior and totaled 36.2 billion dollars, while total sales for 2007 added up to 136.4 billion dollars. Online shopping requires consumers to not only “browse” through merchandise (using their Internet browsers) but to become the cashier and clerk, entering all necessary information for electronic purchase and mail order. While personal computers, apparel and accessories, books, computer peripherals, and software have been some of the most popular online shopping items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160597611433273">Race 2001</xref>), consumers are able to electronically order virtually all forms of goods and services—groceries, prescription medicines, and the limitless varieties of items that can be purchased on E-Bay—which do not require a physical presence in a bricks-and-mortar store.</p>
<p>Self-service checkout systems at grocery and retail stores and self-service check-in systems at large airports and hotels have become more commonplace. A study from IHL Consulting Group indicated that U.S. consumers would spend over $525 billion at self-checkout lanes, and other self-service machines in 2007, an increase approaching $100 billion more than was spent in 2006 (Business Wire 2007). In 1999, only 6 percent of grocery stores used self-checkout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160597611433273">Hayes 2003</xref>). Delta Airlines installed 670 self-service check-in kiosks in all of its domestic terminals in more than 90 cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597611433273">Haddad 2003</xref>) and more recently boasted on its Web site that they have more than 800 kiosks in more than 90 cities (Delta Airlines 2008). Some hotels use a self-service kiosk that enables guests to check themselves in; the kiosk assigns a room according to the preference of the consumer, prints directions to the room, and distributes keys.</p>
<p>In fact, kiosks often serve as the interface for self-service and are occupying an increasingly important role in material culture and consumer life. Juhi Jotwani, an IBM retail stores marketing and strategy director, states that “every time you see a door, there’s an opportunity for a kiosk to be deployed” (Caterinicchia 2007). This statement contains more than a grain of truth when considering the number of kiosks to be installed. In North America, it was estimated that 800,000 customer kiosks, not including ATMs, were to be installed by the end of 2007. By 2009, this number is expected to increase to 1.2 million kiosks (Caterinicchia 2007). In 2007, consumers in North America were expected to spend more than $525 billion at self-checkout lanes, including ticketing kiosks and postal kiosks (Caterinicchia 2007).</p>
<p>There are many other forms of self-service that range from pumping and paying for gas, to self-serving food and beverages, to customer self-service using automated phone systems. In each of the above-described forms of self-service, consumers must operate machinery to perform duties and complete processes previously or concurrently performed by paid employees. Thus, as consumptive laborers, consumers conform to the expectations of organizations and act in the manner of quasi-employees working, albeit without wages, to provide services that they themselves purchase. We wish to learn more about why they willingly do so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160597611433273">
<title>Theory: Manufacturing the Consent of Consumers</title>
<p>An article in the <italic>Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Management Quarterly</italic> states that when business organizations utilize self-service, they must “manage their guest as a quasi-employee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597611433273">Ford and Heaton 2001</xref>). In the article, as the title suggests, the authors describe the different ways that managers can accomplish this objective by exercising control over and/or securing the consent of consumers in ways similar to employees. A fundamental assertion of our theory is that regardless of benefits to consumers, employers intentionally and strategically use self-service for purposes of having consumers add value to the services they receive. In other words, the more consumers perform necessary work, the less that organizations must spend on labor that would be otherwise necessary, thus bolstering their bottom lines.</p>
<p>However, there is a challenge to organizations who wish to use consumers as quasi-employees who perform consumptive labor in self-service settings. Unlike service employees, consumers are not bound to perform work by a formal employment contract. Therefore, to use consumers as quasi-employees, employers must find other ways to exercise control over them. This can be problematic. Within the consumption literature, scholars have argued over the extent to which consumers can be controlled. These debates have been polarized. On one hand, some studies argue that consumers cannot be controlled. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597611433273">Gabriel and Lang (1995</xref>) has described an “unmanageable consumer.” For Lang, it is impossible to capture a single type of consumer. Consumers are not predictable or consistent and often behave in contradictory ways. Therefore, they are unmanageable or uncontrollable (1995:191).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some view the consumer as being subject to a high level of control. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597611433273">Ritzer (2005</xref>:108) has described a <italic>new means of consumption</italic>, which he defines as “the almost dizzying proliferation of settings that allow, encourage and even compel us to consume so many goods and services.” These include franchises, shopping malls, mega-malls, superstores, discounters, home shopping television, cybermalls, theme parks, cruise ships, casino hotels, and entertainment. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597611433273">Ritzer (2005</xref>), the success of modern capitalism relies on the ability of the means of consumption to <italic>exploit </italic>and <italic>control</italic> consumers by enticing them to buy and spend more than they should and by charging them higher than necessary prices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597611433273">Ritzer (2005</xref>) conceptualizes consumption as a form of labor in which consumers are required to exchange with capitalists their consumption time for access to the means of consumption. Advertising manipulates consumers into purchasing more than they need, and credit cards enable them to pay higher than necessary prices and to spend more than they should (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597611433273">Ritzer 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160597611433273">Schor 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast with Lang and in agreement with Ritzer, we argue that the consumer is to a large extent manageable and controllable by organizations. Ritzer’s conceptualization and theoretical approach is useful. However, like other debates over the control of consumers, it is limited to addressing only forms of control that compel people to consume and only exploitation that occurs through prices and purchases. We view self-service as consumptive labor, during which the control of consumers exists not only within the activities that constitute consumption but also production. When self-service is viewed as a productive activity in which consumptive laborers act in the manner of employees, we see that consumers are not only controlled in ways that compel them to increasingly consume, but also, they act as a quasi-employee, performing necessary tasks that add value to the services they receive and being controlled in ways similar to workers.</p>
<p>Like productive labor, many forms of consumptive labor are subject to the control that is embedded in the principles of scientific management as first laid out by Fredrick Winslow Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597611433273">Braverman 1974</xref>). For example, fast food requires consumers to follow a variety of “scripts” in the way that they approach the counter or drive-through window, order food, and exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597611433273">Ritzer 2007</xref>). Online forms and automated voice systems require consumers to enter precise bits of information in a pre-specified manner to successfully complete transactions. Habituated to a Taylorized labor process, the customer is treated as an object of production that is forced to behave in ways desired by management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597611433273">Braverman 1974</xref>). When using self-service with computers or digital kiosks, not unlike workers on an assembly line, the consumer becomes an extension of the machinery, subjected to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597611433273">Edwards (1979</xref>) has described as technical control, a structural form of control in which machinery requires from its operators strict and standardized operating procedures. Should the consumer deviate from these procedures, they will not be permitted to complete their transaction.</p>
<p>However, consumers are not forced to use self-service in all settings. They often can and do exercise choice when deciding whether to use self-service or receive that same service from an employee. For example, most stores that have available self-checkout stations also have employee-staffed checkout stations. Airports usually have at least one person that can serve those that will not or cannot use the self-check-in stations. One does not have to shop or bank online, as she or he can choose to visit the bricks-and-mortar location.</p>
<p>Here, it is important to point out the importance of subjectivity in the performance of consumptive labor and to distinguish between the concepts of <italic>control </italic>and <italic>consent </italic>in the labor process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597611433273">Burawoy (1979</xref>) has argued that workers are not merely passive objects but active subjects who must consent on some level to the conditions of their exploitation. In an ethnographic account of a Chicago machine shop, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597611433273">Burawoy (1979</xref>) sought to determine why, given conditions of overwork and underpay, workers continued to labor rigorously, conforming to the demands of management. He found that far from being highly controlled by a Taylorized work environment, workers engaged in game playing. Through the playing of shop floor games that often deviated from the standard set of procedures put forth by management, workers felt as though they had gained an upper hand over management (which Burawoy termed “making out”). However, in observing and allowing these games, the management of the machine shop profited from the surplus, which was nonetheless produced by workers. Rather than strictly enforcing a set of highly detailed procedures, management “manufactured the consent” of employees to their work. Subsequent studies of the labor process have highlighted the importance of consent in a variety of workplace settings (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597611433273">Chun 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160597611433273">O’Rian 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we pose a similar question to that posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597611433273">Burawoy (1979</xref>) but with regard to consumptive labor: Why do consumers willingly perform various types of labor for organizations that neither formally employ nor pay them? A satisfactory answer must include an understanding of the manner in which consumers not only are controlled by management but also consent to performing consumptive labor.</p>
<p>We argue that organizations elicit this consent by both propagating and capitalizing upon an <italic>ideology of improved service</italic>. This is accomplished by appealing to consumers’ desires for benefits associated with faster speed and increased convenience. It is important to point out that the very concept of “self-service,” while acknowledging the active role of the consumer in the provision of the service simultaneously obfuscates it; the concept of self-service leads the consumer to believe that they benefit by serving themselves, while masking the benefits to business organizations.</p>
<p>However, managers know that they must make additional efforts to make self-service appealing. For instance, the <italic>Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly</italic> reveals that guests need to be shown that the tasks will benefit them personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597611433273">Ford and Heaton 2001</xref>). In turn, consumers become convinced that performing consumptive labor will improve the quality and speed of their service experience. Commenting on touch-screen ordering, which is now used at some fast-food establishments, a company spokesperson explains that customers like the speed with which orders are placed and the ability to customize meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160597611433273">Sheridan 2003</xref>:96). With regard to self-service credit card scanners, now the norm at checkout lanes in most retail stores, the same spokesperson states that whereas it used to take cashiers up to six minutes to authorize credit cards, “now, guests swipe the card and get an OK within seconds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160597611433273">Sheridan 2003</xref>). A spokesperson for the American fast-food restaurant chain Carl’s Jr. explains that “self-service (soft drink dispensers) also improves the customer’s perception of wait-time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160597611433273">Townsend 1990</xref>). A spokesperson for Burger King further explains the reasoning behind the use of self-service soft drink dispensers, “The main factor behind the self-serve system was ice. …. We heard complaints of employees giving either too much or too little ice in the beverages. Our research showed 80% of our customers would be happy to pour their own drinks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160597611433273">Townsend 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The consent elicited by the ideology of speed and convenience, in the language of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597611433273">Burawoy (1979</xref>), can be thought of as akin to the <italic>hegemonic regime</italic> that exists between employees and managers in modern workplaces. As with hegemonic regimes, where it is impossible for organizations to exercise total control over employed labor, it is also the case that they cannot control consumptive labor in its entirety, they must also operate on an ideological terrain in which consent prevails. Ritzer’s (2008) well-known description of McDonaldization—with its principles of efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control, often through nonhuman technologies—is a concept that is useful in summarizing the appearance of the prevailing hegemony under which consumptive laborers consent to performing unpaid labor. We theorize that consumers believe that they can increase the speed of their consumption, thus saving them time and increasing efficiency by using self-service. They need not walk into a store to pay for gas, or even visit a store to purchase items online. Moreover, they believe that they exercise control, more so with self-service machinery than with employees, some of whom they believe to be slow or incompetent or may present to customers other forms of unfavorable interactions. These consumers may also be of the opinion that they think that self-service machinery is more predictable than human beings. They may be more comfortable manipulating (calculating) data that they receive as they use self-service than they are communicating with employees. For example, consumers shopping online may visit Web sites of different stores to compare prices rather than calling or visiting the bricks-and-mortar locations to speak with salespersons. We assert that self-service captures the principles of McDonaldization in a very real way, albeit not in the realm of production or consumption exclusively but in the realm of consumptive labor within the labor process, where consumers perform work. Like Burawoy’s machine shop workers, who believed that through game playing they could maximize self-benefit, consumers believe that they can benefit by using self-service to McDonaldize their consumption.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it is important to point out that while Burawoy’s (1979) theory of manufacturing consent is influenced by theories of Karl Marx and Antonio Gramschi. Ritzer’s (2008) concept of McDonaldization (and McDonaldism) stems from a neo-Weberian theoretical perspective in which McDonaldization is conceptualized as the historical outcome of an ongoing process of rationalization. Therefore, we tend to agree with Ritzer in terms of the cultural appearance of McDonaldization but side with Burawoy’s theory of the labor process, in that the appearance of McDonaldization is not merely an outcome of rationalization but a set of ideas existing in a hegemonic culture that serves to legitimize and reproduce social relations within the labor process. From this perspective, McDonaldization is not a product of ever more rational forms or social organization but rather a description of the appearance of the culture of capitalism in its latest stage. This cultural appearance influences people’s ideas, preferences, and ultimately behavior regarding whether or not they use self-service.</p>
<p>From this theory, we test the following model below, which suggests that the preferences for and use of self-service are influenced by the perception of its ability to create a “McDonaldized” consumer experience. Preferences, partly conditioned by beliefs about McDonaldization also influence use. We construct three interrelated hypotheses about the way in which consumers consent to performing self-service. These hypotheses are used to test our theoretical model, which is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0160597611433273">Figure 1</xref>:</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We wished to test the theory that consumers consent to performing consumptive labor within a hegemonic regime, the appearance of which is characterized by principles of McDonaldization. A six-section survey was developed and administered in the spring of 2006 to 519 students taking sociology courses at a medium-sized university located in the U.S. Midwest. The sociology courses were typically large (more than 100 students) and fulfilled general education electives. College students are a suitable population for this research. They constitute part of the first generation to be raised from birth through adulthood in a digital world, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160597611433273">Tapscott (1998</xref>) and others have referred to as the “Net generation.” They have been socialized to use new information technology. Much of self-service depends on familiarity with a computer. Additionally, many college students were socialized in middle-class, relatively affluent households, whose consumer behaviors likely expose them to service and retail settings where self-service is used.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to state an important caveat: This sample is not representative of all people, as significant proportions of the population in the United States and elsewhere have not been socialized to use information technology and do not have the means to consume in many of the settings where self-service is available. There may exist other important differences that affect the extent to which other segments of the populations can and do use self-service. However, since our primary concern in this study is to explore why people do, rather than do not, use self-service, a sample of college students is suitable for this limited purpose. College students do tend to be situated in a social location in which they can make decisions about whether or not to consume using self-service.</p>
<p>The survey contained six sections, only four of which were used in this research. Section A contained demographic questions. Section B inquired about the frequency of use of self-service in a variety of settings. Section C contained questions about preferences to use self-service in a variety of settings in which it is available. Section D contained items that measured the extent to which respondents felt that self-service, as opposed to service from employees, resulted in a McDonaldized experience. This included questions about self-service regarding its ability to increase efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control through nonhuman forms of technology (i.e., Ritzer’s principles of McDonaldization).</p>
<p>The sample consisted of students who were roughly evenly distributed in their year of school. Prior to college, most had attended public high school. Nearly two-thirds of the sample was comprised of women. Most respondents were white. Most were single with no children. The average age of the sample was 22.5 years old (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160597611433273">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To test our hypotheses, we constructed three indexes. The first, the independent variable, was derived from Ritzer’s principles of McDonaldization: efficiency, predictability, control through nonhuman means, and calculability. The index was tested for reliability and yielded a Cronbach’s α reliability of .814. The following response items, measured on a scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), were used to construct the survey:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Self-service allows me to make more efficient use of my time.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The service I receive from self-service machines is more predictable than the service I receive from employees.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Self-service allows me to have greater control of my service transaction than I would have when served by an employee.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Self-service machines do a more effective job than employees.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Self-service machines calculate information more effectively than employees.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The dependent variables were measured with one additional scale and index. A scale was constructed from a series of ten questions in survey section C, which measured the <italic>frequency of use </italic>of self-service. The Cronbach’s α reliability measure was .775. An index using 20 response items, which measured the preference for self-service in a variety of consumption settings, was constructed from items in section D (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160597611433273">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160597611433273">3</xref> for a list of response items in sections C and D).

<p>Using the “index of self-service and McDonaldization” as the independent variable, along with other control variables, multiple regressions were performed. To test the first hypothesis—the stronger the belief that self-service enables a McDonaldized experience, the greater the preference for self-service—we used the preference for self-service index as the dependent variable. To test the second hypothesis—the greater the preference to use self-service, the greater the use of self-service—we used the frequency of self-service index as the dependent variable. The third hypothesis, the stronger the belief that self-service enables an experience characterized by McDonaldization principles, the greater the use of self-service, was tested using the index of self-service and McDonaldization as the independent variables and the frequency of self-service index as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>With regard to the second hypothesis and the direction of the relationship, we acknowledge that preference to use and actual use of self-service are potentially interrelated. The use of self-service both potentially influences and is influenced by consumers’ preferences to use self-service. Therefore, one might question why we examined only the effects of preference for self-service on the frequency of use of self-service and not the reverse. Our logic in constructing the model in this manner is related to the conceptual and theoretical differences between control and consent which were previously discussed. We assert that prior to consumption and/or within many sites of consumption, consumers can often choose whether to use self-service or receive service from an employee. We hypothesized that people with relatively stronger preferences to use self-service would actively seek out settings where they can use self-service, while those with weaker preferences would not. If these preferences were shaped by desires for a McDonadized consumer experience, then preferences become an important part of the process by which consumers consent to performing self-service. On the other hand, if it was to turn out that the sample tended <italic>not</italic> to prefer self-service, but in actuality did so frequently, this would indicate that the structural organization (rather than the cultural ideology) of consumption required the use of self-service. For example, most of us have no choice but to pump our own gas regardless of whether we might prefer to use a full-service gas station. In most places full-service stations no longer exists and are not options for consumers, in which cases their preferences for or against use of self-service for pumping gas are irrelevant. In these situations, employers exercise what Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597611433273">Edwards (1979</xref>) described as being a structural form of control over consumers, as opposed to eliciting their consent to choose from two or more options. Thus, it was important to find out how preferences were shaped by desires for a McDonaldized experience and how these preferences would affect the actual use of self-service. We did not pursue a model that attempts to explain all (or even most) potential causal relationships of self-services; we sought to explore and test our theoretical propositions and the associated directional relationships. Therefore, with regard to this specific theoretical question and more generally, future research is certainly needed to further explore these and other sociological causes and relationships with regard to employers’ uses of consumers in self-service settings.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160597611433273">Table 2</xref> lists the frequency of use for a wide variety of self-service settings. The most frequently used types of self-service included self-pay with credit card, self-checkout at grocery stores, self-pay at gas pumps, and withdrawals of money at ATMs. Other frequently used forms of self-service included using the Internet to bank, access accounts, and shop. Of all 20 indicators, the mean was 2.55 percent, indicating that research participants used several of these forms of self-service often.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160597611433273">Table 3</xref> lists a number of services in which the respondents were asked to indicate their preference for either self-service or service from an employee in settings where both are typically available options. Results indicate that more often than not, they preferred to use self-service for the following: paying bills, accessing accounts, shopping, paying for items, purchasing gas, and withdrawing money from an account. Alternatively, they preferred employee assistance for opening new accounts, personal banking, checking in at an airport, and eating at a restaurant.</p>
<p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0160597611433273">Table 4</xref> indicate the extent to which participants felt that self-service resulted in a McDonaldized experience. It is worth noting that on a scale of 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), the mean was 3.25, indicating that the sample tended to agree that self-service contributes to a McDonaldized experience. The items, from strongest to weakest level of agreement, were as follows: efficiency, control, predictability, calculability, and use of nonhuman means.</p>

<p>Summarily, these results lend support to all three hypotheses derived from our theory that consumers consent to performing self-service because they believe it enables a McDonaldized form of consumption, which, when compared to service from employees, is more efficient, predictable, calculable, and controlled. The greater the belief among respondents that self-service resulted in a McDonaldized experience, the greater the preference for and use of self-service.</p>

<title>“Working Longer, Living Less”: A Critical Analysis of Self-Service in the Labor Process</title>
<p>We have argued that economic changes have brought a newly conceptualized form of labor to the forefront: consumptive labor. Although we must be careful not to overgeneralize from a sample of college students, our results suggest that many (certainly not all) people prefer a McDonalized form of self-service and do consent to participating in a specific form of consumptive labor—self-service—in the manner of a quasi-employee because they believe that in doing so they are rewarded by a self-beneficial McDonaldized form of consumption.</p>
<p>From a management perspective, the findings of this research could be seen as intuitive. As the new service management school has argued, self-service results in a triple-win situation: businesses become more competitive, consumers realize a higher quality of service, and workers are freed up to perform more important and rewarding tasks in their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160597611433273">Korczynski 2001</xref>). From a management perspective, we could argue that using self-service enables organizations to more effectively put into practice the principles of McDonaldization and provide a superior form of customer service that consumers, quite simply, demand.</p>
<p>However, a labor process perspective is useful for providing a necessary critique of this management perspective. Using the theories of Burawoy and Ritzer, we have argued that business organizations utilize the principles of McDonaldization to manufacture the consent of consumers to performing self-service by presenting to consumers a favorable appearance of self-service. However, we have not yet discussed whether that appearance is accurate or complete. The view that consumers grasp when they perceive the benefits of self-service is carefully angled to create the perception of self-benefit. However, this view also functions like blinders, preventing consumers from seeing not only the benefits of their self-service to business organizations but also the potential disadvantages and costs of using self-service, which they themselves may incur. Like workers in Burawoy’s machine shop, many feel they “make out” well by using self-service, when, in fact, there is a potential cost to performing self-service that is not made obvious to them. When we become aware of this cost, we can better assess whether or not it is outweighed by benefits. We are skeptical and must consider the possibility that what ostensibly looks like a new and improved self-beneficial form of consumption may in actuality constitute part of an economic imperative of people to “work longer, but live less” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0160597611433273">Walsh and Zacharias-Walsh 2007</xref>). Let us now turn to a critical analysis of the labor process in which we examine social relations of production and consumption to more fully identify and weigh the benefits and costs of self-service.</p>
<p>First, as stated previously, in their self-service capacity, consumers complete important and necessary work-like tasks, often the same tasks as those performed concurrently by employees. Yet, unlike employees, these consumers do not receive monetary compensation. This issue tends to be completely ignored or sufficiently obfuscated with regard to self-service, even though there is sufficient cause for objection. After all, when employees perform labor without receiving a wage, it is often met with accusations of slave labor. A second cause for concern, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160597611433273">Koeber (2010</xref>) has previously discussed at length, is when consumers perform self-service, they reduce the amount of employed labor necessary to provide services, potentially contributing to job loss in the retail and service sectors, even during a time when the level of unemployment in the United States hovers at the extraordinarily high level of 10 percent, with significantly higher unemployment rates within minority populations.</p>
<p>One explanation for the lack of concern might be attributed to a manner of reasoning, which states that although consumers receive no direct monetary compensation, they may indirectly benefit by paying lower prices made possible by the reduced cost of the labor that is achieved by their self-service. We respond to this argument twofold. First, any reduction in prices that results from labor cost saved through self-service is passed on to all consumers, not just those who use self-service. There is no directly proportional benefit to individuals in the form of reduced prices linked to the actual amount of consumptive labor or duration of time in which it is performed. Second, empirically, it may or may not be the case that business organizations raise or lower prices according to the effects of self-service on the overall cost of production. In most retail settings where consumers can choose, for example, to check their own merchandise or to use the assistance of an employed checker, the price of the merchandise remains the same with either option.</p>
<p>It is possible, for example, that a consumer could receive compensation in the form of a discount when they use self-service to pay, since a price reduction could be applied to the items they purchase. However this is not often the case. A notable exception has existed in warehouse stores, such as Aldi’s grocery and Sam’s Club, where it is understood that consumers will bag or box merchandise in exchange for lower prices. However, in most settings where self-service is used, the consumer understands that she or he will receive no discount in return for their consumptive labor. In fact, it is sometimes the case when performing self-service online, consumers are charged a “convenience fee.” The consumer pays a fee to enter data necessary to complete a business transaction. Thus, we see little in the form of monetary reward for performing self-service. One can argue that this arrangement is, at the least, unfair, and arguably exploitative, as consumers give up their time and effort to perform self-service. This consumptive labor time is of value, which is usurped by business organizations. Self-service requires consumers to do work but appropriates the value of that work to the businesses from which they consume.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one might agree that consumers are not compensated monetarily for their self-service, and point out that some consumers themselves do believe, as our results show, that self-service reduces the time it takes to complete their transactions. Thus, the logic of this argument is that the compensation for performing self-service is time, rather than money. This is certainly an empirical statement that deserves more research. Suffice it is to say for now that self-service may sometimes reduce the amount of time it takes to complete service transactions, but we are far from convinced that this is always the case or the case in the majority of instances. For example, self-service involving automated phone systems can entail relatively lengthy time periods in which consumers are required to listen to a series of messages, pressing buttons to respond and navigate through menu options, and then remaining on hold for extended periods. Consumers may not save time when they cannot complete, or experience difficulty completing, online forms to receive or pay for services. Self-checkout lines at grocery stores can involve lines of people who wait for excessive time periods for untrained consumers to check themselves through. These consumers are often slow and incompetent as self-checkers, struggling to locate bar codes and to weigh and pay for fruits and vegetables. Many of these self-service checkers would surely be dismissed for poor performance if they were to exhibit similar slothfulness and incompetence as employees. Suffice it to say that self-service <italic>can</italic> save time, but it does <italic>not</italic> <italic>necessarily</italic> save time.</p>
<p>However, if we do accept, at least in part, the claim that self-service compensates consumers not with money but with time, then to assess the potential benefits, we should examine how consumers might use this additional time. There are infinite possibilities for how consumers might choose to spend the accumulation of time they potentially save by participating in all the various forms of self-service. However, one distinct possibility is that they use this time to work longer hours in their jobs, as studies consistently show that American workers have been working longer hours in their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160597611433273">Schor 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160597611433273">1998</xref>). This suggests that the time surplus gained from using self-service is potentially offset by additional time spent working in jobs. When viewed in this light, contrary to the belief of many consumers, self-service does not save any time, as the surplus time has been previously used in the duration of their employed work day. This reality is evidenced by the popularity of many forms of self-service. Consumers eat fast-food because, after working long hours in jobs, they have no time to cook. They shop and bank online because, after leaving their workplaces, banks are closed and time spent fighting traffic and shopping at stores would leave too little time to pick up fast food for their hungry families waiting at home.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0160597611433273">Walsh and Zacharias-Walsh (2007</xref>) we should not be surprised that people are using self-service to make more time for to work, as capitalism exhibits a structural tendency to extend the work day. This occurs because employees agree to provide their time to employers in exchange for a wage. Assuming the total cost of labor is constant (a business has available X amount of dollars to purchase the time of labor), business organizations can increase surplus value (i.e., profit) by extending the length of the workday. By extending the workday, business organizations produce and sell more goods and services, but with no additional labor costs, thus increasing their return. One way to lengthen the workday is to require employees to work longer hours for their daily wage. This is happening, for example, as many U.S. employees put in more hours to compensate for earnings that have not kept pace with inflation and must give up more of their salaries to pay for their “employer provided” health insurance. However, as Walsh and Zacharias-Walsh point out, working longer and longer hours is contrary to what most workers would ideally prefer, and many countries, such as the United States, are limited by law as to how much they can extend the workday without paying higher rates of compensation for hours exceeding the legal standard. As a result, business organizations do seek other options to extend the work day. One strategy, according to Walsh and Zacharias-Walsh, has been to outsource work to geographic areas where workers are paid less, since the same amount of total wages that would be expended on labor employed in the United States can be exchanged for a greater number of hours of work elsewhere, thereby effectively lengthening the workday.</p>
<p>Using consumptive labor can be seen as yet another way to lengthen the workday. Business organizations are not limited by law and bound by contract as to how much consumptive labor they can require of consumers who use self-service. Therefore, self-service helps business organizations lengthen the workday by using consumers to provide a portion of labor time that requires no wage. When self-service does reduce the time of consumption, this time surplus enables consumers to work longer hours as employees, functioning to increase the time of their employed workday. The problem with this arrangement for consumers is that both the time it takes them to perform self-service tasks and the time potentially saved by using self-service can be usurped by business organizations. Consumers bear the cost, businesses reap the benefits.</p>
<p>There remains yet one more way in which the time saved by self-service can be usurped by business organizations. Consuming has become one of the most popular forms of leisure in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597611433273">De Graaf, Wann, and Naylor 2005</xref>). Therefore, we must consider the possibility that time saved by using self-service in consumption is spent on further consumption. For instance, consumers might quickly complete their self-service transactions and then use their leisure time to visit a mall. Again, businesses would seem to benefit the most from this arrangement, as the more time that is freed up and used for consumption, the more likely that consumers will make purchases.</p>
<p>When consumers save time using self-service but spend it working in their jobs or further consuming, they contribute to a process of commoditization in which their activities and identities become increasingly transformed into those that revolve around the production and consumption of goods and services. The effects of this commoditization on people are often harmful. A growing literature documents the many social problems associated with overworking and overspending in the United States. Juliet Schor has documented the cyclical process of work and spend extensively. Consumers spend more, save less, and incur large debts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160597611433273">Schor 1998</xref>). To pay their debts, they work increasingly long hours and neglect other important areas of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160597611433273">Schor 1992</xref>). They become excessively materialistic, neglect their social relationships, and are less happy than previous generations who consumed far less and lived with many fewer material possessions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597611433273">De Graaf et al. 2005</xref>). However, organizations clearly realize benefits from additional surplus that is produced during increased time spent in work and consumption. In this regard, we may conclude that consumers who prefer and use self-service are not “making out” as well as they think, no matter how self-beneficial their McDonaldized consumption may seem to them.</p>
<p>In addition to costs associated with the usurpation of people’s time, we should consider one last cost of self-service. The next time you shop online, pump your own gas, or withdraw money from an ATM, we hope you will pause to question whether these highly impersonal and dehumanized means of electronic exchange are the ideal way for people to receive goods and services. Since Marx, studies of the workplace have documented the problem of alienation, as workers have experienced conditions that separate them from products and processes of their labor, their own creativity (themselves), and others. We should consider the possibility that self-service may yield similar consequences in the arena of consumption, as consumptive laborers experience a parallel form of alienation performing routine and prescribed tasks on machines, devoid of other humans.</p>
<p>Summarily, when we take a closer look at the self-beneficial appearance of self-service and examine the essence of its social relations (i.e. critically analyze the labor process of self-service), we can see that as we consume in self-service settings, we isolate ourselves from others and give more of our time to business organizations who wish to benefit by lengthening our workdays. This comes at no small cost. It is ironic that in acting upon the ostensibly self-beneficial appearance of self-service, we should also lose ourselves in this way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we as consumers are not helpless in this regard. If you are like many of the participants in our study who prefer and will continue to use self-service, we urge you to think critically as you do so. If self-service does save you time, we hope you choose to use it in ways that will improve your social relationships and engage you in self-actualizing activities. Or, you might simply use the time for relaxation or to catch up on your sleep. However, if you oppose the increasing use (usurpation) of your consumptive labor, you are not powerless and you are certainly not alone. Arguably, consumers may be better equipped than workers to resist the business organizations they patronize for conditions they oppose. Unlike workers, who must collectively organize and often risk their jobs to negotiate with their employers, consumers risk much less and can exercise power as individuals by “voting with their pocketbooks” and “voting with their feet.” If you oppose the use of self-service, here are some ways that you can actively resist:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Consume less. Studies show that consuming less not only benefits you but also the natural environment. Also, you will retain more of your time and money.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When consuming, avoid large corporate “big-box” retailers, grocery stores, fast-food establishments, and online shopping, all of which require you to use self-service. Instead, keep your dollars in your local economy and give your business to smaller retailers, service providers, and restaurants, which often provide better and more personalized service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When at stores where self-service is optional, avoid it and refuse to use it when asked.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Consider explaining or writing a letter to store management about why you oppose their use of self-service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Similarly, consider explaining or writing a letter to store management about why you prefer to be served by employees.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When you receive good service from employees, thank them and express your appreciation to their supervisors.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Be playful and creative in resisting self-service. For example, when reaching your car with a shopping cart, unload it, place a tip in it, and do not return it. Simply leave the cart next to your car and drive away. Do not bus your table after dining at fast-food establishments. Leave your trash and place a tip on your tray. These actions allow you to save time, avoid doing consumptive labor, and provide a surprising reward for the likely underpaid employees who retrieve your carts and bus your tables.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Become a better educated consumer. Consider reading <italic>The Better World Handbook</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160597611433273">Jones, Haenfler, and Johnson 2007</xref>), <italic>Affluenza </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597611433273">De Graaf et al. 2005</xref>), and other literature pertaining to socially and ecologically responsible consumption. Improve your ability to make personally and socially responsible decisions about your consumption with or without using self-service.</p>
