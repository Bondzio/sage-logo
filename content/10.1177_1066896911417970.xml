<abstract>
<p>Unlike their cutaneous counterparts, head and neck mucosal malignant melanomas (HNMM) behave much more aggressively and their prognostic markers have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the clinicopathologic features of a contemporary series of primary HNMM, retrieved from archival material of 2 large medical centers, and to explore the association, if any, between these variables, the clinical features, and outcomes. The clinicopathologic, radiographic, and follow-up information as well as the dominant histologic pattern, mitotic rate, presence/absence of pigmentation, necrosis, ulceration, vascular invasion, and host-associated lymphocytic response were retrieved and recorded. Twenty cases were identified including 1 melanoma in situ. Eight-five percent of tumors arose in the sinonasal tract and 3 (15%) in the oral cavity. After a median follow-up of 25 months, all patients with invasive melanoma developed recurrence and/or metastasis. Local recurrences occurred in 82% of the patients after a median of 12 months, and distant metastasis occurred in 71% of the patients after a median of 13 months. Of those with adequate follow-up, 82% died with disease, and the remaining 3 had recurrent or metastatic disease. Fourth-seven percent of tumors were pigmented, 89% showed at least focal necrosis, and 93% demonstrated ulceration. Sixth-eight percent showed vascular invasion and 63% had a brisk host lymphocytic response. Mitotic rates ranged from 2 to 60/10 high-power fields. The absence of an invasive component might be associated with a better prognosis but other clinical and pathological features that predict outcome, and/or could influence therapy, remain to be determined in HNMM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM) is a rare entity. The National Cancer Database report in 1998 on more than 84 000 cases of melanomas found that only 1.3% developed from mucous membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911417970">1</xref></sup> Of these, 55% were located in the head and neck region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911417970">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>HNMM can arise in the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and the upper esophagus and upper trachea. They are most common in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and in the upper oral cavity, particularly the hard palate. Like their cutaneous counterparts, they can develop from transformed melanocytes. However, mucosal tumors behave much more aggressively than the cutaneous ones. Specifically, these lesions are notorious for their high rate of local recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis, translating to significant posttreatment failures and poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911417970">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911417970">5</xref></sup> Although tumors arising from the respiratory mucosa (such as in the nasal cavity) have different clinicopathologic characteristics than those involving oral mucosa, they share similar adverse prognosis and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911417970">3</xref></sup> Sinonasal respiratory epithelial-derived tumors are typically thicker and more frequently present with ulceration, necrosis, and perineural invasion. They are also less frequently associated with nodal metastasis at presentation when compared with oral tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the unrelenting clinical behavior of HNMM and its poor prognosis, it is critical to identify potential prognostic markers and features that may help determine treatment. Relatively few studies have systematically evaluated the clinicopathologic and histomorphologic features of HNMM and investigated their relationship to disease outcomes. For those that have, there has been some conflicting results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911417970">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911417970">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aims of this study were to conduct a contemporary analysis of the clinicopathologic features of patients with HNMM from 2 large institutions with major head and neck oncology and pathology services and to explore the associations, if any, between these variables and clinical features and outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1066896911417970" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Following respective institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of the surgical pathology databases of 2 institutions (University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, and Washington University in St. Louis, MO) was performed to identify cases of primary mucosal malignant melanoma of the head and neck, diagnosed over a consecutive 15 year period (1993-2008).</p>
<sec id="section3-1066896911417970">
<title>Clinical Information</title>
<p>Patients’ age and gender, as well as tumor location, primary treatment, and follow-up information were obtained from medical records. Radiographic images were reviewed when available. The follow-up intervals were calculated in months from the date of first treatment to the date of last follow-up or of patients’ death. Local recurrence, regional and distant metastatic rates, and disease-free survival rates were also calculated in months, where disease-free survival was considered date of treatment to the date of first recurrence of tumor at any site. Overall survival was considered as date of treatment to date of death from any cause. Disease-specific survival was considered as date of treatment to date of death for patients who had evidence of disease at this latter point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066896911417970">
<title>Pathologic Information</title>
<p>Archival pathological material was reviewed in conjunction with the original surgical pathology reports (by authors EK and NSA) to confirm the diagnosis. This included review of the hemotoxylin and eosin–stained sections and review of the reported results of any immunohistochemically stained sections used for the initial diagnosis (all cases expressed at least 2 of the following markers: S100 protein, Mart-1, and HMB45). In addition, a detailed histological review was performed by 2 of the authors (EK and NSA) to determine the predominant histological pattern, mitotic rate, and the presence or absence of melanin pigmentation, coagulative necrosis, ulceration, vascular invasion, and host lymphocytic response. Histologically, the tumors were characterized as spindled, if composed of elongated cells with fusiform nuclei; epitheloid, if composed of round to oval cells with abundant cytoplasm. Tumors were characterized as plasmacytoid if composed of round cells with abundant cytoplasm and an eccentric round nucleus or as small blue round cell if composed of round to oval cells with minimal cytoplasm. Mitotic activity was quantified by beginning in an area where mitoses are easily spotted (mitotic hot spot) and then the number of mitotic figures was counted in 10 high power fields at 400×. Melanin pigmentation was identified as brown to grey, nonrefractile, fine granules within the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The presence or absence of tumor coagulative necrosis was defined as areas where tumor architecture is preserved but there is no cellular detail. Ulceration was determined in each case if the overlying epithelium was still intact and there was a defect in the skin surface due to the underlying tumor. Vascular invasion was identified if tumor cells were focally adherent to or within the vessel wall or if the tumor cells were admixed with blood cells within a vascular lumen. A host lymphocytic response was considered present if there was a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes diffusely involving the tumor or surrounding and disrupting the advancing periphery of the lesion. The tumor size and depth of invasion were not assessed due to the fragmentation of the tumor tissue sections and lack of consistent relationships to the surface epithelium in large tumors. Histological review was performed without knowledge of the clinical information including patients’ outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section5-1066896911417970">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptives were computed as proportions for categorical data and means, medians, and standard deviations for continuous data when applicable. Means were compared using a 1-way analysis of variance. The assumption of normality was checked and if needed comparison was made using nonparametric methods. Time to event data was calculated using Kaplan–Meier curves. All analysis was done using SAS version 9.1, JMP version 8.01, or Microsoft Excel software; <italic>P</italic> value of .05 or less was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty cases of primary HNMM were identified, including 1 melanoma in situ. Seventeen (85%) of the lesions arose in the sinonasal tract and 3 (15%) in the oral cavity.</p>
<sec id="section7-1066896911417970">
<title>Clinical Findings</title>
<p>There were 13 men and 7 women (the clinical findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911417970">Table 1</xref>). The patients ranged in age from 52 to 88 years, with a mean of 69 years. Radiographic imaging prior to surgery helped localize the primary tumors. Of the 17 tumors arising in the sinonasal tract, 9 (53%) of the lesions were located in the nasal cavity. In addition, 2 (12%) of the sinonasal tract lesions involved the nasal cavity and either the hard palate or the maxillary sinus. The remaining 6 (35%) sinonasal tract lesions were located in the ethmoid sinus (2; 33%), maxillary sinus (2; 33%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911417970">Figure 1</xref>), sphenoid sinus (1; 17%), and skull base (1; 17%). Of the 3 tumors arising in the oral cavity, 1 (33%) arose on the hard palate, 1 (33%) arose on the maxillary mucolabial fold, and 1 (33%) arose from the mandibular labial mucosa.</p>

<p>At the time of initial diagnosis, all patients had localized disease with no evidence of metastasis clinically or radiographically. All patients initially underwent total surgical excision of the tumors. Clinical follow-up was available for 17 (85%) patients, 2 patients with oral melanoma were lost to follow-up, and 1 patient with sinonasal melanoma died in the immediate postoperative period. All patients with invasive melanoma (n = 16) developed recurrence and/or metastasis. After a median follow-up of 25 months (mean = 41 months; range = 4-117 months), 3 (18%) patients were alive with disease and 14 (82%) patients had died of disease.</p>
<p>Local recurrence was observed in 14 (82%) patients. The median time to local recurrence was 12 months (mean = 24 months; range =1-35 months). Twelve (86%) of the patients with local recurrence died of disease with a median time to death after local recurrence of 12 months (mean = 24 months; range = 2-84 months). Local recurrence was frequently associated with metastasis, with 10 (71%) patients with local recurrence also having metastasis. This included 1 (10%) patient with nodal metastasis, 7 (70%) with distant metastasis, and 2 (20%) with both nodal and distant metastasis. The median time to metastasis after local recurrence was 3 months (mean = 6 months; range = 0-24 months).</p>
<p>Regional and distant metastases were observed in 12 (71%) patients with a median time to metastasis of 13 months (mean = 20 months; range = 1-36 months; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911417970">Figure 2</xref>). One (8%) patient had isolated nodal metastasis, 9 (75%) patients had distant metastasis, and 2 (17%) patients had both nodal and distant metastasis. The most common sites of distant metastasis were (in decreasing order) lung (58%), liver (42%), vertebra (33%), chest wall (33%), and brain (25%). Eleven (91%) of the patients with metastasis had died of disease at last follow-up, with a median time to death after metastasis of 5 months (mean = 8 months; range = 2-31 months).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Head and neck mucosal melanoma is a rare entity, as evidenced by our identification of only 20 cases collectively from 2 large academic centers over a consecutive 15-year time frame. Patient prognosis is poor, and features that allow for proper patient counseling and rational treatment decision are needed. Our study investigated potential prognostic markers of HNMM. We found that nodal and/or distant metastases are associated with worse outcome, but that none of the other major clinical and pathologic features were associated with outcome.</p>
<p>Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) accounts for approximately 3% of all malignancies and is regarded as a major cause of morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911417970">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911417970">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911417970">7</xref></sup> It is a disease of multifactorial etiology, including genetic and racial factors, but excessive exposure to ultraviolet light is considered by far to be the most important predisposing factor. There are several well-established clinical poor prognosis indicators for CMM including older age (more than 65 years) and male gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911417970">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911417970">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911417970">9</xref></sup> In addition, tumors located on the back, upper arm, neck, and scalp as well as those developing on the acral skin are associated with poorer prognosis when compared with other cutaneous sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911417970">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911417970">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911417970">9</xref></sup> Likewise, there are several well-established pathological prognostic factors for cutaneous melanomas including tumor (Breslow) thickness (more than 1 mm) and the presence of surface ulceration. These are independently associated with higher rates of distant metastasis and poorer overall survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911417970">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911417970">11</xref></sup> Other features that have been linked to a worse outcome include the presence of high mitotic rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911417970">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911417970">12</xref></sup> lymphovascular invasion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911417970">9</xref></sup> and perineural/intraneural invasion, especially in the desmoplastic variant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911417970">6</xref></sup> On the other hand, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytic component has been considered indicative of better long-term prognosis, independent of other prognostic indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911417970">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apart from the skin, melanoma may occur in several other body sites, such as the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, cervical, vaginal and anal mucous membranes, along with head and neck mucosal sites including the sinonasal and oral cavities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911417970">6</xref></sup> In contrast to CMM, prognostic factors for mucosal malignant melanomas have not been well characterized. This is primarily due to the difficulty in applying various cutaneous prognostic indicators to tumors arising in that region because of the anatomic complexity. Additionally, HNMM develops a decade later and presents with more advanced stage at presentation compared with cutaneous tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911417970">1</xref></sup> Unlike cutaneous melanomas where excessive sun exposure is a known etiologic factor, the etiopathogenesis of HNMM is not well elucidated. However, it is noteworthy to mention that, unlike cutaneous tumors, <italic>c-kit</italic> mutation is found in a significant majority of HNMM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911417970">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was a male predominance in the current study, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.9 to 1. This finding is consistent with the literature, which suggests a slight predilection for HNMM in males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911417970">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911417970">18</xref></sup> However, we did not find that the gender of the patients influenced outcome. Most studies show a mean age of presentation for MMHN of approximately 65 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911417970">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911417970">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896911417970">20</xref></sup> The mean age of our patients at the time of diagnosis was a little higher at 69 years. Some studies, such as those conducted by Bachar and coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911417970">2</xref></sup> found that patients younger than 50 years of age had a significantly better disease-specific survival than those older than 50 years. We did not find that the age of the patients influenced outcome.</p>
<p>The majority of tumors in this study arose in the sinonasal tract (85%) as opposed to the oral cavity (15%). This is similar to other studies where there was also a predominance of sinonasal tract HNMM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911417970">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896911417970">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896911417970">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896911417970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896911417970">24</xref></sup> Half of the tumors arose or involved in the nasal cavity (53%). Others involved the nasal cavity along with the paranasal sinuses, the paranasal sinuses alone, and skull base. Most case series also show the predominance of nasal cavity involvement over the paranasal sinuses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911417970">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896911417970">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896911417970">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have shown that the majority of patients with HNMM present with localized disease and with no evidence of metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911417970">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911417970">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896911417970">21</xref></sup> In our study, all the patients presented in this manner. Unfortunately, though, after a median follow-up of 23 months (mean = 38 months; range = 4-117 months), all but 1 patient went on to develop local recurrence or regional and distant metastasis. The 1 patient who did not develop local recurrence or metastasis after a follow-up of 13 months had melanoma in situ. Therefore, the absence of an invasive component might be associated with a better outcome.</p>
<p>Surgical resection is the first line of treatment for localized melanomas irrespective of involvement of the regional lymph nodes. Local recurrences are a common finding with head and neck melanomas, probably attributed to the complexity of the anatomical boundaries and the presence of many vital structures, which in turn cause difficulty in achieving complete resections with negative margins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896911417970">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896911417970"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896911417970">24</xref></sup> In this study, the majority of the patients (82%) suffered local recurrence. Additionally, 71% of the patients developed regional and/or distant metastasis. The majority of patients with metastasis (91%) had died of disease in the follow-up period.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, certain well-documented histomorphological features, including tumor thickness and ulceration, are important in the prognosis and staging of cutaneous melanoma. Balch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911417970">10</xref></sup> and Patel et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref></sup> among others, reported tumor thickness greater than 5 mm in HNMM to have a significantly worse outcome. However, in the present study, we were not able to measure the tumor thickness due to the fragmentation of the tissue at time of resection. Similarly, 5 (31%) of the lesions could not be evaluated for ulceration also due to the fragmentation of the resected specimens. However, the majority of the lesions (14; 93%) with intact epithelium showed ulceration. Therefore, the presence of ulceration might be associated with an overall poor prognosis of these lesions, similar to their cutaneous counterpart. Mitotic rate has also recently emerged as a powerful predictive factor of survival and is now included in the AJCC melanoma staging system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911417970">10</xref></sup> The mitotic count of the lesions varied from 2 to 60 per 10 high power fields, but there was no correlation with outcome.</p>
<p>HNMM show a broad range of histological subtypes, similar to their cutaneous counterparts. In this study, the most common histological subtype observed was spindle cell, with epithelial, plasma cell, and small blue round cell being less frequent. Although some studies have shown that the presence of an undifferentiated cell type (including small blue round cells or markedly pleomorphic cells) portend a worse outcome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911417970">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911417970">10</xref></sup> we did not find this to be the case in this series, although our number of cases (20 cases) were probably too small to make any definitive conclusion about this. We also found that the presence or absence of melanin pigmentation also did not correlate with outcome. At this point, it is important to note that the morphological heterogeneity of HNMM can make the diagnosis difficult and the index of suspicion should always be high for this neoplasm.</p>
<p>Prasad and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896911417970">25</xref></sup> reported necrosis as a reliable predictor of poor survival. The majority of our cases (89%) showed at least focal necrosis, but it was not associated with worse outcomes. Shah and collaborators demonstrated that the presence of lymphatic and/or vascular invasion is common in HNMM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066896911417970">26</xref></sup> Some studies have shown that the presence of vascular invasion was associated with a poor survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911417970">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896911417970">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066896911417970">26</xref></sup> The majority of our cases showed vascular invasion (13; 68%). However, it was also not associated with a worse outcome in this series. We also found that the presence or absence of a host lymphocytic response also did not correlate with outcome.</p>
<p>Thompson and colleagues in 2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066896911417970">27</xref></sup> extensively analyzed 115 cases of sinonasal tract malignant melanoma and found metastatic disease to be the most important predictor of outcome, after applying a modified staging system, where they combined nodal and distant metastasis status into the staging group. They proposed that their modified staging system could accurately predict patient behavior but also acknowledged its limitations. Of the total number of patients investigated, 75% of those presenting with stage I (T1N0M0) and 62.2% of those presenting with stage II disease demonstrated no evidence of disease recurrence after mean follow-up periods of 13.2 and 15.9 years, respectively, whereas 100% of patients presenting with stage III disease (any T, any N, M1) died with disease within a mean follow-up period of 1.5 years. All patients were treated with partial or complete surgical excision, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. There was an equal gender distribution with an age range of 13 to 93 years. There was no significant difference in the overall survival by gender. Additionally, no statistically significant difference in outcome was found between the various histomorphologic patterns and features depicted (including solid, spindled, peritheliomatous, storiform, alveolar and pseudopapillary, plasmacytoid or rhabdoid) or the presence of regressive signs (fibrosis), pagetoid spread, the presence or absence of melanin pigment, and/or the intensity of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or peripheral reactive lymphocytes. Similarly, the identification of tumor necrosis did not affect the overall outcome. However, patients who presented with &gt;10 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields as well as that with an undifferentiated histology were noted to have worse outcomes. Furthermore, tumors that involved patients older than 60 years old, those that recurred, and those that had large tumors (&gt;3 cm) exhibited worse prognosis. This study further confirmed the poor overall survival of HNMM patients, demonstrating 42.6% 5-year and 14.3% 10-year survival rates, respectively. While the Thompson article<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066896911417970">27</xref></sup> elucidated some important prognostic factors, their proposed staging system would have not provided much meaningful information in our patient cohort, where all patients presented with local disease only but most still died of their disease.</p>
<p>It is evident from the review of the literature and the findings of this study among several others that clinicopathological features cannot solely and reliably predict the overall outcome of head and neck mucosa melanomas. This has fueled the search to identify new therapeutic molecular targets that would accurately and reliably predict disease progression, treatment outcome, and prognosis. These include signal transduction pathways, oncogenes, growth factors, and growth factor receptors.</p>
<p>The high rates of c-Kit expression in mucosal melanoma patients, including those from the head and neck region, are well established. C-kit expression is also associated with marked prevalence for mutations involving axon 11, which also correlates with increased immunohistochemical staining for c-Kit (<italic>P</italic> = .015). These finding may support targeting tyrosine kinase pathway and inhibition of c-Kit in the management of mucosal melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066896911417970">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway (also referred to as Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway) is one of the most important pathways investigated, albeit so far with limited clinically applicability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066896911417970">29</xref></sup> Dysregulation of this pathway plays an essential role in the development of several malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066896911417970">30</xref></sup> Various orchestrated and consecutive cascaded events take place with dysregulation of the MAPK pathway. These include the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2) and the phosphorylation of several nuclear transcription factors including Elk-1, Myc, CREB, and FOS among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066896911417970">31</xref></sup> Dysregulation of MAPK pathway is also associated with mutations of upstream membrane receptors Ras and B-Raf as well as other pathways genes, including PI3K, PTEN, and Akt, which promotes the regulation of Raf activity, constitutive ERK signaling, and stimulates the proliferation and survival of tumor cells. It also provides important tumor growth and maintenance functions.32</p>
<p>Therapies targeting the mutant activity components of the MAPK cascade could potentially stop progression of malignant tumors by slowing tumor growth and inducing tumor cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066896911417970">32,33</xref></sup> The MAPK pathway plays an important role in melanoma cell proliferation and survival, with ERK being constitutively activated in up to 90% of melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066896911417970">34</xref></sup> ERK hyperphosphorylation is most often associated with mutations of NRAS (15% to 30%) and BRAF (50% to 70%) genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066896911417970">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066896911417970">36</xref></sup> It is noteworthy mentioning that significant differences in frequencies of regional changes in the number of copies of DNA and mutation frequencies in BRAF were identified between sun-damaged and non-sun-damaged skin melanomas (mucosal melanomas being included in the later group). Eight-one percent of melanoma involving the non-sun-exposed areas demonstrated mutations in BRAF or N-RAS when compared with tumors that involved sun-damaged skin where no mutations in either genes was detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066896911417970">37</xref></sup> Mauerer and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066896911417970">38</xref></sup> have recently discovered a panel of new candidate markers that are associated with melanoma-relevant signaling pathways such as MAPK-, Notch-, and Wnt-signaling by comparing microarray characteristics of primary melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and benign melanocytic nevi. Their findings, similar to previously conducted research, reaffirmed the differences in gene expression between benign and malignant melanocytic lesions, reflected by the activation/deactivation of cancer signaling pathways, such as MAPK, Wnt, or Notch signaling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study on clinicopathologic parameters in HNMM has shown that they are morphologically quite variable, often nonpigmented, and are associated with an aggressive, inexorable clinical course wherein almost all patients develop local recurrences and/or metastases, often within a short period. In contrast to some previous studies, the current study did not identify any histological markers that are predictive of outcome. Given that this may be related to the relatively small size of the study and the universally poor outcomes seen, further larger studies are needed to identify valid predictive and prognostic markers for HNMM. In particular, molecular markers and specific genetic mutations in these neoplasms may allow for better outcome prediction and pave the way for tailored treatments.</p>
