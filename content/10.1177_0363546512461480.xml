<sec id="section1-0363546512461480">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Ankle syndesmotic injuries are complex and require anatomic reduction and fixation to restore the normal biomechanics of the ankle joint and prevent long-term complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512461480">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy and maintenance of syndesmotic reduction using TightRope versus syndesmotic screw fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512461480">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512461480">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This cohort study included consecutive patients treated for ankle syndesmotic diastases between July 2007 and June 2009. Single slice axial computed tomography (CT) scans of both the ankles together were performed at the level of syndesmosis, 1 cm above the tibial plafond. A greater than 2-mm widening of syndesmosis compared with the untreated contralateral ankle was considered significant malreduction. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedics Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512461480">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Forty-six of 55 eligible patients participated in the study; 23 patients were in the TightRope group and 23 in the syndesmotic screw group. The average age was 42 years in the TightRope and 40 years in the syndesmotic screw group, and the mean follow-up time was 2.5 years (range, 1.5-3.5 years). The average width of normal syndesmosis was 4.03 ± 0.89 mm. In the TightRope group, the mean width of syndesmosis was 4.37 mm (SD, ±1.12 mm) (<italic>P =</italic> .30, <italic>t</italic> test) compared with 5.16 mm (SD, ±1.92 mm) in the syndesmotic screw group (<italic>P =</italic> .01, <italic>t</italic> test). Five of 23 ankles (21.7%) in the syndesmotic screw group had syndesmotic malreduction, whereas none of the TightRope group showed malreduction on CT scans (<italic>P</italic> = .04, Fisher exact test). Average time to full weightbearing was 8 weeks in the TightRope group and 9.1 weeks in the syndesmotic screw group. There was no significant difference between the TightRope and syndesmotic screw groups in mean postoperative AOFAS score (89.56 and 86.52, respectively) or FADI score (82.42 and 81.22, respectively). Regression analysis confirmed malreduction of syndesmosis as the only independent variable that affected the clinical outcome (regression coefficient, −12.39; <italic>t</italic> = −2.43; <italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512461480">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that fixation with TightRope provides a more accurate method of syndesmotic stabilization compared with screw fixation. Syndesmotic malreduction is the most important independent predictor of clinical outcomes; therefore, care should be taken to reduce the syndesmosis accurately.</p>

<p>Injuries to the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis are complex, and the diagnosis and management of such injuries pose a challenge to surgeons. In the United Kingdom, ankle fractures are the most common fractures among patients between 20 and 65 years, with a reported annual incidence of 90,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512461480">22</xref></sup> It is estimated that 10% of all ankle fractures are associated with syndesmotic disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512461480">6</xref></sup> Although metal screw fixation has been the most popular stabilizing method used in ankle syndesmosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512461480">7</xref></sup> a controversy still exists regarding the size and number of screws, number of cortices engaged, level of screw placement above the tibial plafond, need for routine removal, and timing of the screw removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512461480">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512461480">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512461480">19</xref></sup> Malreduction of tibiofibular syndesmosis also has been reported to be a significant problem with screw fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461480">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The TightRope (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida) is a relatively new surgical implant based on the suture-Button design. It is a low-profile system consisting of a No. 5 FiberWire loop (Arthrex), which, when tensioned and secured between metallic EndoButtons placed against the outer cortices of the tibia and fibula, provides physiologic stabilization of the ankle mortise and obviates the need for a second procedure for routine removal; therefore, late diastasis is potentially unlikely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512461480">1</xref></sup> Biomechanical testing and clinical studies have shown equivalent strength and improved patient outcome with the TightRope technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512461480">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512461480">21</xref></sup> The literature referring to TightRope fixation is rather limited, and the issue of malreduction has not been extensively investigated. In almost all published studies thus far, syndesmotic reduction has been assessed based on radiographic parameters, including medial clear space, tibiofibular clear space, and tibiofibular overlap, on standard ankle radiographs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461480">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512461480"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512461480">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512461480">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512461480">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512461480">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512461480">25</xref></sup> A published study has indicated that radiographic measurements are influenced by ankle rotation and are, therefore, inaccurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512461480">2</xref></sup> Significant malreduction of the tibiofibular syndesmosis has been reported in the literature for patients treated with the syndesmotic screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461480">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512461480">24</xref></sup> Because malreduction of the syndesmosis is the most important independent predictor of long-term functional outcome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512461480">23</xref></sup> this study primarily aims to compare the accuracy and maintenance of syndesmotic reduction using TightRope versus syndesmotic screw fixation and its correlation with clinical outcomes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512461480">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A cohort study was conducted to assess the radiological and clinical outcomes of patients after the treatment of ankle injuries involving distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Two different methods of syndesmotic fixation were compared (the standard transosseous syndesmotic screw fixation method and the relatively new TightRope fixation technique) to assess the accuracy and maintenance of syndesmotic reduction and its correlation with functional outcome scores at least 18 months after surgery. We examined the accuracy of syndesmotic reduction assessed primarily on axial computed tomography (CT) scans of the ankles using the uninjured contralateral ankle as a control. The study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. We followed the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines in conducting this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512461480">
<title>Selection of Patients</title>
<p>This cohort study included all consecutive adult patients treated for acute ankle syndesmotic diastases with either the TightRope or the syndesmotic screw fixation method in our regional trauma center over a period of 2 years, between July 2007 and June 2009. Patients with compound fractures, multiple injuries, neuropathic arthropathy, bilateral injuries, and chronic or missed syndesmotic injuries were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512461480">
<title>Treatment and Follow-up</title>
<p>Three consultants used the screw fixation method, whereas the other 3 consultants used the TightRope technique for all of their patients requiring syndesmotic fixation irrespective of age, sex, and the type of associated fractures. The diagnosis of tibiofibular diastasis was based on both clinical examination and radiographic parameters, including widening of the tibiofibular clear space and reduction of tibiofibular overlap preoperatively, followed by intraoperative confirmation under the image intensifier using the external rotation stress test or hook test. Concomitant fractures of the fibula and medial malleolus were fixed according to standard principles of the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO-ASIF). Ankle syndesmoses were stabilized with either the transosseous syndesmotic screw (Synthes, Inc, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or the TightRope system, depending on the surgeon’s preference. All patients were immobilized in a below-the-knee, nonweightbearing cast for 6 weeks, followed by physical therapy and weightbearing as tolerated. Patients were followed up in the clinic at 2 weeks, at 6 weeks, and then after 3 months. In this cohort of patients, the syndesmotic screws were routinely removed at approximately 10 weeks after surgery. Patients were reviewed at least 18 months after surgery for study data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512461480">
<title>Surgical Techniques</title>
<p>All procedures were performed with patients in the supine position under general or spinal anesthesia with antibiotic prophylaxis and tourniquet control. Standard ankle orthosis techniques were used to internally fix fractures of the fibula or tibia requiring fixation, and a large ankle orthosis clamp with the ankle in neutral position was used to reduce and maintain syndesmosis. Reduction was confirmed under image intensifier. All 4 cortices were drilled from the fibular side, angled 30° anterior to the coronal plane, and placed approximately 2.5 cm above and parallel to the tibial plafond. If a plate was used for fibular stabilization, the drill hole was made through one of the empty plate holes, depending on the location of the plate. In patients treated with a syndesmotic screw, either a 3.5-mm or a 4.5-mm cortical screw was inserted through the drill hole, engaging all 4 cortices. In the TightRope group, the needle attached to the leading oblong Button was passed through the holes and out from the intact medial skin along with the pull-through sutures. Once the medial button was passed through the medial tibial cortex (confirmed by imaging), the assembly was tensioned by pulling the free ends of the FiberWire on the lateral side. Once both the buttons were seated flush with the bone, the free ends of the FiberWire were hand tied on the lateral side and cut 1 cm long and buried. Two TightRopes were used in 7 cases and 2 syndesmotic screws in 3 cases depending on the fracture configuration.</p>

<sec id="section12-0363546512461480">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>All participants underwent a clinical examination by an independent clinician who was blinded for the type of syndesmotic fixation. Radiographic assessment included an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the ankle and a single-slice axial CT scan of both the ankles together, at 1 cm above the tibial plafond. All of the CT scans were performed by a single, senior CT radiographer using predetermined parameters. To standardize the measurements, a survey scan was performed with both of the ankles together in the supine position with the ankles in neutral position, and a 1-cm distance was measured from the tibial plafond to obtain the axial CT scan image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512461480">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0363546512461480">
<title>Outcome Variables and Measurements</title>
<p>Accuracy of the syndesmotic reduction on axial CT scans was considered the primary outcome variable for comparison of the 2 treatment options. The criterion for malreduction of syndesmosis was set at &gt;2 mm of difference in the width of the syndesmosis compared with the untreated contralateral ankle, as measured on the axial CT scan. The criterion was set at &gt;2 mm in accordance with previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461480">11</xref></sup> and the assumption that this difference will result in a sufficient level of joint incongruity, which may lead to increased contact pressures in the ankle joint and the risk of early degenerative changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512461480">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512461480">17</xref></sup> Elgafy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512461480">10</xref></sup> reported that the average posterior width of syndesmoses is 4 mm (standard deviation [SD], ±1.19 mm). Because this area corresponds to the tibiofibular clear space on AP radiographs and &gt;6 mm of tibiofibular clear space is considered abnormal, the criterion of &gt;2 mm is justified.</p>
<p>The width of the posterior portion of the syndesmotic joint space was measured to facilitate this comparison, because this corresponds to the tibiofibular clear space on the AP radiographs. The distance was measured from the posterior tibial tubercle to the medial boarder or the nearest point on the fibula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512461480">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461480">3</xref>).</p>

<p>We also assessed syndesmotic reduction on AP radiographs of the ankle using parameters including tibiofibular clear space &lt;6 mm, tibiofibular overlap &gt;6 mm, and medial clear space &lt;5 mm. All the measurements were taken by an independent radiologist with special interest in musculoskeletal radiology, using digital imaging software.</p>
<p>Clinical outcomes were compared using the American Orthopaedics Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score, time to full weightbearing, and the rate of complications. Both AOFAS and FADI scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546512461480">
<title>Sample Size Estimation</title>
<p>Sample size calculation was performed based on the measurements of normal syndesmosis on the CT scan as reported by Elgafy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512461480">10</xref></sup> The mean width of syndesmosis was noted to be 4 mm (SD, ±1.19 mm). Based on a 2-group comparison, power calculations indicated that a minimum of 46 participants (23 in each group) were required to detect a difference of 1 mm in the CT measurements, at a 2-sided significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, assuming an SD of ±1.19 mm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546512461480">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was confirmed using Stata 11.1 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Demographics were compared for the 2 groups using mean values and proportions. Mean values were also calculated for the CT and radiographic parameters for both operated and contralateral ankles in 2 groups separately, and a <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparison of these values within each group to measure statistical significance. The Fisher exact test was used to analyze data regarding malreduction of syndesmosis to calculate relative risk and statistical significance. Regression analysis was performed to adjust for potential confounders such as patient age and the duration since the index procedure and to find the variables affecting the clinical outcome scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compared the accuracy and maintenance of syndesmotic reduction based on CT scans and their correlation with the clinical outcomes. The results of this study indicated a significant difference in the mean width of the syndesmosis between operated and contralateral ankles in the syndesmotic screw group compared with the TightRope group. Although a trend toward better clinical outcomes in the TightRope group was noted, when it was adjusted for potential confounders, including age and time period since surgery, no statistically significant difference was seen in the functional outcome scores (AOFAS, FADI). Malreduction of the syndesmosis was the only independent variable that significantly affected the functional outcome scores.</p>
<p>According to our criterion of malreduction, 5 cases of malreduction were identified in the syndesmotic screw group, whereas there were none in the TightRope group. A 21.7% increased risk that syndesmosis would be malreduced with the screw fixation method was observed rather than with the TightRope technique (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, Fisher exact test). This concurs with the earlier literature regarding syndesmotic screw fixation. The incidence of malreduction of syndesmosis has been reported to be between 16% and 52%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461480">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512461480">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512461480">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512461480">24</xref></sup> Weening and Bhandari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512461480">23</xref></sup> reported 16% malreduction of syndesmosis in patients treated with the syndesmotic screw. The diagnosis of malreduction in that study was based on the standard radiographic parameters of syndesmotic integrity and demonstrated a direct relation of malreduction with poor functional outcome scores. Because the literature has suggested that standard radiographic measurements are inaccurate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512461480">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512461480">9</xref></sup> and insufficient to diagnose syndesmotic malreduction, several authors have used CT scans to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Gardner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461480">11</xref></sup> reported 52% syndesmotic malreduction in their series of 25 patients treated with the syndesmotic screw based on CT scans, compared with only 24% based on standard radiographic criteria. This is the highest incidence of malreduction reported thus far in the literature, although the validity of the results is limited by the lack of comparison with the uninjured ankle and the absence of clinical correlation. Wikeroy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512461480">24</xref></sup> reviewed 48 patients treated with the syndesmotic screw from an earlier randomized controlled study after 8.4 years and reported a 20.8% incidence of malreduction based on an axial CT scan compared with the contralateral side. Concurrent with the findings of Wikeroy et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512461480">24</xref></sup> the present study showed a 21.7% incidence of malreduction in the syndesmotic screw group.</p>
<p>The TightRope fixation for syndesmotic injury is a relatively new technique that provides dynamic fixation and obviates the need for routine implant removal. The literature is rather limited regarding the TightRope technique and mainly consists of a few case series and nonrandomized comparative studies with limited numbers of patients and shorter follow-up periods. Thornes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512461480">20</xref></sup> and Cottom et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512461480">4</xref></sup> compared the suture–EndoButton technique (Smith &amp; Nephew Inc, Andover, Massachusetts) and syndesmotic screw fixation method in a nonrandomized comparative study and reported a trend toward better functional outcomes with the suture–EndoButton technique. Thornes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512461480">20</xref></sup> also performed a CT scan in 11 of 16 patients in the suture–EndoButton group after 3 months and did not report any loss of reduction. None of the patients in their syndesmotic screw group underwent a CT scan, which limited the significance of that part of the study. Coetzee and Ebeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461480">3</xref></sup> reported a similar trend of better clinical outcomes in their preliminary results of a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>The present study is the only one that has comparatively studied the accuracy and maintenance of syndesmotic reduction between the TightRope and syndesmotic screw, and it showed that the TightRope fixation technique was significantly better at maintaining the reduction, even after a mean duration of 30 months after surgery. The reason for the high incidence of malreduction in the syndesmotic screw group is, however, difficult to determine from this study, because CT scans were not performed immediately postoperatively, which makes it difficult to discern exactly when the diastases occurred (ie, whether the syndesmoses were malreduced at the time of surgery or had evolved over time). The possibility of an increased gap after removal of the syndesmotic screw cannot be ruled out either. However, the TightRope technique does not require routine removal and continues to maintain reduction. Because TightRope is a flexible device, one possible explanation for the accurate reduction is that the fibula is pulled into the concave incisura fibularis of the distal tibia as it is tightened.</p>
<p>Some limitations in this study need to be considered. First, this was a nonrandomized study and as such has inherent limitations, such as risk of selection bias and performance bias, because the procedures were performed by different surgeons. Blinding of the primary outcome assessor was not possible. Second, it was not possible to identify the precise reason for the higher incidence of malreduction in the syndesmotic screw group. Despite these limitations, given the appropriate size of the sample and follow-up duration, the results of the study are potentially valid and show that TightRope fixation is at least equivalent to the conventional screw fixation in the treatment of syndesmotic injuries and that it has the potential advantages of providing and maintaining accurate reduction and avoiding the need for routine removal. The technique is simple and can be used both in isolation and with plate fixation. Further long-term randomized controlled trials are desirable to confirm the results.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ankle syndesmotic injuries are complex and require accurate reduction and fixation to restore the normal biomechanics of the ankle joint and avoid long-term complications. Syndesmotic screw and TightRope fixation are both valid options for the treatment of syndesmotic injuries. Although short- to medium-term clinical results are comparable for both the groups, TightRope provides and maintains more accurate reduction of syndesmosis compared with screw fixation and obviates the need for routine implant removal. Because malreduction of syndesmosis is the most important independent predictor of long-term functional outcome in these injuries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512461480">23</xref></sup> care must be taken to accurately reduce the syndesmosis before fixation.</p>
