<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, the German government pulled famous brand names, including the washing powder Persil, from shelves. In response, Germans embarked on a shopping frenzy. Beauty creams almost instantly sold out; farmers were seen buying wholly irrelevant goods such as typewriters and grand pianos. Optimistic advertisers continued to name-drop products that it was now impossible to buy, looking forward to the day when the return of consumer goods would bring joy to Germans’ hearts – and presumably also to their own pocketbooks. Instead of willingly sacrificing their consumer desires to the greater goals of the people’s community, German consumers first desperately attempted to maintain access to brand goods, and then complained both about subpar, ‘piece of trash’ replacements and propaganda which ordered them to do without (214).</p>
<p>S Jonathan Wiesen’s impressive new book on the consumer marketplace during the Third Reich demonstrates the difficulty the Nazi government had in imposing its ‘racially and morally sanitised consumer capitalism’ on its subjects (232). Despite the regime’s attempt to remove what it saw as dangerous expressions of consumer cultures, business, marketers and citizens retained a surprising amount of room to manoeuvre. This was, Wiesen asserts, due to continuities from pre-1933 consumer culture, the incompatibility of government and corporate goals (and consumers’ preference for the latter), and the persistent autonomy of producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Wiesen also demonstrates why, despite the Nazi regime arguably being far more successful (and perhaps also focused) on ‘persecution, war, and genocide’, understanding the consumer marketplace is essential to our understanding of it. Consumption played a key role in ‘racist and nationalistic discourse’ (35). To understand patterns of consumption and production is to understand the economic priorities of the Third Reich, the ‘relationship of the economy to political violence’, and, thus, the dynamics of its racial ideology (2). To understand Germans’ dreams of the anticipated material comforts of the future is to comprehend better why so many of them were to stay loyal to the regime for so long – and why the loss of the war in 1945 was such a bitter shock.</p>
<p>Wiesen has a knack for employing case studies and anecdotes that are both interesting and relevant to a wider picture of which he never loses sight. Particularly good are the case studies of Bayer Pharmaceuticals and Henkel cleaning products, in which Wiesen demonstrates how these companies deftly balanced their need to successfully market their product and demonstrate its public good. Advertising was neatly enmeshed in a wider propagandistic context of national self renewal, strength and health.</p>
<p>Even more provocative is the discussion of the marketing for the luxury items such as decaffeinated coffee and cigarettes, which reveals particularly well the highly complicated role of pleasure within the Third Reich. While the regime, including especially Hitler himself, certainly disliked cigarettes, the value of the satisfaction such items brought could not be underestimated. Marketers knew this. They also played on the health obsessions of the regime, touting decaf coffee as both pleasurable and without the ‘poison’ of caffeine. Finally, the concomitant discomfort and desire that devoted Nazi Carl Hundhausen felt when exploring American household appliances is palpable in Wiesen’s writing – American over-consumption was both disgusting and arousing in 1943 Germany, where deprivation was the order of the day.</p>
<p>Only one section of the book jarred slightly – the discussion of the Rotary Club, which Wiesen uses as a way to explore civic society’s views of both consumer society and the Nazi government. This seemed somewhat disconnected; why not a greater focus on the cooperative producers that the Nazis so disliked, for example? I also wondered whether Wiesen’s concluding comments about the centrality and similarity of marketing within different regimes, including democracy, socialism and fascism, are not overly shaped by the primacy of the market in our own historical moment. They also neglect to consider that all of those regime types were also market centred, regardless of whether private enterprise or the government controlled that market (239).</p>
<p>But these are minor quibbles with a thoroughly enjoyable and rigorously researched book. Wiesen is compelling in his conclusions that the continuing tension between capitalism and National Socialism neither points to a failure of the regime to harness production for its own end, nor exonerates companies from various degrees of complicity, conformity, exploitation and survival. His is a story of both how ‘conventional business norms and practices became tied to horrible crimes’ (242), and how Germans, while manipulated by marketers to ‘feel part of a grand mission to overtake other countries in quality of life’ (239) still did not lose control of their ‘private yearnings’ to a totalitarian regime.</p>
