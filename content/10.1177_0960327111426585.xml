<abstract>
<p>The present work was to investigate the effects of flavonoid extracts from celery on oxidative stress induced by dichlorvos (DIC) in male Wistar rats maintained on a normal diet. The rats were given DIC through intragastric administration by the dose of 7.2 mg/kg·body weight (bw)/day and additionally added 5% flavonoid extracts to the diet for 4 weeks continuously. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in livers of rats were measured at the end of the experiment. Under the influence of DIC, there were significant decrease in the activities of SOD, CAT and GST and significant increase in GPx activity and MDA content. The results also showed that the activities of SOD, GST and CAT in the DIC-treated group declined significantly when compared with the flavonoid extracts group and the DIC + flavonoid extracts group, respectively. With regard to GPx activity and MDA content, significant increase were showed in the DIC-treated group in comparison to those in the flavonoid extracts group and the DIC + flavonoid extracts group, respectively. The observations presented lead us to conclude the harmful effects of DIC during the exposure and the protective role of flavonoids in minimizing these effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dichlorvos (DIC), one of the most widely used organophosphorus pesticides, has been used as a crop protectant as well as a general purpose public health insecticide in agriculture and public health programs since 1961.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327111426585">1</xref>
</sup> DIC is also one of the most commonly used organophosphorus pesticides in China. Exposure of general public to DIC may occur via air, water or food as it gets readily absorbed through all routes of exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327111426585">1</xref>
</sup> Many studies have reported that exposure to low levels of commonly used pesticides could induce oxidative stress as indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and/or glutathione depletion, inhibition or induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and quenching endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) in rat tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111426585">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111426585"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111426585">4</xref>
</sup> Thus, oxidative stress induced by the pesticides in vivo became a field of interest for scientists recently.</p>
<p>Flavonoids, a secondary metabolites from plants, are widespread in plant-derived foods such as vegetables, fruits, seeds and tea and are an integral part of the human diet. Dietary flavonoids were shown to mediate antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various cell types.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327111426585">5</xref>
</sup> Flavonoids act as antioxidants by chelating redox-active metals and by scavenging free radicals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111426585">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111426585"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111426585"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111426585"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111426585">10</xref>
</sup> Chelation of both iron and copper by the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of flavonoids prevents peroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111426585">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111426585"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111426585">8</xref>
</sup> Flavonoids also function as terminators of free radicals by donation of electrons to form stable products. Flavonoids are very effective scavengers of hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111426585">6</xref>
</sup> as well as quenching superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111426585">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111426585">10</xref>
</sup> More recently, it has been shown that at low levels flavonoids provide antioxidant protection, but at high levels they cause DNA damage and apoptosis (cell death).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327111426585">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The detrimental health effects of chemicals in foods and/or the environment depend on several factors, one of which is interaction between chemicals in a mixture. Though most studies are conducted with individual chemicals, animals and humans are exposed to multiple chemicals in a complex mixture. Flavonoids in human diets are metabolized by the same pathway as toxic man-made chemicals such as pesticides and other environmental pollutants. Hence a brief investigation for the antioxidative protection of flavonoids against pesticide intoxication in vivo was of much interest.</p>
<p>Celery, which belongs to Umbelliferae family, is widely used as daily vegetable consumption in China. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the green parts of the plant because of their physiological functionalities, such as lowering cholesterol levels, anti-inflammatory activity, antimicrobial activity and anticancer activity.<sup>

</sup> In the authors’ laboratory, the flavonoids content in celery, their metabolism in vivo and their population dietary intake<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111426585">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111426585">17</xref>
</sup> have been studied. Therefore, the present study was designed with an aim to carry out an investigation to find out the protective role of the antioxidative components present in celery against the adverse effects of DIC in vivo, based on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme profiles in rats.</p>

</sup> rats, weighing 180–220 g, were provided by Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Limited Company (Beijing, China). They were housed under sterile conditions in wire cages in a room maintained at 22°C with 12-hour light–dark cycles. The rats had free access to food and distilled drinking water during the experiment. They were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. The study protocol was approved by the animal ethical committee of Harbin Medical University.</p>
<p>After 7 days of acclimation, animals were weighed and randomly allotted to four groups (8 animals in each group) such that all groups had similar average initial body weights, namely control group (Group A), DIC-treated group (Group B), flavonoid extracts group (Group C) and DIC + flavonoid extracts group (Group D). Group A animals received a basal diet, AIN 93M, including cornstarch, casein, maltodextrin, sucrose, soybean oil, fiber, mineral mix, vitamin mix, L-cystine, choline bitartrate and tert-butylhydroquinone. Diets of both groups C and D contained 5% flavonoid extracts. DIC was dissolved in distilled drinking water. Animals of groups B and D were given DIC through intragastric administration (namely by gavage) at a dosage of 7.2 mg/kg body weight·(bw)/day, namely three times of no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). The NOAEL was obtained after a 2-year study of toxicity and carcinogenicity, which was from 1993 Toxicity Assessment of DIC Residues in food, Chemical Safety Information from Intergovernmental Organizations (INCHEM), the WHO/FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR). Animals were exposed to the regimens once daily for a period of 4 weeks. Every week, we evaluated the weight changes in rats of the four groups. At the end of the treatment period, rats were fasted for 12 hours. Then, the animals were killed with 1% of sodium pentobarbital anesthesia and livers were obtained and stored at –−80°C for further analysis, and all analyses were completed within 3 months of storing samples as the enzymes were stable for this period.</p>

<title>Enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities</title>
<p>The tissues were comminuting using liquid nitrogen. The activities of SOD, GPx, CAT and GST and MDA content in liver were analyzed by assay kits. The activity of SOD was determined by the method of xanthine oxidase. GPx was assayed using the method of 5,5′dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. GST was assayed using the method of 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene. CAT activity was measured spectrophotometrically and expressed as U/mg protein, by the reduction rate of hydrogen peroxide. Concentrations of the lipid peroxidation product, MDA, in hepatic homogenates were determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay based on the reaction of MDA with thiobarbituric acid to produce a complex that can be determined spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometer wavelength of SOD, GPx, CAT and GST and MDA were 550 nm, 412 nm, 405 nm, 412 nm and 532 nm, respectively. The total protein in the tissue homogenates was determined by the method of Coomassie Brilliant Blue,<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Organophosphorus pesticides are neurotoxic in nature by acting as inhibitor of neuronal cholinesterase activity. The typical clinical symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning due to excessive cholinergic effects include bronchospasms, hypersecretion from cholinergic innervated glands along with cardiac disturbances caused by vagotonus and anoxia. There are numerous reported studies suggesting that organophosphorus pesticides could cause lipid peroxidation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111426585">21</xref>
</sup> Oxidative stress, thus, was presumed to be one of the possible mechanisms involved in the excitotoxic injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327111426585">22</xref>
</sup> Organophosphorus pesticides may induce oxidative stress, leading to the generation of free radicals and alterations in antioxidant or ROS scavenging enzymes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327111426585">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The antioxidant capacity of flavonoids is determined by their structure. Studies have indicated that the aglycones, including quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol, have greater antioxidant capacity than do the conjugate flavonoids, such as quercetin-3-glucoside, quercitrin and rutin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0960327111426585">24</xref>
</sup> So we detected and reported flavonoids aglycones in celery following the hydrolysis procedure, and flavonoids extracts from celery were added to the experimental diets because of their greater antioxidant capacity.</p>
<p>SOD, CAT and GPx have been used as markers in detecting the level of oxidative stress in tissues and as major free radical scavengers that protect the biological system from the deleterious effects of harmful toxicants like the pesticides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0960327111426585">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327111426585">26</xref>
</sup> They serve as the primary antioxidant defensive mechanism in the body. Their concentrations are altered rapidly in the body during xenobiotic insults, resulting in their increase or decrease in the body tissues or blood. Lipid peroxidation has also been suggested as one of the major molecular mechanisms in case of pesticide induction and serves as a potent marker of oxidative stress induced by pesticide toxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327111426585">26</xref>
</sup> Liver is the main organ where most of the metabolisms take place and also the detoxification of various toxic materials or their metabolites. Conjugation of enzymatic moieties to harmful molecules is a well-known pathway of removal of toxic materials from the system. In this study, we chose SOD, CAT, GPx, GST and MDA as important biomarkers to investigate the protective role of the antioxidative components present in celery extracts against the adverse effects of DIC in vivo, based on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme profiles in rats.</p>
<p>In the present study, DIC exposure (7.2 mg/kg·bw/day) for 4 weeks showed no obvious detrimental effect on the growth curve of animals, as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0960327111426585">Figure 2</xref>. No significant loss in weight gain may be attributed to the low level of DIC administration in rats and the short-term exposure to DIC. This finding contradicted those reported by Geetu et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0960327111426585">27</xref>
</sup> who recorded weight loss following 8 weeks of subchronic DIC exposure (6 mg/kg.bw/day) in rats, which is attributed to impairment of cellular metabolism by the organophosphate compound.</p>
<p>SOD plays an important role in the dismutation of superoxide radicals to form hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen and acts as the first line of defense.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0960327111426585">28</xref>
</sup> CAT in turn converts the peroxide into molecular oxygen and water, thus nullifying the pro-oxidative effect of the free radicals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0960327111426585">29</xref>
</sup> However, the presence of superoxide radicals inhibits the activity of CAT. Singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals also affect SOD and CAT activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0960327111426585">30</xref>
</sup> In some studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0960327111426585">31</xref>
</sup>, SOD and CAT activities were found to be increased; and in other studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0960327111426585">32</xref>
</sup> the activities of these enzymes were found to be decreased. In addition, previous studies have been reported that the modulation of SOD activity by pesticides is variable with low doses of some pesticides not altering, but higher doses increasing the activity in the liver and other tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111426585">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111426585">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0960327111426585">33</xref>
</sup> In the present study, on one hand, the free radical production as an outcome of oxidative stress caused by DIC have reduced the activities of SOD and CAT. On the other hand, a dose of flavonoid extracts to rats have restored their activities, which may be a result of scavenging intracellular free radical oxygen accumulation. These results revealed that flavonoids could prevent oxidative stress induced by DIC through an increase in SOD and CAT.</p>
<p>GPx is an antioxidant seleno-enzyme (found in most tissues) that reduces hydrogen peroxide and alkyl peroxide in tissues and uses glutathione as an essential redox substrate. Previous studies have shown that GPx activity was influenced by pesticide exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0960327111426585">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0960327111426585">35</xref>
</sup> In this study, we found that DIC increased the liver GPx activity in rats, as many researches have reported that low-level organophosphates, including chlorpyrifos-ethyl, appear to increase the activity of GPx in the liver after exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111426585">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0960327111426585">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0960327111426585">37</xref>
</sup> Meanwhile, in our study, flavonoid extracts from celery reduced the elevated GPx activity induced by DIC exposure, due to the greater utilization of glutathione for detoxification of electrophiles and free radicals produced by the flavonoids and their metabolites.</p>
<p>GST is a key enzyme in glutathione-binding reaction. The major function of GST is to catalyze the harmful endogenous substances or foreign electrophilic group and couple with thiol of reduced glutathione, so as to achieve detoxification. Glutathione, a thiol tripeptide, is the most important endogenous antioxidant and is responsible for maintaining the cellular redox state along with smaller thiols such as thioredoxin, glutaredoxin and peroxiredoxin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0960327111426585">38</xref>
</sup> The major function of glutathione is to scavenge intracellular free radicals and peroxides under normal conditions. The results in the present study also showed that GST activity in DIC-treated rats was decreased because of DIC exposure. Moreover, flavonoid extracts reduced the effect of DIC on liver’s GST activity. These results revealed that DIC-induced oxidative damage can be prevented by flavonoids. However, according to Moskaug et al.,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0960327111426585">38</xref>
</sup> in vivo feeding experiments with flavonoid-rich diets do not uniformly induce the enzyme.</p>
<p>In this study, the peroxidation levels in the liver were significantly increased as detected by the high levels of MDA with DIC exposure. Moreover, in our study, low levels of lipid peroxidation in rats treated with the flavonoid extracts and the DIC + flavonoid extracts confirm that damages related to free radical attacks and oxidative stress in systems induced by DIC can be prevented by diet flavonoids.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that exposure to DIC could induce oxidative stress. However, dietary supplementation with flavonoid extracts (quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol and apigenin) could improve the harmful effects of DIC by inhibiting the production of free radicals and by altering the enzyme and nonenzyme levels in their bodies to a good extent. These results indicate that flavonoids like apigenin, quercetin, etc. could prevent oxidative stress induced by DIC through a reduction in GPx and MDA and an increase in SOD, CAT and GST. In relation to public health, when there is a possibility of pesticide contamination through our diet, the inclusion of such flavonoids in the diet is strongly suggested.</p>
