<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the relationship among lack of self-control, academic ability, and academic performance for a cohort of freshman engineering students who were, with a few exceptions, extremely high achievers in high school. Structural equation modeling analysis led to the conclusion that lack of self-control in high school, as measured by the frequency of illegal and irresponsible behaviors, had an inverse relationship with first semester grade point average (GPA), whereas academic ability, as measured by ACT scores, had a positive relationship with college GPA. The correlation between the residual error for one of the indicators of self-control, homework behaviors in high school, and the residual error for first semester GPA was also significant. Research on the relationships between self-control, homework behaviors in high school, and performance in college should continue; meanwhile, parents and teachers would be advised to emphasize the importance of developing self-control and positive homework behaviors in academically advanced high school students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A drop in grades freshman year in college can be a shock to the ego and self-esteem of students who have always achieved high grades and for whom high academic performance has contributed to their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X13482466">Seymour &amp; Hewitt, 1997</xref>). There are numerous hypothesized causes for the drop in grade point average (GPA) between high school and college such as lack of preparation, poor time management, and low motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X13482466">Balduf, 2009</xref>). This study sought to add to the understanding of factors that affect first semester college GPA, specifically for a group of students who in the past had high academic performance and who were enrolled in a challenging curriculum in college. Once these factors are identified, the K-12 and postsecondary systems, parents and college students themselves should be able to make more informed decisions and adjustments that could contribute to a higher likelihood of success for individuals choosing to study engineering or other highly challenging majors.</p>
<sec id="section2-1932202X13482466">
<title>Why Is GPA Important?</title>
<p>GPA is important to students for concrete as well as abstract reasons. Two concrete reasons are the potential loss of a scholarship and the possibility of academic probation. Many scholarships such as Georgia’s Hope Scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X13482466">Georiga’s Student Finance Commission, 2012</xref>), South Carolina’s Life Scholarships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X13482466">Mobley, Brawner, &amp; Ohland, 2009</xref>), and Florida’s Academic Scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1932202X13482466">Zhang, Min, Frillman, Anderson, &amp; Ohland, 2006</xref>) require students to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA to keep their scholarship. According to national results from the 2011 Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) Freshman Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X13482466">Higher Education Research Institution, 2010</xref>), 26.5% of all college freshmen who completed the survey specified they had scholarships of over US$10,000 and 69.5% of the freshman class had some form of grant or scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X13482466">Pryor, Hurtado, Saenz, Santos, &amp; Korn, 2007</xref>). In the cohort in the current study, 25% of students self-reported they had full scholarships and 56% indicated they had partial scholarships. Their scholarships were awarded from a variety of organizations within the university as well as from outside organizations. The majority of the scholarships had a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0, but some allowed students who fell below a 3.0 to petition to keep their scholarship. It is estimated, based on their 1st year GPA, that 31% of the students with full scholarships and 50% with partial scholarships subsequently lost their scholarships due to not meeting the minimum GPA requirement.</p>
<p>Keeping a certain GPA is also important to stay off academic probation. College students at most universities must maintain a GPA of 2.0 or above to stay in good academic standing. In this study, 17% of the students were either on academic probation or had received an academic warning at the end of their 1st year.</p>
<p>GPA can also be important when looking for a job. In the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2011 survey, 77% of employers reported they screen college students’ job applications based on GPA. Sixty-four percent of those who screened said they used 3.0 as a minimum GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X13482466">NACE, 2010</xref>). At the end of the 1st year, 45% of the students in this study had a GPA of less than a 3.0.</p>
<p>However, most importantly, for some students, grades help define their self-worth. A drop in grades can be devastating and can lead students to switch out of challenging disciplines such as engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X13482466">Seymour &amp; Hewitt, 1997</xref>). This is demonstrated in the quotes below taken from a well-referenced, multi-institutional ethnographic study (<italic>n</italic> = 335) that investigated why students who were expected to be successful based on their math SAT scores switched from science, engineering, and math majors (55% of participants) whereas others did not (45% of participants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X13482466">Seymour &amp; Hewitt, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>By my second mid-term I was still pulling around the mean—which is okay—even pretty good. But I was still a B− or C+, which is horrible for someone who does well in high school and is accepted into a school as good as this. I mean, I never got a B until I got to college. It was very discouraging. (Female Asian American engineering switcher; p. 108)</p>
<p>A lot of people let their self-esteem get caught up in their grades. So when their grades are going down they are pretty miserable. (Female White engineering switcher; p. 109)</p>
<p>I was always at the top of my class in high school for math and science, but when I got into college science class, I was only getting mediocre grades. I think that was the biggest problem. I could do the work okay, but I did not feel comfortable being in the middle after always being at the top. (Male White science switcher; p. 108)</p>

<title>Past Studies Predicting GPA in Engineering Students</title>
<p>Research trying to predict GPA of engineering students has included a variety of variables. Most studies include a measure of ability such as ACT/SAT scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1932202X13482466">Ting, 2001</xref>), high school GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X13482466">Jin, Imbrie, &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>), high school rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X13482466">French, Immekus, &amp; Oakes, 2005</xref>), and/or scores on subject-specific tests or classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X13482466">DeWinter &amp; Dodou, 2011</xref>). In all the studies reviewed that included measure(s) of academic ability as predictors of college GPA, at least one measure was statistically significant. When more than one ability measure was included in the analysis, the statistical significance of the variables was not consistent. This was most likely due to the multicollinearity of these variables.</p>
<p>Other variables not related to ability have also been included in models with mixed results of significance. For example, some studies have shown a nonsignificant relationship between performance and measures of self-confidence or efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X13482466">Besterfeld-Sacre, Atman, &amp; Shuman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X13482466">Jin et al., 2011</xref>), whereas other studies have found these relationships to be significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1932202X13482466">Vogt, 2008</xref>). The same is true with measures of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X13482466">French et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X13482466">Jin et al., 2011</xref>), leadership experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X13482466">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1932202X13482466">Ting, 2001</xref>), and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X13482466">Cummings &amp; Knott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X13482466">DeWinter &amp; Dodou, 2011</xref>). Some studies have found the relationship between performance and certain reasons a student chose to study engineering to be significant, such as choosing engineering for financial reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X13482466">Besterfeld-Sacre et al., 1997</xref>) or genuine versus superficial reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X13482466">Levin &amp; Wyckoff, 1988</xref>). Meanwhile, other reasons such as parental influence have not been found to be significantly related to performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X13482466">Besterfeld-Sacre et al., 1997</xref>). The inconsistency of the results could be due to the way the variables were measured, the other variables that were included in the model, or the inherent differences in the samples.</p>
<p>Other variables that have been shown to have a significant relationship to academic performance of engineering students include interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X13482466">Besterfeld-Sacre et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X13482466">Levin &amp; Wyckoff, 1988</xref>), learning style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X13482466">Bernold, Spurlin, &amp; Anson, 2007</xref>), and personality type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X13482466">Felder, Felder, &amp; Dietz, 2002</xref>). Not enough research has been completed on these factors to determine the strength of the relationship across samples.</p>
<p>Although research exists that shows a relationship between self-control and GPA for students from the general college population, none of the studies we located had targeted college students who were high-achieving high school students, such as those found enrolled in engineering. Self-control might be a critical issue for students who showed high academic ability, some of whom did not have to put forth much effort in high school to receive high grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X13482466">Balduf, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1932202X13482466">
<title>Self-Control</title>
<p>Research has identified a relationship between self-control and many factors important to health, success, and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004</xref>), and between lack of self-control and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1932202X13482466">Goldfried &amp; Merbaum, 1973</xref>). Most important to this study, self-control has been related to academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X13482466">Duckworth, Quinn, &amp; Tsukayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney and colleagues (2004)</xref> hypothesized that students with higher self-control should have better grades due to making more appropriate choices between studying and other activities, using study time wisely, and keeping emotional distractions from interfering with performance. Multiple studies using various measures of self-control have investigated the effect of self-control on academic performance at various levels of schooling.</p>
<p>Empirical studies of students in eighth grade have shown that self-control had a statistically significant relationship with GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X13482466">Duckworth &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X13482466">Hofer, Kuhnle, Kilian, &amp; Fries, 2012</xref>). In both of these studies, self-control explained more variability in GPA than did measures of cognitive ability, and cognitive ability explained more variability in standardized test scores then did self-control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X13482466">Duckworth et al. (2012)</xref> also showed a small but statistically significant relationship between change in self-control and the change in GPA among students in fifth through eighth grade (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Studies have also been completed with college students who were either part of the college’s psychology test pool or who were taking an introductory psychology course. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1932202X13482466">Wolfe and Johnson’s (1995)</xref> analysis showed that after accounting for high school GPA, self-control accounted for more variability in college GPA (9%) than did any of the other 32 personality traits considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney and colleagues (2004)</xref> showed a positive correlation between grades and self-control, where self-control was measured by multiple self-reported surveys.</p>
<p>These studies focused on a definition of self-control as the “voluntary self-governance in the service of personally valued goals and standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X13482466">Duckworth &amp; Kern, 2011</xref>, p. 260). Thus, their starting assumption was that people have goals, intentions, and values that they try to realize through their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X13482466">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998</xref>). Central to this view of self-control is one’s ability to override, interrupt, or abstain from acting on an inner response that does not contribute to meeting a personal goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney et al., 2004</xref>), or when faced with a decision between two personal goals, to choose actions to meet the more important goal.</p>
<p>An alternative way to look at self-control is through signs of a lack of self-control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X13482466">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1998)</xref> characterize people who lack self-control as being more concerned with easy gratification and more likely to engage in risky behavior, to pursue immediate pleasure, to smoke and drink, and to lack diligence and persistence. Their work centered on the relationship between crime and self-control, but it also can add insights to the prediction of academic performance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X13482466">Rachlin (1974)</xref>, the causes of behaviors considered self-control and those considered to show a lack of self-control “differ in degrees of temporal extent, not in their place of origin” (p. 100). The ability to view behaviors that are illegal or irresponsible as representing lack of self-control is valuable for the age group in this study, as high school seniors might not know what their goals are or might have conflicting goals. Thus, focusing on goal attainment alone might be misleading.</p>

<sec id="section5-1932202X13482466">
<title>Academic Ability</title>
<p>Using standardized entrance exams as a measure of academic ability is well established, as they are effective predictors of college performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X13482466">Kuncel &amp; Hezlett, 2010</xref>). ACT or SAT scores are commonly supplied on college applications and are easily extracted from computer files for use in research. This study used ACT test scores. The ACT Math section is a measure of reasoning skills to solve practical problems in mathematics. The math knowledge tested includes pre-, elementary, and intermediate algebra; coordinate and plane geometry; and trigonometry. The English section of the ACT test measures usage and rhetorical skills. The Reading section tests comprehension and use of referring and reasoning skills. Finally, the Science section tests skills in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X13482466">ACT, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Question</title>
<p>Although research investigating the relationship among self-control, academic ability, and academic performance has been completed, we were unable to locate studies that looked at these specific variables for a group of students who were high achievers in high school and who had selected a demanding curriculum in college. Some literature addresses differences in the relationship between certain variables and performance of engineering students and nonengineering students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1932202X13482466">Veenstra, Dey, &amp; Herrin, 2008</xref>). Due to the demands of the engineering curriculum, we hypothesized that lack of self-control in high school might have a strong negative relationship with college GPA. Therefore, this study focused on the following research question:</p>
<list id="list1-1932202X13482466" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Do academic ability, as measured by ACT scores, and lack of self-control in high school, as measured by frequency of illegal and irresponsible behaviors, have a significant relationship with first semester college GPA earned by a cohort of students studying engineering?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Answering this had the potential to help students who had good academic results in high school to continue to perform well in engineering school and to meet their academic goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1932202X13482466" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-1932202X13482466">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants in this study were first time, full-time engineering students from the 2010 engineering cohort at one medium-sized, urban, engineering school accredited by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET). The students, with a few exceptions, had performed extremely well in high school. Thirty-seven percent of the cohort had a GPA of 4.0 or above, only 3% had a GPA less than 3.0, and more than 60% entered college with college credit. After 1 year in engineering school, only 1.9% of the students had a 4.0 and 49.5% had a GPA of less than 3.0.</p>
<p>The cohort consisted of 321 students, of whom 279 (87%) were represented in this study. The final data set included 45 females (16%) and 234 males (84%). The sample was overwhelmingly Caucasian (88% Caucasian, 4.3% Hispanic or Latino, and less than 3% Asian, African American, two or more races, or nonresident alien). The majority (98%) came straight from high school, whereas 2% had been out of high school for 1 year. The sample was representative of the freshman 2010 cohort, which was 87.5% Caucasian, 16% female, and 97% of whom had graduated high school the spring before starting college.</p>
<p>The 42 students not included in the analysis had an average first semester college GPA of 2.71 (<italic>SD</italic> = .858), which was not statistically different from the average first semester GPA for students included in the study (<italic>t</italic> = 1.345, <italic>p</italic> = .180). Twenty-five students were excluded because they did not take the CIRP Freshman Survey; 13 more were excluded because they submitted SAT scores instead of ACT scores. The remaining excluded students had completed the CIRP Freshman Survey but did not answer the specific questions used in this study. Due to the high inclusion rate, the sample being representative of the entire cohort, and similar first semester GPAs of students included and excluded from the study, most likely the exclusion of these students did not have an impact on the results of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1932202X13482466">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was performed under university institutional review. We analyzed de-identified secondary data from the CIRP Freshman Survey and data from student records to determine whether a relationship existed among lack of self-control, academic ability, and academic performance for the 2010 cohort of engineering students. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was chosen as the statistical technique in this study due to the multicollinearity among the indicators.</p>
<p>The two-step modeling approach recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X13482466">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref> was used to test the hypothesized model. The first step was to evaluate the measurement model and to make re-specifications before evaluating the structural model. The analysis was performed using MPlus Version 6.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X13482466">Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2012</xref>). The method of weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustments (WLSMV) was used because the data were categorical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1932202X13482466">
<title>Indicators of Constructs and Source of Data</title>
<p>In this study, the constructs were lack of self-control (LACK_SC) and academic ability (ACAD_ABILITY). Because studies have shown a significant relationship between self-control and GPA for students in K-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X13482466">Duckworth &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X13482466">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>), high school GPA was not used as an indicator of academic ability. Instead, ACT Math, Science, Reading, and English tests scores, which have not been shown to have a significant relationship with self-control, were used to measure academic ability. The variability in ACT scores was also greater than the variability in high school GPA. The greater variability helps meet the assumptions of the statistical procedures used. Students’ ACT scores were extracted from student records.</p>
<p>Self-control is a complex construct, and within the literature, more than 100 unique measures of self-control can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X13482466">Duckworth &amp; Kern, 2011</xref>). Rather than administer an instrument that measured self-control, we chose to use the frequency of past behaviors that indicated lack of self-control. Specifically, we used responses to the following questions from the CIRP Freshman Survey that the students completed during freshman orientation the summer before they started college.</p>
<p>Indicate which activities you did during the past year (1 = <italic>Not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>Occasionally</italic>, 3 = <italic>Frequently</italic>).</p>
<list id="list2-1932202X13482466" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Smoked cigarettes (SMOKE)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Drank beer (DRANK)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fell asleep in class (SLEEP)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Failed to complete your homework on time (NO_HW).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These behaviors are either illegal or irresponsible for high school students who are planning to go to college to study a demanding discipline. Using these indicators also had the advantage that they were collected on the CIRP Freshman Survey, which has been administered for more than 40 years by the Higher Education Research Institute at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to freshman at hundreds of colleges and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X13482466">Higher Education Research Institution, 2010</xref>). The participation rate on the survey for the 2010 engineering cohort was 92% (<italic>n</italic> = 296), although not all questions were completed by all students who took the survey.</p>
<p>The residual error of NO_HW was allowed to correlate with the residual error of FIRST_GPA based on research that has shown a relationship between homework and academic performance in high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X13482466">Cooper, 2007</xref>). If this research is correct, students who complete homework should have a better understanding of subject matter and this should help them perform better in future classes. In fact, we were unable to find prior research relating homework completion in 1 year with performance in subsequent years. Finally, LACK_SC and ACAD_ABILITY were allowed to correlate because they forecasted the same outcome variable. Based on research that has shown a nonsignificant relationship between self-control and standardized grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X13482466">Duckworth &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X13482466">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>), we did not expect this correlation to be significant. The hypothesized model is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1932202X13482466">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

All of the correlations between indicators and their constructs were significant, although some were lower than desired, which is a concern for convergent validity. None of the indicators of LACK _SC had a significant correlation with indicators of ACAD_ABILITY, thus there were no concerns about discriminant validity. Of the indicators of LACK_SC, NO_HW had the strongest correlation with FIRST_GPA, but had some low correlations with other indicators of LACK_SC. Overall, the two strongest correlations between indicators and FIRST_GPA were with ACT Math (<italic>r</italic> = .428, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and ACT Reading (<italic>r</italic> = .436, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Past studies using different instruments measuring self-control have shown a relationship between self-control and GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X13482466">Duckworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X13482466">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X13482466">Tangney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1932202X13482466">Wolfe &amp; Johnson, 1995</xref>). This study did not verify the results of these previous studies, instead it complemented them. This study was not only different in that it looked at indicators of lack of self-control but also in that it investigated the relationship of behaviors in high school to college performance. A lack of self-control in high school, as measured by illegal and irresponsible behavior, had a negative relationship with first semester GPA for a group of students, nearly all of whom had achieved high GPAs in high school. The cause of this relationship is not known, but future research might be able to determine whether students who more frequently were engaged in illegal or irresponsible behaviors in high school did so in college as well. This might be expected because most students are exposed to more temptations and have more freedom to make their own decisions in college.</p>
<p>In addition to being an indicator of lack of self-control, the remaining variability in homework completion rate helped explain variability in the first semester GPA after accounting for self-control and academic ability. The results support studies that have shown a relationship between completing homework and developing self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X13482466">Bembenutty, 2011</xref>), and between doing homework and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X13482466">Cooper, 2007</xref>). Future research could determine whether this can be explained by students who complete their homework retaining information longer than students who do not completed their homework, or if students who develop a habit of not doing homework in high school continue this habit in college.</p>
<p>The nonsignificant relationship between lack of self-control and ACT scores complements results from studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X13482466">Duckworth and Seligman (2005)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X13482466">Hofer and colleagues (2012)</xref> that showed a nonsignificant relationship between self-control and standardized tests. This has implication for colleges when selecting students and professors, as one cannot assume that students who have high-standardized test scores also have high self-control.</p>
<p>Although only correlational, the results of this study support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X13482466">Bembenutty’s (2011)</xref> call for teachers to instill in their students the value of completing homework and the importance of delaying gratification. Because all but a few of the students in this study had performed well in high school, the results specifically point to the importance of developing self-control and a habit of doing homework for bright students who generally might not need to put forth much effort or complete homework to maintain good grades in high school. This is demonstrated in the words of a male student in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X13482466">Seymour and Hewitt (1997)</xref> who switched out of engineering:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was young, I was in all these “talented and gifted” classes. I used to be impressed by it, but I’m not any more. I never opened a book in high school—my father says he didn’t either. After class, we went home, played basketball, ate dinner and screwed around. I probably never did any homework. My teachers didn’t like it that I didn’t work, but I kept scoring high on the tests, so they couldn’t say anything to my dad. And I still came out of high school with a 3.7 and over 700 in math SAT. Six years later I’m still learning how to study. (p. 85)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because the students in this study were all studying engineering, the results might also be useful to students who are considering other challenging curriculums. Students who have demonstrated a lack of self-control might want to think twice about pursuing a challenging curriculum, or might benefit from being made aware that they need to consider changing their behaviors while in high school or before attending college. College professors should not assume that all students are in the habit of doing homework, even if their grades in high school were high.</p>
<sec id="section15-1932202X13482466">
<title>Limitations and Threats to Validity</title>
<p>In this study, the indicators of LACK_SC were limited to questions answered in the CIRP Freshman Survey. Threats to validity exist with all self-reported surveys. Some of the indicator loadings were lower than the high standard of .7 recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X13482466">Kline (2011)</xref> to ensure construct validity. There might be some questions as to whether the indicators were all measuring the same construct. For example, only 27% of the variability in NO_HW is explained by the construct of LACK_SC. This seems reasonable as there are other reasons for not doing homework, such as not understanding the content or not having time due to jobs and extracurricular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1932202X13482466">Xu, 2011</xref>). As previously mentioned, although some of the fit statistics showed good fit, the χ<sup>2</sup> test did not. The χ<sup>2</sup> statistic is used to test whether the observed and predicted covariance matrices are statistically equivalent. A low fit would lead to lack of confidence in the estimates in the model. The accuracy of the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic is impacted by nonnormality of the data and the sample size. Because the indicators of LACK_SC were highly skewed, the sample size was greater than 200, and the other fit statistics show good fit, we nonetheless have confidence in the model.</p>
<p>The participants in this study were all freshman engineering students from a single university; these students represented 13% of the university’s freshmen. The authors believe the results would be applicable to other engineering programs with traditional students who attend college within a year of graduating from high school. The results might also be applicable to other demanding majors.</p>
<p>The relationship between self-control and homework was unidirectional. There is some evidence that this could be bidirectional, that is, doing homework helps develop self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X13482466">Cooper, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1932202X13482466">Ramdass &amp; Zimmerman, 2011</xref>) and students with self-control are more likely to do their homework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X13482466">Hofer et al., 2007</xref>). This relationship could be developed in future research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Thirty-six percent of the variability in first semester GPA was explained in the hypothesized model. As with all nonexperimental designs, the design of this study is not adequate to conclude that first semester GPA is caused by academic ability and lack of self-control, but as more studies show a relationship between self-control or lack of self-control and academic performance, it is becoming apparent that this is an important trait for students to be successful academically. These results do warrant further investigation using other instruments that measure self-control. They also indicate a need for greater emphasis on the value of completing homework and staying away from illegal and irresponsible behaviors, for high-achieving students who plan to pursue challenging curriculums in college. K-12 teachers and parents who focus only on raising the academic ability of their children are, according to this study, missing a component that can quickly offset the gains in academic ability.</p>
