<abstract>
<p>A number of studies involving staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities have utilised equity theory as a theoretical framework. According to this theory, people evaluate social relationships through the comparison of inputs and outcomes, respectively, with what a person brings to and receives from a relationship. Little is known about what constitute inputs and outcomes for staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 staff to find out what constitute inputs and outcomes for staff who work with people with intellectual disabilities. The interviews were conducted in the first half of 2008 in the United Kingdom. Data were analysed using template analysis. A wide range of inputs and outcomes was identified by staff, which were grouped under high-level themes relating to relationships with their employers, their co-workers and the service users. The utility of the findings, in terms of informing future research, is discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A small number of studies involving staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities have utilised equity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512466793">Adams, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744629512466793">Walster et al., 1973</xref>) as a theoretical framework (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744629512466793">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512466793">Van Yperen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512466793">Van Yperen et al., 1992</xref>). According to this theory, individuals evaluate their social relationships by comparing their perceived ratio of outcomes to inputs to the corresponding ratio of a comparison other. Inputs and outcomes are defined, respectively, as what an individual perceives they give to and receive from a particular social relationship. Within the work context, examples of inputs include age, education, skills, personal appearance, experience and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512466793">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512466793">Kreitner et al., 1999</xref>). Outcomes can have either positive or negative valance (outcomes that are sought after or avoided, respectively). Within the work context, examples of outcomes include pay, status symbols, fringe benefits, monotony and job security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512466793">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512466793">Kreitner et al., 1999</xref>). Individuals perceive a relationship to be inequitable, or unfair, when they perceive a mismatch between their own and their comparison other’s input/outcome ratio. When an individual perceives a relationship to be inequitable, they experience distress and are motivated to restore equity. Equity can be restored in a number of ways, for example, the individual may attempt to alter their own, or their comparison other’s, inputs and outcomes or they may leave the field (i.e. by permanently or temporarily leaving the job).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a number of studies have investigated the equity perceptions of staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. This line of research has been conducted, predominantly, by researchers from the Netherlands (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose (2010</xref>) for a study conducted in the United Kingdom). The findings from this body of research suggest that relatively large numbers of staff in services for people with intellectual disabilities perceive their work-based relationships to be inequitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512466793">Van Yperen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512466793">Van Yperen et al., 1992</xref>). These studies have also found that when compared with staff who perceive their work-based relationships to be equitable, staff who perceive their work-based relationships to be inequitable experience higher levels of burnout (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512466793">Van Yperen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512466793">Van Yperen et al., 1992</xref>) and are more likely to express the intention to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512466793">Van Yperen, 1995</xref>). Research has also found that an intervention programme utilising the principles of equity theory had a positive impact on the well-being (level of burnout) and behaviour (length of absence duration) of staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al., 1998</xref>). The programme adopted a number of strategies in order to reduce staff perceptions of inequity including changing the actual inputs and outcomes of staff and changing staff perceptions of specific inputs and/or outcomes (for a more detailed review of this literature see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512466793">Disley et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of recent discussions on staffing issues in services for people with intellectual disabilities have highlighted the need for further research on equity theory and staff equity perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512466793">Devereux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512466793">Disley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744629512466793">Skirrow and Hatton, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512466793">Disley et al. (2009</xref>), for example, suggested that equity theory may have some utility as a theoretical framework for integrating various strands of research on staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. The same authors also suggested that the attempts of staff to restore equity in their work-based relationships might impact upon service delivery, service goals and the quality of life of service users.</p>
<p>Within the context of services for people with intellectual disabilities, we have no clear, or accurate, idea of what inputs and outcomes are relevant to staff. Previous research investigating the equity perceptions of staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities has used global measures of equity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512466793">Van Yperen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al., 1996</xref>) and specific measures of equity that have been developed for other occupational groupings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>). By their very nature, the items in global measures of equity do not provide information on specific inputs and outcomes. The measures developed for other occupational groupings may either contain items that are not relevant to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities and/or fail to contain items that are relevant to them. With regard to the intervention programme developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744629512466793">Van Dierendonck et al. (1998</xref>), the authors provide few details about which specific inputs and outcomes were altered. A variety of sources have provided listings of potential inputs and outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512466793">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512466793">Kreitner et al., 1999</xref>). As with the measures of equity developed for other occupational groupings, the listing may contain items that are not relevant to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities and/or fail to contain items that are relevant to them. The present exploratory study aims to find out what constitute inputs and outcomes to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. This information will have utility in terms of generating ideas for future research on equity theory and in developing interventions to improve staff well-being.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1744629512466793">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This article forms part of larger qualitative study investigating various aspects of equity theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512466793">Disley, 2011</xref>). Space limitations, however, mean that this article will only focus upon the data relating to staff inputs and outcomes. The study utilised a purposive sampling strategy in order to gather information from as broad a range of staff as possible (i.e. in terms of job role, experience and location). Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data. Ethical approval for the study was sought, and obtained, from an NHS Local Research Ethics Committee. Research governance approval was received from the participating NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1744629512466793">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 15 staff from services for people with intellectual disabilities were interviewed. Participant numbers were determined by data saturation. All the participants came from one county in the United Kingdom. The participants worked in specialist, domiciliary, residential and community support services for adults with intellectual disabilities and came from a NHS Foundation Trust (participants (P) 1–8) and an independent service provider (P9–P15). Of all, 4 of the participants were males (P4, P6, P11 and P12). The participants came from a range of occupational roles including health professionals specialising in intellectual disabilities (e.g. nurses and occupational therapists, P1, P3–P5 and P7), managers/team leaders (P2, P9 and P11) and support workers (P6, P8, P10 and P12–P15). The mean age of the sample was 45 years (range: 35–60 years). The mean length of time participants had been working in their current posts, working for their current employer and working in services for people with intellectual disabilities were 5 years and 9 months (range: 3 months to 16 years), 10 years and 11 months (range: 1 year and 6 months to 27 years and 2 months) and 12 years and 3 months (range: 1 year and 6 months to 27 years and 2 months), respectively. Compared with previous studies on staff in UK services for people with intellectual disabilities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512466793">Hatton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>), the staff in the current study were slightly older and had longer tenure working in their current posts, working for their current employer and working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. The percentage of males to females in the current study, however, was similar to the percentage found in previous studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1744629512466793">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were identified by their employers and were approached and recruited by letter. The interviews were conducted between January 2008 and June 2008 by the first author and took place in private rooms in public locations that were easily accessible to the participants. On average, the interviews lasted 32 minutes (range: 17 minutes to 68 minutes). Participants were asked ‘What, if anything, do you bring to your job?’ (staff inputs) and ‘What, if anything, do you get from your job?’ (staff outcomes). If the participant struggled to answer the questions, a series of prompts were used. Specifically, participants struggling with the inputs question were asked about what their employer, their co-workers and the service users got from them. Participants struggling with the outcomes question were asked about what they got from their employer, their co-workers and the service users. All of the interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744629512466793">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data analysis was conducted by the first author using the template analysis method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512466793">King (1998</xref>). The decision to use template analysis was based primarily on its suitability and efficiency. Template analysis is suitable for analysing qualitative data relating to the perspectives of individuals. The approach permits the use of a priori themes. This allows researchers to focus on specific theoretical considerations and questions pertinent to the research, while still providing enough freedom to allow additional codes to emerge from the data. Compared with many other approaches for analysing qualitative data, such as interpretive phenomenological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744629512466793">Smith et al., 1999</xref>), template analysis is better able to handle relatively large data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512466793">King, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, the higher level themes in the template were developed a priori. Specifically, all the level 1, highest-order, themes were derived from the major research questions in the interview guide. These themes were related to staff ‘inputs’ and ‘outcomes’. The lower level (level 2) a priori themes relating to both staff ‘inputs’ and ‘outcomes’ were derived from the prompts used in the interview guide (which in turn had been derived from research on staff equity perceptions). Specifically, these themes were concerned with specific work-based relationships (i.e. relationships with employers, co-workers and service users). The lowest level (level 3) themes in the template were developed by placing segments of text together that used the same or similar words and, where possible, by combining text groupings that appeared to be connected. The text groupings were then labelled. To check the quality of the analysis, the second author independently assigned codes to each segment of text identified across all the transcripts, using the final version of the template. Differences regarding coding were resolved through discussion.</p>

<title>Inputs</title>
<sec id="section9-1744629512466793">
<title>Inputs to employers</title>
<p>For the relationship with employers, the most frequently cited inputs were related to ‘work’ and ‘learning’. For the theme ‘work’, participants frequently mentioned the effort they made and the value for money they provided. Typical responses were ‘I try one hundred percent to do my job the best I can’ (P1) and ‘I think they get quite good value for money out of me’ (P3). With regard to the theme ‘learning’, staff frequently cited the training and qualifications they possessed, the experience they had and the skills they had developed. For instance, one individual said ‘I’ve got lots of experience especially in challenging behaviour and lots of life experiences as a more mature lady’ (P5). Other themes cited concerned: the personal characteristics of the member of staff (i.e. being reliable and enthusiastic); the loyalty and commitment the member of staff showed; the people and communication skills the individual possessed; and the member of staff themselves (‘me’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1744629512466793">
<title>Inputs to co-workers</title>
<p>With regard to what their co-workers got from them, the most frequently cited input that was mentioned by staff was the support they provided. For example, one member of staff said:<disp-quote>
<p>I come and support my staff one hundred, two hundred percent. Whatever they need I will try and ensure that they get it. . . . I’ll back them. I’m behind them. That sets them free really to do better work. To do good work. That’s probably one of the most important things I think. (P9)</p>
</disp-quote>The second most frequently cited theme was related to the personal characteristics the member of staff possessed. The most frequently cited personal characteristics were being calm, having a sense of humour, being motivated, treating co-workers fairly and being trustworthy. Examples of quotes for this theme include ‘I’m quite a laid back person, I don’t really stress out a lot’ (P6) and ‘I think that most of them would say that I’m fair’ (P2). Other inputs, mentioned by smaller numbers of staff, were being a good or valuable team member and having the ability to enthuse or motivate co-workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1744629512466793">
<title>Inputs to service users</title>
<p>With regard to what the service users got from them, the most frequently cited theme was related to the help and support they gave the service users. An example quote for this theme is:<disp-quote>
<p>And hopefully I can help them. But if I can’t, I’d know who to send them to for help. Yeah, I’m supportive and I just like to think that they’ll come to me. (P12)</p>
</disp-quote>Other themes, cited by relatively large numbers of staff, were related to the personal characteristics they possessed and the way they treated the service users. Being caring and being happy and approachable were the most frequently cited personal characteristics. With regard to the treatment of service users, staff cited a wide variety of behaviours. These included having pleasant interactions with service users and providing good quality care. A typical response for this theme was ‘I always think . . . if that was my brother or a relative, or even me, would I want that for them’ (P13). Smaller numbers of staff mentioned that they acted as advocates for service users, elicited positive feelings from service users and provided friendship to the service users.</p>

<sec id="section12-1744629512466793">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section13-1744629512466793">
<title>Outcomes from employers</title>
<p>With regard to outcomes from employers, a number of themes were cited relatively frequently by staff. These themes were related to their terms and conditions, their opportunities for professional development, the support they received from their employer and the positive feelings they experienced from doing their job. Aspects of the job that made-up the first of these themes included: the pay that the staff received; the job security staff had; the pleasant and safe environment staff had to work in; the resources available to staff; and the fringe benefits staff received, such as pensions, holidays and sick leave. For instance, one participant stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the thing I get the most from my employer is job security. Our posts are very secure. You’re quite well looked after in a financial and terms and conditions sense. We get very good pensions. On the whole, they provide you with pleasant working environments that are safe and I don’t have to go down a mine and dig coal or stand out in the rain too often. (P3)</p>
</disp-quote>Less frequently cited themes were related to the encouragement staff received from their employers, the challenge staff got from their work and the negative outcomes staff experienced such as stress and scrutiny.</p>

<title>Outcomes from co-workers</title>
<p>Outcomes from co-workers that were most often cited by staff were related to the overt behaviour their co-workers displayed. The most frequently cited of these behaviours were related to the support they received and the ideas and advice they received. For example, one participant said ‘They’ll look after you, if you’ve got a problem. They’ll try to sort it out for you. Work-wise and personal-wise’ (P10). Another participant said ‘Working with colleagues, you find out about different points of view and perspectives and that’s really useful’ (P4). Other overt behaviours, cited by smaller numbers of respondents, related to the encouragement, feedback and the trust given by co-workers. Other themes that were cited less frequently concerned: the friendship and companionship provided by co-workers; the loyalty shown by co-workers; and the negative feelings elicited by co-workers. For the last theme, participants mentioned that co-workers caused ‘a lot of heartache sometimes’ and made them ‘angry’ and ‘frustrated’ (P11).</p>

<title>Outcomes from service users</title>
<p>With regard to outcomes from service users, the most frequently cited theme concerned the overt behaviours service users displayed to staff. Overt behaviours displayed by service users that were mentioned by participants included being supportive to staff, showing appreciation, showing respect and being cooperative. Typical responses for this theme included <italic>‘</italic>And yeah, the support I can sometimes get from the service users. Like I said, that arm just around the shoulder’ (P11), ‘They are generally, but not always, pleased just to see you’ (P7) and ‘….some are more cooperative than others’ (P15). Other themes that were also cited relatively frequently concerned the feedback and information staff received from service users about their own performance and that of others, and the rewards staff got from making the lives of service users’ better. Responses to this last theme emphasised the ‘pride’, ‘satisfaction’ and ‘sense of achievement’ staff got from ‘seeing service users achieve things’ (P11) and ‘helping them move on’ (P5). Less frequently cited themes concerned the emotional attachments staff formed with service users and positive feelings that staff got from working with service users. For instance, one participant said ‘I do get pleasure, pleasure in the smile on their face when they are doing something that they like doing and that’s good for them’ (P13).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this exploratory study was to find out what constitute inputs and outcomes to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. No previous studies, set within services for people with intellectual disabilities, have explicitly attempted to do this. A wide variety of inputs and outcomes were identified for a number of work-based relationships. Many of these can be linked to other strands of staff research in the literature on intellectual disabilities. For example, support, an often cited input and outcome in the current study, has been found to be linked with both staff stress and the job satisfaction of employees (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512466793">Hatton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512466793">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). Aspects of the terms and conditions of employees (e.g. pay) are often cited as reasons for leaving the job (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512466793">De Kock et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512466793">Felce et al., 1993</xref>). From the perspective of equity theory, these relationships are not unexpected, as staff perceptions about inputs and outcomes are hypothesised to impact upon staff well-being, morale and behaviour.</p>
<p>Given the large literature on equity theory, it is difficult to compile a comprehensive listing of postulated inputs and outcomes. Consequently, it is difficult to make definitive statements about how the findings from the current study compare with previous listings of inputs and outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512466793">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512466793">Kreitner et al., 1999</xref>). Bearing this in mind, it appears that there was some correspondence between the current study findings and previous listings of potential inputs and outcomes (e.g. effort, pay, job security and fringe benefits). A number of inputs and outcomes from previous listings, however, do not appear to be relevant to staff working with people with intellectual disabilities (e.g. status symbols, age and personal appearance). It also appears that the current study identified a number of inputs and outcomes, for specific work-based relationships, that have not been mentioned in previous listings (e.g. ‘Me’, ‘Negative feelings’, ‘Advocate’ and ‘Friendship’). A similar pattern appears to emerge when the findings from the current study are compared with items from the specific measures of equity that have been used in previous research on staff (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512466793">Thomas and Rose, 2010</xref>). This raises questions about using equity measures developed for other occupational groupings in research to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Within the context of services for people with intellectual disabilities, the findings from the current study can be used to inform future research on equity theory and to help develop intervention programmes to improve staff well-being. Equity theory predicts that one of the ways staff might restore equity is by adopting an input/outcome alteration strategy (i.e. amending their own, or others’, inputs and/or outcomes). By identifying the inputs and outcomes relevant to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities, the current study provides a list of variables that could potentially be influenced by staff equity perceptions. It should be pointed out, however, that many of the inputs and outcomes identified in the current study may be difficult for staff to amend. This difficulty could be attributed to a number of factors including: (a) the abstract nature of some inputs and outcomes, (b) external and internal regulatory systems preventing staff from altering specific inputs and (c) the lack of individual control over specific outcomes. The inputs and outcomes identified in the current study may also have some utility in the generation of items for a detailed measure of staff equity perceptions relevant to staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Many, but not all, of the outcomes identified in the present study could be seen to fulfil various human needs. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744629512466793">Maslowe’s (1954)</xref> hierarchy of needs as a classificatory system, the outcomes that staff derived from their interpersonal relationships (i.e. the relationships with co-workers and service users) and their relationship with their employer could, to a certain extent, be seen to compliment each other. Specifically, the majority of outcomes derived from interpersonal relationships could be seen to satisfy mid-level needs (e.g. social and esteem needs). On the other hand, the majority of outcomes derived from the relationship with employers could be seen to satisfy lower and higher level needs (e.g. physiological, safety and self-actualisation needs).</p>
<p>The majority of outcomes identified in the current study could be classified as having positive valance. It is difficult to determine whether this finding reflects the actual ‘state of affairs’ (i.e. the majority of outcomes that staff get from their work-based relationships have positive valance) or whether it can be attributed to social desirability effects and/or the wording of the interview question.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential limitations that need to be taken into account when interpreting the findings from this study. For example, a non-random sampling method was used to identify participants. Participants were drawn from a single region in the United Kingdom, were homogenous with respect to their ethnicity and tended to have relatively long tenure within services for people with intellectual disabilities. The sample in the study was also biased towards those willing to take part in the research and was relatively small in terms of numbers. Consequently, in light of these potential limitations, caution may need to be exercised when considering the generalisability of the findings from this study. Nonetheless, conclusions drawn from this study may be strengthened by the fact that there was often considerable agreement between participants about what constituted inputs and outcomes.</p>
<p>Future research could ascertain the generalisability of the findings of the current study. Research could also ascertain the relevance of specific inputs and outcomes to staff; investigate whether job title, staff demographic factors and/or service user characteristics impact upon the choice and relevance of inputs and outcomes; and compare the inputs and outcomes that staff use to those used by other human service professionals (e.g. mental health services).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this was the first study to specifically investigate what constitute inputs and outcomes for staff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities. The study offers important insight into which inputs and outcomes are important to staff. It is hoped that the findings from the current study will act as a platform for future studies that utilise equity theory and will help to improve the well-being of staff and, indirectly, the quality of life of service users.</p>
