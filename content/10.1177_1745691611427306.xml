<p>Since Gordon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691611427306">Allport (1954)</xref> identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett’s (1898)</xref> study as the first social psychological experiment in his handbook chapter on the history of social psychology, most social psychology textbooks have been repeating this claim.

Triplett’s study was not the first social psychology study (it was not even the first study on social facilitation), the experimental task was described wrongly, and the evidence for social facilitation was overstated.

<body>
<p>Generations of psychologists have learned from social psychology textbooks that experimental social psychology began in 1898, when Triplett performed the first experimental study, which was also the first study to demonstrate that individual performance on simple, well-learned tasks improves in the presence of others. This phenomenon, which was later called <italic>social facilitation</italic> by Floyd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1745691611427306">Allport (1924)</xref>, became a major social psychological research area throughout most of the last century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1745691611427306">1</xref></sup> In this article, I argue that the claims about the historical status as well as the textbook descriptions of the Triplett study are incorrect. In view of the historical importance attributed to the Triplett study, it would seem timely to correct these errors. I will first describe the method and findings of the Triplett study and then discuss the various misrepresentations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1745691611427306">
<title>The Facts About the Study</title>
<p>It seems that Triplett was a fan of bicycle races. He was interested in determining why racing cyclists go faster when racing with others or when being paced than they do when riding alone, racing against the clock. Using records of the average speed of bicyclists under these different conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett (1898)</xref> may have indeed demonstrated that bicyclists ride faster in competition or with pacers. However, as Triplett recognized, the shortcoming of this kind of quasiexperimental evidence is that racers specialize on the types of races in which they do particularly well and do not participate in races for which they are less well suited. The differences in speed could therefore have been due to self-selection.</p>
<p>To rule out this explanation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett (1898)</xref> conducted an experiment in which 40 girls and boys aged 9 to 15 years performed a simple task either alone or in competition with another participant. Triplett’s apparatus consisted of two fishing reels fixed to a Y-shaped wooden frame that extended for more than two meters. The reels were fixed at the Y’s branches and were thus placed sufficiently far apart to allow for two persons turning them side-by-side. At exactly 2 m from the two fishing reels, two wheels were fixed to the opposite end of the framework and a silk cord was looped from each of the fishing reels through the corresponding wheel at the opposite side, creating two closed circuits of four meters each. Winding the fishing reel caused a small flag sewn to the silk cord to traverse the 4-m closed circuit (i.e. no line was wound onto the reels). A trial consisted of four circuits of the course, and the time taken for this performance was measured by stopwatch. After practicing “turning the reel until he had become accustomed to the machine” (p. 518), each participant performed six trials, three alone and three with a competitor. Triplett created a clever design, with the sequence of trials differing systematically for Groups A and B:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Group A: (1) alone, (2) competition, (3) alone, (4) competition, (5) alone, (6) competition</p>
<p>Group B: (1) alone, (2) alone, (3) competition, (4) alone, (5) competition, (6) alone</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rationale behind these two sequences was to eliminate practice as well as fatigue effects: Within-subject as well as between-group comparisons are possible from Trial 2 onwards.</p>
<p>Triplett categorized his participants into three groups on the basis of their performance during the various trials: individuals who were stimulated positively by competition (<italic>n</italic> = 20), those who were not affected (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and those who were “overstimulated” by competition and performed more slowly (<italic>n</italic> = 10). From visual inspection of his data, Triplett concluded “that the bodily presence of another contestant participating simultaneously in the race serves to liberate latent energy not ordinarily available” (p. 533).</p>
<p>As visual inspection of data is no longer accepted as evidence and as Triplett published the individual data in his article, it is surprising that it took more than a century for somebody to subject these data to statistical tests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1745691611427306">Strube (2005)</xref> first conducted a between-group analysis and found no evidence of significance. He then conducted two within- subject comparisons. He first analyzed a 5 × 2 (Trial × Order) design, with trial as repeated measure and order as between group factors. Although there was a trial main effect showing better performance on later trials, the Trial × Order interaction was not significant. He then conducted a repeated measures analysis testing the difference between the means for the alone and competition conditions for Trials 2 to 6. This analysis indicated a slight social facilitation effect. However, this effect disappeared when the data of two left-handed participants were excluded from the analysis. As the task was more difficult for left-handed participants instructed to use their right hand, one would have expected social inhibition, because the presence of others results in performance deterioration for difficult tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1745691611427306">Zajonc, 1965</xref>). Elimination of their data should therefore have strengthened the effect.</p>

<title>The Origin Myth</title>
<p>Gordon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691611427306">Allport (1954)</xref> identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett’s (1898)</xref> study as the first social psychological experiment in his classic handbook chapter on the history of social psychology. Social psychology textbooks have subsequently been repeating this claim. In their analysis of the historical status of the Triplett study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691611427306">Haines and Vaughan (1979)</xref> listed seven textbooks published in the 1970s that described it as the first experiment in social psychology. A survey of the textbooks on my shelf indicates that most cite or repeat this claim,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1745691611427306">2</xref></sup> as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1745691611427306">Ross, Lepper, and Ward (2010)</xref> in their history chapter in the 5th edition of the <italic>Handbook of Social Psychology</italic>. A book of historical and contemporary readings in social psychology, which reprinted an abbreviated version of the Triplett article, also described it as “the first social psychological experiment to be published” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691611427306">Halberstadt &amp; Ellyson, 1990</xref>, p. 11). However, the historical status of the Triplett study was questioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691611427306">Haines and Vaughan (1979)</xref> in an article that has not received much notice. Haines and Vaughan argued that there were other social psychological experiments before 1898. They mention a number of studies, but the most convincing examples are the studies on suggestibility of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691611427306">Binet and Henri (1894)</xref>. Although Binet and Henri were mainly interested in age differences in suggestibility, two of their studies focused on the effects of social influence. In both studies children had to look at a series of lines of different lengths and identify the line that was similar to a standard line shown to them previously. In one study, the children were tested individually, but the experimenter asked them whether they were absolutely certain after they had made their choice. Not surprisingly, most children yielded to influence and changed their mind. More interesting is a second study, in which children participated in groups of four and were aligned in front of a board on which the lines are displayed. They were instructed to announce their choice collectively. The children appear to have had difficulty in responding collectively, with some children being quicker than others, and that is where the suggestion process started. Binet and Henri found that the first answer typically influenced the choices of the other three children. As a result, the number of identical choices was higher in the group than the individual session. Most interesting, however, the average of correct choices was higher in group than in individual sessions.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1745691611427306">Kravitz and Martin (1986)</xref>, even earlier social psychological experiments were performed by Max Ringelmann, a professor of agricultural engineering at the French National Institute of Agronomy. Between 1882 and 1887, Ringelmann conducted investigations into the performance of workers pulling a load either alone or with others. But as Ringelmann published his research only in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1745691611427306">1913</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett (1898)</xref> predates him as far as publication is concerned.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett’s (1898)</xref> study may not even have been the first experiment on social facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1745691611427306">Prislin &amp; Crano, in press</xref>). Preceding Triplett by more than a decade, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1745691611427306">Féré (1887)</xref> published a book in which he described experiments that were subsequently mentioned by Triplett (p. 531) with results that one today would label as social facilitation. Féré used a dynamometer to measure the pressure exerted by the hand grip of a participant and found that the presence of another person engaged in the same activity increased the force exerted on the dynamometer twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1745691611427306">Prislin &amp; Crano, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691611427306">Triplett, 1898</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Triplett’s study was not the first social psychological experiment, his use of an elaborate experimental design makes it more prototypical of present day experimental research than the earlier studies. However, these studies also manipulated social conditions to observe the impact of such manipulations on individual performance and thus qualify as experiments. And yet, it is important to note that Triplett and all the other early researchers pursued questions that were unrelated to social psychology. They manipulated the social context only in their attempts to answer these questions. I would therefore argue that the year 1924 is a more appropriate date for the beginning of experimental social psychology. It marks the appearance of Floyd Allport’s seminal textbook, which explicitly delineates the domain of social psychology as the experimental study of social behavior, defined as “behavior in which the responses either serve as social stimuli or are evoked by social stimuli” (p. 148).</p>

<sec id="section3-1745691611427306">
<title>A Study Misrepresented</title>
<p>It is more difficult to pinpoint the precise origin of the false description of the experimental task and of the findings of the Triplett experiment. The most likely candidate is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745691611427306">Cottrell’s (1972)</xref> influential chapter on social facilitation. Probably misled by the mention of “fishing reel,” Cottrell and other textbook authors seem to believe that Triplett’s participants had to reel in a fishing line. Although this is a minor mistake, the misrepresentation of Triplett’s results is more serious. Failing to mention the three groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745691611427306">Cottrell (1972)</xref> concluded that “The results showed that the children worked faster in coaction than when alone” (p. 188). Since then, this unequivocal conclusion has been echoed by most textbooks of social psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1745691611427306">Aronson, Wilson, &amp; Aker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1745691611427306">Brehm &amp; Kassin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745691611427306">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745691611427306">Franzoi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745691611427306">McClintock, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745691611427306">Myers, Abell, Kolstad, &amp; Zani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1745691611427306">Smith &amp; Mackie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1745691611427306">Taylor, Peplau, &amp; Sears, 2003</xref>). This conclusion is a far cry from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1745691611427306">Strube’s (2005)</xref> summary that Triplett’s data indicated “barely a statistical hint of the social facilitation of performance to which his experiment has been credited” (p. 280).</p>

<sec id="section4-1745691611427306">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>How could textbook authors get it so wrong for so long? With regard to Triplett’s experimental task and his findings, the summaries given in textbooks raise doubts as to whether these authors consulted the original article. Although Triplett’s description of his task is not overly clear (despite a figure of his apparatus),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1745691611427306">3</xref></sup> a careful reader is unlikely to conclude that participants had to reel in fishing lines. And even before Strube’s reanalysis became available in 2005, the fact that half of his participants showed no evidence of social facilitation would suggest that one should avoid overstating these findings.</p>
<p>With regard to the historical status of the Triplett study, matters are more complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691611427306">Haines and Vaughan (1979)</xref> published their article in the <italic>Journal of the History of Behavioral Sciences</italic> and it seems that few social psychologists read journals on the history of social sciences. Indeed, the fact that practically all history of social sciences journals covered by the Social Science Citation index have impact factors of less than 1 suggests that these journals do not enjoy a wide readership. And the people who do read these journals often seem to be other historians, who then publish their conclusions in historical journals, which are mainly read by their fellow historians. At least this is the impression one gets from the titles of the 12 publications that cited the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691611427306">Haines and Vaughan (1979)</xref> article since 1979, according to the Social Science Citation Index.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1745691611427306">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>So in order to reach authors of textbooks, researchers would need to publish historical analyses in journals that these authors are likely to read. This is easier said than done, because practically all social psychology journals specify that articles have to be either empirical reports or papers on specialized theoretical or methodological issues. Unfortunately, most forms of historical analysis do not fall in any of these categories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1745691611427306">5</xref></sup> This raises the interesting question of why these journals rule out the publication of historical articles. From the responses I received from the two editors who rejected this article without sending it out for review, the reason seems to be that they assume (rightly or wrongly) that their readers are not interested in the history of their field. Both editors mentioned that they enjoyed reading the paper and both emphasized that it was of utter importance for the field that textbooks were accurate. But as the editor of one, a prestigious U.S. psychology journal wrote, they only published “cutting edge research” that “pushed the envelope.” The associate editor of a more venerable but somewhat less high-impact European social psychology journal was not convinced that “correcting how the Triplett study is reported is of significance and broad importance to the field” because he added, “The Triplett study appears to have little influence on research in the present day.” I freely admit that the findings reported in this article do no not represent cutting edge research nor do they push any envelopes. However, I was trained many decades ago in a period where one would have considered correcting the history of the origin of an important subfield of psychology to be important. We even had a word for it. We called it scholarship.</p>

<p>Neither the phenomenon nor its explanation turned out to be straightforward as subsequent research showed.

In a classic article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1745691611427306">Zajonc (1965)</xref> offered an explanation for these conflicting results: The presence of others improves performance on well-learned or easy tasks but impairs performance on tasks that are not well learned.
