<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 45-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of a small nodule with intermittent sharp pain in the right palm. There was no history of trauma or infection in the area. She had worked in an electronic company for several years, and the sharp pain usually occurred when grasping and moving the hard cases of electric home appliances. No visible mass or skin changes were evident over the affected area, but a firm 0.5 cm sized nodule was palpated 2.5 cm proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger. The nodule was mobile and Tinel’s sign was positive on percussion. Plain radiographs were unremarkable, but MRI revealed a subcutaneous, well-defined 5 × 10 mm ovoid mass, superficial to the flexor tendon sheath and lumbrical muscles at the metacarpal neck level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411433564">Figure 1</xref>). The patient underwent surgical exploration because of continuing discomfort. At surgery, a 4 × 8 mm peanut-shell shaped segmental expansion was noted in the radial digital nerve of the index finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411433564">Figure 2</xref>). Intraneural microdissection of the expanded segment of the nerve and enucleation of a 3 × 7 mm ovoid mass was carried out, preserving all fascicles. The cut surface of the specimen was whitish yellow and had a homogeneous texture. Histology revealed a multi-lobulated, plexiform, well-encapsulated lesion composed of spindle cells positive for S-100 protein with an Antoni A pattern. At 1 week after surgery, the neuropathic symptoms had subsided completely. At the last follow-up, 4 years after surgery, there was no evidence of recurrence and no sensory deficit was found by the two-point discrimination test.</p>

<p>Schwannomas or neurilemmomas are benign encapsulated tumours of the nerve sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433564">Greenfield et al., 2002</xref>) and are usually solitary. Schwannomas involving the digital nerves are rare and are typically located on the palmar side of the hand, but they also occur distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433564">Holdsworth, 1985</xref>). The treatment of choice is extracapsular or intracapsular removal under magnification. A preoperative diagnosis may be made, based on a high index of suspicion from the history and physical examination. However schwannomas are uncommon (less than 5% of the soft tissue tumours of the arm) and the symptoms they cause are sometimes indistinguishable from other lesions such as neuroma-in-continuity, nerve entrapment, perineural adhesions and external nerve compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411433564">Kang et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>MRI and ultrasonography are useful for delineating perineural lesions and for the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumours. However ultrasonography has limited ability to identify the type of tumour. Although some MRI features, such as an ill-defined margin, central necrosis and heterogeneity are helpful for distinguishing between malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) and benign tumours (BPNST), the lesions may sometimes appear similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433564">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). So the possibility of an MPNST should always be considered, although its prevalence is very low (about 0.001% of general population).</p>
