<p>By the time this <italic>Young Exceptional Children</italic>’s issue is published, the 2012 Division for Early Childhood (DEC) Conference will be a memory. The DEC Conference has always been an opportunity for DEC members and the larger early intervention/early childhood special education (EI/ECSE) field to share and collaborate on the issues and trends of the day as we strive toward “Realizing the Vision” for EI/ECSE—the theme of this year’s conference. I hope the 2012 DEC Conference continued this tradition and provided some new ways to come together as a community. One new format was the Ignite sessions; one focused on leadership and one focused on DEC Recommended Practices. In these sessions, each of five presenters was given 5 minutes to share his or her perspectives on the topic, which set the stage for the ensuing large group dialogue. As one panel member described it, this format brings to the forefront those discussions that usually occur among session attendees as sidebar conversations and when walking out at the end of a session. The hope was this format would create a space for all session participants to exchange ideas, debate, problem solve, and potentially come to consensus.</p>
<p>In addition this year, the conference tried to provide a sense of belonging so that we all could leave feeling invigorated and reinforced to continue our work in moving the field forward. As our inspiring keynote Sondra Samuels from Northside Achievement Zone described, it is our “belief in the impossible” that can make our vision a reality. This belief is easier to hold onto when strengthened by a community of family members, professionals, and anyone else working with and on behalf of young children with developmental delays or disabilities. The collective words of conference attendees were shared throughout the 3 days. Those who registered early bird (as well as those who attended the 2011 conference closing session) were asked to submit the following: “In exactly 6 words, what is one thing you would want to see in early intervention/early childhood special education in order for the field to move toward realizing its ideal vision?” We had an overwhelming number of responses. The overarching themes were empowering, partnering, and supporting families (e.g., “meaningfully engage families of diverse languages”); evidence-based practices (e.g., “help scale up effective practices everywhere”); inclusion (e.g., “positive outcomes through quality inclusive settings”); funding (e.g., “innovation in funding of services/supports”); policies (e.g., “decision makers’ priorities shift to children”); professional development (e.g., “more opportunities for reflection among teams”); and collaboration (e.g., “let’s stop yielding and start merging”). These inspiring words were shared during the opening and closing sessions and at the awards luncheon.</p>
<p>These themes and the specific phrases within them do not end with the conference. They actually provide the DEC Executive Board with some of our first data from DEC members to help us create our annual agenda for the next year, based on what is important to our members. We linked with DEC members during the conference to gather more data—at meetings, during the Conversation with DEC, and through informal opportunities as they arose. During the DEC Executive Board meeting that occurred at the conference, the Executive Board designed a plan to collect even more information from our members after the conference was over. If you are a DEC member, you may have already been asked to share your thoughts and ideas. If you have not been asked yet, odds are you will. These data will be used to understand the current impact of DEC and what our members think our impact should be, how DEC does and should enhance child and family life, what outcomes DEC should strive to achieve for the EI/ECSE community, and what the barriers are to realizing the vision of EI/ECSE. We will also learn about current trends, emerging issues, and initiatives within the larger EI/ECSE field. All of these data will be analyzed during our Executive Board meeting in April. At that time, the Executive Board will revise its Ends (outcomes), which will guide the work of the Executive Office in achieving those Ends. The Executive Board will also use these data to determine next steps in the Executive Board’s work, which will be implemented as the 2013-2014 annual agenda. The agenda will (a) outline the board’s communication to and from DEC members to share data and gather new data so that DEC can be proactive with the always evolving EI/ECSE field (i.e., ownership linkages), (b) develop and revise related policies, and (c) monitor the work of the Executive Office and Executive Board processes.</p>
<p>As the Executive Office is responsible for achieving the Ends set out by the Executive Board, this is the last year the DEC president and president-elect are responsible for the DEC Conference program. The Executive Office staff have recruited a very talented DEC member, Ted Burke of Illinois, to be the conference program chair for the next couple of years. I am excited for this change as we can utilize the expertise of our DEC members who know about and frequently coordinate conference programs to lead this effort. This is just one way we are trying to make DEC as effective as possible in achieving its vision for the field of EI/ECSE.</p>
