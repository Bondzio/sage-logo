<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are increasing numbers of reports on deaths and serious complications associated with the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612444169">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612444169">4</xref></sup> Bleeding is one of the more serious complications, occurring in patients with exposed blood vessels or vascular grafts (such as femoral and femoral-popliteal grafts), in sternal and groin wounds, and during the removal of dressings adhered to or embedded in the wound bed tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612444169">5</xref></sup> The application of negative pressure treatment to nerves and blood vessels is currently contraindicated because of the risk of damage. These tissues are, however, often subject to NPWT because of the lack of effective alternative treatments. In November 2009, the Federal Drug Administration filed an alert where bleeding was classified as the most serious complication to NPWT, having been reported in 6 death and 17 injury reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612444169">5</xref></sup> The importance of protecting exposed organs and sensitive tissue has also been emphasized in the international scientific literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612444169">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612444169">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612444169">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Heart rupture, bypass graft bleeding, and death are the most devastating complications for patients treated with NPWT for mediastinitis after cardiac surgery, the incidence being 4% to 7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612444169">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612444169">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612444169">9</xref></sup> We have previously described the reason for heart rupture during NPWT in pigs using magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612444169">10</xref></sup> The heart was shown to be drawn up toward the thoracic wall, the right ventricle bulged into the space between the sternal edges, and the sharp edges of the sternum protruded into the anterior surface of the heart. These events were not prevented by the insertion of soft, nonadhesive, wound-contact layers, but the insertion of a rigid disc between the anterior part of the heart and the inside of the thoracic wall was successful in providing protection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612444169">10</xref></sup> Heart and lung ruptures, similar to those seen in patients, were observed in this experimental setup without the rigid discs, whereas no damage to heart or lungs was seen when rigid discs were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612444169">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>NPWT is also known to cause the rupture of blood vessels, leading to hemorrhage in peripheral wounds. The cause may be the negative pressure–induced mechanical deformation and a hypoperfusion of exposed, delicate structures resulting in damage to and tears in the blood vessels walls. NPWT is known to mechanically deform the wound edges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612444169">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612444169">13</xref></sup> and alter microvascular blood flow around the wound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612444169">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612444169">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to examine the effects on pressure transduction to the wound bed and blood flow through a large blood vessel during continuous NPWT with rigid discs of different designs inserted between the wound filler and the wound bed. We hypothesized that the placement of a rigid disc, able to withstand the forces of negative pressure, over an artery that is exposed in the wound bed could offer protection from hypoperfusion.</p>

<sec id="section3-1553350612444169">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Eight healthy domestic pigs of both sexes, with a mean body weight of 70 kg, were used in the study. The animals were fasted overnight with free access to water. The experimental protocol for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research, Lund University, Sweden. All animals received humane care in compliance with the European Convention on Animal Care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612444169">
<title>Anesthesia</title>
<p>An intramuscular injection of xylazine (Rompun vet 20 mg/mL; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; 2 mg/kg) mixed with ketamine (Ketaminol vet 100 mg/mL; Farmaceutici Gellini SpA, Aprilia, Italy; 20 mg/kg) was used for premedication. Intravenous catheters were inserted into the auricular veins of both ears. Anesthesia was then induced with intravenous sodium thiopental (Pentothal; Abbott Scandinavia, Stockholm, Sweden; 10-12 mg/kg) and maintained with a continuous infusion of fentanyl (Leptanal; Lilly, France; ~3.5 µg/kg/h) in Ringer’s acetate or buffered 2.5% glucose (250-500 mL/h), in combination with sodium thiopental (~400 mg/h), delivered via an infusion pump (Compact Perfusor, Braun, Melsungen, Germany). After orotracheal intubation using a 7.0 mm diameter cuffed endotracheal tube, the pig was connected to a rebreathing circuit (Servo 900C; Siemens-Elema AB, Solna, Sweden) and its lungs ventilated mechanically in the volume-controlled mode (65% N<sub>2</sub>O, 35% O<sub>2</sub>). Ventilatory settings were identical for all animals (respiratory rate = 15 breaths/min; minute ventilation = 10 L/min). A positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was applied. A Foley catheter was inserted into the urinary bladder through a suprapubic cystostomy. The animals remained anesthetized during the entire experiment, which lasted for approximately 8 hours. On completion of the experiment, a lethal dose of potassium chloride was administered intravenously.</p>

<sec id="section5-1553350612444169">
<title>Wound Treatment</title>
<p>A 6-cm long wound was created over the femoral artery in the pig’s groin. The exposed artery was approximately 6 cm in length. Tissue was removed to simulate a true open wound. Two intracranial tissue pressure microsensors (Codman ICP monitoring system, Johnson &amp; Johnson Professional Inc-Codman, Henrico, VA) were sutured to the bottom of the wound, beside the artery, for recording of the pressure on the wound bed. The wound was sealed for NPWT using open-pore polyurethane foam. A laser Doppler probe (Probe 457, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) was inserted through a 2-cm incision, 5 cm distal to the NPWT-treated wound, to measure the distal blood flow in the femoral artery using a Perimed PF5010 LDPM unit (Perimed). After preparation of the wound, the blood flow was allowed to stabilize at atmospheric pressure for 1 hour. Wound bed pressure and femoral artery blood flow were recorded before and after the application of continuous negative pressure at −80 and −120 mm Hg using a custom-built vacuum source. The pressures used were consistent with clinical practice. The blood flow was recorded as arbitrary perfusion units (PU) and is presented here as percent of baseline values (before the application of negative pressure). Blood flow was recorded in probes showing a baseline blood flow between 0 and 300 PU. Values above 300 PU were excluded as they exceed normal physical blood flow, hence they were considered artificial. Blood flow was measured before and after the placement of a disc. The immediate effects of negative pressure were studied. The experimental setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612444169">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612444169">B</xref>.</p>

<p>The effects on blood flow through the femoral artery and pressure transduction to the wound bed after insertion of different rigid discs between the wound bed and the foam wound filler were investigated. The blood flow through the femoral artery was studied in the same wound, with and without a disc. Every wound thereby served as its own control.</p>
<p>The discs were 6 cm in diameter, millimeter-thin, made of plastic, and rigid enough to withstand the forces of the negative pressure. The discs were not commercially available. The discs were created with or without channels (to accommodate exposed sensitive structures such as blood vessels and nerves), perforations and a thin layer of open-pore structure black polyurethane foam covered the underside of the discs (to facilitate pressure transduction and fluid evacuation). The various combinations of discs and dressings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612444169">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When NPWT is applied to a wound with exposed blood vessels or vascular grafts there is risk of damage to or rupture of these delicate structures, probably because of the mechanical deformation and/or hypoperfusion of the structures induced by NPWT. We placed rigid discs over the wound bed to minimize the mechanical deformation of the wound bed tissue and exposed structures, in this case the femoral artery. Our results show that negative pressure is distributed evenly over the wound surface when the underside of the disc is covered by a porous dressing. Furthermore, all discs had similar positive effects on blood flow.</p>
<sec id="section11-1553350612444169">
<title>Pressure Delivery to the Wound Bed</title>
<p>The undersides of the discs were covered with a thin layer of open-pore foam, and then a perforated, soft, nonadherent wound contact layer was added in most of the cases. A contact layer allows the negative pressure to be distributed evenly over the wound surface; it also aids in removal of wound fluid from beneath the disc. The pressure transduction to the wound bed using dressing-covered discs was similar to that in the control wound without a disc. However, the pressure transfer to the wound bed was impaired when using a bare disc (ie, without a dressing), which most probably is because of the fact that there is no open structure wound dressing to allow the pressure to be distributed into the space underneath the disc.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the pressure on the wound bed was of a similar magnitude regardless of whether the rigid disc was perforated or not, suggesting that pressure transduction occurs in the dressing that covers the disc as well as through the perforations of the disc. The wounds in the present study were 6 cm in diameter, and it cannot be deduced whether the same results regarding pressure transduction to the wound bed would have been obtained if larger rigid discs had been used. Presumably, as the size of the disc increases the importance of having perforations in the disc would also increase, to allow pressure transmission to, and fluid removal from, the wound bed.</p>
<p>It cannot be deduced from the present study whether the presence of a rigid barrier disc may limit the wound healing at the wound bed because of the formation of residual dead space and fistulae. We believe that it is of the utmost importance that pressure is transduced to the underside of the disc and distributed evenly over the wound bed in order to facilitate drainage of effluents and thereby hinder the formation of residual dead space, which may be a source of infection and fistulae formation. To maximize the pressure distribution over the wound bed it is our strong belief that the disc should be perforated and also covered with an open structure dressing that has the properties of distributing negative pressure to all parts of the wound.</p>

<sec id="section12-1553350612444169">
<title>Blood Flow in the Femoral Artery</title>
<p>Blood flow through the femoral artery decreased when NPWT was applied to the control wounds. This finding is in line with previous reports where the perfusion of the superficial wound bed tissue decreases during NPWT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612444169">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612444169">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612444169">19</xref></sup> The reason for the decrease in blood flow may be the compression of superficial tissue or structures that are exposed in the wound, leading to the collapse of the vasculature, being either the microvasculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612444169">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612444169">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612444169"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612444169"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612444169">19</xref></sup> or a larger artery (as in the present study). Compression of a large blood vessel may reduce the blood flow to the blood vessel wall itself, via vasa vasorum, and reduce the blood flow to more distal tissues that are supplied by the artery.</p>
<p>Thus, the damage to blood vessels or vascular grafts reported during NPWT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612444169">5</xref></sup> may be caused both by hypoperfusion of the blood vessel wall (leading to necrosis) and by tearing forces exerted by the negative pressure. Anastomoses are known to be extra sensitive to hypoperfusion and tearing, and NPWT may cause graft failure with ensuing bleeding complications. Hypoperfusion and mechanical forces may also cause complications in wounds with other exposed delicate structures, such as nerves.</p>
<p>In the present study we inserted a rigid disc between the wound bed and the foam filler, which facilitated blood flow through the artery. The disc was rigid to provide a mechanical barrier to hinder the compression force that arises when the wound filler is pushed against the wound bed by the negative pressure. We have previously demonstrated that a rigid barrier protects against mechanical deformation of other cardiovascular structures during NPWT. In sternotomy wounds, the heart is sucked up toward the sharp edges of the split sternum and deformed by these wound edges when negative pressure is applied. Placement of a rigid barrier disc underneath these edges hinders this mechanical deformation of the heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612444169">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously studied blood flow through large arteries and found that the blood flow through the mammary artery was not altered when applying NPWT to a sternotomy wound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612444169">20</xref></sup> The reason for the difference between the findings in the present study and those in our previous study is probably that the mammary artery is embedded in tissue, and it is more than 3 cm away from the wound subjected to negative pressure therapy, while the artery in the present study was in direct contact with the dressings to which negative pressure was applied. It has been shown that the compressive forces exerted by NPWT extend less than 2 cm into the wound bed tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612444169">15</xref></sup> From a clinical point of view, this means that sensitive structures only require protection during NPWT when they are located in close proximity to the wound bed. In clinical practice, protective discs may not be necessary in all wounds, and their use should be weighed against the positive effects of NPWT in accelerating wound healing. The presence of a disc probably prevents the micromechanical effects of the NPWT on the wound bed, which in turn might slow the speed of granulation tissue formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1553350612444169">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It should be noted that the aim of the present study was to examine the effects on blood flow through a large blood vessel during NPWT and see the effects of the presence of a rigid disc. The effect of a rigid disc on wound healing can therefore not be deduced from the present study. A future study for monitoring granulation tissue formation would be valuable. Another limitation of the study is the short time frame of monitoring the blood flow and the wound bed. The risk of potential problems, such as pressure erosion from the contact between the wound bed, the blood vessel, and a rigid disc, has not been evaluated here.</p>

The placement of a rigid disc over the blood vessel restores blood flow, presumably by alleviating the compressive forces exerted by the negative pressure. A rigid disc placed over the wound bed may be beneficial to protect vital structures, such as blood vessels, vascular grafts, or nerves, from damage or rupture during NPWT.</p>
