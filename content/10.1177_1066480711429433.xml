<abstract>
<p>Recently, the impact of deployment, especially war-zone experiences on the well-being of military personnel and veterans, has received much attention. Findings show that combat exposure may be linked to an array of negative health consequences, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for the deployed individual and stress that is placed on the family. Married U.S. college students from Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were asked to complete a survey measuring depression, anxiety, social support, and marital satisfaction. Comparisons of means between participants with spouses in the military and participants with a civilian spouse showed no significant differences in depression and anxiety. Participants with a military spouse did report significantly higher social support, and the same group was more likely to report marital discord. Implications for these findings, especially the prevalence of high marital discord associated with lengthy military deployment, are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Since September 11, 2011, over 2 million service members have deployed to Iraq, including 800,000 with multiple deployments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429433">Tan, 2009</xref>). There is little debate that military deployment may be linked to an array of negative health consequences, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429433">King, King, Vogt, Knight, &amp; Samper, 2006</xref>). PTSD is generally characterized by heightened levels of anxiety, stress, possible sleeping disorders, and a harder time adjusting back to one’s life prior to deployment. It is important to recognize that exposure to war-zone activities and multiple deployments may have long lasting effects on the individuals that go through such experiences. Specifically, chronic combat exposure related to multiple deployments may likely result in a myriad of stress-related dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429433">U.S. DoD Task Force on Mental Health, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As the effects of deployment on service members has been well documented, the subsequent impact of deployment on the family has only recently garnered attention in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429433">Castro, Adler, &amp; Britt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711429433">Lincoln, Swift, &amp; Shorteno-Fraser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429433">APA Presidential Task Force on Military Deployment Services for Youth, Families, and Service Members, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429433">U.S. DoD Task Force on Mental Health, 2007</xref>). While both acute and chronic stress is a likely by-product of military personnel returning home and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429433">King et al., 2006</xref>); there remain few empirical investigations about the effects of military deployment on families. In fact, findings from past military conflicts are often generalized to apply to current global conflicts. Although historical findings may help us understand the general effects of deployment, there remains insufficient empirical evidence pertaining to the effects on today’s families in general and the marriage specifically (Sheppard et al., 2010).</p>
<p>It is not surprising that high levels of stress are typically reported by those who have been exposed to extreme trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711429433">McCarroll, Ursano, Wright, &amp; Fullerton, 1993</xref>). Exposure to traumatic events such as murder, suicide, torture, bombing, and other wartime activities may be shocking and therefore the individuals who have been a witness to such episodes are likely to have difficulty coping from the event. Coping is a major factor when considering how the individual will lower their stress levels once they return from their deployment. For individuals under high levels of recent life-event stress, a functional, need-based social support is very helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429433">Maton, 1989</xref>). In essence, a caring and nurturing environment is vital to recovery from major stressors. Once the military personnel have returned home, it is important that their environment does not present with additional major stressors. In turn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429433">King et al. (2006)</xref> found that postwar social support including family cohesiveness and a nonchaotic household are likely to be protective to later life stressors.</p>
<p>Once the military personnel return home from their deployment they often return to a spouse. Over one half of enlisted military personnel and 70% of active duty officers are married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429433">Lutton, 2011</xref>). Family homeostasis has been shown to be negatively affected by prolonged separation due to military deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429433">Collins &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>). While the individual who experienced the traumatic events is trying to reestablish their sense of self within their family setting, it is likely for children and spouses to be confused and uncomfortable around the person who has just returned. Role reorganization generally takes place within the household while the solider is away on deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429433">Collins &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>). It can be very stressful for the family while the solider is away for fear that that person may not return home, and while the stress is alleviated from that concern when the solider returns, role reorganization and confusion likely occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429433">Collins &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The duration of the marital separation has been one factor predicted to affect the degree of coping. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429433">Flake, Davis, Johnson, and Middleton (2009)</xref> found that military families are likely to cope well with short deployments that last less than 6 months. In addition, peacetime deployments have been found to be easier to handle for many members of the family as opposed to wartime deployments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429433">Flake, Davis, Johnson, &amp; Middleton, 2009</xref>). Conversely, uncertainty and fear is typically heightened for the military families when the individual is deployed numerous times, especially during times of war. Anxiety and depression may be common occurrences in families left at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429433">Flake et al., 2009</xref>). In turn, the home environment may not be a nurturing place, but rather one defined by confusion, depression, and anxiety.</p>
<p>Many problems can occur specifically within a marriage while a solider is on deployment and once they return home. At times, the parent that has been left at home feels a heightened amount of stress due to the added responsibility of running the household and having to deal with the children’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711429433">Hillenbrand, 1976</xref>). These feelings may make it difficult for the nondeployed parent to maintain a lower feeling of stress within the relationship. Ineffective coping skills may place added strain on a relationship. Successful coping such as managing negative emotions to solve existing problems become critical to the marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711429433">O’Brien, DeLongis, Pomaki, Puterman, &amp; Zwicker, 2009</xref>). If the coping skills within a marriage are strong, it is more likely that an individual experiencing PTSD will recover from feelings of anxiety and stress more quickly. When close relationships are maintained during stressful times, the individual may experience a buffer from the negative effects of stress. In turn, those who perceive an empathetic and supportive spouse tend to also perceive lower rates of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711429433">O’Brien et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, it is clear that deployed military personnel experience stress and anxiety. However, to date, there has been no systematic empirical study of the effects of military deployment on the spouse left behind. As the marital relationship appears to be a critical component of coping and wellness, the present study sought to test several hypotheses pertaining to the spouses of active duty military personnel. For clarification, the terms “military spouses” and “civilian spouses” are used to describe husbands and wives of active duty military service personnel and their nonmilitary counterparts.<list list-type="order">

<title>Method</title>
<p>Married U.S. college students (<italic>M</italic> age = 28.3 years) were selected as a sample of convenience to participate in the study. The participants (<italic>N</italic> = 121, 68 female and 53 male) were currently enrolled in a distance education program centered at two military bases (Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, North Carolina). Participants were recruited via e-mail from the distance education program and completed a voluntary survey online compiled by the authors. The Military Deployment Survey (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1066480711429433">Appendix A</xref>) included depression and anxiety items from the Depression and Anxiety Stress scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711429433">Lovibond, 1993</xref>), which has demonstrated high internal consistency with Cronbach’s αs of .94, .88, and .93 for depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429433">Nieuwenhuijsen, de Boer, Verbeek, Blonk, &amp; van Dijk, 2003</xref>). Four questions pertained specifically to marital discord (e.g., I consider divorcing my spouse. Note: seven items were originally used for this construct, but 3 items were removed to achieve higher internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = .087) and 7 items pertained to social support (e.g., I engage in activities that provide social interaction, Cronbach’s α = .084). Depression, anxiety, marital satisfaction, and social support were measured on a 4-point scale from <italic>does not apply to me at all</italic> to <italic>applies to me very much, or most of the time</italic>. In addition, a demographic section including gender and age of participant, branch of armed services for deployed spouse, number of deployments, length of deployments, and number of children was also incorporated into the survey. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066480711429433">Table 1</xref> for demographic data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The toll of military deployment on families has far-reaching effects. As estimates suggest that one-in-five military service members return home with PTSD, the financial cost to society continues to rise. Direct medical care and lost productivity pushes financial estimates in excess of 6 billion dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711429433">Tanielian &amp; Jaycox, 2008</xref>). While 300,000 U.S. military service members have returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan with symptoms of PTSD and depression, only about 50% have sought treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711429433">Tanielian &amp; Jaycox, 2008</xref>). As reports continue to document the effects of deployment on military personnel, only recently have researchers begun to look at the impact of deployment on families left behind. The current investigation was designed to assess levels of mental health wellness and marital discord in spouses of deployed active military personnel.</p>
<p>As perceived social support is a key component to mental health and wellness, a strong marital relationship may not only assist in recovery from, but provide a buffer against depression and anxiety (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429433">Simons, Lorenz, Wu, &amp; Conger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711429433">Chioqueta &amp; Stiles, 2007</xref>). However, findings from the present study indicate that a strong marriage may not be awaiting military personnel returning from home. While the past decade has seen the highest survival rates in the history of U.S. conflicts (Sheppard et al., 2010), current results suggests that there may be a low prevalence of supportive husbands and wives available to assist in ongoing care of wounded spouses.</p>
<p>Current findings do not support the recent length of deployment findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429433">Flake et al. (2009)</xref>. In essence, neither the length of deployment nor the number of deployments or number of deployments, and so on did not moderate any of the constructs measured in our study (depression, anxiety, social support, and marital discord). In other words, there were no differences found in the dependent measures within the military spouse group when comparing number and length of deployments. This is not surprising, given that only a small number of military spouses reported partner deployments of less than 6 months. Adding participants to the “less than 6 months” category of deployment length however, would likely only reduce the low depression and moderate anxiety findings reported in the present study. In sum, military spouses left at home did not report higher levels of depression and anxiety to civilian spouse counterparts, regardless of the length of time their partner was deployed.</p>
<p>A plausible explanation for the lack of differences in depression and anxiety between military and civilian spouses lies in the social support findings. It was predicted that military spouses would report higher isolation (less social support) as past research has indicated the need to support families of deployed service members who are left at home (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429433">Castro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711429433">Lincoln et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429433">APA Presidential Task Force on Military Deployment Services for Youth, Families, and Service Members, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429433">U.S. DoD Task Force on Mental Health, 2007</xref>). Perhaps as a result of such attention and awareness, spouses of deployed service members remaining at home may now have more options for interpersonal engagement and social networking. In any event, this finding suggests the need for further investigation.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a need for more research on the effects of deployment on military families. As more wounded soldiers are returning home than any other time in U.S. history, a supportive family is a critical component to ongoing care and recovery of our servicemen and women. Marital discord can only add to the stress and strain on the family system once the deployment has ended. Research agendas directed toward gaining a better understanding of the complex issues reunited couples face is definitely warranted. In turn, we suggest a greater focus on marital role-reorganization counseling in addition to the social support mechanisms currently in place for military families.</p>
