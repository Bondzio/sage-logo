<p>When the corruption of the political class and the inadequacy of social institutions fail to meet people’s rising expectations, they search for alternatives and a convergence of circumstances eventually precipitates a ‘social movement’. Such mass movements have a potential for radical change far beyond staid, conventional party politics. They are a challenge to a more participative politics for a different, more inclusive society as it could well be said that the structural contradictions of our society are reaching a breaking point. They seem barely containable by our constitutionally designed democratic institutions, which struggle to cope with the changes and demands of a society in transition, even as they are increasingly subverted by partisan politics and vested interests. With economic disparities and social antagonism rapidly sharpening the divides in our society, people’s movements are bound to mushroom.</p>
<p>The volumes under review are a timely collection of 25 essays on social movements. These movements, today, are setting the agenda of contemporary public discourse, with their demonstrated capacity for structural change. In a lengthy introduction, the editor gives an elaborate categorisation of types of social movements, a veritable taxonomy and though this is perhaps more orderly than insightful, it does help the newcomer to the field to navigate through the maze of such movements. An overview of the chapters in each volume is also provided and is helpful to a reader.</p>
<p>Vol. I covers a broad spectrum of themes from ‘Religious and Caste Movements’ to that of ‘Linguistic and Tribal’. In the first section on ‘Religious and Caste Movements’, Kenneth W. Jones traces Hindu ‘socio-religious movements of the Twentieth Century’ from their earlier, more religious phase to their later, more political one, while Christophe Jaffrelot presents the tensions and ambiguities between the traditional conservative Hindus and the modernising secularists in the context of ‘Ethno-religious Mobilisation and the Politics of Secularism’. The politicisation of religious movements is not an uncommon phenomenon as Shail Mayaram argues in the case of the Tablighi Jama’t. Besides movements for revival within a tradition, there are movements for a change of religious tradition. Thus, according to Walter Fernandes, the complexity of ‘Caste and Conversion Movements’ has given rise to a much diversified Christian community in this country. We could say the same of other communities as well—all are now being homogenised in view of electoral compulsions, such as vote banks. Finally, in this section, Vivek Kumar finds, in his ‘Different Shades of Dalit Mobilisation’, a challenge to caste that has changed Indian democracy but has not produced an autonomous Dalit leadership due to an endemic factionalism within the Dalit movement.</p>
<p>The second section on ‘Regional, Linguistic and Tribal Movements’ has even more ground to cover and so this selection will not satisfy all. The Dravidian cultural distinctiveness crystallises around language as Robert L. Hardgrave argues in his review of the ‘Foundations of the Dravidian Movement’. Later, it expresses itself politically in Tamil nationalism, which is only contained now with the reorganisation of states and the autonomy that Tamil Nadu has been able to exercise. Dipankar Gupta shows how the autonomy of the superstructure explains ‘The Shiv Sena Movement’ in Mumbai, mobilising the Marathi <italic>manus</italic> by tapping into not just the sense of relative deprivation, but also by using an idiom and imagery with strong emotional appeal. ‘The Assamese Movement’ has been precipitated by large-scale immigration and for Sanjib Baruah, the multiple aspects of this conundrum now can only be resolved by evolving a framework for ethnic accommodation. In a bird’s eye review of ‘Tribal Solidarity Movements’, Surajit Sinha opines that the many rebellions and insurgency have their local context. Their roots can be traced to the cultural and ecological isolation that results in deprivation and backwardness. Focusing more on cultural considerations, Frederick S. Downs discusses ‘Christian Conversion Movements’ in the North-East, both in colonial and in post-colonial times. He stresses the ‘new cultural synthesis’ that served as a protection against their absorption and loss of identity in mainstream society.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter to the second volume is a repetition of the general introduction made in the first one, except for the overview of the chapters here. The repetition is probably meant to make each a stand-alone volume, though to this reviewer, both volumes cover intimately entwined issues and as such, should be read together.</p>
<p>Equality is a complex and contentious issue that invites social movements to coalesce around them. The increase of violent non-state actors has become a serious concern and citizen movements have been mobilised to address this. The chapters in this volume are around these two themes: Equity and Security and they are covered in three sections: ‘Peasant and Labour Movements’, ‘Women and Students’ Movements’ and ‘Ecological and Environmental Movements’.</p>
<p>Contesting Barrington Moore’s thesis that Indian peasants were passive compared to their Chinese counterparts, Kathleen Gough counts some 77 ‘Indian Peasant Uprisings’ in the 200 years of colonial rule. While all these differed widely in scale and intensity, they have had a significant impact on larger society. Partha Mukherji traces the origins of the ‘Naxalbari Peasant Movement’ to the contradictions in an oppressive agrarian system. The demand for the natural resources in these habitats needed to fuel national development has exacerbated these contradictions and further alienated people there.</p>
<p>The editor expands his contribution on the ‘Bhoodhan-Gramdhan Movement’ into a discussion on the relationship of the role and limits of charismatic leadership and the need for institutionalisation for sustainability. ‘The New Farmers’ Movements in Maharashtra’ are categorised as economistic and popularist by D.N. Dhanagare. Inevitably, these get fragmented with the impact of the global market and the economic reforms in response to it, for such movements do not have an ideology that will sustain it. S.M. Pandey periodises ‘The Indian Labour Movement’ to trace its ‘Growth and Character’ while the ‘Changing Trends in Industrial Relations: India 1950–2000’ are reviewed by Debashish Bhattacherjee. The last chapter in this section on ‘Labour Activism and Women in the Unorganised Sector’ by Supriya Roy Chowdhury, insightfully indicates how the concerns of these women centre on community and domestic matters outside the factory rather than on the work situation there.</p>
<p>In the second section on women and students, Indu Agnihotri and Veena Mazumdar’s paper on ‘The Changing Terms of Women’s Discourse in India: Women’s Movement in India, 1970s–1990s’ traces its trajectory from the post-Emergency upsurge for civil rights and the mushrooming of women’s organisations, through the fundamentalist advent of the 1980s and the effect of the new economic policies of the 1990s. They feel that the gradual but increasing involvement of women at the grassroots promises hope for the future of women’s movements in the country.</p>
<p>The increasing violence against women in post-colonial India is highlighted by Rajni Palriwala who shows how ‘The Anti-Dowry Movement in Delhi’, brought not just legal prohibitions, but more importantly conscientised women about their rights. The last chapter on women is a history of ‘The Self-Employed Women’s Association’ (SEWA), from its beginnings in Ahmedabad to its national and even international reach today.</p>
<p>The first paper on student movements by Philip G. Altbach describes ‘The Transformation of the Indian Student Movement’ from their participation in the freedom struggle through its resurgence with J.P. Narayan’s call to ‘total revolution’ in the 1970s to its meagre promise today. The editor in his chapter on ‘Student Power: Mobilisation and Protest’ points to the heterogeneity and transitoriness of students for this. Their economic and emotional dependency on their families seems to contain their restlessness and stymie demands for change.</p>
<p>In the final section, Vandana Shiva’s discourse on ‘Ecological Movements in India’ uses the Chipko movement to illustrate the inherent dilemmas in the developmental model privileged in India: between an economy focused on sustainability and one pursuing growth; a technology that is labour intensive and one that is capital intensive; a science that produces a technology on a human scale and comprehended by laypersons; and a science of specialised experts that produces a technology beyond their reach. How these dilemmas are resolved defines our relationship with the environment and the ecological footprints we leave for a future that is crashing into our present. In his paper on ‘Parks, People and Protest’, Ranjit Dwivedi discusses ‘The Mediating Role of Action Groups’ play here, as in the ‘Jungle Jivan Bachao Yatra’ of 1995. All these are core issues in the ecological discourse that the editor’s concluding chapter on ‘Protest against Displacement by Development Projects’ illustrates with case studies of the ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ and the trajectory of displacement and protest in Orissa.</p>
<p>Social movements do impact larger society as these two volumes adequately illustrate. However, their lasting impact cannot be maintained without some measure of institutionalisation for their sustainability. But this eventually domesticates the movement and scales back the changes first envisaged. Their demands are often accommodated by the mainstream and down-sized. Soon enough, other movements arise and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p>Social movements are not self-perpetuating. However, if the life-cycle of a movement is to bring real and effective structural change, a cohesive and comprehensive ideology is necessary to articulate issues critically and motivate people credibly. There must also be an internal self-critique and a self-correcting mechanism in its organisation. Left to their own dynamics, movements tend to follow a predictable life-cycle of birth-growth-maturation-demise. Worse still, they can become part of the problem themselves, as indeed they have with nativist, fundamentalist, extremist, revivalist and other similar ones that may begin with a real injustice and then become partisan and exclusive, organisationally weak or co-opted by a coterie. Such movements militate against the shared concerns of the larger society and eventually could de-humanise it.</p>
<p>Social movements precipitate change but also give it direction, which can be progressive or regressive. Ultimately, it is the ideology that inspires a movement that will condition, if not determine, its direction. The increasing communalism and casteism in our society, the majoritarianism and minoritarianism of our religious communities, the regionalism with privileging of a sons-of-the-soil priority over a common citizenship and so on are spawning intolerant and divisive movements that are ever more oppressive and dangerously politicised. These are alarming trends that must not be ignored. Otherwise the promise of liberative social change that people’s movements were once supposed to bear will turn into a nightmare of despair.</p>
<p>The social movements selected in these two volumes are largely seen as progressive. This is but one side of the picture and by itself a misleading one. Apart from this lacuna, these two are a useful set of volumes, especially for students and teachers of social movements. Perhaps a third complementary volume of the dysfunctional side of social movements would remedy this.</p>
