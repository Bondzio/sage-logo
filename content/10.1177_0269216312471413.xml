<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p>Art therapy is a clinical intervention that uses the expressive qualities of art making with the aim of improving well-being and psychological functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312471413">1</xref></sup> The creative process involved in art making allows the expression of concerns and feelings that might otherwise be difficult to express verbally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312471413">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312471413">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Art therapy has demonstrated evidence for its efficacy in reducing common symptoms experienced by cancer inpatients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312471413">4</xref></sup> However, art therapy is a complex intervention, and its evaluation can be challenging because of the multiple components involved.</p>
<p>The objectives of our study were to evaluate the feasibility of mixed methods to quantitatively determine the short-term effect of an art therapy session on symptoms commonly experienced by patients with advanced cancer and to qualitatively assess these patients’ perceptions of the impact and value of the session on their physical and psychological distress.</p>
<p>Consecutive inpatients were recruited from a palliative care unit. Patients involved in art therapy sessions were systematically proposed to participate in the study before their first session. Participants were provided a 1-h art therapy session by a professional art therapist. The day before the session, each patient was invited to discuss the topic they wanted to explore. The art therapy sessions (painting) took place in the palliative care department twice weekly. The choice of painting allowed patients to express their feelings through colors and drawing and to produce an artwork. Guidance from art therapists was mainly toward technical aspects.</p>
<p>We used the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) to assess physical and psychological distress. We recorded the ESAS results collected 1 h before and after the art therapy session. A Wilcoxon test was used to compare pre- and postintervention ESAS scores. A p value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance.</p>
<p>We also conducted semidirected interviews the day after the art therapy session. The interview questions were geared toward eliciting open-ended responses to acquire information about the patient’s thoughts associated with the art therapy session. We used a grounded theory approach in analyzing the transcripts and applied a thematic analysis to the data to extrapolate results.</p>
<p>Twelve patients were included in our study. All the participants were female and had metastasis. One hour before and 1 h after the art therapy session, there were statistically significant improvements in pain (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.022), anxiety (p = 0.027), and diminished feeling of well-being (p = 0.015).</p>
<p>During the semiqualitative interviews, patients expressed that they had experienced relief from physical pain during the art therapy session. They mainly explained the relief by the fact that they were doing something else (distraction).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Pain was reduced because I thought of nothing except what I was doing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two patients reported increased fatigue. However, it was not an obstacle to continuing the session and was not considered an undesirable feeling.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well because it was a fatigue … due to … having accomplished something. It’s not a fatigue of having done nothing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two patients explained that they were surprised to be invited to participate because they had thought they were too sick to be eligible for this type of treatment (reality testing).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I thought it would not be possible for me as I was in bed and I could not move, … that I would not be eligible to participate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the patients described the session as pleasant and relaxing. Five of the patients clearly stated that it allowed them to forget about their illness and to feel almost as if they were out of the hospital.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For a few hours the patient is thinking of other things, it frees him from his illness, and I think it’s good … You do not feel like you’re in the hospital anymore.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants consistently expressed that the art therapy session improved their relationships with their family, friends, and caregivers. Art not only allowed the patients to accomplish something but also provided them and their family and friends with a way to talk about something other than the cancer. These results suggest that the process involved in art therapy session can help not only to express concerns and feelings regarding the cancer but also to provide a break out of the illness.</p>
<p>Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of mixed methods of an art therapy session on the symptoms experienced by advanced cancer patients. These preliminary results confirm the value of this type of method by increasing the confidence of the results (convergent results) and also by providing preliminary data on the potential active component (e.g. distraction, reality testing) involved in art therapy for cancer patients.</p>
