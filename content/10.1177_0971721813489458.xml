                <p>Making use of the recent STS focus on the idea of subpolitics, the study seeks to
                    understand the limited yet important implications of the rise of the political
                        twitterati<sup>1</sup> for liberal democracy in Singapore. The phenomenon
                    marks a significant development not in terms of facilitating mass upheavals or
                    radical reforms as elsewhere in the world, but in terms of contributing towards
                    the construction of counter narratives to the historically articulated and
                    previously uncontested discourses of progress, efficiency, productivity and
                    success that in part have legitimated the political establishment in Singapore.
                    By critiquing the regime’s myriad narratives of accomplishments and
                    constructing subversive counter narratives through ‘series tweets’
                    that were infused with wit, sarcasm, parody and satire, the political twitterati
                    in Singapore has expanded the vistas of democratic participation while remaining
                    loyal to the country’s non-Western liberal democratic framework.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p><sc>THE RELEVANCE OF</sc> subpolitics is beginning to be widely recognised in the
                field of STS. A paper by de Vries (2007) highlights the value of the subpolitical
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489458">Bakardjieva, 2009</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971721813489458">Beck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489458">Linde and Lindgren, 2010</xref>)
                in examining expert influence in technological decisions. Building on the work of
                Collins and Evans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0971721813489458">2002</xref>)
                who express concern that a democracy may not be able to afford an infinite amount of
                subpolitics, de Vries argues that the scope of the subpolitical needs to be
                delineated before it can be of any theoretical value for STS. Initially arguing that
                the modern view of democratic engagement is instrumental in nature and viewing
                stakeholders in the decision-making process as ‘mini kings’, de Vries
                suggests that this is akin to <italic>poiesis</italic> in the Aristotelian
                framework. <italic>Poiesis</italic>, however, according to de Vries, does not help
                us to understand the way in which contributions outside of the explicitly political
                arena have a qualitative impact on political decisions. He suggests that
                Aristotle’s idea of <italic>praxis</italic> might come closer to explaining
                this phenomenon, dealing as it does with the way in which actions and discourse
                combine to create an object which is an end in itself, rather than a means to an
                end. Focusing on <italic>praxis</italic> allows us to explain how the non-political
                moves into the political and thus has an indirect impact on democracy.</p>
            <p>In this article, we take up this particular aspect of subpolitics retaining some of
                its meaning derived from the field of STS and incorporating de Vries’
                refinement through the lens of <italic>praxis</italic> and apply it to political
                engagement by influential actors on a social media platform at the time of a
                watershed General Election in Singapore. While deterministic statements about the
                role of social media in influencing election results in Singapore are unproductive,
                we argue, through our analysis, that the use of the platform in particular ways has
                larger implications for the future of democracy in Singapore. Our article seeks to
                explain the impact of a subpolitical phenomenon on the reconfiguring of politics in
                Singapore. De Vries frames current STS discourse on the subpolitical as a
                continuation of a limited view of democratic politics and he introduces the
                Aristotelian framework in order to highlight the mechanisms by which the
                subpolitical evolves so that what counts as subpolitical can be carefully defined.
                Through our empirical case study, we further the argument that subpolitics needs
                closer examination in technological societies. In doing so, we expand the scope of
                STS studies beyond the relationship between technical decisions taken by a minority
                and larger democratic processes; by studying a new media phenomenon that has a
                particular kind of legitimacy of its own.</p>
            <p>We posit that the evolution of a political twitterati that contributes to political
                thought may be analogous to the development of a technical expert discourse that
                contributes to technological decision making in the public sphere. The larger
                democratic election process may not have been directly affected by the
                twitterati’s contributions, but at the same time there was an organic link
                that qualitatively transformed the democratic process because the medium provided a
                certain kind of critique of the system which trickled down to the larger democratic
                process. The ‘object’ thus constituted was the quality of democracy in
                Singapore.</p>
            <p>In his compelling commentary on the down side of Iran’s over glorified
                ‘Twitter revolution’ Morozov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489458">2009a</xref>, p. 12) argues that something like a
                ‘Twitter revolution is only possible in a regime where the state apparatus is
                completely ignorant of the Internet and has no virtual presence of its own’.
                In his view, most authoritarian states eagerly exploit cyberspace ‘for their
                own strategic purposes’(Ibid) and specifically in Iran’s case, both
                Twitter and Facebook provided Iran’s secret services ideal platforms for
                gathering intelligence about political activists and their intimate connections.
                According to him, ‘(O)nce regimes used torture to get this kind of data; now
                it’s freely available on Facebook’ (Ibid). Drawing on Morozov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489458">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0971721813489458">2011</xref>), Christensen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971721813489458">2011</xref>, p. 234) has pointed
                out that ‘(t)he very terms “Twitter Revolution” (Iran) and
                “Facebook Revolution” (Egypt) have now been called into question as
                overly techno-deterministic and techno-utopian’ since such approaches ignore
                the use of social media by authoritarian regimes for the purposes of surveillance
                and repression. Further discussions on the Iranian case have provided caveats that
                help move beyond positions with technological deterministic overtones hinging on
                cyber-utopianism and state dystopianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489458">Erlich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971721813489458">Rahimi, 2011</xref>). Nevertheless,
                Rheingold’s (2002) predictions of a new wave of activism that makes use of
                powerful online networks based on synergetic connections to organise people, share
                information and make decisions through collective intelligence even under conditions
                of anonymity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0971721813489458">Warlaumont,
                    2010</xref>) still appeal to many scholars and activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971721813489458">2</xref></sup></p>
            <p>This article, based on tweets and re-tweets (RTs) captured just before and after the
                May 2011 General Elections in Singapore, seeks to explore the role of twitterati in
                the politicisation of public debate, with specific focus on the small state of
                Singapore. Singapore, paradoxically, is as well known for its highly wired
                population as it is for its comparably lower level of online political participation
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971721813489458">Baber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971721813489458">Banerjee and Yeo, 2003</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971721813489458">George, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489458">Ho, Baber and Khondker,
                    2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971721813489458">Rodan,
                    2003</xref>). In the May 2011 General Election to the Singapore Parliament, one
                of the opposition parties, Workers Party (WP), for the first time substantially
                increased representation in parliament by winning a group constituency of five
                legislatures triggering debates on the role of social media in realising the
                surprise win.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0971721813489458">3</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The process of gradual democratisation of political engagement in Singapore leading
                to the growth of a Singaporean public on social media was fuelled by the affordances
                of the social media platforms that urge users onto a learning curve of wider
                participation. The strategic use of these affordances by key players involved a
                partial critique of government institutions, practices and procedures, creating a
                new social space of active political engagement unavailable in Singapore’s
                mainstream media. Based on the analysis of representative series tweets, we argue
                that the phenomenon marks a significant development not in terms of facilitating
                mass upheavals or radical reforms as elsewhere in the world, but in terms of
                contributing towards the construction of counter narratives to the historically
                articulated and previously uncontested discourses of progress, efficiency,
                productivity and success that in part have legitimated the political establishment
                in Singapore. By critiquing the regime’s myriad narratives of accomplishments
                and constructing subversive counter narratives through ‘series tweets’
                that were infused with wit, sarcasm, parody and satire, the political twitterati in
                Singapore attempted to challenge the post-colonial consensus on Singapore as
                ‘an intelligent island’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971721813489458">Mahizhnan, 2000</xref>). It may be noted that
                while hegemonic discourse on administrative efficiency has met serious challenges
                elsewhere in post developmental Asia during the times of crises such as the outbreak
                of bird flu, SARS etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971721813489458">Ku,
                    2001</xref>), such efforts to delegitimise the ruling establishment had been
                completely absent in Singapore. The new Singaporean public, composed of a previously
                quiescent citizenry, has begun to discover the possibilities of online political
                engagement and critique on a wider scale. The phenomenon provides an opportunity to
                analyse an alternative perspective on social networking activism based on liberal
                values and a belief in gradual change, rather than looking at them as inevitable
                harbingers of political revolutions or as mere constructions of the global corporate
                media.</p>

            <title>Political Engagement and the Internet in Singapore</title>
            <p>Singapore has been noted for its early successes in focusing on the extensive use of
                information technology for economic growth and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971721813489458">Kuo and Low, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971721813489458">Mahizhnan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971721813489458">Rodan, 2003</xref>) in striking contrast to the
                experience of most other countries in developing Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489458">Sreekumar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0971721813489458">Sreekumar and Rivera-Sanchez, 2008</xref>).
                Nevertheless, online political participation in Singapore had not kept pace with the
                rapid development of infrastructure due to legal restrictions and resource
                constraints faced by opposition parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971721813489458">Kluver, 2004</xref>). The advent of the Internet
                in the middle of the 1990s did not have any extensive influence during the General
                Elections in 1996, 2001 and 2006 although its role in building alternatives to
                mainstream media to publish oppositional views and opinions began to attract public
                attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489458">George, 2010</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971721813489458">Gomez, 2002</xref>). On the
                contrary, the 2011 General Election was widely perceived as a turning point in terms
                of the extensive use of the Internet for political participation not only by
                oppositional parties but also by ordinary citizens as well as interest groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971721813489458">Lim, 2011</xref>, p. 5).</p>
            <p>The phenomenal change in terms of the unprecedented influence of the Internet in the
                Singapore General Election 2011, was facilitated by three major developments namely,
                the emergence of new social media such as Facebook and Twitter, wide adoption of
                mobile Internet devices such as smartphones and liberalisation of governmental
                regulations on the use of the Internet for online campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489458">George, 2011</xref>, p. 148). The speed and reach
                of the Internet made political awareness trickle down to Singapore-focused websites
                and online discussion groups, forming a nucleus around which discussion could grow
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489458">Gomez, 2005</xref>).
                Political activity was gradually incorporated into new ways of articulating identity
                online, reinforcing a gradual process of Internet acculturation already under way
                for more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0971721813489458">George,

                diffusion of the Singaporean Internet, information control faced technical
                challenges in ways that tested the effectiveness of established mechanisms in
                Singapore.</p>
            <p>In striking contrast to previous elections, during the lead-up to the May 2011
                General Elections, online activity across blogs, social media platforms and
                discussion boards registered a conspicuous increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489458">George, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0971721813489458">Soo, 2011</xref>). Despite survey evidence that
                local television news coverage and newspapers had a greater influence on voters, the
                overall impression was of an online world abuzz with information and opinions that
                in prior elections had been more muted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0971721813489458">R. Tham, 2011</xref>). The 2006 General Elections
                also had been noted for being an ‘Internet election’, with blog posts
                carrying reports (for example about massive attendance at the election rallies of
                opposition parties) that seemed to be deliberately left out of the mainstream media
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0971721813489458">Ibrahim, 2009</xref>). With
                the 2011 Elections, however, social media platforms allowed even more people to add
                their voices to the stream of online content. Overwhelmingly, there was a sense that
                only anti-government and anti-ruling party voices were able to make themselves heard
                online and there were serious doubts about the veracity of much of the
                anti-Establishment information that spread through social networking
                        sites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0971721813489458">4</xref></sup>
                Following the Election, an entrepreneur and author who wrote a Facebook note in
                defence of the ruling party, the People’s Action Party (PAP), expressed the
                sentiment with irony and bewilderment: <disp-quote>
                    <p>When did this happen? It used to be that if you spoke up against the PAP, you
                        feared for your life. But now online sentiment for the PAP has turned so
                        overwhelmingly negative that I’m afraid to post this! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489458">Moh, 2011</xref>)</p>
                </disp-quote></p>
            <p>As R. Tham (2011) observed, this was not an isolated experience: <disp-quote>
                    <p>Anti-PAP sentiments on Facebook and Twitter had reached such incredible
                        heights that people who ‘dared to criticise the opposition’ or
                        advocate the capabilities of the PAP, would be ostracised by the online
                        community…popular local blogger Wendy Cheng, a.k.a. Xiaxue, was
                        ‘flamed’ by the online community after she had expressed
                        support for the PAP on her online blog. The online resentment towards her
                        was so intense that advertisers had to pull their ads from her blog in order
                        to avoid any potential backlash.</p>
                </disp-quote></p>
            <p>While the post-election critiques of the role, influence, bias and prejudice of
                social media-based political discourses in Singapore point to an unprecedented
                consolidation of oppositional politics in social media, there has been no serious
                discussion on the nature and content of this expanded democratic participation. Most
                political blogs in Singapore that are overtly critical of the government are still
                anonymous—posting links to them on Twitter or Facebook does not carry as much
                responsibility as writing them. What seems to be on the public agenda, far from a
                desire to overthrow the state, appears to be a liberalising of the ‘illiberal
                democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489458">Zakaria,
                    2004</xref>). The ease of sharing on Twitter and the informal tone that is a
                common discursive feature which lowers barriers to access may be seen as building up
                towards a form of democratic media activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489458">Carroll and Hackett, 2006</xref>), although
                currently lacking in the element of collective action that normally defines such
                activism. In the Singapore case, social media may be seen as a mechanism that
                supports gradual democratic development as citizens get inducted into democratic
                practices of emerging publics. It may also be seen as part of a larger move towards
                democracy that has its roots outside of the nation state, even while it is used to
                deal with decidedly local issues.</p>
            <p>Tweeting and re-tweeting are recognised as a conversational practice and can be
                understood as a process of negotiating authorship, attribution and communicative
                fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971721813489458">boyd et al.,
                    2010</xref>). The practice of re-tweeting is a complex one, not least because it
                can be done in so many ways. Given the right conditions, Twitter can be a way of
                expressing solidarity with a cause in a situation where such expressions lack
                offline outlets. The rise of a political twitterati in Singapore via a platform that
                spans a wider network opens up the possibility of a discussion of publics that takes
                into account the role of the network in cultivating the public, as well as the
                potential of the network for further nurturing this public as it seeks gradual
                democratic change. In the next section a study is described that examines the
                evolution of a Singaporean public on Twitter, with a view to exploring the role of
                the platform in the gradual induction of citizens into democratic modes of
                engagement, leading to the suggestion that this process of induction falls squarely
                within the realm of the subpolitical.</p>

            <title>The Emergence of the Political Twitterati in Singapore</title>
            <p>Scholars analysing social media with a focus on Twitter have used varying
                methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489458">Hargittai and
                    Litt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971721813489458">Lassen
                    and Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489458">Lingdren and Lundstrom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971721813489458">Marwick and boyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0971721813489458">Small, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0971721813489458">Yardi and boyd, 2010</xref>). The
                approaches range from conventional qualitative/quantitative methods using
                primary/secondary data offline, to using software to retrieve tweets utilising
                interfaces available through Twitter’s Application Programming Interface
                (API). Twitter provides an API to access data, which allows programmers to
                systematise the interaction with the data pool. A call on ‘User
                timeline’ (Documentation page:
                    <uri>http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/statuses/user_timeline</uri>), provides the
                100 most recent tweets of any Twitter handle. Access to older tweets is provided by
                increasing page number which can be raised to a maximum value of 15. Similarly, in
                the case of hashtags (Documentation page:
                    <uri>http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/search</uri>), a call can provide access to
                the 100 most recent results. As in the case of tweets, by increasing page number
                older results for hashtags can also be accessed. However, unlike in the case of
                tweets, the maximum number is limited by time. We can access only one week’s
                data irrespective of how many results we have. The results appear in a format called
                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (selected because it is simple to parse). In our
                case, the programme was written in java programming language to send the requests,
                download the data and write into another file, which was copied to an Excel file for
                coding. The three basic steps in our data collection may be summarised as follows:
                (a) download tweets in JSON format based on API calls, (b) parse to get the details,
                store them in a database and (c) copy required fields to Excel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0971721813489458">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The methodology was sufficient for our purpose of identifying important tweeters and
                hashtags that were closely relevant to our focus of research. Based on this method,
                we collected and analysed data in two streams, one using general quantitative data
                from thirteen key Twitter accounts and the other using two qualitative case studies.
                Thirteen Twitter accounts were identified that were actively producing
                socio-political tweets relating to Singapore prior to the General Elections. While
                not all of these accounts were solely dedicated to political tweets, they were among
                the top few that emerged when the search term ‘Singapore’ was entered
                in the Twitter search bar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0971721813489458">6</xref></sup> The tweets of the thirteen accounts at two points in time
                (17 March 2011 and 25 May 2011) were randomly retrieved using the above mentioned
                programme that tapped on Twitter’s API, in the four-month period (February,
                March, April and May 2011) when we were closely following political developments in
                social media in Singapore as part of this research. The dates neither signify days
                with any particular acceleration of tweets nor were they too close to the polling
                date. Singapore’s 16th parliamentary General Election was held on 7 May 2011
                with the date of nomination falling on 27 April 2011. We noticed in early March the
                increase in election-related tweets in Singapore and mid-March appeared to be an
                ideal time point to catch this early interest. Although the political twitterati
                continued to be active after the election, by the end of May 2011, their enthusiasm
                was slowly shifting to the upcoming Presidential Election and we decided to capture
                the post-election data on May 25 before the subsequent drift. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0971721813489458">Table 1</xref> presents details of the thirteen
                accounts as provided on their respective profile pages. The descriptions provide a
                broad view of the various roles played by these accounts and hint at the motivations
                of the accounts with regard to influencing the socio-political sphere in Singapore.
                Given the ease of setting up and deleting Twitter accounts, we make no claims about
                the current activities and influence of the accounts in our data set. Rather, we
                present their profiles as a case study from a significant time period, with data
                representing their influence, motivation and impact at the time of collection.</p>

            <p>The total number of tweets for each account was calculated, as was the total number
                of re-tweets. The total number of tweets includes mentions, replies and re-tweets in
                a variety of forms. It must be noted that the Twitter API does not allow more than
                3,000-plus tweets at a time and that even this number is not consistently applied
                each time. However the total number of Tweets obtained does mirror to some extent
                the relative volume of tweets across the different accounts. Re-tweets are
                recognised as a measure of the influence of a Twitter account as well as a way of
                engaging in the conversation without having to compose a tweet that may not be
                valued as highly. Re-tweets are problematic in their own way, because re-tweeting
                can be done in many ways, not all of which are captured by the API. However across
                all the accounts, re-tweet count was calculated in the same manner—via the
                API and not taking into account tweets that quoted the original tweet with the RT
                tag in front of them, or simply quoted the tweet without the tag. The number of
                re-tweets to tweets was then calculated as a ratio, in order to identify the most
                influential Twitter accounts. The figures from the first data set, downloaded on the
                17 March 2011, are presented in the form of a graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0971721813489458">Figure 1</xref> that clearly shows the distribution
                of influence in the form of re-tweet ratio.</p>
            <p>The figures from the second data set, downloaded on 25 May 2011, are presented in the

                the distribution of the re-tweet ratios for these accounts. It may be noted that

                We consider this an aberration since he could have been riding a sympathy wave in
                the wake of his defeat—even the opposition parties projected him as future

            <p>A quick note on a few other critical participants with an explicit interest in
                political reforms in Singapore will be in order. Accounts such as tocsg, FakeSTcom,
                SGnews and sgelection took on roles that exploited the perceived gaps left by the
                lack of coverage of alternative views in the mainstream media. The first is managed
                by a political website known as The Online Citizen, which aims to provide balanced
                coverage of alternative viewpoints and stimulate discussion about public issues.
                Most of the tweets from this account link to posts on the parent site. The account
                is significant because the parent site was recently gazetted by the government as a
                political association, an acknowledgement of the influential power of the site in
                the public sphere. SGnews and sgelection are news aggregating accounts, posting
                links to news articles in mainstream media as well as blogs and alternative sites.
                In this way, they raise the status of citizen journalists to that of the mainstream
                media, which is seen as a mouthpiece of the government. FakeSTcom posts links to
                articles in the Straits Times, Singapore’s main newspaper, but adds witty and
                sarcastic comments that ridicule the perceived lack of independence, intelligence
                and integrity of those who run the newspaper. These 3 accounts—along with
                temasekreview (another account linked to a parent site like tocsg) and
                PAPLightning—confront the lack of balance in mainstream media, the tight
                control of the government and the contentious issues that receive little public
                debate. The account entitled yourSDP belongs to the Singapore Democratic Party, an
                opposition party.</p>

            <title>Popular Twitter Handles and Critical Counter Narratives</title>
            <p>This section takes a look at the nature of the communication model that the political
                twitterati in Singapore has developed based on the analysis of selected series and
                individual tweets by the two most popular Twitter handles in Singapore. The
                influence of these critical accounts has to be seen against the backdrop of accounts
                that appear strongly aligned with government policies which receive very low
                re-tweet counts, making tweeting itself into a subpolitics with an autonomy of its
                own. Given that Twitter allows for the exploitation of structural gaps and that
                alternative voices unrepresented in the mainstream media have utilised this
                affordance, supporters of the government probably do not feel the need to coalesce
                around these nodes. More significant is the low re-tweet count for accounts such as
                tocsg and temasekreview, which are established alternative voices online. An
                analysis of the tweets of Fake_PMLee (an account parodying the Prime Minister of
                Singapore) and mrbrown (an account run by a well-known blogger and socio-political
                commentator in Singapore) shows that there are particular features that lead to a
                high re-tweet count and to a greater observable influence in general. When viewed in
                this regard, it can be seen that temasekreview, tocsg and other accounts with low
                re-tweet count do not manifest these features in their tweets. Especially of
                interest are tweets that came in series focusing on a particular topic, because
                these indicate a commitment to give lengthy consideration to the topic that goes
                beyond a single tweet, as well as confidence that followers will stay engaged
                throughout the series of tweets and even contribute to them.</p>
            <p>Both Fake_PMLee and mrbrown are generally critical of the government and its
                institutions (this includes the mainstream media). What is immediately observable,
                however, is the comicality with which this critique is conveyed. For example, in a
                series of tweets grouped around the hashtag #SG_productivity (a reference to the
                government’s call for increased productivity among the workforce in
                Singapore), Fake_PMLee tapped on the notion of productivity and turned it towards
                how the government functions, as seen through the eyes of his persona, the Prime
                Minister: <list id="list1-0971721813489458" list-type="order">

            <p>The first tweet is a commentary on the mainstream media (MSM) and its control by the
                government. As a result, local events and issues tend to be covered less critically
                than those of other countries. Most articles on local issues tend to read like
                educational missives, in line with the way in which the role and responsibility of
                the press is viewed by the government. Fake_PMLee’s suggestion to increase
                productivity by abandoning the farce of press freedom and freeing up reporters to
                critique other countries by directly publishing government press releases is thus a
                pithy comment on press freedom, state control, low quality of journalism and the
                productivity rhetoric. The second tweet references a suggestion made in parliament
                to cut down on the time allotted for each speech and points to the futility of
                debate in a context where decisions are made based on efficiency and control rather
                than consultation and consensus. The third tweet is especially sharp and makes
                reference to the PAP’s practice of bringing defamation suits against what
                they claim as unsubstantiated allegations. The idea of developing a template as an
                efficiency measure pokes fun not only at the use of defamation suits as an
                instrument of control, but at the technocratic paradigm within which the government
                operates. The last tweet above mentions the debate on the sudden influx of new
                citizens before the General Elections. While the government explained this in terms
                of economic necessity, the explanation was not one that was widely accepted and in
                fact became an election issue that cost the PAP some votes. This tweet expands the
                productivity theme even further into the sphere of instrumentality and hints at the
                idea that the PAP will do whatever needs to be done to ensure that its goals are
                met. In fact another tweet on the topic by Fake_PMLee was re-tweeted 24 times,
                showing that it resonated with his followers: <disp-quote>
                    <p>#SGporeans, don’t fret. At current rate, the early PRC &amp; Indian
                        immigrants will soon complain abt our open immigration policy. #NDRsg</p>
                </disp-quote></p>
            <p>The reference is made to new immigrants from India and China (the two main source
                countries in the present wave of immigration, but also two of the four major ethnic
                groups in Singapore), pointing to the rapidity with which they are being brought in
                and provided citizenship. That immigrants who themselves benefited only recently
                from an open immigration policy could turn around and criticise it for being too
                open to the next wave sounds enormously ironic. This critique of government policy
                couched in wit and sarcasm is a quality of the tweets that get frequently
                re-tweeted.</p>
            <p>mrbrown’s tweets show the same tendency towards satirical critique. For
                example, during the Prime Minister’s National Day Rally speech in 2010,
                mrbrown tweeted the following: <list id="list2-0971721813489458" list-type="order">

                </list></p>
            <p>The speech was delivered at a time when immigration was a contentious issue and
                opposition parties were expressing dissatisfaction with government policy that
                encouraged immigration based on economic exigency. The example of Canada’s
                policy of open immigration encouraging Microsoft to hire talent there is met here
                with witty cynicism and Singapore’s small size is alluded to as a way of
                deriding the comparison. It reflects the general objection to increasingly
                overcrowded conditions and a perception that infrastructure cannot cope with a large
                influx of immigrants. The second tweet is with reference to the government’s
                pay-out of S$9,000 to citizens who have completed their compulsory
                two-and-a-half-year stint in the army. Widely perceived as a way of reducing the
                tension over the issue—which again pitted new citizens and permanent
                residents who don’t have to serve National Service if they are past a certain
                age against existing citizens who cannot avoid it—the monetary reward is
                mocked by mrbrown as being insufficient compensation. Instead, he jokes, he will pay
                it to the government so that he does not have to serve the time in the army. The
                third tweet references the high salaries that ministers in Singapore receive,
                another contentious issue among the population. Here mrbrown contrasts the salary of
                the Prime Minister with the content of the speech where Singaporeans are told that
                they must be prepared to make do with less in challenging economic times. The wit in
                the construction of the tweet reinforces the simple yet stinging critique—not
                quite directly accusing the government of hypocrisy and yet alluding to it in an
                unmistakable way.</p>
            <p>Fake_PMLee tweets as soon as any issue comes up, such as the Youth Olympic Games
                (YOG), the floods in the central shopping district of Orchard Road or the elections.
                This timeliness resonates with his followers and he is re-tweeted very quickly by
                many of them. For example, the following tweets were posted when the Youth Olympic
                Games coincided with heavy rain and floods. Both the games and the floods were
                contentious issues, the former because of multiple hitches and overspending and the
                latter because they were later proven to have been due to structural deficiencies
                and yet the authorities initially denied responsibility. Combining the two
                issues—the efficiency of the city state in holding a major event like YOG and
                the cracks in the credibility of the efficiency paradigm reflected in the flooding
                of Orchard Road—Fake_PMLee posted: <list id="list3-0971721813489458" list-type="order">

            <p>Unlike news-aggregating accounts that merely post links to articles, accounts of
                organisations that report on their events, or even alternative news accounts that
                link and report but do not generally initiate or take part in conversations on
                Twitter, Fake_PMLee and mrbrown both actively engage their followers through
                mentions, replies, sharing links with their own related comments attached (as
                opposed to leaving the link to stand on its own), re-tweeting and quoting tweets.
                The personal involvement creates a situation whereby their strong influence
                percolates down to smaller individual accounts—not just in terms of their
                tweets being re-tweeted, but also in terms of drawing more people into the
                conversation. An example of active engagement is the way in which mrbrown devises
                hashtags and re-tweets some of the tweets that contain them: <list id="list4-0971721813489458" list-type="order">

            <p>The hashtag here refers to a speech made by a senior minister encouraging
                Singaporeans not to complain too much and to accept certain realities of life.
                Subtly critiqued by mrbrown in a video he created and posted on his blog, the
                comment was turned into a hashtag ‘#smgohsaysdontcomplaintoomuch’
                (expanded to mean ‘Senior Minister Goh says don’t complain too
                much’) that was then creatively applied to a wide range of tweets. Any sort
                of complaint was tagged with the hashtag and re-tweeted, with the effect that his
                timeline contained a series of tweets reframed as political commentary (however
                indirect), that could have the outcome of gradually socialising his followers into
                making connections, politicising ideas and critiquing established practices,
                traditions and norms.</p>
            <p>One of the central aspects of the ‘series tweets’ is that they
                construct narratives which resemble storytelling. Using the technique of
                ‘series tweets’ these two prominent accounts attempt to create a set
                of alternative narratives and a shared field of political experience to provide
                legitimacy to the counter narratives which challenge the carefully constructed
                Singaporean stories of progress, economic success, productivity and efficiency. On
                the one hand, it is clear that the political twitterati did not aim to generate mass
                political mobilisation or become instrumental in triggering massive protests as seen
                in several other parts of the world where affordances of the platform, ostensibly,
                helped shape large social and political movements for democracy. Nor did they
                associate directly with any particular opposition party or subpolitical movement
                within the civil society to create alliances that have a potential to exert
                extra-parliamentary coercion for democratic reforms. However, the absence of such
                explicit political manoeuvring does not make the contribution of political
                twitterati in Singapore inconsequential. The substantive nature of the intervention
                is brought out by the specific accomplishment of successfully challenging the
                official narratives and ‘moral claims (that were) commonly accepted by
                Singaporeans, including members of opposition parties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489458">Chua, 1994</xref>, p. 657).</p>

            <title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
            <p>The political engagements of the Singaporean twitterati appear to be similar to what
                Beck (1997) calls subpolitics with traces of what Bakardjieva (2009) has identified
                as a deeper level of political engagement called subactivism. While the
                ‘organised and/or publicly traceable initiatives of social movements and
                individuals finding themselves in strategic points of the social system’
                (ibid., p. 96) are counted as subpolitics, Bakardjieva’s approach focuses on
                ‘small-scale, often individual decisions and actions that have either a
                political or ethical frame of reference (or both) and remain submerged in everyday
                life’ (ibid.). Bakardjieva highlights the potential for subactivism to be
                mobilised by trigger events and transformed into overt public activism and argues
                that subactivism ‘is that essential bedrock against which individual
                citizens’ capacity for participation in subpolitics or in the formal
                political institutions of the public world is shaped and nurtured’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489458">Bakardjieva, 2009</xref>, p.
                96).</p>
            <p>In this study, we have highlighted the importance and influence of subpolitics as an
                autonomous process without teleological implications. This is particularly striking
                when transposed against the specific history of democratic reforms in Singapore.
                Chua (1994, p. 655) had noted that there are conceptual and substantive difficulties
                in placing Singapore in the democratisation debate as ‘a highly stable polity
                which many critics continue to characterise as an “authoritarian
                regime”’. He argued that the perception that this authoritarian regime
                was ‘popularly elected, financially uncorrupt, manages the economy well, has
                improved the population’s standard of living and governs through due
                parliamentary process, all with a dash of self-sacrifice on the part of its leaders
                and members, adds up to a very powerful set of legitimatizing elements’
                (ibid., p. 657). Our study shows that the political twitterati in Singapore has
                systematically taken on this carefully articulated discourse of efficiency and
                success. The popular Twitter handles have constructed counter images through tweets
                that are infused with wit, sarcasm, parody and satire, that are generative of a
                powerful mode of subpolitics. This new political engagement links up organically
                neither with opposition parties nor any particular political strata within the civil
                society in Singapore.</p>
            <p>De Vries (2007) puts forward the argument that more attention needs to be given to
                the nature of the political in considerations of the subpolitical. His invocation of
                the Aristotelian framework, with its explication of the more instrumental
                    <italic>poiesis</italic> and the more metadiscursive <italic>praxis</italic>,
                has value for the consideration of the future of democracy in Singapore. This is
                especially so in light of arguments about coercion and control. Viewing the
                subpolitical through the lens of <italic>praxis</italic> allows for the suggestion
                that a culture of democratic discourse, as seeded by action such as that of the
                twitterati, may have more long-term and less overt effects. Indeed, the Singapore
                state’s response to the emergence of the new media-based Singaporean public
                is characterised by democratic counter critique and political engagement. The belief
                that the state’s approach to new media will be one that essentially
                encompasses strategic moves of ‘embracing electronic media but suppressing
                civil society’ and of ‘preventing the emergence of organised social
                and political forces that could lead to a genuine civil society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971721813489458">Rodan, 2003</xref>, p. 503), seems
                unfounded.</p>
            <p>The identification of thirteen Twitter accounts, ten of which made use of a
                structural gap in the wider socio-political context and took up the enabling
                features of the Twitter platform to reach a relevant audience, allow a claim to be
                made about the emergence of a Singaporean public on Twitter. While the extent of
                influence of all thirteen accounts is not equal, their very presence stimulates
                political engagement by others on Twitter, even if only through re-tweeting. However
                re-tweeting is not an insignificant activity. It carries information further and
                draws more people into the conversation. A case study of two highly influential
                Twitter accounts shows that effective use is being made of Twitter’s
                affordances to persuasively engage in commentary at an intensity that would not be
                possible in any other sphere, online or offline. In 140 characters at a time,
                capitalising on Twitter’s affordances to satirically critique the government,
                ensure timeliness and appropriateness and actively engage their followers, they have
                drawn around them a network that enthusiastically passes on their cleverly crafted
                tweets.</p>
            <p>Tweets generated immediately prior to the General Election in May 2011, along with
                posts on Facebook in the same time period, were cited widely as major reasons for
                the opposition winning an unprecedented six seats in Parliament. Subsequent
                commentaries in the state-mediated press had also given a high level of coverage to
                the role of social media and the Prime Minister acknowledged the prominence of this
                role in his speech to the nation on National Day. Nevertheless, this unprecedented
                increase in political participation through social media did not lead to any radical
                changes in the political system in Singapore. The PAP retained their majoritarian
                dominance and all the contentious policies which had been hotly debated at
                opposition rallies prior to the Elections remained in place after the event,
                although with promises that they would be looked into, bearing in mind the pragmatic
                need for survival in a competitive economy. There was no collective action that
                arose out of the discourse of political engagement on social media and other online
                sites. Hong Lim Park was in no way turning into Tahrir Square.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0971721813489458">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Early scholarly work on electronic democracy has very perceptively captured the
                problems of over-glorification of the potentials of new media technology for
                democratic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971721813489458">Friedland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489458">Sawhney, 1996</xref>). Friedland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971721813489458">1996</xref>, p. 187) identifies three pertinent
                perspectives: first, he points to the threat that growth of information inequality
                poses for broad democratic participation. Second, he brings out the dangers of state
                and corporate engagement in electronic surveillance of civil society. Third, he
                highlights how new forms of citizenship and public life are both enabled by new
                technology and restricted by market power and surveillance. In line with these early
                critiques of electronic democracy we have argued that Singaporeans on Twitter have
                learned to use the affordances of the platform and are being inducted into a mode of
                communication that the platform has made possible while emphasising the need for
                creating fields of shared experiences for the sustenance of successful democratic
                participation. At the same time, we caution against any suggestion of a ground
                breaking ‘Twitter revolution’ in Singapore and share the idea that to
                remain complacent about the need for advancing further the reformist liberal
                democratic agenda would be politically undesirable.</p>

                    <p>One of the most cited examples comes from Moldova where during the disputed
                        election in 2009, a few local Twitter activists spread news about their
                        ‘flashmob’ and launched a campaign which resulted in huge
                        demonstrations and loud protests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489458">Grossman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971721813489458">Morozov, 2009b</xref>;

                        Not surprisingly, more recent studies point to the fact that Twitter is
                        being increasingly used as a forum for political deliberation and online
                        messages on Twitter tend to reliably reflect offline political and social
