<abstract>
<p>This study had three objectives: (a) to examine compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens (BBPs) Standard at eight correctional facilities, (b) to identify potential barriers to compliance, and (c) to discuss steps to address these barriers. Eight facilities of different sizes and locations were visited to examine employer adherence to 15 selected BBP risk reduction activities. Facility compliance was less than 50% for four activities: updating exposure control plans, implementing use of appropriate safer medical devices, soliciting employee input on selection of safer devices, and training medical staff when such devices are implemented. Inconsistent compliance may be due to difficulties in applying the standards in the correctional health care work setting. Any BBP training and health communication activities targeted to correctional health care workers should be tailored to the correctional facility setting.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Many health care workers are at risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens (BBPs) in the performance of their day-to-day job duties. Those who work in correctional facilities may be at even higher risk due to the unpredictable nature of their work environment and the high prevalence of BBPs in the population they treat. In studies of correctional health care facilities, it has been noted that higher priority is given to security than to exposure prevention and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421466">Gershon, Green-McKenzie, &amp; Swetz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>). For example, routine supplies such as gloves may not be readily available as they may be stored away to prevent inmates from using them as weapons. The prevalence of HIV infection and hepatitis B virus infection in incarcerated populations has been reported to be 2 to 6 times higher than in the general U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345811421466">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345811421466">Macalino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345811421466">Maruschak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421466">McQuillan et al., 1999</xref>) and 10 to 20 times higher for hepatitis C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345811421466">Armstrong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345811421466">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345811421466">Spaulding, Greene, Davidson, Schneidermann, &amp; Rich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078345811421466">Vlahov, Nelson, Quinn, &amp; Kendig, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>CDC has provided detailed, research-based guidelines on the prevention and control of occupational exposures to BBPs among health care and public safety workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345811421466">CDC, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421466">2003</xref>). Relying substantially on these guidelines, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard of 1991 and a revision to the standard dictated by the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (NSPA) of 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421466">OSHA, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345811421466">2001</xref>; NSPA, 2002). Compliance with these standards has been found to significantly reduce the risk that workers will contract a bloodborne disease in the course of their work (NSPA, 2002). However, the effectiveness of these standards in nontraditional health care settings is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345811421466">Gershon, Qureshi, Gurney, Rosen, &amp; Hogan, 2002</xref>). In this article, we examine compliance with these standards in one such nontraditional setting, health care in correctional facilities.</p>
<p>The article has three primary objectives: (a) to report on compliance with 15 key BBP risk reduction standards in a sample of eight correctional facilities, (b) to identify potential barriers to compliance with the standards, and (c) to discuss steps that can be taken to address these barriers.</p>

<sec id="section2-1078345811421466">
<title>Method</title>
<p>For this study, we determined that it was not feasible to visit and collect data on a random sample of the 100 federal, 1,700 state, and 3,300 local jails and prisons in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078345811421466">Stephan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078345811421466">2008</xref>). Instead, we decided to conduct site visits to a diverse set of eight correctional facilities to obtain as broad a view as possible of BBP risk reduction activities. We determined that the following recruitment criteria would satisfy this goal: (a) sites should include at least two geographically dispersed locations; (b) sites should include federal and state prisons and large and small county or municipal jails; and (c) sites should include urban, suburban, and rural locales.</p>
<p>We consulted with correctional health care experts to compile a list of correctional facilities that met these criteria and would agree to a site visit. We then obtained supplemental information (names of other facilities located near the recommended facilities, number and type of inmates, number of health care staff, address, and contact information) through Internet searches and telephone exchanges. After reviewing the list of candidate facilities, we selected two regions for recruiting: the mid-Atlantic states (Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Washington, DC) and Texas. Using a letter of support from the American Correctional Association, we contacted facilities by telephone to identify and discuss the study with the appropriate contact person. In general, the contact person was the administrative head of the health or medical clinic/unit. The calls were followed with an email or fax that included a letter briefly describing the visit along with the endorsement letter. Additional follow-up contacts were made until eight facilities from these locations were recruited for site visits.</p>
<p>Prior to visiting the facilities, the study team reviewed the OSHA BBP exposure standards (OSHA, 1992, 2001; NSPA, 2002), CDC guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345811421466">CDC, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421466">2003</xref>), and published studies of correctional health care workers (CHCWs) to determine the key factors relating to CHCW risk of occupational BBP exposures.

 summarizes the 15 injury prevention activities, lists the relevant federal OSHA regulations, and provides a brief description of the regulations. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970 encourages states to develop and operate their own job safety and health programs that are at least as effective as comparable federal standards. Currently, 22 states and jurisdictions operate complete state plans that cover both the private sector and state and local government employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345811421466">OSHA, 1993</xref>). The four mid-Atlantic correctional facilities we studied were all in âstate planâ states; therefore, all employees were covered by standards at least as stringent as federal OSHA standards. Four of our study sites were in Texas, a state covered by federal OSHA regulations. State and local government workers are excluded from federal coverage under the OSH Act. However, Texas has adopted state BBP regulations âanalogous with federal OSHA BBP standardsâ that cover public sector (state and local government) workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078345811421466">Texas Department of State Health Services, 2006</xref>). The Texas regulations are quite similar to OSHA regulations, so subsequent references to guidelines or recommendations are meant to encompass both sets of study sites.</p>

<p>All facility visits were 1 day long and were conducted by a team of at least one interviewer/focus group moderator and one industrial hygienist familiar with BBP standards and procedures. All visits were conducted during the day shift, which was the most heavily staffed at all of the sites. Copies of relevant BBP materials were requested from the appropriate health care unit manager, including the ECP, training materials, infection control procedures, standard operating procedures, and other policies or materials that facility staff considered relevant to BBP exposures. A tour of the health facility/unit was conducted, and the work practices of the health care workers were observed. Observations were supplemented with discussions with as many administrators, management, and frontline staff as were available during our visit. The purpose of the observations and discussions was to identify the areas and procedures where BBP exposures may occur, describe the equipment and procedures used to protect workers from exposure, and document observed workplace barriers. Structured guides to collect desired information were prepared and used at all sites.</p>
<p>After the site visits were concluded, the research team assigned a pass/fail rating to each of the 15 standards for each of the eight facilities. This rating was a summary assessment based on reviewer observations, records reviews, and discussions with facility staff and management.</p>

<p>Characteristics of the eight correctional facilities and their health care operations are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345811421466">Table 2</xref>
. The largest facility housed up to 3,400 inmates and the smallest handled up to 150. The facilities spanned all security levels and handled both male and female inmates. Some offered a suite of medical, diagnostic, psychological, and dental care, while others provided routine or emergency care only and transported inmates to local health facilities for further treatment. 50 CHCW staff across the eight facilities participated in discussions with project staff. Their job titles included medical director, physician, dentist, pharmacist, infection control nurse, registered nurse, nurse practitioner, health/clinic administrator, physician assistant, phlebotomist, medical/laboratory technician, licensed practical nurse, paramedic, and public health educator. At least one senior manager (who was responsible for medical treatment of inmates) from each facility was interviewed. Of the 50 staff, 38 were frontline, nonsupervisory medical staff with primary responsibility for patient treatment. The remaining 12 staff had job titles of administrator, director, or manager. Five of the 12 regularly performed medical treatment in addition to their management responsibilities.</p>

<title>ECP</title>
<p>While seven of the eight facilities visited had written ECPs, only two reviewed and updated the plans annually. Only the federal prison medical center complied with the two standards added by the NSPA in 2001 (NSPA, 2002): documenting annual consideration and implementation of new medical devices and soliciting employee input on identification, evaluation, and selection of safer medical devices. Several managers at noncompliant facilities mentioned that they did ask for employee input on what new devices (including needleless or other engineered safety devices) should be purchased, but input was not obtained consistently and was documented at only one site. Some employees mentioned that they suggested equipment and supplies for purchase, but there was clearly no consistent organizational process that would meet the intent of the NSPA or the State of Texas regulations.</p>
<p>At two facilities, the required elements of the ECP were spread throughout many sections in multivolume manuals, making it difficult to determine if all elements were present. Although one facility had an ECP with a listing of job classifications and an exposure determination for each job, the information had not been updated since the manual was written 5 years earlier. The small county jail had no BBP program or ECP and the medic-jailor did not even know what an ECP was. One of the larger county jails had an ECP (developed by the county risk assessorâs office and apparently never updated), but none of the medical staff knew that it existed. At the federal prison medical center, staff exposure evaluation folders were present on every counter. The folders had the phone number of the National Cliniciansâ Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078345811421466">1</xref> on the front cover, instructions taped to the inside cover, and all the forms needed following an exposure: assessment, precounseling session, PEP declination, PEP Fact Sheet, and consent for testing. Also, everyone knew where the ECP was located in their area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345811421466">
<title>PPE</title>
<p>Gloves were observed in use in every facility. Of the eight facilities, seven had wall-mounted disposable exam gloves in each exam room. In one emergency treatment room, gloves were locked in a cabinet, but staff reported that wall-mount boxes were on order. In one treatment room, the glove box was empty. Multiple glove sizes were available at all facilities. Of the eight facilities, seven had nitrile and nonpowdered latex gloves available.</p>
<p>Other forms of PPE, such as impermeable disposable gowns, face shields, safety glasses, and disposable masks, were available at all facilities. However, in four facilities, these forms of PPE were not readily accessible in all treatment areas because they were stored in central supply units or cabinets. In the small county jail, the medical unit personnel did not know that they had any PPE other than gloves, but disposable masks and gowns were found in supply cabinets upon further inspection. The use of PPE other than gloves was actually observed in only three facilities. In one facility, disposable gowns were worn by a nurse in a wound cleaning room, by the phlebotomist in the blood draw room, and by the dentist and dental hygienists. Face shields were worn occasionally by the wound nurse and were reportedly worn by the dentist, ophthalmologist, and podiatrist. In another facility, a disposable gown and full face shield were worn by the dentist during a tooth extraction. In another phlebotomy room, one of the two technicians wore a gown.</p>
<p>Overall, the reported use of PPE other than gloves was procedure-specific. A common sentiment expressed by CHCW staff was that PPE other than gloves was not used or needed if âthey donât do anything majorâ or if minimal blood was involved in a procedure. They felt the use of nonglove PPE was generally for more emergency-type care, which in many cases is consistent with standard precautions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345811421466">CDC, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345811421466">
<title>Engineering Controls</title>
<p>All facilities had sharps containers in exam and treatment rooms; most were wall mounted. In one facility, two of the sharps containers were still in use even though they were past the âfullâ line on the container. Three facilities followed a policy not to carry sharps into cell areas. In the other five facilities, the jump bag (or kit for responding to emergencies in the cell areas) contained sharps, some of which lacked engineered safety features. In three of those facilities, CHCWs did not take along portable sharps disposal containers.</p>
<p>Sharps with engineered safety features were observed in use at all eight facilities. Most CHCWs reported provision and use of sharps with engineered safety features, although a few commented that traditional needle devices were necessary in specific situations because acceptable alternatives were not yet available (e.g., deep venous punctures for inmates who used intravenous drugs and whose veins were mostly collapsed, administering hepatitis A/B combination vaccine). In one facility, the state health department supplied tuberculosis testing syringes that did not have safety features.</p>
<p>Because of the short duration of the site visits and the large number of sharps in use at the medical facilities, we were not able to determine if sharps with engineered safety features were implemented to the extent possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078345811421466">
<title>Hepatitis B Vaccine</title>
<p>All of the CHCWs contacted stated that they had received the hepatitis B vaccine. All were aware that it was the employerâs responsibility to offer the vaccine free of charge and to document any declinations. No one knew of any staff member who had declined. They felt that the reason for the high rate of compliance was because they knew that they worked in a high-risk environment. At one facility, a new employee had been offered the hepatitis B vaccine at time of hire, but several months had elapsed and arrangements still had not been made to provide the vaccine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345811421466">
<title>Training</title>
<p>All but one facility provided the required BBP training when CHCW staff were hired. Based on a review of training records and discussions with staff, annual training sessions appeared to adequately cover the elements specified in OSHA and State of Texas regulations, including what steps need to be taken after an exposure event occurs. One facility provided BBP training upon hire but provided neither refresher training nor BBP educational material. Except for the federal prison medical center, no other facility provided training on changes to tasks or procedures that could affect employee exposure or on the use and features of newly adopted safer medical devices. BBP training had never been conducted at the small county jail, and the jailor in charge of the medical unit had never received BBP training.</p>
<p>Typical training sessions consisted of a classroom lecture along with a slide presentation. Some facilities reported using a video to supplement the trainings, as well as scenario-based examples, PPE demonstrations, game-formatted training, and posttests. Some sites maintained their educational materials on their intranet so that employees could refer to it as needed. Some CHCWs did not like the videos used and said they were âout-of-date.â The annual training was mentioned by many as the best way to reach CHCWs because they have limited personal time to attend other types of in-service training or read educational materials about BBP exposure. Two facilities had dedicated health educators. In other facilities, an infection control officer was typically responsible for BBP training. Most trainers developed their own BBP training material, generally from existing materials or from materials downloaded from CDC or state health departments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Few studies of BBP risk and risk reduction activities among health care workers in correctional settings have been conducted, and no consistent assessment has been made as to how well BBP guidance is adopted in these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421466">Gershon, Qureshi, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345811421466">Gershon, Sherman, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345811421466">Green-McKenzie, Gershon, &amp; Karkashian, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421466">Haltmeier, Hall, &amp; Boesch, 1991</xref>). The results of these few studies were substantially based on questionnaire data provided by individual CHCWs in targeted locations. Only one of these studies documented an objective validation of the questionnaire data by conducting 2- to 4-hour âOSHA-typeâ walk-through surveys at four large health units in one state correctional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>While we also obtained information from employees at each site using nonstructured interviewing techniques, we conducted walk-through surveys at each site, observed work practices, and discussed BBP policies and practices with administrative and medical management staffs. We felt it important to obtain an employer-centered orientation to the topic because CDC, OSHA, and the State of Texas emphasize the employerâs responsibility to establish and enforce appropriate BBP work standards and provide supplies and equipment that reduce or eliminate potential worker exposures. Finally, our study is the first to collect data on correctional facilities after OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard in 2001 in accordance with the NSPA. That revision clarified the need for employers to select safer medical devices, involve employees in the identification and selection of such devices, and maintain a log of injuries from contaminated sharps (NSPA, 2002). We made an effort to examine these new topic areas with the exception of the sharps injury log. We felt that requesting access to potentially confidential medical information from the log could complicate our recruiting and access to sites, so we simply asked employees if they had been exposed and had reported such exposures to their employer. Similar to the results of other studies that examined exposure reporting, we found that about half of the employees questioned had been exposed in their current jobs and about half of that number actually reported the exposure incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421466">Gershon, Green-McKenzie, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345811421466">Gershon, Qureshi, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421466">Gershon, Qureshi, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421466">Gershon, Sherman, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421466">Haltmeier et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The one clear pattern that emerged from this study was a lack of compliance with the NSPA changes instituted in 2001, primarily involving the use of safer medical devices. Only 12% compliance was demonstrated for the three activities relating to safer medical devices.</p>
<sec id="section10-1078345811421466">
<title>Results by Functional Category</title>
<p>The following is a brief discussion of the results for each functional category examined.</p>
<sec id="section11-1078345811421466">
<title>ECP</title>
<p>The development and regular updating of a facilityâs ECP is considered a critical starting point for reducing the risk of worker exposure to BBPs (NSPA, 2002). The annual update should act as a trigger to the person responsible for the program to conduct annual refresher training and to review all components of the ECP. Our site visits found that medical staff and management do not use the ECP as a living document that can facilitate exposure reduction and can help monitor exposure control activities. The ECPs seemed to have been established merely to meet the requirements to have an ECP rather than to be used as a guide for effective risk reduction. While all but one small facility had an ECP, only one had updated the plan annually and had addressed the newer regulations concerning consideration of safer medical devices and soliciting employee input on the identification and selection of such devices. Most staff members did not seem to know what an ECP was nor its purpose; the staff who were aware of an ECP thought it was limited to postexposure procedures. The only other study of CHCWs that specifically addressed ECP issues found that the facilities involved had inadequate risk management controls, were missing safety policy manuals and did not adequately address safety program elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421466">Gershon, Green-McKenzie, et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The most significant deficiency noted was the virtual absence of the involvement of nonmanagerial employees in the identification, evaluation, and selection of newer, safer medical devices developed to reduce BBP exposures. Only one facility visited was in compliance with this provision and documented the procedures for obtaining employee input. Management staff at six of the eight facilities were not aware that employee involvement should be obtained. It appears that this provision of the NSPA has not yet filtered into the normal operation of seven of the eight facilities we visited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1078345811421466">
<title>PPE</title>
<p>Of the eight facilities visited, seven provided an adequate, accessible supply of gloves to health care staff when needed, the one exception being the small county jail that provided limited emergency care. Other types of PPE were present but were not accessible to all treatment sites in half of the facilities. Most management and CHCW staff did not see this as a significant problem because events necessitating use of face shields, goggles, and gowns were rare. They felt they were often able to anticipate the need for âextraordinaryâ measures and could obtain needed PPE ahead of time. Echoing a concern expressed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421466">Gershon, Green-McKenzie, et al., 2002</xref>), the staff we talked to were more concerned about the possibility that gloves and other PPE could be converted to weapons than they were about having PPE readily accessible. The glove availability and accessibility results in our study were consistent with the findings of three studies that asked about strict glove usage (72% to 92%) and perception of glove availability (92% to 96%). The use and availability of other types of PPE ranged from 29% to 53% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1078345811421466">
<title>Engineering controls</title>
<p>Although acceptable sharps containers were available in all examining rooms in all facilities, they were not available in three facilities when CHCWs needed to enter inmate holding areas and cells to provide treatment. In three facilities, CHCW staff brought sharps in their treatment bags or kits to treat the medical emergencies and carried the contaminated sharps out with them to dispose into a sharps container in treatment rooms. Portable sharps containers are recommended for this type of situation. This same issue was identified as a potential exposure hazard in other studies that reported fully compliant sharps disposal procedures between 64% and 92% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421466">Gershon, Green-McKenzie, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345811421466">Green-McKenzie et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1078345811421466">
<title>Hepatitis B vaccine</title>
<p>All of the respondents in our study reported receiving the full vaccine series, contrary to results from earlier studies. The most commonly reported reason for compliance was concern about providing medical treatment to a high-risk, unpredictable population and the perceived increased risk of contracting a BBP from a contaminated needlestick. The one deficiency we detected was an employer delay in providing the vaccine series to a new employee within 10 days of hire. Although the hepatitis B vaccine has been available since 1982 and has been shown to be a highly effective preventive measure with minimal side effects, early studies showed a notable percentage of health care workers had not received the vaccine at all or had not received a full vaccine regimen. For example, a 1990 study reported that only 35% of the CHCW staff had received all three doses of the vaccine (note that this was prior to the OSHA BBP standard but after the 1987 CDC hepatitis B vaccination recommendation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421466">Haltmeier et al., 1991</xref>). Recent studies indicate improved compliance, with CHCWs either obtaining the vaccine or declining after being advised of their rights to obtain it free of charge. A study using data collected in 1999 and 2000 reported full vaccine series for 64% of medical staff with 12% declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421466">Gershon et al., 2005</xref>), while a study in 2007 reported 72% fully vaccinated with 13% declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421466">Gershon, Sherman, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1078345811421466">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Although most facilities understand the need to provide initial and annual refresher BBP training, only one facility provided timely training on the implementation and use of newly acquired equipment and devices engineered to reduce exposures. Several studies have noted that BBP exposures may initially rise when safer medical devices are introduced if workers are not properly trained on how the devices should be used. Although such training has been required since the promulgation of OSHAâs Bloodborne Pathogens Standard in 1991, it received renewed emphasis with the provisions directed by the NSPA. It appears, however, that training has not kept pace with the adoption of such devices. From our discussions with management staff and employees, it appears that facility size affects the timing, quality, and availability of BBP training. The larger correctional facilities had larger administrative and support staffs that specialized in employee safety and health and had the resources to implement targeted training. Jails, on the other hand, are generally small (75% have fewer than 500 inmates) and may be staffed by only one or two medical service providers who also have nonmedical duties. Staff turnover in the smaller facilities is reportedly high, hindering efforts to provide adequate BBP training for all staff. Training tends to be more generic and less adapted to the smaller facilities and may not be updated regularly to consider changes in technology or regulations. Scheduling annual refresher training for a small staff is a considerable challenge: Staff cannot be pulled out of service because there is no backup capacity, medical services generally need to be available around the clock all year long, and the designated âtrainerâ is commonly a practitioner who has a full workload and often has to prepare and deliver training on nonduty time. To conduct ad hoc training on newly adopted safer medical devices is even more difficult.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1078345811421466">
<title>Barriers to Compliance</title>
<p>Of the eight facilities in our study, the federal prison medical center exhibited the highest overall compliance (86%) with the BBP standard elements we studied. That facility had almost 4 times the staff and double the inmate population under treatment of any other facility studied. It had a well-developed BBP prevention and training program and staff dedicated to infection control. The small, rural Texas county jail demonstrated the poorest compliance (21%) of all facilities. The jail was 4 times smaller than the next largest facility we studied and had only one staff member with medical training. That jail had no formal training or infection control programs. Without considering these extremes, the size of staff, size of the medical treatment operation, and size of the inmate population were not correlated with better compliance. For example, the mid-Atlantic large county detention center #1 demonstrated better compliance (78%) than the Texas state jail (64%), a facility twice its size.</p>
<p>Improvements in compliance may be slow in coming for several reasons. First, a recurrent theme that we heard during site visits was that change occurs very slowly in the correctional environment. By design, correctional facilities adhere to a traditional hierarchical structure that is highly procedure driven. These organizational structures may include multiple positions such as wardens, prison directors, and county administrators who have decision-making authority but are outside of the medical treatment operation. Therefore, decisions on purchasing safer medical devices, for example, may be made by personnel who are not cognizant of BBP exposure concerns. Second, while larger facility size does not consistently correlate with more consistent adherence to BBP protection guidelines, the availability of staff to attend to risk reduction efforts is potentially beneficial. However, facility management staff indicated little chance that additional staffing and resources would be allocated to ensuring adherence to these guidelines. Any efforts would need to be within existing funding and staffing levels. Finally, appropriate consideration must be given to the fact that medical treatment is not the primary reason why correctional facilities exist. Health care is a supporting activity for the incarceration of inmates, so the organization may provide proportionately less attention and resources to that effort. Protecting staff from assault will always take priority over the less obvious risk of infection from BBPs.</p>
<p>The CHCW staff we interviewed demonstrated little awareness of the BBP-related publications and websites that were presented during our discussions. According to these staff, any materials developed for CHCWs need to be concise, short, easy to read, readily available, and adapted to the health care environment in corrections. Because Internet access is limited at some correctional facilities for security reasons, materials should be made available in hard copy as via the Web. Posters were more enthusiastically supported than pamphlets because CHCWsâ busy schedules prevent them from taking time to read lengthier materials.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, CDCâs National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) posted a correctional health care webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/correctionalhcw/">www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/correctionalhcw/</ext-link>) that highlights some of the deficiencies we found and presents information and tools to correct them. To reach those who lack readily available Internet access, we developed and mailed two posters and two brochures (along with the link to the correctional health care webpage) to all of the correctional facilities in the United States that provide medical care. Considering the potential barriers identified, the poster content was targeted to the frontline CHCW and the brochure content was targeted to facility administrators and health care operations management. We are in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of our dissemination methods and communication channels. Meanwhile, state and local governments and other organizations considering trying to reach this worker population should keep in mind potential limitations and methods to overcome them.</p>
<p>From what we observed during site visits, simple, low-cost solutions to the deficiencies we detected are often available. For example, a lockable sharps disposal container could be mounted to a mobile cart for use when CHCWs need to enter secured inmate areas for medical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345811421466">NIOSH, 1998</xref>). This would eliminate situations where CHCWs transport used sharps out of inmate areas for disposal elsewhere. In addition, CDCâs <italic>Workbook for Designing, Implementing, and Evaluating a Sharps Injury Prevention Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345811421466">CDC, 2004</xref>) could be a useful tool for correctional health care administrators. Use of this workbook could help address deficiencies we noted in ECPs and training. Larger facilities may have the capacity to implement the full scope of the workbook, but as the authors note, ââ¦ not all parts or activities will be relevant to every health care organization â¦ CDC encourages health care organizations to use whatever they find helpful and necessary for their sharps injury prevention program.â</p>
<p>The identification of such simple solutions would need to be effectively communicated to CHCW staff and employers using multiple pathways and methods including direct mail, government webpages, trade journals, and trade associations. Additional research will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used to reach CHCWs.</p>
<p>We do need to acknowledge two important limitations of this study. While no central database of correctional medical facilities exists in the United States, our work indicates that about 1,200 facilities provide some level of medical treatment. One limitation is that our targeted sample, which covered a little more than one half of 1% of these facilities, cannot be considered representative of the totality of correctional medical facilities. The second limitation involves our assignment of a summary compliance rating to each facility based on a 1-day, 8-hour site visit. We were not able to talk to all health care staff in the larger facilities and were able to observe only a very small number of procedures due to privacy and security concerns. We were unable to cover all work shifts at any site. Therefore, our activity scoring, which was based only on the normal daytime shift, may not be representative for all shifts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although most BBP regulations and guidelines were being adhered to in the correctional health care facilities that we visited, we noted significant deficiencies in the maintenance of ECPs, in the solicitation of employee input in the selection of safer medical devices, and in training for medical staff when such devices were implemented.</p>
<p>Current BBP risk reduction guidance has been a significant factor in reducing exposures among health care workers, including CHCWs. Our study supports previous concerns that this guidance is not fully translatable to all work settings where BBP exposures may occur, including the nontraditional correctional health care setting. We do not see the need for significant alterations in existing guidance but do see the need to better communicate and provide more appropriate solutions adapted to unique work settings.</p>
<p>Additional effort must be made by the appropriate government agencies to (a) ensure that meaningful, concise communications about BBP protection guidelines reach CHCW medical staff and (b) provide simple solutions to common problems that may be unique to the correctional health care environment.</p>
