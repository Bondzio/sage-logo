<abstract>
<p>Now reaching over 100 million families, the burgeoning microcredit movement has come to play a dominant role in the international development agenda. This is especially true in Nicaragua, where microcredit has supplanted the Sandinistas’ more radical approaches to poverty alleviation and women’s empowerment. Survey and focus group data from borrowers with seven prominent Nicaraguan microfinance institutions show that women benefit less than men from microcredit because they get smaller loans and they invest those loans in less lucrative businesses. Also, these women are constrained by household responsibilities. These findings call into question neoliberal notions that market forces can solve societal problems such as gender inequality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In January of 2009, as North Americans picked up the pieces of the worst US financial crisis since the Great Depression, microfinance advocates heralded their grandest and most coveted achievement to date: reaching their goal of lending to over 100 million families worldwide. While celebrating, microfinance supporters could not help but note that microcredit had thrived while the financial giants tumbled. They saw this as a vindication for the core principle of microfinance: that market forces could solve social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511404443">MSC, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511404443">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Still harsher jabs at Wall Street came from elsewhere. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua claimed the financial collapse was God’s punishment on the USA for imposing its economic principles on other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511404443">New York Times, 2008</xref>). Indeed, the crisis has inflamed resentment toward the USA; and Ortega especially has reason to feel so, after US intervention cut short his party’s revolutionary changes in the 1980s.</p>
<p>One might imagine that the proliferation of microfinance and Ortega’s return to power bode well for Nicaragua’s poor, especially women. After all, both microfinance advocates and the Sandinistas have employed narratives of poverty alleviation and empowerment for women. To assess just how good this news is, I will investigate the earnings of male and female microcredit borrowers in Nicaragua. My evidence is drawn from quantitative and qualitative data gathered from borrowers of seven prominent Nicaraguan microfinance institutions (MFIs). Of course, data on earnings alone are not sufficient indicators of empowerment;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511404443">1</xref></sup> and since this study does not include a control group, it does not provide a definitive assessment of microcredit’s ability to alleviate poverty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511404443">2</xref></sup> However, this study is important because it reveals underlying gender inequalities in society and at home, which result in differences in earnings between male and female borrowers. Considering these findings in the context of Nicaragua’s recent history of gender relations, structural adjustment, and post-revolution politics will highlight the importance of the social context in which microcredit is disbursed. I will argue that if gender inequalities are not addressed at the societal level, women may not realize the full benefits of microcredit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0896920511404443">
<title>Microcredit and Earnings</title>
<p>Before discussing the data, I will briefly review of the literature addressing the impact of microcredit on earnings around the world. Seminal studies in Bangladesh – home of the world’s premier MFI, the Grameen Bank – have shown some impressive evidence that microcredit helps to increase entrepreneurs’ income and household expenditures, and reduce poverty levels. By employing a quasi-experimental design that compares borrowers to non-borrowers while controlling for selection biases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511404443">Khandker (1998)</xref> finds that two-thirds of borrowers’ households realize an increase of income. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511404443">Bernasek (2003)</xref> finds that Grameen Bank borrowers have lower levels of poverty than non-borrowers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511404443">McKernan (2002)</xref> finds that not only Grameen but other MFI Bangladeshi borrowers realized considerable income gains over non-borrowers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511404443">Morduch (1998)</xref> finds less impressive gains, but at least shows microcredit helps to even out income cycles for Bangladeshis. And while they do not measure income directly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511404443">Pitt and Khandker (1998)</xref> show that household expenditures increase for borrowers, which suggests that they are less impoverished.</p>
<p>Researchers elsewhere in Asia have found similar results. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511404443">Park and Changqing (2001)</xref> replicate Khandker’s model in rural China and find that microcredit borrowers fare better than non-borrowers in terms of expenditures. In Zambia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511404443">Copestake et al. (2001)</xref> compare experienced borrowers (who received their first loan at least one year before) to ‘pipeline’ borrowers (persons who already run a business and are about to receive their first loan from the same MFI), and find that the former report 20 percent higher profits. In Latin America, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920511404443">Mosley’s (2001)</xref> longitudinal study of Bolivian borrowers finds that their income increased more than a control group of non-borrowers over six years. Elsewhere in Latin America, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511404443">Nourse (2001)</xref> cites his own experience managing microfinance projects, in which he did not see increased income from microcredit but he did at least observe business growth and expansion.</p>
<p>These findings are somewhat encouraging, but they typically aggregate all borrowers into one group, thus overlooking any differences (i.e. class or gender) among the borrowers. By comparing borrowers to each other (rather than comparing them to non-borrowers), other studies have shown that the benefits of microcredit are not evenly distributed. For example, Mosley (2002) compares borrowers who were relatively well off before joining a MFI to those who were poorer before taking their first loan, and finds that the relatively well-off borrowers perform better than their poorer peers. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511404443">Coleman’s (2002)</xref> study of Thai microcredit borrowers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511404443">Datta’s (2004)</xref> study of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee’s (BRAC) Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development (IGVGD) program in Bangladesh both show that <italic>a priori</italic> wealthier households benefit more from microcredit than poorer households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0896920511404443">Shaw (2004)</xref> argues that poorer borrowers in Sri Lanka tend to engage in ‘survival’ enterprises, which are lower risk and less capital intensive, but also less profitable. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511404443">Legovini (2002)</xref> finds that poor households in Nicaragua may even be worse off after taking microcredit loans, while the a priori richer households benefit considerably.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned studies compare better-off to poorer borrowers, few compare men to women. Those that have done so provide some preliminary evidence suggesting that men fare better than women with microcredit. In their study of microcredit borrowers in the Dominican Republic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511404443">Espinal and Grasmuck (1997)</xref> find that men on average earn 22 percent more than women. In Nigeria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511404443">Ayanwale and Taiwo (2004)</xref> find that male borrowers’ average income is 130 percent higher than women’s.</p>
<p>But these studies offer little explanation as to why this is so. An understanding of the broader social, political and economic context in which microcredit is implemented may offer explanations for these differences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511404443">Fernando’s (1997)</xref> appraisal of microcredit programs within a broader political context finds that the priorities of mainstream development trump women’s interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511404443">Isserles (2003)</xref> agrees, noting that many MFIs target women because women are perceived to be an effective means for achieving their goals, not because they are genuinely interested in empowering those women. But treating women as ‘conduits for credit’ merely essentializes those women and reinforces traditional notions of womanhood.</p>
<p>More generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511404443">Elyachar (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511404443">Isserles (2003)</xref> assert that too many microcredit advocates uncritically accept and promote neoliberal ideology, including a strong faith in the ability of the market to solve social problems, thus leaving it up to the individual to rectify society’s problems for herself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511404443">Rankin (2001)</xref> calls this ‘aggressive self-help’; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">Weber (2002)</xref> goes even further to call microcredit ‘a form of social disciplining aimed at compliance for neoliberal restructuring more generally’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">2002</xref>: 48). So with no effort to change the sexual division of labor, women borrowers are left with a double burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511404443">Isserles, 2003</xref>), working to pay back a loan while tending to household chores.</p>
<p>The problem is that microcredit has no inherent ability to empower women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511404443">Johnson, 1998</xref>). Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511404443">Kantor (2003)</xref> says, ‘access to economic resources alone is not necessarily sufficient to counter … inequality and to empower women, as their disempowerment is not based only in economics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511404443">2003</xref>: 426). This is why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511404443">Hunt and Kasynathan (2001)</xref> say MFIs need to focus intently on transforming gender relations if they hope to truly empower women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511404443">Buckley’s (1997)</xref> more general findings are in concurrence; he argues that the social challenges faced by microentrepreneurs are too vast and complex to be solved simply with microcredit alone. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920511404443">Pyle and Ward (1995)</xref> assert that a deeper understanding of the greater social forces at play is necessary to formulate solutions for women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511404443">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to understand microcredit from a gender perspective, we need to examine how Nicaragua’s recent political and economic history has shaped its social conditions today. More precisely, we need to answer these questions: what has been the impact of the Nicaraguan revolution and post-revolution politics on gender relations? What roles have the US and international financial institutions played in Nicaragua’s political economy? And what has been the impact of these external forces on entrepreneurship and gender relations in Nicaragua?</p>

<title>Gender and Revolution in Nicaragua</title>
<p>Nicaragua’s social context is deeply rooted in its ‘long history of foreign occupation and invasion, class polarization, civil war and social upheaval’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>: 39). The country won independence from Spain in 1821, but still the peasantry languished under a cruel agro-export system in the 1800s and repeated occupations by US forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511404443">Bastiaensen, 2000</xref>). Resistance ensued, most notably from General Ernesto Sandino, who broke with his liberal colleagues in 1920 to ally himself with peasants, minors, artisans and indigenous persons. Although he did not originally declare himself a Marxist, Sandino’s position increasingly became radicalized until he was murdered in 1934 and his supporters were decimated by the US-trained National Guard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511404443">Vanden, 1982</xref>). The USA-backed Somoza regime assumed control shortly thereafter, thus beginning 43 years of oppression, corruption and poverty for the majority of Nicaraguans.</p>
<p>However, Sandino and his movement would rise again. In 1961 Carlos Fonseca led a small group of revolutionaries to establish <italic>el Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional</italic>, (the Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN). They fused Sandino’s ideas and tactics with those of more recent revolutionaries like Che Guevara to create a moderate sort of Marxist ideology, ‘tinged with a radical Christian element’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511404443">Molyneux, 1985</xref>: 247). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511404443">Vanden (1982</xref>: 57) calls this ideology ‘very much Nicaraguan and … not a copy or imitation of any other nation’. Indeed, the movement was something new, and the FSLN was widely regarded as a welcome improvement over the Somoza regime. Academics and activists especially praised the FSLN for its progressive rhetoric, and for actively including women in the revolution; about half of the members of the Sandinista defense committees and 30 percent of the militias were women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511404443">Kampwirth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511404443">Vanden, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>At the cost 50,000 lives, the FSLN overthrew the Somoza regime on 19 July 1979. Upon gaining power, the Sandinistas enacted pro-labor reforms, raising union membership from only about 12 percent of the salaried labor force to 42 percent. The Sandinistas also increased the literacy rate from under 50 percent to nearly 90 percent, cut infant mortality in half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511404443">Robert and Fitzgerald, 1995</xref>), and ‘achieved more in their housing program than Somoza [Debayle] had in his entire period of rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511404443">Molyneux, 1985</xref>: 248). The Sandinistas also made ‘massive and heavily subsidized credit’ available to poor farmers and workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511404443">Bastiaensen, 2000</xref>: 155).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sandinista-led government enacted pro-female reforms and encouraged women to participate in the workforce and in politics. The premier women’s organization, the <italic>Asociación de Mujeres Nicaragüenes Luisa Amanda Espinoza</italic> (the Association of Nicaraguan Women Luisa Amanda Espinoza, or AMNLAE), had 25,000 members and advocated for women’s rights; and the Women’s Secretariat within the <italic>Asociación de Trabajadores del Campo</italic> (Association of Rural Workers) offered training for women in non-traditional jobs like welding, masonry and auto mechanics. The FSLN also tried to organize <italic>maquila</italic> and domestic workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>). New laws relaxed Somoza-era definitions of the family and <italic>patria potestad</italic> (absolute paternal power) and banned media portrayals of women as sex objects.</p>
<p>These reforms were good portents for Nicaragua. Soon nearly half of the formal sector labor force was women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511404443">Dello Buono, 1996</xref>). It seemed the nation could be on its way to a more prosperous and equitable future. However, this did not materialize because the Sandinistas faced three insurmountable challenges from the day they started. First of all, members of the Somoza government left behind only US$3.5m in the government coffers when they fled, and foreign debt was US$1600 per capita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>). The FSLN decided to honor those obligations, which proved to be an enormous burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511404443">Walker, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, in spite of its progressive outlook, the FSLN had some crippling internal flaws, such as corruption and hierarchy. Some FSLN leaders used their power to appropriate state property to themselves; they began acting more like businessmen, and were intolerant of alternative or opposition unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>). Thus some people accused the FSLN of selling out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511404443">Barquero, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511404443">Bastiaensen (2000)</xref> says the Sandinistas largely replicated the previous vertical, patriarchal governance system. More precisely, the Sandinista leadership often perceived of women as mothers and supporters rather than fighters in the revolution and leaders in the new government, thus reinforcing traditional gender roles and essentializing women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511404443">Kampwirth, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511404443">Linkogle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511404443">Mulinari, 1996</xref>). This situation was further complicated by strong opposition from the Catholic Church on matters of contraception, education, divorce and abortion. Considering the Church’s influence nationwide, even many feminists within the FSLN felt inclined to tone down their rhetoric in fear of alienating their base of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511404443">Babb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511404443">Molyneux, 1985</xref>). This is especially true regarding issues of inequality in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">Weber, 2002</xref>). For example, grassroots committees drafted laws requiring men to do chores at home, but the FSLN never ratified these draft laws, asserting the time was not right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511404443">Kampwirth, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511404443">Molyneux, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, the US Government was not at all pleased with the FSLN’s leftist ideology and imposed a crippling embargo, pressured other nations to break ties with Nicaragua and began a decade-long program of ‘low intensity’ warfare against the FSLN by training and financing a loosely tied network of opposition forces, the ‘Contras’. During the 1980s, the Contra war claimed between 30,000 and 50,000 lives – as much as 1 percent of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511404443">Robert and Fitzgerald, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511404443">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511404443">Walker, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to claiming lives, the war squelched the women’s movement. AMNLAE was ‘placed under great moral pressure to suppress or delay the pursuit of overtly feminist demands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511404443">Linkogle, 2001</xref>: 120). Thus, ‘little had been achieved to tangibly improve the position of women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511404443">Molyneux, 1985</xref>: 238) – especially regarding inequality in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">Weber, 2002</xref>). One prominent Nicaraguan feminist, Dora María Téllez, says, ‘The war prevented us from concentrating on [women’s] specific demands … We never managed to do adequate ideological work, with women especially. We just didn’t’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo, 2001</xref>: 158, 160).</p>
<p>And so, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511404443">Disney (2004)</xref>, the ‘sexual division of labor was “half-challenged”, thus perpetuating gendered participation in production and reproduction in a way that made things worse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511404443">2004</xref>: 8) The FSLN encouraged women to work outside of the home but nothing was done to relieve their domestic workload. All the while, the FSLN glorified traditional gender values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511404443">Hensman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511404443">Mulinari, 1996</xref>), and promoted ‘essentialism and static gender opposites’, portraying women as inherently more empathetic and nurturing – and thus domestic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo, 2001</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>As the war dragged on, military spending continued to rise while ‘fiscal and monetary discipline was progressively lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511404443">World Bank, 2001</xref>: 2). Nicaragua plunged into the longest economic crisis in the recent history of Central America; the percentage of households in poverty increased from 43 percent to 62 percent and unemployment increased from less than 1 percent to over 11 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511404443">Perez Sainz, 2000</xref>). Inflation soared, wages dropped, professionals left the country, and there were shortages of basic goods and foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511404443">Chamorro and Dello Buono, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511404443">World Bank, 2001</xref>). At the behest of the World Bank, the Sandinista-led government initiated structural adjustment in 1988, which discontinued many of the FSLN’s innovative social programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511404443">Perez Sainz, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The war also exacted a psychological toll on the Sandinistas and the people of Nicaragua in general. Amid demoralization and insecurity, the FSLN lost touch with its grassroots and became less participatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511404443">Chamorro and Dello Buono, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511404443">Dolan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511404443">Vanden and Prevost, 1993</xref>). By the end of the 1980s there was considerable discontent in Nicaragua, especially among women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo (2001)</xref> says, ‘in a 1988 opinion poll, two of the most disaffected groups from the Sandinistas were the domestic sector (housewives and maids) and the informal sector (predominantly women)’ (1999: 156).</p>
<p>Disillusioned with the FSLN, many Nicaraguans turned to presidential candidate Violetta Chamorro. Her broad-based coalition, <italic>Unión Nacional Opositora</italic> (National Opposition Union, or UNO), enjoyed over US$17m in support from the US Government in 1990, and asserted to the electorate that their party was the only hope for mending ties with the USA and thus ending the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511404443">Vanden and Prevost, 1993</xref>). But also, voters seemed drawn to Chamorro’s traditionalism: ‘I’m not a feminist nor do I want to be one,’ Chamorro once said. ‘I am a woman dedicated to my home, as Pedro [her former husband who was assassinated by the Somoza regime] taught me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511404443">1993</xref>: 157). Dressed in white, Chamorro invoked images of the Virgin Mary, which many Nicaraguans found preferable to Ortega’s swagger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511404443">Dolan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511404443">Kampwirth, 1998b</xref>). The Catholic Church and the US Government strongly backed Chamorro, and she won an upset victory in the 1990 presidential election.</p>
<p>Bayard de Volo noted, ‘Once the Sandinistas lost the elections and the war was over, many Sandinista feminists were freed from the pressure they had previously felt to toe the party line’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">2001</xref>: 241). These feminists abandoned the FSLN-established organizations to form autonomous women’s groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511404443">Linkogle, 2001</xref>). But at the same time, the women’s movement came to be dominated by urban, professional women, foundations, foreign governments and, perhaps most importantly, international NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>). Bickham Mendez says the ‘proliferation of NGOs must be understood in the context of wider global phenomena – the hegemony of the neoliberal development model, the dismantling of the welfare state, and the debt crisis in the developing world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">2004</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chamorro collaborated with the World Bank to implement a new structural adjustment program that was far more draconian than the reforms the FSLN had begun in 1988. Public spending dropped 37 percent in just a couple of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>). These cuts in spending included health care, education, and any remaining consumer subsidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511404443">Bayard de Volo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">Weber, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, adjustment had compromised food security and shifted the burden of social services from the state to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511404443">Weber, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Cooperatives were dismantled, as well. Again this appears to have been especially detrimental to women. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511404443">Babb (1997)</xref> details the fate of four women’s coops in Managua in the 1990s. She sees each one fail due to poor macroeconomic conditions, competition from large corporations with economies of scale, husbands’ resistance, and household duties. After a few years, the coops were failing and women were going back to being housewives or finding employment related to traditional gender roles, such as clerical work in a hospital.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as people lost their public sector jobs and subsidies, they turned to the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511404443">Dello Buono, 1996</xref>). This was especially true for women, who had borne the brunt of these changes. By 1994, 64 percent of urban working women were in the informal economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511404443">Perez Sainz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0896920511404443">Salazar, 1992</xref>). MFIs began to appear to meet the informal sector’s demand for capital. They started modestly; in 1992 the MFIs’ total collective portfolio was about US$5m in Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511404443">Barquero, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Chamorro’s successor, Arnoldo Alemán, continued with the plan of structural adjustment. More people continued to turn to the informal economy to eke out a living; by 1996 there were 26,587 microenterprises in Nicaragua – most were managed by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511404443">Barquero, 2002</xref>). Meanwhile, MFIs continued to proliferate to serve the burgeoning informal sector. By 1996 about 200 MFIs were lending in Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511404443">Barquero, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Alemán’s policies and their social consequences were no surprise to many observers. Less foreseeable was the way in which some former revolutionaries formed an alliance with Alemán. In an attempt to protect himself from fraud and money laundering charges, Alemán forged a power-sharing agreement with the Sandinistas (‘<italic>el Pacto</italic>’), which protected Ortega from allegations against him (he was accused of molesting his step-daughter), but greatly compromised the Sandinistas’ integrity and commitment to progressive social change.</p>
<p>When Alemán’s successor, Enrique Bolaños, took office in 2001, Nicaragua’s national economy had languished. There was zero percent economic growth in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511404443"><italic>Nuevo Diario</italic>, 2002</xref>). In 2005 only 25 percent of Nicaraguans were formally employed, and many families continued to resort to the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511404443">Cloke, 2002</xref>). What perhaps was once seen as a temporary survival strategy for laid off public sector workers in the early 1990s became something more of a lifetime occupation. Adrian Martinez, leader of a street vendors’ union in Managua, stated it more simply: ‘It’s our bread and butter. This is how we feed our families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511404443"><italic>La Prensa</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Women especially continued to rely heavily on the informal sector to get by. In 2002, 76 percent of Nicaragua’s working women were in the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511404443">Agurto, 2002</xref>). Meanwhile, Nicaragua’s <italic>Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos</italic> (National Institute of Statistics and Census, or INEC) said 55 percent of women had their own business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511404443">Balmaceda, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>With more funding from European governments and foundations, the microfinance sector continued to develop to serve these entrepreneurs, especially in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511404443">Lacayo, 2002</xref>). More MFIs arose; the largest 20 of them formed a consortium, called <italic>Asociación Nicaragüense de Instituciones de Microfinanzas</italic> (Nicaraguan Association of Microfinance Institutions, or ASOMIF). ASOMIF’s members collectively had a portfolio of nearly US$50m – 10 times what it had been for all MFIs in Nicaragua less than 10 years before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511404443">Barquero, 2002</xref>). In total, Nicaraguan MFIs lent to 101,771 people in 2002. Women especially relied on the MFIs; 83 percent of women who borrowed money did so from MFIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511404443">Deugd, 2004</xref>), and 66 percent of the MFIs’ borrowers were women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511404443">Agurto, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>All the while, Bolaños perpetuated Alemán’s conservative policies toward women. For example, Bolaños advocated a 30-year prison term for women who had an abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511404443">Rosenberg, 2004</xref>). At the same time, accusations of corruption related to Bolaños’ campaign kept Nicaragua’s leaders preoccupied with scandals when they could have been focused on resolving social problems.</p>
<p>Observers on the left might have hoped Ortega’s return to power in 2007 would reverse the nearly 20-year trend of detrimental policies, especially for women. However, the now pious ex-revolutionary regained the presidency in part by helping to pass a Catholic Church-sponsored anti-abortion bill in the National Assembly that is one of the strictest in the western hemisphere. The law maintains a six-year prison term for any woman who has an abortion, even in cases of rape or when the mother’s life is in danger. (Chile and El Salvador are the only other two countries in the region to ban abortion without exception) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511404443">McKinley, 2006</xref>). Upon the law’s passage, Juana Jiménez, the leader of <italic>Movimiento Autonómo de Mujeres</italic> (Women’s Autonomous Movement, or MAM), claimed ‘This is a throwback to the Middle Ages for women’s rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511404443">McKinley, 2006</xref>). The law passed on 26 October 2006; Ortega was elected president 10 days later.</p>
<p>Now donning pastels rather than military uniforms, Ortega says he no longer considers himself a Marxist, but a pragmatist. Others would say opportunist is a more appropriate moniker. Regardless, Ortega clearly feels unable or unwilling to challenge many donor directives from the North; and those directives seem unconcerned with progressive reforms. In fact, pressures seem to be just the opposite of progressive; an active anti-feminist movement supported by the Catholic Church, Focus on the Family and the Heritage Foundation, has proven to be quite influential with Nicaraguan policymakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511404443">Kampwirth, 2006</xref>). Ortega has even taken an antagonistic stance towards feminists. In September 2008, police raided the Managua offices of MAM, <italic>Red de Mujeres Contra la Violencia</italic> (Women’s Network against Violence, or RMCV) and <italic>Grupo Venancia</italic> (the Venancia Group), confiscating files, computers and other materials under the guise of suspicion of money laundering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511404443">Aleman, 2008</xref>). Ortega later accused another MAM leader, Sophia Montenegro, of being a CIA operative. This proved to be a baseless assertion, and MAM’s public response was: ‘Nos tienen miedo porque no tenemos miedo’ [‘You are afraid of us because we are not afraid’]; and Montenegro later added that Ortega is the figurehead of male impunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511404443">Lambert, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While such political drama unfolds, international NGOs in Nicaragua seem to be more preoccupied with pleasing donors and nations involved in multilateral aid and development than with doing the less prestigious work of challenging unfair gender norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511404443">Bickham Mendez, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, women have continued to rely heavily on self-employment to get by, and ASOMIF has a US$212m portfolio with over 292,000 borrowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511404443">ASOMIF, undated</xref>). Studies, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0896920511404443">Pisani and Yoskowitz (2005)</xref>, show that Nicaraguan MFIs have a positive impact on borrowers. However, my research reveals a disturbing development among microentrepreneurs. Comparing the net income from their primary economic activity – into which they invested most of their microloans – men earn 32 percent more than women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511404443">4</xref></sup> In order to understand the causes of this gap in earnings, I will operationalize gender roles and norms into observable phenomena, which then can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. I will begin by showing that human capital is not a significant factor in this case. Then I will look at several other factors that do matter; including loan size, how the loan is utilized, gender segregation within the informal sector, and household duties and expectations. Finally, data comparing single and partnered borrowers will highlight just how much those duties and expectations influence women’s microenterprises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511404443">
<title>Gender and Human Capital</title>
<p>I employed two methods in my research. The first is a survey of microcredit borrowers from seven of the 10 biggest MFIs in Nicaragua in 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511404443">5</xref></sup> A stratified random sample of 80 borrowers from each MFI was selected. Those 560 persons were surveyed in their homes by a team of researchers from the Nicaraguan research institute, <italic>la Fundación Internacional para el Desafío Económico Global</italic> (the International Foundation for the Global Economic Challenge, or FIDEG), during May and June of 2002 in and around the cities and towns of Boaco, Chinandega, La Paz Centro, Managua, Matagalpa, Somotillo, and Wiwilí. The sample did not result in enough women in agriculture for a reliable comparison to men. Therefore, I excluded all agricultural borrowers, leaving 403 people in the sample – 284 (70%) women and 119 (30%) men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511404443">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the survey, I conducted 14 focus group interviews – seven men’s groups and seven women’s groups – in December 2004 and January 2005. These were borrowers with the same MFIs that I surveyed in 2002. The focus group sessions took place in Boaco, Chinandega, Managua, Masaya, and Somotillo. Focus groups had from 4 to 7 participants each. In total, 65 people (32 men and 33 women) participated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511404443">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since human capital is a common explanation for differences in earnings, it seems like a logical starting point if we want to understand this gap in earnings between male and female borrowers. Past studies in other countries have shown that differences in income between men and women may be at least partially attributable to human capital, although there is no consensus on how much so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511404443">Blau and Khan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511404443">England, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511404443">Mincer and Polacheck, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0896920511404443">Sandell and Shapiro, 1978</xref>). Those studies focus on wage earners in the formal sector of industrialized countries. In contrast, the data in this study of Nicaragua’s informal sector show no such impact from human capital among microentrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Using the survey data, I measured human capital by looking at years of experience working as an entrepreneur and years of education. Regarding the former, there is no significant difference in years of experience between male and female borrowers. Furthermore, for both men and women there is no significant correlation between years of experience and net earnings. For Nicaragua’s microentrepreneurs, it appears that being in business longer does not result in higher earnings – for either men or women.</p>
<p>Regarding education, men’s and women’s secondary school graduation rates were almost identical in my sample - 26 percent for men and 25 percent for women. This suggests that education itself does not help to explain why men earn more than women. However, while both genders have attained about the same level of education, men who graduated from secondary school realized a greater increase in net income for their primary business than did similarly educated women. Male borrowers who graduated from secondary school netted US$96 per month more than their male peers who did not graduate (<italic>p</italic>. =.023).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511404443">8</xref></sup> But for female graduates the premium was only US$51 (<italic>p</italic>. =.063).</p>
<p>The gender difference is even greater if we look at total monthly net income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511404443">9</xref></sup> Men who graduated from secondary school increased their total monthly net income by US$224 over other male non-graduates (<italic>p</italic>. =.008). But for women, the increase – while still statistically significant – was only US$89 (<italic>p</italic>. =.007). While the women whom I interviewed had not seen such statistics, at least some of them were painfully aware of the situation. Celina, a fruit seller in the Chinandega central market, expressed her frustration this way:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The lady who sells chickens, across from me, she has two daughters with [college] degrees, and they are selling chickens with her. So what did they study for? … Those girls are very well educated, and they are cleaning up chicken shit!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Why do men borrowers appear to benefit more from a secondary education than do women borrowers? Part of the answer lies in the sizes of men’s and women’s loans; as well as in how those loans are used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920511404443">
<title>Loan Size and Gender</title>
<p>For both male and female borrowers there is a significant, positive correlation for net income and loan size – albeit a weak one for the women (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> =.088, <italic>p</italic>. =.000), and a moderate one for the men (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> =.120, <italic>p</italic>. =.000). So at least to some extent the size of the loan matters. Meanwhile, the mean loan size for men in my survey sample was US$1345, but for women it was only US$762 – a difference of US$583 (<italic>p</italic>. =.000). In other words, women’s loans were 43 percent smaller than men’s loans. And yet it was the men who complained about small loans. In fact, that was their most common complaint during the men’s focus group sessions. Interestingly, they often associated their need for capital with manhood and success. For example, Antonio, who owned a printing business in Managua, told me, ‘Men will search for a way to achieve the best. That is why they are always in debt.’ And Jorge, a mechanic in Managua, summed it up quite simply: ‘A man thinks about increasing capital; a woman does not.’ These expectations seem to have become self-fulfilling prophecies, in which men borrow more aggressively.</p>
<p>The men’s comments are in stark contrast to those of the women, only one of whom complained about small loans. In fact, three of the women’s focus group sessions started off with participants spontaneously praising their MFI and its staff. This praise was unsolicited, and MFI staff persons were not even present to hear those comments. While the men certainly were cordial and respectful of their MFI, none of them expressed such gratitude as the women. Perhaps this reflects the fact that for the women, more so than the men, a chance to obtain a business loan may be unprecedented. But also, this seems to reflect traditional gender norms, which imply that men should be demanding and women grateful.</p>
<p>Other researchers have noted this same phenomenon. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511404443">Ferguson (1993)</xref> notes that men in Nicaragua are more demanding for bigger loans. Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511404443">Sanders and Nusselder’s (2003)</xref> overview of Nicaraguan MFIs found that women represented 57 percent of borrowers but only 40 percent of the MFIs’ portfolios. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511404443">Deugd (2004)</xref> also notes this problem and explains it by asserting that Nicaraguan women lack collateral. However, when I spoke with MFI branch managers and field officers, they told me they did not see that one gender was more collateral-constrained than the other. Also, all seven of the MFIs in my sample had an alternative to collateral: guarantors. These were friends, family or associates of the borrower who had sufficient assets and were willing to sign a contract promising to pay the borrower’s loan if he/she were unable to repay.</p>
<p>One also might argue that smaller loans to women reflect overt discrimination. But when I asked the women borrowers about this in the focus groups, they did not feel discriminated against. I also posed this question in confidentiality to several female field officers in the MFIs, who supervised disbursement and repayment of loans. I wanted to see if they felt pressured by their supervisors to give bigger loans to men, but they consistently said no.</p>
<p>The fact that women get smaller loans appears to be an unintended consequence of the MFIs’ efforts, but I would maintain that this is what happens when lending proceeds without addressing the broader issue of gender norms. Another unintended consequence is the way many of the borrowers utilize their loans. As demonstrated in the next section, women are more likely to use their loans for less lucrative and non-productive purposes.</p>
<sec id="section6-0896920511404443">
<title>Gender Differences in the Utilization of Loans</title>
<p>It is no secret in the microfinance industry that borrowers use loans not only for business investment, but also for consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511404443">Nourse, 2001</xref>). In the focus groups, about half of the women (but only one of the men) said they use at least some of their loan for household consumption – including buying food, medicine and school supplies and making home improvements. In general, while the men seemed more concerned with growing their businesses, women were more likely to be using their loans for the family.</p>
<p>After getting smaller loans and diverting some of those loans into family consumption, women in my study were more likely to invest what was left for business in less lucrative sectors – often related to domestic labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920511404443">10</xref></sup> For example, the survey data show that women are much more likely to have <italic>pulperías</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920511404443">11</xref></sup> and they are almost unrepresented in the skilled labor and transportation categories, which are dominated by men (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0896920511404443">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, if we compare men’s and women’s net incomes within each category, only one shows a statistically significant difference at the 95 percent confidence level. But there are important distinctions within these categories, as well. For example, the most common retail activity for men is selling meat and dairy, which is the most lucrative retail activity. Meanwhile, no men in the survey sample engage in street food vending, which is the least profitable retail activity on an hourly basis. For women, selling clothes is the most common retail activity, but that is the least lucrative type of retail activity.</p>
<p>Manufacturing activities show a similar pattern. The two manufacturing activities in which women are least represented, furniture and jewelry, are by far the two most lucrative. Meanwhile, the manufacturing activity that no men do, handicrafts, is the least profitable.</p>
<p>Overall my data show a considerable amount of segregation in terms of men’s and women’s economic activities. More precisely, the types of activities in which men are more involved are more profitable than the activities in which women are more involved. My findings run parallel to those of researchers looking at gender segregation in the formal sector of industrialized nations. While many economists traditionally considered this phenomenon to be a result of women’s rational choices (‘preferences’), other authors have argued that ideological influences might effectively limit a woman’s options based on what was considered acceptable for her to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511404443">Morgen, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0896920511404443">Russell Hochschild (2003)</xref> goes even further to argue that ‘[a] woman’s gender ideology determines what sphere she <italic>wants</italic> to identify with (home or work)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0896920511404443">2003</xref>: 15, emphasis in original). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511404443">French and James (1997)</xref> say this is especially true in Latin America, where ‘[a woman] has been raised with certain expectations about respectability and about appropriate roles for women workers as well as wives and mothers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511404443">1997</xref>: 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511404443">Pedrero et al. (1997)</xref> see this process starting early in Latin America, with boys and girls learning their gender roles in school. The result is that women are seen as “secondary” workers – by both their husbands and their bosses – and hence they could find themselves working in lower paying sectors.</p>
<p>I asked my focus groups about this. Justo of Somotillo told me, ‘A woman can work at home, like in a <italic>pulpería</italic>. But if she goes outside to work, I don’t agree with that. Someone needs to stay at home with the kids.’ Exactly half of the men in my focus groups were in agreement with Justo, although a few qualified their statements by saying it would be acceptable for the woman to work outside if she were a single mother. But it is important to note that the other half of the men disagreed with the <italic>machista</italic> view – some emphatically – saying women should be free to work outside of the home, especially if they are supporting the family.</p>
<p>Several women acknowledged that such <italic>machista</italic> attitudes about women working outside of the home exist. For example, Rosie in Managua said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There are men who don’t like their wife to work. Why? Well, because first of all perhaps the husband is jealous. Or also he might say, ‘I am the man and you are the woman. You have to wash, cook and be the maid and you have to stay at home to have dinner on the table when I get home, have my clothes ready for me and everything.’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>But unlike the men borrowers, only five (15%) of the women in my focus groups agreed that it was better for women to work at home. Furthermore, when I asked those women who worked outside of their homes if they themselves had encountered any disapproval or prejudice, they mostly said no, it was a thing of the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920511404443">13</xref></sup> Miriam, who had worked in both the market and at home in a <italic>pulpería</italic> in Boaco, told me, ‘All people treat you the same, regardless of whether you are working at home or out in the street.’ And in Managua, a medicine vendor named Thelma told me,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t say, ‘I’m not going to do this because it will bring shame upon me.’ No, no. I live for the moment. If I am going to work, I do it proudly. And if we need supplies I put on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt and I say, ‘I’m going to East Market<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0896920511404443">14</xref></sup> to buy some things.’ And I go like that. No one judges me. There is no judgment when it comes to work. Wherever we may be, we work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>But some men said it was not a question of propriety, rather a question of safety. For example, the aforementioned Justo in Somotillo also said this in defense of his opposition to women working outside of the home: ‘It’s not just because of <italic>machismo</italic>. It’s also because it’s dangerous out there. She could get robbed.’ Ronaldo in Managua distanced himself from <italic>machismo</italic> but still agreed with Justo on this issue; using taxi drivers as an example, Ronaldo said: ‘In the street … one has to be ready to fight whomever. Personally, I would rather that a woman would drive a taxi than a man. But it’s about security.’</p>
<p>But again we hear a different perspective from the women, who seem less concerned about violence. Some women did say crime is a problem, but only one woman said she was very worried about it. Other women simply said it was something to try to avoid, and it was not particularly a female problem. For example, Auxiliadora, who sold shoes in Managua’s East Market, said: ‘Regardless if it is a woman or a man, the facts are that there are some robbers that attack people.’ Auxiliadora also emphasized that she did not feel she was at great risk because most of the robbers preyed on the customers, not the vendors.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The delinquents in East Market know the sellers and so there is a relationship. That is, the delinquents respect the sellers like it’s an unwritten law; because to get involved with one seller is to get involved with all of East Market. So the robber shows respect. The robber typically attacks the buyer, instead – like you [nodding to me]. Since you are not from around here, they will leave you naked in the street.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rosario Cruz, who sold shoes in the Chinandega Central Market, said the situation was similar there. ‘The vendors and the thieves, we know each other. They only take from the customers, the people who walk around shopping, not us.’</p>
<p>While many women are willing to question the logic of men’s concerns for their safety, there are other areas still left unchallenged, specifically, the matter of household duties and expectations – the same areas left unchallenged by the Sandinistas and their successors.</p>

<title>Household Duties and Expectations</title>
<p>Taking smaller loans, diverting part of their loan to family consumption, and investing what is left of those loans into less lucrative enterprises are factors helping to explain why the incomes of women entrepreneurs are lower than their male peers. But this is not the whole story. Furthermore, I still have not fully explained why women take smaller loans, divert some part of them into the household, and invest them less aggressively. The answer lies in expectations related to household chores, expenses and family support, which can impinge upon women’s businesses and their productivity. This section will look at each of those factors, showing how they appear to diminish with single parenthood.</p>
<sec id="section8-0896920511404443">
<title>Household Chores</title>
<p>After explaining a daily routine that began as early as 3 a.m. to both prepare for her business and complete various household chores before leaving for work and later returning to cook dinner, Miriam of Boaco told me she felt exhausted every day, but she proclaimed, ‘I can rest later.’ Indeed, the women in my focus groups are far more involved in household chores than their male counterparts, in spite of the fact that both men and women work the same number of hours in their businesses.</p>
<p>In the focus groups, over half of the women respondents do at least some of the housework – compared to only 13 percent of the men. One-third of the women do it all by themselves – compared to none of the men (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0896920511404443">Table 2</xref>). This is in spite of the fact that the women on average work 57-hour workweeks – only 90 minutes less than the men. Clearly, this could be a great constraint and a hindrance for their businesses. Not only do these women have inflexible work schedules (because they have to be home at a certain time to cook, clean and/or care for children), it also constrains the location and the type of business these women can engage in. Furthermore, it impinges on their work time and exhausts them, thus lowering their productivity.</p>

<p>The sum of percentages exceeds 100% for women because in some households more than one person does the chores. For example, a woman might hire a maid to wash clothes, but she herself still cooks and cleans. Two men did not answer the question.</p></fn>

<p>Other family includes children and parents. For example, nine female borrowers said their daughters help with chores; two more said their mother helps, and one said her son helps.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In addition to household chores there is the question of household expenses. The next section looks at the implications of the fact that men and women often are expected to cover different types of expenses to support the household.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0896920511404443">
<title>Household Expenses</title>
<p>In terms of dollars, the men and women in my focus groups share the burden of household expenses equally. However, it is important to note that the women more often pay for food and other daily provisions while the men pay for utilities. Thus, even though expenses are shared equally, the woman is the one who has to pay more frequently to meet her family’s needs. The electricity and water bills can be paid monthly or even quarterly, but kids need to eat daily. This means women need a steady income, which influences their business decisions and the type of business they engage in toward more reliable and less risky, but also less lucrative endeavors.</p>
<p>While adults are expected to do certain chores and pay for daily household expenses, the rest of the family typically is expected to reciprocate with help for the adult’s business – mostly unpaid. The next section considers how such free labor is allocated between men and women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0896920511404443">
<title>Family Support</title>
<p>For both men and women in my focus groups, 33 percent get help for their business from a household member. For women, most are so young their presence is not so much to help out as to be cared for. For example, several women described taking their preschool children along with them to sell food in the street.</p>
<p>As for men, their helpers typically are older and do more substantial work. For example, Heriberto runs a fairly sophisticated business outside of Chinandega. His teenage sons use a computer to track his income and expenses, manage his payroll for his eight workers, and ensure that he is staying profitable. In another example, Mario owns a woodshop in Masaya. His two teenage sons work with him, and Mario has taught them the skills he learned from his father. Working full time, they produce high quality doors, railings and other wood products with an ample supply of tools and machinery in their shop. Like other men, Mario told me he plans to pass on his business to his sons. In contrast, none of the women in my focus groups said they planned to pass on their business to their daughters.</p>
<p>More important than the children was help from the spouse. In the focus groups, 47 percent of the men borrowers get help for their business from their spouse, but only 21 percent of the women borrowers get help from their spouse. Not only are women more likely to help out their spouse than vice versa, the kind of help they provide seems to be different. Male borrowers’ spouses appear to be more directly involved, while female borrowers’ spouses seem to be supportive – but not so much on a daily basis or in a ‘hands-on’ manner. For example, Miguel, an auto mechanic in Managua, told me how his wife works full time in his shop. She handles incoming calls, processes orders and does the accounting. Meanwhile Rocio, a female clothes vendor in Managua, proudly mentioned that her husband supported her in her business. But when I pressed this issue, I learned ‘support’ simply meant that he allows her to do it and in the past he occasionally contributed small amounts of funds to supplement her MFI loan.</p>

<sec id="section11-0896920511404443">
<title>Single Parent Entrepreneurs</title>
<p>So far I have found that women have similar levels of human capital, but do more household chores than men, bear more responsibility for immediate household expenses, and get less substantial familial help for their businesses. If all this is true, one might surmise that the 32 percent gender gap in earnings is primarily attributable to the difference between partnered men and partnered women. And if we compared only single men to single women, that gap would largely disappear since those single women are less encumbered with household duties and obligations.</p>
<p>Of the 403 borrowers in the survey sample, 119 (30%) were single – 98 women and 21 men. This is not a large number of men, but at least we can do some simple comparisons. And interestingly, when we do so, there no longer is a statistically significant earnings gap between men and women. In fact, the women appear to have earned slightly more than the men (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0896920511404443">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920511404443">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>If we compare single men to single women in terms of hourly income, the women earn 69 cents per hour more than men (<italic>p</italic>. =.329). But single men tend to work more hours and are more likely to have a secondary business; so if we compare men and women in terms of total monthly net income, men and women’s earnings are virtually the same (US$302 and US$304 respectively, <italic>p</italic>. =.987).</p>
<p>So the difference in net earnings between men and women is occurring in the partnered households, not in the single households. If we compare partnered men to partnered women in terms of hourly net earnings, the men earn 71 cents per hour more than women (<italic>p</italic>. =.039). If we compare men and women in terms of total monthly net income, men earn US$551 per month and women earn only US$362 (<italic>p</italic>. =.023).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that men rely more heavily on their spouses for help with their business and household chores than vice versa. When such spousal support is taken away, men’s net earnings decline much more than do women’s.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Advocates of microfinance stress the empowering properties of capital. But a lack of capital is not the only constraint women face around the world; most notably in this study, social norms and gender relations often set boundaries for what types of business ventures are feasible for women, and how much time and effort they can invest in such ventures. Even in a country like Nicaragua, with a history of feminist movements and a steady decline of <italic>machismo</italic>, the long tradition of expectations that the woman would provide selflessly for the most immediate needs of the family remains largely intact. For women entrepreneurs, this means having sufficient human capital is not enough to succeed. And among microcredit borrowers, their male peers are able to outperform the women (except for single parent households) because they get bigger loans and work in more lucrative fields. Meanwhile, women often compromise their entrepreneurship for the sake of household obligations.</p>
<p>To maximize the impact of microcredit and to make it a truly liberating experience, development practitioners should focus on activities that will challenge those traditional gender norms that disadvantage women in the marketplace. Such activities might include promoting non-traditional enterprises for women. Practitioners also should engage in activities that encourage men to be more involved in household responsibilities. Unfortunately, the revolution-era women’s cooperatives operating in non-traditional sectors that were supported by the FSLN in the 1980s have been replaced by MFIs making individual loans to women who then compete with each other for revenue while shouldering the double burden of work and home. And the proposed legislation to equalize reproductive labor between men and women that was never ratified in the 1980s sees little chance of resurrection so long as the leader of the FSLN seems more interested in antagonizing feminists than in working with them.</p>
<p>More generally, the findings of this study call into question the ideological framework of free market capitalism. Before the financial collapse, US policymakers saw subprime lending as an ameliorant to inequality and segregation to be employed in lieu of addressing those problems directly. The result is an estimated 53 million people trapped in poverty due to the global reverberations of the collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0896920511404443">World Bank, 2009</xref>). It seems ominous then, that microcredit’s advocates today present it as ‘a successful genre of subprime lending’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511404443">Roy, 2010</xref>: 190). So long as microcredit is perceived as such, it does not address the fundamental causes of poverty; it ‘makes individual behavior central to overcoming poverty, avoiding structural analyses or critiques’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511404443">Isserles, 2003</xref>: 45). Nor does it necessarily empower women to lead better and more fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>The point is not to dismiss microcredit as a viable tool for the alleviation of poverty and the empowerment of women. In fact, it can play a part in doing such things; but only if microcredit is administered properly in a supportive social and political context. The problem is that Nicaragua’s neoliberal reforms and post-revolution politics have not provided that context.</p>

<p>A comparison of single and partnered female borrowers shows no significant difference in the types of businesses they engage in; single women are not more inclined to engage in non-traditional or more lucrative sectors. In the parlance of economics, we could say the difference of earnings seems to stem from the fact that the single women are more productive. In other words, it appears the single women are better able to focus on their business because they are less burdened by household duties.</p></fn>
