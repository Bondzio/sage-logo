<p>Reference sources in palliative medicine have developed exponentially over the past 24 years or so since its recognition both as a medical specialty in the UK and abroad. Our ‘evidence base’ (quite appropriately) started life as collections of clinical experiences, anecdotal observations, peer consensus and basic, laboratory-based pharmacological data. As a result of specialty development and recognition of palliative care as key in managing life-limiting illness, this knowledge base has now evolved to its current, commendable position. This is captured excellently in both of the specialty’s two core texts: the <italic>Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine</italic> (now in its 4th edition) and the newer <italic>Palliative Medicine: Expert Consult</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Oxford Textbook</italic> has remained a dynamic text, continually developing and refining itself over its various editions to maintain its key position as an invaluable resource to professionals involved in all aspects of palliative care, including non-malignant disease. This edition has a more up-to-date, fresh appearance, with clear text, diagrams and improved presentation of clinical photographs. The editors have both recognized and embraced the global spread of palliative care, both through expansion of the editor and author base, and having further developed their section on worldwide provision. The chapter discussing basic and specialist provision in poor countries has been updated, but welcome additions include the progress that has been made in introducing the specialty in previously hard to reach areas, and considering which medicines actually are the essentials in providing symptom control at the end of life.</p>
<p>One of the most welcome developments, however, has to be the increased emphasis on the multi-disciplinary nature of palliative care. The section has been expanded considerably to include more detail about the contribution of individual team members to the holistic approach to care, which not only adds evidence to the valuable contribution of all team members, but also allows a better understanding of the roles of fellow professionals in providing high-quality care.</p>
<p>The recently topical, political and controversial topics of euthanasia and withdrawing/withholding life-sustaining measures are addressed comprehensively and sensitively and will give the reader a significant amount of material to aid clinical decision-making and further study.</p>
<p>Finally, the updated text continues to deliver an excellent, comprehensive approach to symptom control issues in a practical, but evidence-based manner which will suit the palliative care novice and seasoned professional alike.</p>
<p><italic>Palliative Medicine: Expert Consult</italic> is an equally powerful text, with the added functionality of included, Web-based access to its materials. It is equally well written, referenced and informative, but has a totally different ‘feel’ to it than the <italic>Oxford Textbook</italic>. Written in a very American style, it covers all of the essential and interesting aspects of palliative medicine, in an insightful and interesting way.</p>
<p>Coverage of all aspects of the care of patients with life-limiting illnesses is extensive and thorough although, at times, rather leaden to navigate. However, this should not detract the reader from using the text in their routine practice. Once comfortable with the editorial style, the text proves to be a useful tool in the clinical setting. Diagrams and illustrations are of a superior quality to those of the <italic>Oxford Textbook</italic>, but the essence of the text is on a par.</p>
<p>Many chapters of the text are superbly written and are a welcome addition to the palliative care armamentarium. Contributions examining and discussing ‘the desire for death’, ‘stress and burnout’ and ‘patterns of metastatic cancer’ are fascinating. Like its counterpart, this text addresses the multidisciplinary nature of palliative care more extensively than previous publications have allowed, and this is only to be commended.</p>
<p>While <italic>Palliative Medicine: Expert Consult</italic> does attempt to cover a far broader range of topics related to palliative care than its UK-based sibling, including chapters detailing endoscopy, arrhythmias, durable medical equipment, stroke and an entire section on administration, it does appear to be trying to be more than it should be, no matter how well written. One wonders whether a less extensive contents list may have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, few palliative care services will have the resources to enable access to both of these texts. The choice, I must admit, will necessarily be an individual one. Personally, I prefer the familiar, reliable and wonderfully written <italic>Oxford Textbook</italic>, but that may say more about me than the text itself. <italic>Palliative Medicine: Expert Consult</italic> is an equally impressive and high-quality reference text and will be preferred by others. The choice, as they say, is yours.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to be asked to review a book which will, if it has not already, become a core textbook for post-graduate palliative care nursing. The 35 chapters of the book are well referenced and written by some of the best known and most respected ‘names’ in specialist palliative care, many of them with a nursing background.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four sections based on a trajectory of illness model: Encountering Illness, Transitions into the Terminal Phase, Loss and Bereavement and Contemporary Issues. Each section starts with an overview from the editors and this is followed by chapters written by experts in their field, drawn from the whole multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>The introduction specifies that this is not a ‘how to do’ book but rather it ‘seeks to intellectually challenge and promote debate and discussion about the nature and purpose of palliative care’. This is a publication that has much to offer the reader with an open and enquiring mind</p>
<p>The key points listed at the start of each chapter, allow the reader to quickly identify the content. This enables the reader to find the information being sought, an invaluable asset when juggling textbooks to source that much needed evidence or quote.</p>
<p>The references will allow those wanting to expand their study to really challenge their preconceptions. I have already directed staff members to different chapters as we review several areas of our services.</p>
<p>I have no hesitation in recommending this book, it is well worth its price and deserves a place on every library bookshelf.</p>
