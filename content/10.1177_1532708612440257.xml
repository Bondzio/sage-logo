<abstract>
<p>This article challenges the neoliberal discourse of “instrumental rationality” that is encroaching on theories of qualitative research, critical reflection, and subjectivity. I return to Foucault’s historical ontology of the <italic>self</italic> and the ancient Athenian precept <italic>care of the self</italic> to show that critical reflection and rationality have never been mutually exclusive. I put the <italic>care of the self</italic> metaphor to empirical use by examining the practical and ethical issues that emerged when I transitioned from a state-sponsored frontline employee working with public housing tenants, to a university researcher investigating public housing tenant participation in a state-sponsored urban redevelopment project. The focus is on my experiences as a practitioner-researcher working within two neoliberalized institutions, while also constructing a <italic>performative</italic> research ethic to mount a challenge against the politics of neoliberal “evidence” in the space between.</p>

<p>Only when the Enlightenment’s epistemology is contradicted will there be conceptual space for a moral-political order in distinctively qualitative terms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>, p. 61)</p>

<p>The debates about the politics of knowledge creation have long histories that span many millennia and discursive doctrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612440257">Erickson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532708612440257">Tuominen, 2009</xref>). Recall the rationalist/empiricist debates of the early modern era; or the objective/subjective debates of the late modern era; or the enduring positivist/relativist dualism of postmodernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532708612440257">St. Pierre, 2011</xref>). The prize, to which philosophers and researchers mount struggles in pursuit, is one of the central tenets of academe; the right to place boundaries around what will be constructed as “valid” knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532708612440257">Gutting, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612440257">Foucault (1969)</xref> showed that it is not by holding knowledge that a social subject can exercise power. Instead, it is through the control of the production of knowledge that power is truly operationalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612440257">Foucault, 1969</xref>). Therein resides the politics of “evidence” and “truth.”</p>
<p>These struggles, the politics of placing boundaries around what can be counted as the “truth,” have many institutional and ideological fronts. The technocratic right to set guidelines and ethical standards for “quality” research in research institutions; or the political right to define what constitutes “evidence-based” policy; or even the philosophical endeavor to call your research “scientific,” are but a few examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532708612440257">Larner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532708612440257">Lemke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532708612440257">St. Pierre (2011</xref>, p. 614) argues, science is “a highly contested concept whose meaning and practices shift across philosophical approaches and historical and political moments.” So, although qualitative researchers might expect to find the commitment to (post)-positivism to be an anachronism, the proponents of “evidence-based” research have a new ally in the neoliberalization of state and nongovernment institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Discursively termed “economic rationalism” during the 1980s in Australia, neoliberal discourses have colonized and distorted “rationality” and thereby rendered invisible the concept’s long and diffuse philosophical history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck (2010)</xref> recently observed,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The actually existing worlds of neoliberalism are not pristine spaces of market rationality and constitutional order; they are institutionally cluttered places marked by experimental but flawed systems of governance, cumulative problems of social fallout, and serial market failure. (pp. 29-30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Australia, United States, and United Kingdom, and in pursuit of “economic rationalization,” almost all areas of social life are being brought into the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532708612440257">Harvey, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532708612440257">2005</xref>). These neoliberalized spaces are quantitative spaces; to be “rational” and “objective” in a neoliberalized space requires you to audit, code, quantify, and commodify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532708612440257">Lemke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612440257">Smith &amp; Hodkinsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532708612440257">St. Pierre, 2011</xref>). This applies as equally to the commodification of academic knowledge within neoliberalized research institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612440257">Cannella &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>); or to community knowledge within a neoliberalized nongovernment sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532708612440257">Larner, 2005</xref>); or to business knowledge within a “free-market” corporate sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>). The ahistorical conception of “rationality” within neoliberal discourses is a form of obscurantism that constructs interpretive knowledge, which is grounded in a commitment to moral and ethical action, as “unscientific” for it lacks “objectivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612440257">Smith &amp; Hodkinsson, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532708612440257">Postone (1997</xref>, p. 54) warns we have become, “a society governed by instrumental rationality without any possibility of fundamental critique and transformation.” “Instrumental” is used here to refer to the politics of positioning “scientific”—positivist—inquiry as a necessary instrument for understanding the (social) world.</p>
<p>In the context of the politics of “truth,” the neoliberal turn has political features that are both <italic>unexpected</italic> and others that have come as <italic>no surprise</italic>. The political return, or perhaps continuation, of the positivist/relativist dualism comes as no surprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>). While unexpected is how readily neoliberal actors, by deploying a “technocratic instrumental rationality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532708612440257">Žižek, 2011</xref>, p. 187), have marginalized the qualitative research paradigm in light of the now expansive qualitative literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612440257">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While this state-sponsored “hegemonic politics of knowledge cannot be allowed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>, p. 155), any challenge to the nefarious discourses that have colonized the concept of “rationality”—and neoliberalized public, private, and nongovernment institutions—must be mounted from outside the discursive frame of neoliberalism. In this article, I advocate an ethical and moral research pedagogy, which is both explicitly <italic>antineoliberal</italic> and <italic>performative</italic>, by addressing directly the concepts of “philosophical rationality” and “instrumental rationality.” I historicize “rationality” with ancient philosophical conceptions of subjectivity, morality, and ethics in the interest of conducting more rigorous empirical research.</p>
<p>The analysis is composed of two discrete sections, with the first providing a discussion of an oft-ignored body of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault’s (2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612440257">2011</xref>) work, <italic>care of the self</italic> (<italic>epimeleiaheautu</italic>). I locate the <italic>care of the self</italic> precept within the reflexive ethics frame not only to accept subjectivity as an important epistemological consideration, but also to show how I also attempted to transform the <italic>self</italic> through my research practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612440257">Carmody, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>). While significant conceptual and theoretical attention has been paid to the issue of reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612440257">Lyons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>), more empirical work is required to understand the technicalities of using a methodological <italic>technology of the self</italic> to challenge the neoliberal discourse of instrumental rationality (Cannella &amp; Lincoln, 2004a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>, p. 409; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>; Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532708612440257">Myers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>). The second section provides reflections on some of my consultancy and fieldwork experiences. I draw on critical reflections of the multiple role identities I occupied over a 5-year period while working as a community consultation consultant for a state housing authority, before transitioning to a university researcher investigating the redevelopment of a public housing estate in Southwest Sydney, Australia. These are centered on a series of consultancy events and email exchanges between the author and a private sector research partner in the field, which were further complicated by neoliberalized work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532708612440257">Peck &amp; Tickell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The renewed interest in reflection and reflective inquiry is beginning to challenge the discourse of instrumental rationality that has encroached on theories of critical reflection and subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440257">Al-Amoudi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612440257">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>). Theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612440257">2009</xref>) have shown that critical reflexivity and philosophical concepts of rationalism have never been mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>). Certainly, when I deployed critical reflexivity as a research method in my practitioner-researcher role on a public housing estate, rational thought and ethical action were central to my critical self-reflections. The purpose of critical reflectivity was methodological and “composed of practices of ethical self-governance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612440257">Luxon, 2008</xref>, p. 378) to inform my ethical subjectivity and political action throughout my studies. It was not “irrationalism, i.e., disbelief in objective fact . . . [a] desire to assert something for which there is no evidence, or to deny something for which there is good evidence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1532708612440257">Russell, 2008</xref>, p. 35).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612440257">1</xref></sup> Critical reflexivity was not a form of ego centricism or solipsism, but rather a facilitated process of truth telling about myself that involved public housing tenants and other research partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440257">Al-Amoudi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612440257">Luxon, 2008</xref>). The purpose of critical reflexivity was to turn rational thought onto the <italic>self</italic> to increase research rigor and this is by no means a new epistemological position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>, p. 46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The links between rational thought and subjectivity were central to philosophical thought from the classical period, if not before, and continued as a necessary condition of knowledge creation until about the time of René <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612440257">Descartes (1637</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532708612440257">Tuominen, 2009</xref>). Since Descartes, rationality has been increasingly associated with the confinement of the emotions to quasiresearch roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>. p. 347), while the “rigorous” work of investigation and hypothesis testing within a neoliberal audit culture has been left to “objective” research processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612440257">Denzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532708612440257">St. Pierre, 2011</xref>). At the very least, intuitive insights developed over time at research sites by practitioner-researchers are constructed as subordinate to research paradigms informed by scientism and instrumental rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612440257">Cannella &amp; Lincoln, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>). <italic>Care of the self</italic> is a useful construct to further challenge the epistemological bias for a neoliberal discourse of instrumental rationality in the politics of research and practice.</p>

<title>Reflexive Ethics as a Technology of the Self</title>
<p>Marcel Proust’s aphorism, “The real art of discovery consists not in finding new lands, but in seeing with new eyes,” has become a calling card to reflexivity, a metaphor from which to hang a range of epistemic positions constructed around notions of subjectivity and reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532708612440257">Korthagen &amp; Valsalos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612440257">Lyons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532708612440257">Serio, 2009</xref>). In my view, the real art of discovery consists not in finding new lands, but in seeing with old eyes. I advocate a return the classical period and philosophical questions relating to the passions or emotions to shed light on an old philosophical question, how to <italic>care for the self</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612440257">2011</xref>). If I were to ascribe a maxim to reflexivity from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532708612440257">Proust, (1996</xref>, p. 217) it would be “the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532708612440257">Foucault’s (2001a</xref>, p. 68) latter work on ethics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612440257">2</xref></sup> predominantly a historical ontology of the <italic>self</italic> staring with ancient Athenian ethical practices, challenges a Cartesian view of rationality by drawing attention to an imagined “Cartesian moment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612440257">3</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault (2001b</xref>, p. 11) presented a “history of the practices of subjectivity” to show how we have historically constituted ourselves as subjects of knowledge and truth, and thereby showcased the relationship between subjectivity and truth from Socrates to Descartes.

Nonetheless, it is different from approaches that are based on instrumental rationality that work to remove the person and subjectivity from the research site. Reintroducing subjectivity to rational inquiry has led more recently to a return to the epistemological theorizing of the morality of our reflexive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612440257">Luxon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532708612440257">Robinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>).

<p>Researchers of many persuasions are trained to use inductive and deductive reasoning in pursuit of knowledge about a particular research question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>). A self-reflexive practitioner-researcher is no less “rational” in their approach to research than an “objective” logical positivist. Both researchers use rationality to answer a research problem, though admittedly through divergent research methodologies. The difference between these two researchers is not in their capacity for reason, but in the methodological focus of their rational thought and an acknowledgment of the “sentiment” of their actions within the qualitative research paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532708612440257">Hume, 2001</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532708612440257">Hume (2001)</xref>, a highly rational person may not be a moral person and vice versa; it is the “sentiment” of their actions that determines their morality.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532708612440257">Hume (2001)</xref> rejected the ideas of the so-called “selfish schools,” including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532708612440257">Bernard Mandeville (1711)</xref> who believed that morality is an illusion and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532708612440257">Thomas Hobbes (1650)</xref> who believed that morality is founded on self-interest.

<p>What is Passion? . . . Passion arrives like that, a state that is always mobile, but never moves toward a given point. There are strong and weak moments, moments when it becomes incandescent. It floats, it evens out. It is a kind of unstable time that is pursued for obscure reasons, perhaps through inertia. In the extreme, it tries to maintain itself and to disappear. Passion gives itself all the conditions necessary to continue, and, at the same time, it destroys itself. In a state of Passion one is not blind. One is simply not oneself.

Reason alone can never motivate social subjects toward moral action; the passions or emotions motivate us but “benevolence” cannot be reduced to self-interest. Therefore, practitioner-researchers might be motivated by our own gratification in the first instance (to secure a research grant), but these emotions are only the preconditions for “benevolence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532708612440257">Hume, 2001</xref>). Reason is not behind the morality of our actions. Using this epistemic frame, we can critically reflect on the “emotion” of working with research subjects, as coresearchers, to show how this might motivate us toward subjective moral action. The <italic>care of the self</italic> metaphor is a productive way of conceptualizing this practice. While I problematize providing normative models of critical reflexivity below, at this point I will offer a broad definition of the methodological <italic>technology of the self</italic> put forward in this article.

<p>Foucault would call “critique”—both a political and ethical attitude that Foucault calls “the art of not being governed.” Thus, the ethics of passion involve simultaneously an art of not being moral (which does not make Foucault either immoral or amoral) and an art of not being governed (which does not make Foucault either apolitical or an anarchist). It amounts to a kind of unique experimentation in ethics and in life where, with the help of others, one loses oneself in modes of existence . . . that enable us to confront the line of the Outside, delivering us over to the passions and pleasures of new “possibilities of life.”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532708612440257">Robinson, 2003</xref>, p. 123)</p>

<p>When I engaged in participatory research on the public housing estate, it involved embedded exposure to social subjects within the research site and a range of emotional, physiological, and cognitive responses to this embedded period manifested in “aha moments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>). The first “aha moment” occurred while I was a consultant for the state housing authority managing a series of community consultations as part of the public housing estate redevelopment.</p>
<p>The state housing authority had announced their state’s first public housing estate redevelopment by public–private partnership (PPP) in December 2004 and was now managing the development project (Project) while selecting a private sector “partner.” The Project involves a 30-year contract between the state government and a private-sector consortium company managed under a performance based fee structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532708612440257">NSW Department of Housing, 2004</xref>). In 2004, the 81-hectare estate had a population of around 3,300 people with 833 publicly owned dwellings. The PPP contract covers the delivery of physical infrastructure and a suite of social objectives, including tenancy management, “community building” and “community consultation.” Over the contract term, the net housing stock across the estate will be increased from about 950 to over 2,330 dwellings. A nonprofit housing manager, under contract to the private sector “partner,” is to manage the public tenancies for 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532708612440257">Rogers, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>By July 2006, I had been working as a consultant for the state housing authority for over a year on a number of community consultation projects. In a self-reflexive research project focused on my consultancy work, a partnership between the university and the state housing authority, I began to question my<italic>self</italic> about the limits of my knowledge and the disciplining effects of my consultancy profession and host organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612440257">2011</xref>). With tenants as coresearchers, I attempted to show how these limitations and disciplining effects had informed and shaped my consultation practice. During this time, tenants and other residents had become increasingly concerned about the redevelopment project, as key milestones within the PPP procurement schedule were not realized. Two typical comments from tenants included</p>

<p>In response to these concerns, the state housing authority created a colorful timeline brochure that, due to the unpredictability of the PPP bidding processes, did not contain any dates.

But no amount of discursive maneuvering could have challenged the raw and powerful questioning tenants directed toward me in these community consultations.

<p>For practitioner-researchers who operate within the space between research and practice, these “aha moments” constitute the realities of each research project in spontaneous and intuitive ways.

It is important for researcher-practitioners to engage with these “aha moments” otherwise “critical reflexivity becomes just another technique rather than a philosophy-driven practice in which we take responsibility for creating our social and organizational realities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>, pp. 408-409).</p>

<p>By turning rational thought onto the <italic>self</italic> as a reflexive ethical pursuit, the practitioner-researchers may find not only their own voice but also the voice of others and voices silenced by our research projects and findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612440257">Beauregard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>). Practitioner-researchers cannot turn privilege—our privileged status as practitioner-researchers—into political action without reflecting on the very mechanics required to realize this power and the limitations and disciplining effects of our knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>, p. 38).</p>
<p>This brings into focus an important, albeit subtle, difference between my contemporary <italic>care of the self</italic> metaphor and other research methods conceived of as reflexive exercise. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612440257">Burnier’s (2006</xref>, p. 412) autoethnography for instance, written expressions—memoir, personal narrative, personal criticism, autobiography, autoethnography—are conceived of as reflexive struggle. This view positions autoethnography as an endeavor focused on, to some extent, creative writing that engages with philosophy and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532708612440257">Newton (1998)</xref> has termed the “psychologicalization of the self.” By contrast, my <italic>care of the self</italic> metaphor is a philosophical endeavor that might manifest in writing creatively, as in this article, or equally the reflections of the <italic>self</italic> might remain internal to the researcher. There is a difference here between the <italic>self</italic> as narrative and the <italic>self</italic> as subject, a difference perhaps only in methodological weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612440257">Burnier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612440257">2011</xref>). Nonetheless, my metaphor of ethical self-governance is explicitly directed toward the better design and management of research projects, “the idea that one must put a technology of the self to work in order to have access to the truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>, pp. 46-47).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault (2001b</xref>, p. 38) asks whether disciplines in their own terms, and therefore based on the “conditions of possibility” that define the discipline or body of knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>), can pose questions about the relations between subject and truth. Like Foucault, I do not seek to answer this question, but instead pose it as a point of reflection for practitioner-researchers. It is an epistemological question that makes providing typologies or models of reflexive ethics, located within any research discipline, problematic. Therefore, I have purposely avoided constructs that are normative or categorical—such as typological models borrowed from psychoanalysis—as researchers can construct these models within an epistemology of instrumental rationality that will subjugate reflexivity. In light of this, the remainder of this article presents one final <italic>technology of the self</italic> to highlight how I drew on intuitive insights from the study site, questioned the <italic>self</italic> about the limits of my knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>) and examined the disciplining effects of my neoliberalized academy and profession.</p>

<title>Questioning the <italic>Self</italic> as a Practitioner-Researcher</title>
<p>I conducted two research projects on the estate between 2006-2010, both investigating public housing tenant participation. The first study included the state housing authority as a research partner in an insider research project conducted in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612440257">Braithwaite, Cockwell, O’Neill, &amp; Rebane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1532708612440257">Taylor, 2011</xref>). The second study included the private-sector company as an informal research partner in an action research project conducted between 2007 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532708612440257">Humphrey, 2007</xref>). Public housing tenants were constructed as coresearchers through participatory research methodologies in both studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612440257">Coghlan &amp; Holian, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612440257">Darcy &amp; Gwyther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532708612440257">Reason &amp; Bradbury, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612440257">Fine, Denzin, and Lincoln (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612440257">Fine and Weis (1998)</xref>, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612440257">Dimitriadis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532708612440257">Humphrey, 2007</xref>) have shown, transitioning from a practitioner to a researcher, through the important ethical, moral, and social spaces between, is fraught with hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532708612440257">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532708612440257">Marinetto, 2003</xref>). So following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532708612440257">Virillio (2008</xref>, pp. 28-29), I set out in search of the “intervals,” to discover “the <italic>space between (l’entredeux)</italic> . . . [and to] contemplate my environment in all its facets, reality had become abruptly kaleidoscopic.” Transitions through these spaces are certainly not marked by a chronological moment, and in my case it was a slow slide into unknown territory. A drifting between practitioner subjectivity constructed through my consultancy contracts and work roles with the state housing authority, and researcher subjectivity constructed by human geography and the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612440257">Christians, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1532708612440257">Miehls &amp; Moffatt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532708612440257">van Woerkom, 2010</xref>). The research/practice site was tricky because it was changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1532708612440257">Tuhiwai Smith, 2005</xref>); it was tricky because of my multiple role identities and the space between. It was impossible to separate these roles into demarcated employment, research or social roles in the field. Therefore, being a practitioner-researcher presented significant challenges, but it also provided unique empirical insights.</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2007, I designed and facilitated community consultation programs with public housing tenants as a consultant to the state while also conducting an insider research study. Then, from 2007 to 2010 I attended formal public housing tenant group meetings and was assisting public housing tenants to self-organize, as part of my doctoral action research study. I also participated informally in community life during this time by attending street meetings and barbecues, and by dropping into the knitting group for a coffee or visiting local residents in their homes for a chat. Occupying these multiple role identities meant I was constructed as colleague, academic, friend or foe, or any combination of these, at different moments in time and in the context of different social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612440257">Caldwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612440257">Dimitriadis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532708612440257">Guillemin &amp; Gillam, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the capacity for action research to generate role conflicts and the inability of formal ethics reviews to deal with these issues are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612440257">Cannella &amp; Lincoln, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612440257">Carmody, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612440257">Dentith, Measor, &amp; O’Malley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612440257">2009</xref>). Indeed, my research projects showcase many examples. In this section, however, I recount only two vignettes that exemplify the way a reflexive methodological <italic>technology of the self</italic> can be deployed to evaluate the research site and study. Public housing tenants continued to be the moral thorn in my side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532708612440257">Plato, 1993</xref>) by problematizing my work and research tasks, while my relationships with former colleagues from the state housing authority, who were now employed with the private-sector company, began to crumble.</p>
<sec id="section5-1532708612440257">
<title>The Space Between</title>
<p>The ground was shifting and I started to slide between identity roles. In my academic role, conducting research as an insider, I began to critically reflect on the redevelopment project and the information I was providing tenants. In my consultancy role, I continued to develop and deliver workshops for the state housing authority. In the space between these life-worlds I went about my daily work and research functions on the Estate known to colleagues and tenants as a practitioner-researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612440257">Dimitriadis, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this quickly changed with the completion of the first study and the delivery of my final confidential report to the public-sector research partner. The report offered, in part, critical reflections of my consultation practice and did not served me well within my consultancy role. The research questions had been developed in the field through my interactions with public housing tenants, and the report called into question aspects of the PPP as well as the work of the community consultation team. Although I remained a community consultation practitioner under contract to the state, I had also become a researcher insofar as I was undertaking an insider research project through a university. I resolved to critically reflect on the subjective morality of my actions within this bifurcation of social roles and I asked myself <italic>how can I rationalize and bring these two very different life-worlds together?</italic></p>
<p>By attending to the <italic>self</italic> as a researcher, I had found voices silenced by my actions as a practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612440257">Beauregard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612440257">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612440257">Lincoln &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>). However, on discovering this, I was not finally liberated from the shackles of my own naivety. Instead, I was exposed to a complex diffusion of power, action, and resistance operating within the neoliberalized research site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612440257">Foucault, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>). I found no single social subject or entity is ever solely responsible for action or inaction. It was only by taking note of my different subject positions, as a researcher and as a practitioner, and the tasks required of these roles, that a more nuanced picture of the subtle ways in which social subjects are drawn into various technologies of power became clearer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612440257">Foucault, 1997</xref>). As a practitioner, I had been working toward an end to which I was not aware and to which I did not agree. The <italic>care of the self</italic> metaphor helped me work through the paradox that I had unwittingly become an intricate social actor to a neoliberal cause I could not condone.</p>
<p>Like me, another staff member, Mary,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532708612440257">12</xref></sup> had also engaged in critical reflection of her community consultation actions within the community consultation team in 2006 in another university partnership project. By late 2006, Mary had also challenged many of the subjugating effects of her practitioner role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612440257">Foucault, 1997</xref>). We can use this as a subjectivity baseline, a <italic>moment</italic> from which to track the changes in our researcher/practitioner subjectivities over time. In late 2006, we were both employees of the state and university researchers, and roughly occupied a similar subjectivity constructed from colocating at the research site practitioner-researchers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the job roles that we occupied after late 2006 become important. From early 2007, I no longer undertook contract work for the state housing authority. Instead, I began my action research study as a university researcher, without any formal relationship to the state housing authority or the private-sector company. By contrast, from early 2007, Mary no longer undertook research functions and continued working on the redevelopment project before securing full-time employment with the private-sector company undertaking the PPP. In retrospect, it seems the clue was in the title for it is no coincidence that we have ascribed the term discipline—in my case the discipline of human geography—to describe the way a body of knowledge has a disciplining effect on how we think about social subjects, define social space or how we seek to acquire knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612440257">Burchell, Gordon, &amp; Miller, 1991</xref>). So too, professions have disciplining effects and becoming a private-sector employee in a neoliberalized space would also came to shape Mary’s subjectivity in the redevelopment project.</p>
<p>I developed a doctoral research proposal to investigate how the actions of public- and private-sector employees, through the PPP contract, were being shaped by neoliberal ideology and internationally mobile discourses of urban and social pathology. The methodology included a semiautobiographical account of the 5-year study to date, and participant observations of current project staff from within the company. I planned to take up an office space within the private-sector company to observe their daily operations. This included attending various public meetings and events where tenants or private-sector employees were present. I kept a research diary <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1532708612440257">13</xref></sup> to record the outcomes of these meetings and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532708612440257">Reason &amp; Bradbury, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout 2007, my university research office and the private-sector company attempted to negotiate and finalize a research agreement between the two parties. Mary understood the study, the proposed methodology and was very supportive, even advocating for my proposed study at a senior level within the private-sector company. However, no research agreement was ever signed between the private-sector company and the university, and the action research project continued with public housing tenants as coresearchers. In any case, Mary provided support and was pivotal to me securing access to private-sector contractor and subcontractor staff for interviews in 2009 and, despite no formal research agreement, providing me with an office space for 2 days per week within the community center, located on the Estate, for the term of my fieldwork.</p>
<p>In the first instance, <italic>care of the self</italic> directed me to analyze the behind-the-scenes action by reflecting on the mechanics of researching a sensitive topic, the negotiation of relationships and the politics of possible negative findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612440257">Carmody, 2001</xref>, p. 177). Then, in March 2010, the “community relations” department within the private-sector company requested a research report for my study on behalf of Mary. A community relationships manager emailed,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hi Dallas,</p>
<p>Hope all is going well . . . Anyway, just seeing if you’ve got anything to report on your work, I’ll be doing my monthly report soon. Can you also cc me in on any correspondence with Mary regarding your PhD? As I’ll be back on board four days a week shortly, so will be the contact for all research projects.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While there was no research agreement between the university and the private-sector company, I had informally agreed to give Mary a discussion paper for the study in late 2009. The discussions with Mary and my commitment to provide a discussion paper were framed within the negotiations that had taken place in late 2008 between the university, and the private-sector company such that, had a research agreement been signed, it would have stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The candidate will produce a report of the findings [report name removed] and/or other aspects of the study as deemed beneficial by [the private-sector company] co-researchers. While the exact study outputs will require further negotiation between the candidate and [the private-sector company], these outputs may include: writing up the results in a format that is most beneficial to [the private-sector company] for future projects; co-presenting the results at academic conferences; or the co-publication of findings in industry or academic journals. (Unsigned research agreement)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I felt, given the informal support given to the study by Mary, that I would provide a discussion paper for review and comment in early 2010. Additionally, this fitted well with the ethos of action research and my original research plan of collaborative learning. Therefore, I responded by email, moving further toward the subject position of a “researcher.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got a Discussion Paper for [the private-sector company] . . . Then the next step will be to meet with Mary to discuss the paper—after Mary has read it of course—so we can decide on the next steps for the paper for [the private-sector company]. My proposal at this point in time is to send the paper to Mary first for review and thoughts. This of course will be a confidential [private-sector company] document.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This discussion paper had clear aims:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This discussion paper sets out the emerging themes from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) tenant participation study . . . This confidential discussion paper has been prepared to facilitate discussion between the researcher and [the private-sector company] about emerging themes from the study . . . An important part of the PhD research methodology includes “reporting” emerging themes back to “research participants” for verification, discussion and if applicable review of current practice . . . The emerging themes are presented as a starting point for discussion. As noted above, some of the themes are retrospective observations and may have more relevance to future projects, however some might be considered within the context of the current project.

<p>The report concluded, in general terms:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>while participation <italic>practice</italic> [on the Estate] was increasingly linked to contractual arrangements between [the private-sector company] and [the state housing authority], residents were generally positive about the redevelopment project . . .

</disp-quote></p>
<p>As noted above, <italic>care of the self</italic> is about good research governance and alternative forms of research and practice, and I had decided to “own up” to the political nature of my research and to draw on my “aha moments”—insights developed by working closely with tenants—when I prepared the 2010 discussion paper. The redevelopment project was now under private-sector management and was an ideological and moral space in which I had played an active part, both in constructing and now resisting, through numerous work/research roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532708612440257">Foucault, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532708612440257">Peck, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612440257">Foucault (1969)</xref> rejects the idea of a self-governing subject, and I used the construct of power/knowledge to help me understand the limits and arbitrariness of knowledge creation in this PPP: the “limits, exclusions and constraints” placed on the production of knowledge, and the relationship between knowledge creation and power.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Mary and I had become more ideologically dislocated from each other than I had allowed myself to realize over the passing 3 years. I was no longer an insider–outsider, researcher-practitioner, but an outsider researcher in a neoliberalized space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532708612440257">Peck &amp; Tickell, 2002</xref>). Further, my colleague was no longer connected to the academy, but was a senior employee of a private-sector company. The initial response by Mary to the 2010 Discussion Paper was a short email questioning the methodology and objectivity of the study. The email stated, “You say that this is PAR [Participatory Action Research] but it does not reflect our understanding at all. Our voice is not heard . . . ” and it concluded with the following questions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Do you feel that you understand the constraints of both [the state housing authority] and [the private sector company]?</p>
<p>When can we get together? When are you expecting to publish?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We met soon after and discussed the study at length. We went over the discussion paper and reflected on the PPP. However, it seemed that our diverse subjectivities were preventing us from seeing each other’s assessment of tenant participation in the project. I was being asked to “acknowledge constraints” and to “incorporate understandings of triple bottom line processes” into my analysis, while the report was pointing to these processes as some of the key constituents that led to the subjugation of public housing tenants (email communication). However, I conceded that the action research processes with the private-sector contractor and subcontractors had been fraught and had failed—although the action research process with tenants had been successful. We had not engaged in regular cycles of reflection and review, and we had not changed practice. Following this meeting, we both slid back into the space <italic>between</italic> research and practice, and the staff member emailed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Dallas,</p>
<p>A bit of self-reflection from me. I’d like to acknowledge that I’m also on a learning journey with all this. I know that I got a bit intoxicated at the idea of you opening up to other possibilities but, to be really honest, I know that I have to do likewise. I’m an idealist at the best of times and can be blinkered by my unbridled positivity . . . Thanks for the opportunity of exploring this space with you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On reflection, we attempted to chain together two different subjective <italic>habitus</italic> experiences—private-sector and academia—by means of an action research project that was purposely designed to challenge the subjugating effects of the market and a PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440257">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>). We underestimated the power of the neoliberalized spaces within which we were operating. It seems that the power and subjugating effects of these neoliberalized spaces are even more effective when they are hidden from view behind the daily tasks undertaken by different social subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612440257">Foucault, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The neoliberalization of state and nongovernment institutions is being facilitated by a discourse of instrumental rationality that subverts the extensive philosophical history of rationalism. Constructing theories of critical reflection within such discourses renders important intuitive insights—“aha moments”—especially those available to “engaged” practitioner-researchers in the field, invisible. These intuitive insights can be used methodologically, and as part of a reflexive ethical pedagogy, to constitute a practice of ethical self-governance within critical qualitative research paradigms. Far from encouraging egocentrism or solipsism, facilitating a process of truth telling about the <italic>self</italic> can reintroduce rational thought to theories of critical reflexivity with the aim of increasing research rigor. In the vignettes outlined in this article, I undertook this process of critical self-reflexivity by using the <italic>care of the self</italic> precept as a metaphorical <italic>technology of the self</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Care of the self</italic> was a way of thinking about the politics of knowledge creation that focused my attention on how I was acting at the research and practice site, and how this shaped the way I related to other social subjects. It pointed to the limitations of my knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>), and it unsettled and exposed—but certainly did not rebalanced—the power structures operating at the neoliberalized research site. <italic>Care of the self</italic> was deployed to redraw my ethical horizon, and it can be a productive way of rigorously analyzing how we find our own subjective and ethical way in the field, while undertaking critical qualitative research.</p>
<p>In my studies, I found that normative models of research practice and ethical review, that are based on a technocratic instrumental rationality, provided little scope for challenging the neoliberal power structures operating at the research-practice site. Participatory research methodologies were better suited to this task. <italic>Care of the self</italic>, however, is no panacea. Instead, it allows the researcher to “own up” to the problems we experience while constructing an ethical subjectivity in the field, when we occupy more than one social role. While we must continue to educate <italic>ourselves</italic> about our own, and others, unique vantage points, we must also accept the norms that compose these vantage points will also discipline and regulate our actions and knowledge.</p>
<p>The analysis demonstrates that the way we make use of individual agency is complicated by the multiple role identities we find ourselves located within, so we should look for the space between. While operating between two neoliberalized institutional spaces, in the space between I created a <italic>performative</italic> research ethic to mount a challenge against the politics of evidence within neoliberalized institutions. The empirical examples bring to the surface, in subtle ways, the subjugating effects of these social and institutional sites. Part of Foucault’s ethics of the self is located in a move to not be oneself, or to lose oneself, at these moments of crisis; when we are most constrained and subjugated by knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>). By turning a <italic>technology of the self</italic> onto our research and practice roles, to find the space between, we will no doubt unsettle the <italic>self</italic> and the established order. Therefore, it will be both uncomfortable and an unfulfilled project in practice. Nonetheless, it is a useful and necessary project as researchers should not exercise power over others, without reflecting on the very mechanics required to realize this power and the limitations and disciplining effects of ones knowledge (<italic>connaissance</italic>).</p>

<p>This is a somewhat misappropriated use of Bertrand Russell’s citation. Russell argues the obfuscations of philosophers have blurred the questions surrounding skepticism and rationalism. He argues psycho-analysis shows our emotions and passions are often contrary to “fact,” “the theoretical part of rationality, then, will consist in basing our beliefs as regards matters of fact on evidence rather than on wishes, prejudices, or traditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1532708612440257">Russell, 2008</xref>, p. 35).</p>

<p>Foucault uses the term the <italic>Cartesian moment</italic> to highlight not a chronological moment in time, but instead, a moment over time in the history of thought. Foucault remarks, “It seemed to me that modern philosophy—for reasons which I tried to identify in what I called, as a bit of a joke although it is not funny, the “Cartesian moment”—was led to put all the emphasis on the gnothi seauton and so to forget, leave in the dark, and to marginalize somewhat, this question of the <italic>care of the self</italic>” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532708612440257">Foucault (2001a</xref>, p. 68).</p>
