<p>We begin this issue with a paper which resonates with much of our own long experience in promoting the development of library and information services in developing countries. In her paper, ‘The leisure divide: Can the ‘Third World’ come out to play?’, Payal Arora of Erasmus University Rotterdam notes that one of the results of the billions of dollars that are being invested in mitigating the digital divide is that donors and governments look to measure the outcomes of their investments in terms of activities that have clear socio-economic outcomes. For example, farmers in rural India are watched closely to see how they access crop prices online, while their social networking activities are largely ignored. Users in emerging markets are thus somehow considered to be inherently different from those in the West. Yet it is now commonly accepted that much of what users do online in developed nations – as elsewhere – is leisure-oriented. As the author points out:<disp-quote>
<p>While there is no pretense on the fact that what most users do online in the West is primarily social and leisure oriented – social networking, porn, idle browsing and media consumption and production – there seems to be a belief that users in the emerging markets will have a more conventional work ethic online; they will virtuously reach out for ways to get information for healthcare diagnostics and treatment, online education and agricultural best practices. While undoubtedly this happens, this paper argues that there is a possibility that much of what users do <italic>even</italic> (and arguably, one can say, <italic>especially</italic>) in ‘Third World’ countries is, in fact, heavily leisure oriented.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This paper thus argues that negating online leisure in ‘Third World’ settings, our understanding of this new user market can be critically flawed.</p>
<p>The next paper adopts a more utilitarian approach to information development. In ‘An analysis of agricultural informatization in Korea: The government’s role in bridging the digital gap’, Junghoon Moon and Md. Dulal Hossain of Seoul National University, Hyoung Goo Kang of Hanyang University and Jungsoon Shin of Ewha Womans University, all in South Korea, discuss the challenges inherent in agricultural informatization by analyzing the effects of the digital divide in urban and rural areas of Korea and the role of the government in narrowing this divide. Korea is recognized as one of the most advanced countries in terms of informatization, and agricultural informatization has played an important role in bridging of the digital gap between rural and urban areas. However, while Korea has achieved success in terms of access, inequalities in the ability to use digital technology remain. This creates new challenges for policymakers. The results of this study aim to offer a better understanding of the efforts required to raise the level of agricultural informatization to bridge the digital divide and provide researchers with some guidelines for examining the digital divide and determining how it influences farmers, villagers, managers, and economies.</p>
<p>From East Asia we move to South America – specifically, to Colombia, where the paper ‘Lending a visible hand: An analysis of infomediary behavior in Colombian public access computing venues’, by Ricardo Gomez (a member of the Editorial Advisory Board of Information Development), Phil Fawcett and Joel Turner, all of the University of Washington in the USA, discusses the findings of a study which analyzed the role of infomediaries in three types of public access computing venues: libraries, telecenters and cybercafés. Infomediaries in these venues contribute to human development by enabling easier access to information on education, health, government services and other social needs in the community (Social Impact); information about jobs, employment, business opportunities, and agricultural resources (Economic Impact); and information and communication resources to strengthen personal relationships and sense of belonging to a local and global community (Community Impact). The research sheds new light on the role of formal and informal infomediaries in strengthening the contribution of public access computing to human development.</p>
<p>For a different application of ICTs in a different country, we move next to ‘Catalytic mechanisms for promoting ICT investment and use in cassava value chains in south-western Nigeria’, by Mutawakilu A. Tiamiyu, Abiodun S. Bankole and Rosemary O. Agbonlahor of the University of Ibadan. The paper reports on a study of the catalysts and impact of ICT investment, ownership and use in the cassava value chain in south-western Nigeria, using in-depth structured interviews to collect data from cassava growers, processors and marketers. The model which was articulated as a result predicts that in value chains dominated by small and medium enterprises (SME), ICT investments are unlikely to progress beyond basic low-end ICT unless there is expanded market demand for output of the SME. The model highlights key process points that policy may target in order to improve the use of ICT by SME to leverage their value chain activities. </p>
<p>We remain with agricultural information in Africa with the next paper, ‘The information environment of agricultural stakeholders in Botswana’, by L.O. Aina of the University of Ilorin in Nigeria. The paper is based on a study undertaken for the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), to survey the agricultural information needs, information sources used by agricultural stakeholders in Botswana and to assess their awareness of CTA’s products and services. The study revealed that while agricultural stakeholders in Botswana have a wide range of information needs, especially on government programmes, farm problems and identification of market for agricultural products, and mainly use the Internet, journal articles and technical papers, most of them were not aware of CTA’s products and services. The study recommends that the Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) Library should be the agency to provide agricultural information services to all stakeholders in Botswana, and that CTA should take steps to ensure that its services are well utilized by agricultural information stakeholders.</p>
<p>The final paper in this issue, ‘ISIS2ABCD: a batch program to automatically create a database in ABCD from an existing CDS/ISIS database’, by Eustache Mêgnigbêto of the Bureau d'Etude et de Recherche en Science de l'Information (BERSI), in Benin,deals with a topic normally covered by Alan Hopkinson’s regular column of ‘CDS/ISIS Information’. As a result, we decided to give Alan a break from the column he has been writing for Information Development for more than 20 years – but he will be back with the next issue. This paper introduces ISIS2ABCD, an MS-DOS command script that creates automatically, from an existing CDS/ISIS database, a new database compliant with ABCD. It also imports records from the existing database into the newly created database and finally creates and updates the inverted file. The paper describes the parameters of ISIS2ABCD and illustrates the use of the script.</p>
<p>Although Alan Hopkinson’s column does not appear in this issue, our other regular columns, by Archie Dick, on Education for Librarianship and Information Studies, and by Msafiri, on Sexual Healing, are included, along with Information Development News and information on Forthcoming Events.</p>
<p>Readers who are accustomed to access our website may already have noted the inclusion there of an Editor’s Choice Collection of seven articles on the theme of Indigenous Knowledge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://idv.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/indigenousknowledge">http://idv.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/indigenousknowledge</ext-link>). This collection is linked to a similar one on the same theme on the IFLA Journal website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ifl.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/indigenousknowledge">http://ifl.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/indigenousknowledge</ext-link>); the latter was compiled in support of the forthcoming IFLA Presidential Programme Spring Meeting on Indigenous Knowledges, to be held in Vancouver, Canada, from 12–14 April 2012. The articles in both collections have been made open access, so are free for you to enjoy!</p>
