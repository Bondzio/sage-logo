<p>For the most part, scholars have disregarded the influence of the democratic, civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> on Paul’s discussion over speech and wisdom in 1 Cor. 1–4. Yet the notion of the civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> served as a source of practice, identity and democratic discourse in the early Roman Empire.

<p>Paul opens 1 Corinthians by warmly praising the wisdom and speech of this early Christian community. He tells the Corinthians that their relationship with Jesus means that, ‘in every way you have been enriched by him, in speech and knowledge of every kind’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13482798">1</xref></sup> Yet Paul soon characterizes the Corinthians as immature, worldly and contentious in both their speech and wisdom. This worldliness, this immaturity, starkly contrasts with Paul’s portrayal of his own speech and wisdom which, while lacking eloquence, is ﬁlled with the maturity of ‘spirit and power’ (1 Cor. 2.4). Scholars have read the early chapters of Paul’s letter as revealing the Corinthians’ divisiveness,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13482798">2</xref></sup> their lack of self-control or their compromising ‘Greekness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13482798">3</xref></sup> I argue instead that the focus on speech in these early chapters of 1 Corinthians is a sign of democratic discourse—what I will call <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13482798">4</xref></sup> Analyzing this discourse in 1 Cor. 1–4 highlights speech as a site of struggle between Paul and his Corinthian audience—and as a key to understanding the contestation over power that marks the letter as a whole. In particular, my analysis seeks to illuminate the social context of the letter, and the way this context both shapes and constrains Paul’s argumentation. I argue that Paul’s rhetoric is designed to address a community that understood itself in terms of ancient democracy and its principal institution, the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.</p>
<p>My argument proceeds in the following way. First, I will challenge scholarship that has dismissed the democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> as a viable institution in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc> by showing that the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> remained a source of practice, identity and discourse in the early empire. Secondly, I will discuss speech as a critical <italic>topos</italic> of ﬁrst-century democratic rhetoric, which, like its classical predecessor, structured the nature of citizen participation and leadership in the context of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. Ultimately, I contend that reading 1 Cor. 1–4 in light of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse provides new insights into Paul’s rhetoric, which seeks to establish his authority through negotiation with a powerful democratic assembly composed of individuals with equal voice.</p>

<title>The First-Century <italic>Ekklēsia</italic>: Institution and Discourse</title>
<p>Biblical scholars have been inattentive to democratic discourse in 1 Corinthians because they have assumed that the political institutions of democracy, including the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, were moribund, if not entirely absent, in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13482798">5</xref></sup> Richard Horsley represents this wider consensus when he asserts:
<disp-quote>
<p>Under imperial Roman rule, then, the last vestiges of democracy were undermined as the oligarchies gained control of or simply abolished the city assemblies, gradually destroyed the law courts (<italic>dikasteria</italic>), and by attaching liturgies to magistracies, established a property requirement for holding public ofﬁce … With the weakening or abolition of the assemblies and law courts, two of the traditional functions of rhetoric disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142064X13482798">2000</xref>: 79).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This portrait of the Greek city reflects over a century of influential research in classics. For instance, G.E.M. de Ste Croix, following the lead of I. Lévy writing more than a century ago,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13482798">6</xref></sup> posits an increasingly ornamental assembly during this time period manipulated by elite councilmen and magistrates serving as Rome’s chosen representatives in each district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13482798">7</xref></sup> Ste Croix suggests that the assembly fell into complete political insigniﬁcance by the beginning of the Principate in Greece, and by the mid-second century <sc>ce</sc> in Asia Minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0142064X13482798">1981</xref>: 527, 532-33). Meanwhile A.H.M. Jones claims that democracy itself had ceased to exist for Greek cities even by the beginning of the second century <sc>bce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142064X13482798">1971</xref>: 170). Ste Croix and others have further linked democracy’s disappearance with an argument that the Greek city declined during the ﬁrst centuries <sc>ce</sc> as a viable political unit and source of identity for its inhabitants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13482798">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In New Testament scholarship, the democratic, civic roots of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> tend to be invoked only for them to be dismissed as the source of the name and practice of early Christian assemblies. By accepting classicists’ contention that the political <italic>ekklēsia</italic> had become irrelevant in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, New Testament scholarship largely disregards democratic discourse as operative when analyzing the term <italic>ekklēsia</italic> itself, and in assessing the community dynamics and rhetoric that are consistent with <italic>ekklēsia</italic> practice. The scholarly consensus locates the origin for <italic>ekklēsia</italic> as a Christian community title in the Septuagint, which uses <italic>ekklēsia</italic> to translate the Hebrew <italic>qahal</italic> for gatherings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13482798">9</xref></sup> This scholarship often highlights the Septuagint’s use of the term for the gathered Israelites as the chosen people, especially at the time the law is given in Deuteronomy (23.1-8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13482798">10</xref></sup> Following this reasoning, the Christian phrase ‘<italic>ekklēsia</italic> of God’ (1 Cor. 1.2; 10.32) ﬁnds its roots in the Septuagint’s ‘<italic>ekklēsia</italic> of the Lord’ (ἐκκλησία κυρίου)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13482798">11</xref></sup>—both phrases demonstrating that the Christians chose the title for its ‘particular religious signiﬁcance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142064X13482798">McCready 1996</xref>: 47). However, Dieter Georgi explains that this argument founders on the Septuagint’s failure to use <italic>ekklēsia</italic> as a ‘technical’ or ‘particularly religious term’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X13482798">1992</xref>: 57).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13482798">12</xref></sup> In fact, the Septuagint uses <italic>ekklēsia</italic> interchangeably with the word <italic>synagogē</italic> for an extremely wide range of gatherings that included not only the Israelites as chosen people, but also such groupings as war parties (Gen. 49.6) or even a group of ‘evil-doers’ (Ps. 26.5). Explaining the Christian title <italic>ekklēsia</italic> with reference to select aspects of its Septuagint usage neglects the fact that from the classical period into the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, the term <italic>ekklēsia</italic> was employed most widely and persistently to designate the civic, political assembly of citizens—the essential institution of democratic government in Greek cities.</p>
<p>Although New Testament scholars routinely claim the Septuagint as the source of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> title, they often explain the form and interaction of early Christian communities by drawing parallels with other social groups active in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>. In this pursuit, Wayne Meeks’s identiﬁcation of four ancient ‘models’ to compare and contrast with the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic> has been highly influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142064X13482798">2003</xref>: 75-84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13482798">13</xref></sup> In the case of each model—household, synagogue (συναγωγή), voluntary association and philosophical school—Meeks indicates similarities with the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, but explains that each model ultimately falls short of explaining the form of early Christian communities. Among the most serious discrepancies between his models and these Christian communities, Meeks recognizes the contrast between the Christians’ more democratic gathering and the hierarchy of the Greco-Roman household, even as he points out that the social diversity in the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic> was uncommon in voluntary associations. However, the influence of democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse on early Christianity would account for these very discrepancies. The civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> embodied the democratic interaction lacking in the hierarchical organization of the ancient household. Meanwhile, a socially diverse range of citizens participated in civic assemblies, a contrast to Meeks’s description of voluntary organizations as homogeneous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X13482798">14</xref></sup> Meeks himself attributes any democratic currents present in Pauline communities to the influence of voluntary associations set up ‘according to the model of the classical <italic>polis</italic>’, a model he does not speciﬁcally associate with the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142064X13482798">2003</xref>: 78). Meeks thus ascribes any democratic practice or ideology in the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic> to voluntary associations or synagogues which are themselves appealing to the classical past. In this way, Meeks does not acknowledge <italic>ekklēsia</italic> democracy as an active, ﬁrst-century discourse shared alike by Christian communities, voluntary associations and synagogues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X13482798">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article, however, will demonstrate that reports of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>’s demise in the early empire ‘have been much exaggerated’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13482798">16</xref></sup> In classics, scholars have begun to question the irrelevance of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> in the ﬁrst-century Greek <italic>polis</italic>, and likewise the disappearance of democracy in this period. For instance, Giovanni Salmeri foregrounds both textual and inscriptional evidence that the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> retained legislative authority, and that this authority shaped the interaction of elite statesmen with the assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0142064X13482798">2000</xref>: 72-73).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13482798">17</xref></sup> Likewise, John Ma shows that inscriptional and textual evidence registers democratic thought and practice associated with the assembly throughout the Hellenistic period and into the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142064X13482798">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142064X13482798">2000b</xref>). The unfettered democratic practice and decision-making characterizing classical Athens may have been impossible under the Romans. Nevertheless, the developing portrait in classics scholarship of active, democratic <italic>ekklēsiai</italic> in Greek cities of the empire seriously undermines earlier historical models in which the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> was seen as only the rubber stamp for a powerful <italic>boulē</italic> or council, itself dominated by omnipresent Roman power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13482798">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>That citizens continued to meet and to exercise political power in civic assemblies signiﬁcantly questions the disappearance of the democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> under the Romans. At the same time, evidence for the vitality of democratic thought is not limited to the physical theater or Pnyx, but is witnessed in what I call ‘<italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse’. By <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse, I mean the logic and <italic>topoi</italic> that marked constructions of democracy in the ﬁrst-century Roman Empire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X13482798">19</xref></sup> The civic assembly represents only one institution that sustained and replicated <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse. This discourse expanded into other ﬁelds of the Greco-Roman world to constitute a prevalent kind of social knowledge and cultural logics, deﬁning debates over power and authority in a variety of contexts. Here, Michel Foucault’s theory is useful to my argument because he understands discourse as sustained through, but not limited to, particular institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X13482798">1972</xref>: 45). A variety of institutions maintained <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse as a vital part of the Greek cultural context. These institutions included education, rhetoric and drama—institutions taking a critical role in shaping identity in the Greek city. Speciﬁcally, these institutions and their practices helped to form the democratic citizen as a speaking and discerning subject.</p>

<title>The Speech <italic>Topos</italic> in <italic>Ekklēsia</italic> Rhetoric</title>
<p>During Paul’s lifetime, the emphasis on citizen speech was the critical rhetorical <italic>topos</italic> connecting democratic discourse in the early empire with its powerful classical antecedent. In democratic Athens, the right to public, political speech delineated the nature of freedom and equality promised to the citizen by the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X13482798">20</xref></sup> Because fourth- and ﬁfth-century <sc>bce</sc> literature offers little systematic endorsement of democracy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X13482798">21</xref></sup> Euripides, in his play <italic>Suppliant Women</italic>, stands out with his lucid deﬁnition of free speech and its relationship with democratic citizenship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X13482798">22</xref></sup> In this play, Euripides explains freedom by quoting the formula used to open the assembly: ‘This is freedom: “Who is willing, having good counsel, to bring it before the city?”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X13482798">23</xref></sup> Here the extraordinary freedom and equality that democracy grants to its male citizens crystallizes in the ability to stand and speak persuasively to the gathered <italic>dēmos</italic>. Freedom of speech was not only the foundation of the democratic system in Athens, but also the act deﬁning the citizen subject.</p>
<p>Within classical Athens, all male citizens<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X13482798">24</xref></sup> could attend and contribute to the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> regardless of their economic status or profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X13482798">25</xref></sup> Ancient authors alternately described this freedom of speech with the words <italic>isēgoria</italic> and <italic>parrhēsia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X13482798">26</xref></sup> Not every citizen might make use of this right. However, Josiah Ober contends that the emphasis on <italic>isēgoria</italic> in the ﬁfth century <sc>bce</sc>—this radical right to political speech for each citizen—meant an equally radical impact for the majority of Athenian citizens attending the assembly. He explains, ‘<italic>Isēgoria</italic> changed the nature of mass experience from one of passive approval (or rejection) of measures presented, to one of actively listening to and judging the merits of complex, competing arguments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">1989</xref>: 79). In these terms, an active, discerning assembly audience decided matters of the state based on the speech brought before them. As <italic>isēgoria</italic> deﬁned the status of citizenship, it also circumscribed the exercise of political authority. ‘Direct public communication’ was the foundation of whatever leadership someone might offer in the democratic <italic>polis</italic>, a leadership always in a complicated negotiation with the power of the <italic>dēmos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">Ober 1989</xref>: 107).</p>
<p>With democratic assembly leadership and participation based in <italic>isēgoria</italic>, classical authors repeatedly invoke the necessary partnership of wisdom and speech on the part of assembly speakers and audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X13482798">27</xref></sup> Thucydides succinctly explains the dynamics of this partnership through Athenagoras of Syracuse: ‘While the wealthy are the best guardians of property, the wise (ξυνετούς) would be the best counselors, and the many, after hearing matters discussed would be the best judges; and that these classes … enjoy a like equality in democracy’ (Thucydides 6.39.1-2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X13482798">28</xref></sup> While other classical authors share Thucydides’ insistence that democracy depended on wise counselors or speakers, <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X13482798">29</xref></sup> these authors also betray a common assumption that the wisdom of the <italic>dēmos</italic> exceeds the wisdom of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">Ober 1989</xref>: 163-66). For his part, Aristotle approves of limited democracy because the many exhibit signiﬁcant ‘virtue and wisdom’ (ἀρετῆς καὶ φρονήσεως) when they gather in assembly or court, a collective virtue and wisdom that surpasses even that of the few possessing the greatest virtue in the city (Aristotle, <italic>Pol</italic>. 1289b1). Likewise, Demosthenes courts his audience by claiming, ‘You the many are not expected to speak as well as the orators, but you, especially the older ones of you, are expected to have intelligence equal or better than that of the speakers’ (<italic>Exord</italic>. 45.2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X13482798">30</xref></sup> In both examples, the ability—one might term it the special talent—of the <italic>dēmos</italic> to arrive collectively at wisdom enables citizens to practice the self-rule characterizing democracy.</p>
<p>In the ﬁrst and early second century <sc>ce</sc>, Plutarch and his near-contemporary Dio Chrysostom give particularly valuable witness to the continuing emphasis on <italic>polis</italic> citizenship and <italic>ekklēsia</italic> speech. Giovanni Salmeri asserts that, ‘It is above all the writings of Plutarch and Dio that show the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> as a far from negligible element in the political life of the <italic>polis</italic> during the imperial age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0142064X13482798">2000</xref>: 71-72). While both write with an awareness of Roman power, each commits to the Greek <italic>polis</italic> as their primary political forum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X13482798">31</xref></sup> Moreover, each describes this citizenship played out within the arena of the democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>: Plutarch in illuminating political treatises, and Dio within his own <italic>ekklēsia</italic> speeches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X13482798">32</xref></sup> In their role as civic elites, each explains that statesmen must lead by means of persuasive speech directed to a powerful citizen assembly. For instance, Plutarch juxtaposes leadership of the people (δῆμος) or city (πόλις) with attempting to influence the mob (ὄλος). The mob may be satisﬁed with bribes, but Plutarch insists, ‘It is necessary to lead a people (δῆμος) or a city mostly by the ears … for leadership of a people is leadership of those who are persuaded by speech.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X13482798">33</xref></sup> Likewise, Dio Chrysostom’s surviving assembly speeches describe the need to lead through persuasion,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X13482798">34</xref></sup> and his carefully crafted rhetoric embodies this practice.</p>
<p>If Plutarch and Dio specify persuasive speech as the medium of civic leadership, they also echo classical authors in suggesting that this speech must be paired with wisdom. Plutarch calls for the persuasive speech of the ‘statesman’ (πολιτευομένου) or ‘counselor’ (συμβουλεύοντος) to be full of true high-minded thought (φρονήματος ἀληθινοῦ)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X13482798">35</xref></sup> and foresight (Plutarch, <italic>Praec. ger. rei publ</italic>. 802 F). Likewise, he quotes Euripides from <italic>Antiope</italic>, ‘For one wise counsel over many hands is victor’ (σοφὸν γὰρ ἓν βούλευμα τὰς πολλὰς χέρας νικᾷ), in order to argue that ‘one sensible and persuasive expression of opinion accomplishes the greatest and most excellent public measures’ (μία γνώμη λόγον ἔχουσα καὶ πειθὼ τὰ κάλλιστα καὶ μέγιστα διαπράττεται τῶν κοινῶν) (Plutarch, <italic>An seni</italic> 790 A).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X13482798">36</xref></sup> Dio also repeatedly stresses wisdom in his own speech. Though Dio downplays his knowledge and speaking ability, he indicates that his service to the people resides in his wise words.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0142064X13482798">37</xref></sup> He also shares with classical authors the expectation for wisdom on the part of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> audience. For instance, speaking to the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> of his native Prusa, Dio acknowledges that the audience is capable of understanding, and claims that above all he hopes they should ‘have the character which is Greek and be neither ungrateful nor unintelligent (ἀξυνέτους)’ (<italic>Or</italic>. 43.3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0142064X13482798">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Plutarch and Dio also speak, sometimes bitterly, of the power that the <italic>dēmos</italic> holds over its citizen speakers. In this, they explicitly make the connection between speech and democracy. For instance, in one speech Dio acknowledges criticism towards citizen advisers as essential to democracy: ‘For it is not the nature of democracies, nor is it reasonable, that they should not allow anyone in the city either to speak against a single person or to ﬁnd fault with him, even when that person shows himself to be doing everything well …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0142064X13482798">39</xref></sup> For his part, Plutarch emphasizes the <italic>dēmos</italic>’s power and the necessity that each speaker develops a relationship of trust with this audience in order to exert authority. Plutarch explains that gaining this trust means a social leveling, ‘in the matter of power raising the low-born to the level of nobles, the poor to the rich, and the private citizen to the ofﬁce holders’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0142064X13482798">40</xref></sup> For Plutarch, the equality stemming from such trust allows each citizen to carry out <italic>parrhēsia</italic>, the freedom of speech at the heart of democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0142064X13482798">41</xref></sup> Here Plutarch champions citizen equality across the boundaries of class and rank, even as he deﬁnes that equality by the citizen speech with which Euripides also explained the freedom and equality of democracy.</p>
<p>Dio and Plutarch actively engage in a continuing democratic discourse centered on the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. However, the discourse they witness was mobilized in contexts beyond the traditional political institutions of the democratic city. Indeed, Plutarch and Dio themselves are products of a process of Greek education that disseminated this discourse over many centuries. Primarily drawing on texts from classical, democratic Athens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0142064X13482798">Morgan 1998</xref>: 3-7), this education introduced students, from some of their earliest writing exercises, to democratic principles regarding speech and citizenship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0142064X13482798">42</xref></sup> Meanwhile, more advanced rhetorical training like that of Aelius Theon’s ﬁrst-century <italic>Progymnasmata</italic> asked students not only to engage with classical democratic texts, but also imaginatively to inhabit a Greek city where their education prepares them to speak before a civic democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0142064X13482798">43</xref></sup> Such a process of <italic>paideia</italic> formed students as democratic citizens and <italic>ekklēsia</italic> members. This identity, this ‘citizenship’, could be reinforced through other channels in the Greek city beyond education and the classical canon. Participation in voluntary associations offered one such channel. These organizations often shared titles for their ofﬁcers with civic political ofﬁces, even as they exhibited democratic organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0142064X13482798">44</xref></sup> These parallels between civic politics and voluntary organizations have been explained as part of the compensatory role these organizations served for inhabitants of Greek cities, replacing the involvement and identity lost when the democratic <italic>polis</italic> ceased to exist in the Hellenistic era. However, one might argue along with Philip Harland that these organizations actually exhibit civic vitality in the early empire, a vitality that related to the continuing civic political involvement of a range of citizens—a range that includes Plutarch’s low born and nobles, poor and rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142064X13482798">Harland 2003</xref>: 101-106).</p>
<p>Democratic thought and practice continued to permeate the Greek East of the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, the cradle for the growing Christian movement. More speciﬁcally, I have also suggested that Paul’s correspondents in ﬁrst-century Roman Corinth knew and mobilized <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse. At ﬁrst glance, Corinth’s history seems to make such a claim counterintuitive. In 146 <sc>bce</sc>, the Romans defeated and largely destroyed the powerful ancient Greek city of Corinth. Corinth owed its decline, but also its resurrection as a vibrant city, to the Romans that resettled the city as a colony in 44 <sc>bce</sc>. James Walters details two recent trends in scholarship on Roman Corinth from the time of this refounding to the ﬁrst and second centuries <sc>ce</sc>. On the one hand, scholars increasingly recognize that ‘refounded Corinth was a more typical Roman colony with a stronger Roman character than has been assumed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0142064X13482798">Walters 2005</xref>: 397).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0142064X13482798">45</xref></sup> However, another group of scholars argues that ‘The civic identity of Roman Corinth began to change during the Augustan period and accelerated through the second century as the city became increasingly integrated into the surrounding Greek world, a transition already evident by the time of Claudius’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0142064X13482798">Walters 2005</xref>: 397).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0142064X13482798">46</xref></sup> This second group of scholars explores the complex negotiation between Greek and Roman identity as witnessed in Corinth’s archaeological record. This record attests that, even as a Greek population was reestablished in Corinth soon after its defeat in 146 <sc>bce</sc><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0142064X13482798">47</xref></sup> and became more visible in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0142064X13482798">48</xref></sup> Roman colonizers highlighted Corinth’s Greek past in order to validate Roman rule. Christine Thomas explains that this focus on Corinth’s traditional Greek identity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0142064X13482798">49</xref></sup> speaks to a hybrid discourse that was exploited by Romans and Greeks alike. Romans might use this discourse towards justifying their rule, but Greeks also ‘enthusiastically adopted this emphasis on Greek heritage … to depict a world in which most traces of Roman influence have faded from view’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0142064X13482798">Thomas 2010</xref>: 141). The Roman orator Favorinus, speaking to Corinthians in the early second century <sc>ce</sc>, suggests that this trajectory of Corinthian Hellenization included Greek <italic>paideia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0142064X13482798">50</xref></sup> and an awareness of the democratic discourse which had its own place within Greek identity under Rome. In his Corinthian oration, Favorinus rhetorically courts the Corinthians, both by asserting that they have been thoroughly Hellenized like him (<italic>Or</italic>. 37.26) and by naming them as Greek heirs to classical Corinth (<italic>Or</italic>. 37.1; 7; 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0142064X13482798">51</xref></sup> Further, he contends that these classical ancestors, and thus his audience, are distinguished by their support of democracy and the freedom from tyranny.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0142064X13482798">52</xref></sup> Hence one can argue that Greek-speaking inhabitants of ﬁrst-century Roman Corinth, participants in the increasing Hellenization of their city, would have known democratic discourse centered on <italic>ekklēsia</italic> speech, a discourse itself thoroughly implicated in Greek culture and <italic>paideia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0142064X13482798">53</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Corinthian <italic>Ekklēsia</italic>: Speech and Wisdom in the Christian Assembly</title>
<p>When Paul wrote to Corinth in the middle of the ﬁrst century, I suggest that both he and his audience were immersed in this <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse. In 1 Corinthians, the extensive use of the word <italic>ekklēsia</italic> itself signals this discourse, insofar as this letter claims an exceptional place in the New Testament, with the largest concentration of the term <italic>ekklēsia</italic> outside of the book of Acts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0142064X13482798">54</xref></sup> However, the signiﬁcance of this expression for indicating the presence of democratic discourse lies not only in its frequency, but also the way in which the word is deﬁned and the <italic>topoi</italic> that accompany it. Here, as in civic parlance, Paul applies this term to a corporate body, deﬁned not as a location, but as the group coming together in a gathering (1 Cor. 11.18). Moreover, the prominence of the word ‘<italic>ekklēsia</italic>’ pairs with the focus on speech and wisdom in 1 Corinthians. Beginning with the opening thanksgiving, speech and wisdom emerge as central concerns in this letter. While Paul’s other letters combined only use the words σοφία and σοφός 6 times, 1 Corinthians employs this vocabulary 28 times. Likewise, the word λόγος<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0142064X13482798">55</xref></sup> features more prominently in the Corinthian correspondence than in Paul’s other letters, appearing 26 times in 1 and 2 Corinthians compared to 38 occurrences in the ﬁve other undisputed Pauline epistles together with Colossians and Ephesians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0142064X13482798">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars have recognized the centrality of speech and wisdom<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0142064X13482798">57</xref></sup> in 1 Corinthians and have located that emphasis in the Hellenistic cultural and political context of the letter. For instance, Dale Martin and Lawrence Welborn hypothesize that Paul’s arguments over speech and wisdom reflect the role of Greco-Roman rhetoric in Corinthian strife, a strife that each relates to class conflict within the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13482798">Martin 1995</xref>: 49-54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0142064X13482798">Welborn 1997</xref>: 29-32). Martin, in particular, suggests that Paul problematizes rhetoric because rhetorical ability and education are such critical status indicators in the ancient world, linked to elite possession of wealth, beauty and noble birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13482798">1995</xref>: 49-54). Martin argues that for Paul to persuade those within the community who claim such status to lower themselves voluntarily, Paul must ﬁrst stake his own claim to high status and leadership. At the same time, Paul ultimately rejects the status upholding elite power as damaging to community, and valueless in comparison with divine speech and wisdom. To support this argument, Martin exploits assumptions regarding ancient democracy that I have already examined. Along with Stephen Pogoloff, on whom he relies in this discussion, Martin portrays ﬁrst-century rhetoric as divorced from a democratic context. In an echo of Horsley’s earlier quotation (see pp. 324-25 above), Pogoloff claims that, ‘under the Empire the practical public value of rhetoric declined as opportunities for free political speech were curtailed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142064X13482798">1992</xref>: 175). Since Martin and Pogoloff envision rhetoric permeating the Greco-Roman city,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0142064X13482798">58</xref></sup> they assert that civic elites trained in rhetoric primarily for the purpose of the classroom, the rigors of declamation and the cachet of status, but not for the civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13482798">Martin 1995</xref>: 50-51). For these scholars, rhetoric no longer ﬁgures into the complex negotiation between speakers and powerful citizen audiences in the democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0142064X13482798">59</xref></sup> but represents the one-sided exercise of power by the educated upper classes. In turn, this understanding of rhetoric and politics means that the function of rhetoric is largely equated in the Greek and Roman political contexts, and these scholars draw examples freely from each in order to tease out Paul’s arguments. Continuing vitality of democratic discourse and practice in the ﬁrst-century Greek East problematizes this view of rhetoric and power, and, in the process, raises a new set of questions regarding the debates over speech between Paul and the Corinthians. Not least, we must consider the possibility that a community engaged with democratic discourse might view rhetorical speech and wisdom not primarily as a marker of elite status and class conflict, but rather as the act that deﬁnes collective authority, together with individual freedom and equality.</p>
<p>Paul opens 1 Corinthians (1.1-9) by applauding the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, singling out their speech and wisdom for notice. Paul explains that the Corinthians have the grace of God through Christ Jesus, and states in 1.5, ‘in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind …’ (ὅτι ἐν παντὶ ἐπλουτίσθητε ἐν αὐτῷ, ἐν παντὶ λόγῳ καὶ πάσῃ γνώσει). Here, Paul might have speciﬁed any number of gifts that the Corinthians possess. In letters to other communities, Paul praises his audience for speciﬁc spiritual gifts highly valued throughout his writings, including faith (1 Thess. 1.3) and love (Phil. 1.9). However, beyond the grace of God in Christ, this thanksgiving only mentions Corinthian enrichment in speech and knowledge (1 Cor. 1.5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0142064X13482798">60</xref></sup> Unique among Paul’s epistles, this praise of Corinthian speech and wisdom is even more striking because Paul goes on to challenge systematically the group’s use of these gifts. Scholars have explained this dissonance between Paul’s initial approbation and later critique as part of Paul’s rhetorical appeal to the Corinthians’ own vision of themselves in order to make them more receptive to later criticism. For instance, Margaret Mitchell and Ben Witherington argue that Paul’s opening compliments to the community serve the rhetorical work of an <italic>exordium</italic> or προοίμιον designed to ‘make the hearers attentive, receptive, and well-disposed, and orient them to the argument to follow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142064X13482798">Mitchell 1991</xref>: 195).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0142064X13482798">61</xref></sup> In fact, such an <italic>exordium</italic> was a common strategy in ancient <italic>ekklēsia</italic> speeches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0142064X13482798">62</xref></sup> Paul’s use of this strategy shows that he shapes his rhetoric towards a group valuing speech and wisdom as part of their collective identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0142064X13482798">63</xref></sup> This thanksgiving intimates not division based on an unequal distribution of speech and wisdom, but that the community understood its members as all possessing powerful speech and wisdom by virtue of their relationship with Christ.</p>
<p>Beginning with 1 Cor. 1.17, a critique of worldly wisdom and eloquent, persuasive speech governs Paul’s rhetoric, indicating the presence of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse. With this verse, Paul initiates his challenge of the value of speech and wisdom practiced by the community. Indeed, Elizabeth Castelli views the relationship between power, speech and knowledge as the most contested terrain between Paul and the Corinthians within this letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13482798">1991</xref>: 208). Paul constructs his own authority based on this relationship, even as he questions Corinthian power as exercised through speech and wisdom. Paul claims in 1 Cor. 1.17 that his own ministry to the Corinthians lacked ‘eloquent wisdom’ (οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου) which endangers the power of the cross. 1 Corinthians 1.17 bridges a discussion of Corinthian factionalism associated with different leaders to a later discussion contrasting God’s wisdom with that of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0142064X13482798">64</xref></sup> In this verse, Paul introduces the word σοφία<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0142064X13482798">65</xref></sup> into the debate, indicating that the following argument about wisdom has some relationship to leadership, speciﬁcally his own. This disavowal of eloquent wisdom reappears in 1 Cor. 2.1, where he again insists that his initial proclamation did not feature ‘lofty words or wisdom’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0142064X13482798">66</xref></sup> Likewise, in 1 Cor. 2.4-5, Paul states that he did not use ‘persuasive words of wisdom’ (ἐν πειθοῖς σοφίας λόγοις)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0142064X13482798">67</xref></sup> so that the Corinthians’ faith did not rest on ‘human wisdom’ (ἐν σοφίᾳ ἀνθρώπων). With these statements, Paul rhetorically constructs his image as a leader who neither values nor employs eloquent, persuasive speech, itself linked with worldly wisdom. With Pogoloff, one might conclude that Paul uses this claim to make a surprising break with the dominant culture in which persuasive, eloquent speech is so integral to ‘the Hellenistic role of the ideal public ﬁgure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142064X13482798">1992</xref>: 134). However, within <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse, such a claim can be construed not as a radical rejection of personal status and authority by the speaker—or yet again as a rather empty rhetorical strategy employed to gain audience favor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13482798">Martin 1995</xref>: 52)—but instead as an essential element in the elite speakers’ negotiation of the power and authority of ‘the many’.</p>
<p>From the classical period into the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, Greek texts concerned with democracy reveal a tension centered on the role of elite orators. The democratic assembly required educated elite speakers who could provide the <italic>dēmos</italic> with wise advice and thoughtful options for future action. However, this recognition of elite rhetors’ worth to the common people, the <italic>idiōtai</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0142064X13482798">68</xref></sup> was balanced by a fear that elite rhetors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0142064X13482798">69</xref></sup> would not stop at offering advice, or better yet, verbalizing the wisdom of the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">Ober 1989</xref>: 165-68). Instead, Athenians harbored a strong anxiety that these orators would use their skills to deceive or mislead their audience, thus threatening the democratic process itself. As Ober explains, ‘The orator who put great store by his speaking ability was not merely unseemingly vain but threatened the whole state. He set himself about the decrees of the Assembly (e.g., Dem. 51.22) and believed that his ability to speak well gave him immunity from prosecution (Aristot. <italic>Rhet</italic>. 1372a11-17)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">1989</xref>: 169). In this atmosphere, elite speakers employed a variety of rhetorical strategies designed to preclude accusations that their own polished speech threatened the <italic>dēmos</italic>. In one such strategy, applied both to the assembly and court, the orator claimed that it was his opponents who were ‘sophists’, well-trained, clever speakers who used rhetoric towards selﬁsh or even evil ends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0142064X13482798">70</xref></sup> An equally prevalent, and not unrelated, rhetorical <italic>topos</italic> found the speaker characterizing himself as unskilled and inexperienced at crafting rhetoric. This last strategy, the ‘unskilled speaker’ <italic>topos</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0142064X13482798">71</xref></sup> became an especially useful element in the rhetor’s tool kit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0142064X13482798">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ober explains that self-presentation as an inexpert or inexperienced speaker was one of the ‘ﬁctions’ in the democratic assembly, one which allowed elite leaders to make common cause with their audiences by signaling that they supported equality in the political realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">1989</xref>: 191). At the same time, this rhetorical strategy could accomplish further beneﬁts for a civic leader. The unskilled speaker <italic>topos</italic> also allowed an orator to make a signiﬁcant truth claim. Speakers thereby asserted that they were using words supposedly so lacking in sophistication that they could only represent the truth, a truth entirely to the beneﬁt of the audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0142064X13482798">73</xref></sup> By taking on the guise of the amateur citizen speaker, elite rhetors could also use this <italic>topos</italic> to persuade—and even critique—their audience, hinting that resistance to the speaker’s proposals exposed the <italic>dēmos</italic>’s preference for eloquence or entertainment over substance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0142064X13482798">74</xref></sup> In most cases, the well-crafted orations of those employing this strategy revealed it to be an obvious fabrication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142064X13482798">Ober 1989</xref>: 175). As one of the ﬁnest orators of his age, Dio Chrysostom provides an excellent example of the elite rhetor who repeatedly, and with great eloquence, denies his ability to speak with any skill whatsoever.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0142064X13482798">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians, Paul’s own ﬁnely chosen words for an <italic>ekklēsia</italic> audience undermine his claims of limited rhetorical ability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13482798">Martin 1995</xref>: 47-54).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0142064X13482798">76</xref></sup> As in the civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, I would suggest that Paul employs this <italic>topos</italic> towards reinforcing his leadership within the community, even as he also uses it to challenge the authority of his audience. Paul may present himself as an inadequate speaker, in part to establish his credentials with a group primarily composed of non-elites. Scholars have commonly derived a description of the Corinthians’ stratiﬁed class and status out of Paul’s statement in 1.26 that few at the group’s founding could be labeled ‘well born’ (εὐγενεῖς), ‘powerful’ (δυνατοί) or wise ‘according to the flesh’ (σοφοὶ κατὰ σάρκα) (1 Cor. 1.26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0142064X13482798">77</xref></sup> Welborn recognizes that these words, along with their paired opposites used by Paul in the next verses, were associated not only with status, but with political allegiances in the ancient world. While ‘powerful’, ‘wise’ and ‘well born’ were often terms applied to wealthy supporters of oligarchy, the words ‘foolish’ (μωροί), ‘weak’ (ἀσθενεῖς) and ‘lowly born’ (ἀγενεῖς) often appeared as descriptors for the economically disadvantaged supporters of democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0142064X13482798">78</xref></sup> Rather than envisioning the ‘few’ wealthy and powerful members of the community as his target audience in these early chapters of 1 Corinthians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0142064X13482798">79</xref></sup> I suggest that Paul crafts his rhetoric towards the wider community dominated by non-elites. Indeed, Paul’s exercise of the unskilled speaker <italic>topos</italic> is most easily explained as a strategy directed towards such a group. However, we must also explain Paul’s transition from this initial sketch of the Corinthians in 1 Cor. 1.26-28 to a description of the wider group with other status indicators such as powerful, rich and royal (1 Cor. 4.8-10). Paul’s division of worldly and human wisdom is the key to this explanation. Together with the unskilled speaker <italic>topos</italic>, this conversation facilitates Paul’s unique truth claims in the letter. At the same time, he appears to use both the inexpert speaker strategy and his characterization of wisdom to secure the role of the common man, the <italic>idiōtēs</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0142064X13482798">80</xref></sup> for himself—a role he sets against his construction of the Corinthians as ‘elites.’</p>
<p>In 1 Cor. 1.18, Paul commences a lengthy argument distinguishing two types of wisdom: the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world (1 Cor. 1.20-21). This division of wisdom effectively divides human beings into two groups as well. Paul places himself among those who speak and possess divine wisdom. By contrast, Paul aligns the Corinthians with the inferior wisdom of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0142064X13482798">81</xref></sup> Deﬁning the two types of wisdom through association with other entities and concepts, Paul attributes to God’s wisdom the message of the cross (1.18, 23; 2.2) and divine power (1.24; 2.4-5). This divine wisdom has an eternal quality manifested through the foolish and weak in the eyes of the world (1.27-28; 2.7). Moreover, only those who are mature and spiritual can recognize this wisdom (2.6, 13-15). Paul claims that it is this very wisdom which characterizes his own leadership. Paul’s proclamation to the Corinthians embodied this wisdom, since it did not contain persuasive words, but ‘a demonstration of spirit and power’ (ἐν ἀποδείξει πνεύματος καὶ δυνάμεως) linked with the power of God (1 Cor. 2.4). In fact, the very weakness and fear that Paul demonstrates in his proclamation (1 Cor. 2.3) become assets, since they illustrate his own separation from fleshly matters.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to divine wisdom, Paul establishes the inferiority of worldly wisdom by linking it with the human (2.5), the fleshly (3.1-4) and, by extension, with immaturity (2.6; 3.1-4). As the wisdom of God is by implication eternal, this other wisdom must be transitory. In fact, Paul ties this wisdom to the rulers of this age (ἀρχόντων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου) who are ‘doomed to perish’ (2.6). Likewise, Paul ascribes this lesser wisdom to other groups, notably the scribe or debater (1.20),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0142064X13482798">82</xref></sup> and the ‘Greeks’ who seek wisdom (1.22). Finally, Paul couples worldly wisdom with persuasive, eloquent speech, which becomes the antithesis of his own message of divine wisdom (1.17; 2.1; 2.4).</p>
<p>The connection of eloquent wisdom to certain groups signiﬁcantly shapes the portrait that Paul develops of his Corinthian audience. Scholars have long sought to explain the connection between these groups that enables Paul to use them as a foil to divine wisdom. Recognition of the political valence of these words in the Hellenistic world reveals some of their rhetorical power in the early chapters of 1 Corinthians. With regard to the wise man, scribe and debater of 1 Cor. 1.20, scholars have often understood one or more of these ﬁgures as belonging to a Jewish context, and associated the remaining terms with the Hellenistic world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0142064X13482798">83</xref></sup> Arguably, a place also may be found for all three within the Greek democratic environment strongly associated with paired wisdom and speech—a pairing that also frames this passage in 1 Corinthians. Indeed, the focus on speech and wisdom that forms the context of this discussion means that ‘wise person’ (σοφός) may well designate the wise leader who applies his wisdom to political speech.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0142064X13482798">84</xref></sup> Meanwhile, although ‘scribe’ (γραμματεύς) was certainly used in a Jewish context, it was also a common title for certain magistrates in the Greek democratic <italic>polis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0142064X13482798">85</xref></sup> A ﬁrst-century author like Plutarch attests this use (<italic>An Seni</italic> 796E5), even as Acts 19.35 uses the term to describe an ofﬁcial associated with the Ephesian civic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. Likewise, the extremely unusual συζητητής may be used in 1 Cor. 1.20 to evoke not only, as Martin suggests, someone rhetorically trained for debate, but someone who carried out such debate within a Greek political context. Finally, Paul uses ἀρχῶν in 1 Cor. 2.6 and again in 2.8 as a key word to deﬁne the temporary and immature nature of wisdom ‘of this age’. Dio Chrysostom and Plutarch show that, during the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, this term could be employed as a general word for political leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0142064X13482798">86</xref></sup> However, these authors also utilize the word ἀρχῶν according to its most common meaning in classical Athens. In that context, the word signified an elected ofﬁce-holder, and thus was often used as a foil for ‘private citizens’—the <italic>idiōtēs</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0142064X13482798">87</xref></sup> Paul’s description of those who cruciﬁed the Lord with the aid of this word (2.8) suggests that its meaning in 1 Corinthians may not be exhausted by its democratic connotations. Nevertheless, Paul clearly draws upon the term’s association with political leadership. His rhetoric brings together the resonance of ἀρχῶν with that of ‘scribe’, ‘wise man’, ‘debater’ and the ‘Greeks who seek wisdom’ in order to craft a vision of those that Paul contends are ‘worldly’ in their speech and wisdom. In this vision, Paul’s construct is an influential ﬁgure who acts in a public, political context with ‘human’ wisdom and speech as the hallmarks of leadership and authority.</p>
<p>By the beginning of ch. 3, Paul has laid the necessary groundwork to establish that the Corinthians themselves possess inferior worldly, or human, wisdom. In 1 Cor. 3.1, he describes the Corinthians as possessing the characteristics of this worldly wisdom, naming them ‘fleshly’ (σαρκίνοις) and ‘infants in Christ’ (νηπίοις ἐν χριστῷ). Paul asserts continued jealousy and quarrelling in the community—including claims of allegiance to Paul and Apollos (3.4)—to support his contention that the Corinthians are not yet spiritual people (3.1). Because they are immature, fleshly and contentious, the Corinthians can only be aligned with worldly wisdom and its accompaniment in Paul’s rhetoric: eloquent and persuasive speech. Likewise, through association, they can be understood—like the ἀρχῶν, like the συζητητής—to be politically powerful by human standards. Nevertheless, Paul indicates that they are separated from true power and true wisdom. After praising their speech and knowledge in 1 Cor. 1.5 as a fulﬁllment of their life in Christ, Paul now deﬁnes the Corinthians by wisdom and speech that lacks divine power, and thus, has no place in the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.</p>
<p>Castelli reads ‘echoes of the competing discourse of Corinthian power’ in Paul’s arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13482798">1991</xref>: 208). While Paul’s arguments legitimize his own authority over and against his audience, even affording him a unique authority as builder and ‘father’, Castelli hypothesizes that the ‘Corinthians as knowers and speakers seem to understand power as a fluid, surging quality, occupying different bodies at different moments and with varying intensities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13482798">1991</xref>: 209). This description of the community’s exercise of power closely parallels ancient <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse and practice, in which every citizen had the right to speech and thus to power that shifted with each new discussion and speaker. However, a recognition that Paul and the Corinthians do indeed participate in <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse allows us to be more speciﬁc about the exercise of authority not only by individuals (Paul among them), but also the community’s power as an <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.</p>
<p>Paul attributes to his Corinthian audience paired ‘worldly’ wisdom and persuasive speech, thus recalling the pairing of speech and wisdom in the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> by ancient authors from the classical period into the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>. These ancient authors largely judged democracy’s success by the wisdom of speech on the part of citizen leaders, and wise discernment of that speech by the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> itself. In the case of the Corinthian community, Paul’s arguments not only suggest that the Corinthians looked for this type of wisdom among their leaders, but that, as a group, they also claimed excellence in speech and wisdom. Indeed, Paul’s ﬁrst appeal to the Corinthians as ones gifted in speech and wisdom indicates that, as a group, they saw themselves as possessing those very skills that deﬁned both citizenship and superior leadership in the democratic city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0142064X13482798">88</xref></sup> Within <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse, the right of each citizen to speech also rendered each member of the assembly as an active, discerning participant in the powerful whole of the <italic>dēmos</italic> itself. Each speaker coming before the assembly had to negotiate with this powerful <italic>dēmos</italic>, navigating possible critique and debate over their leadership. In 1 Corinthians, Paul intimates that debate within the community centers on his own leadership. Moreover, the signs of Corinthian debate over leadership accompany Paul’s efforts to destabilize Corinthian conﬁdence in the very speech and wisdom grounding their authority as an <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.</p>
<p>If one recognizes the prevalence of democratic discourse in Paul’s rhetoric, one can see how he uses it to negotiate with an audience steeped in this discourse. Paul’s rhetoric indicates that the Corinthians expected leadership through persuasive speech and that they understood themselves to be empowered to judge those who acted as leaders. At the same time, Paul’s discussion of speech and wisdom works to privilege his voice as a leader in the community. The very act of persuasion that Paul uses in this effort shows that he is negotiating with the authority of the Corinthians in the model of an <italic>ekklēsia</italic> audience endowed with the power to make decisions. However, Paul also seeks to erode the community’s authority relative to his own.</p>
<p>Paul may draw on the unskilled speaker <italic>topos</italic> in part to appeal to an audience that understood itself as a democratic <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. This strategy allows Paul to distance himself from negative understandings of elite orators in a democratic context. However, the use of this strategy in conjunction with the division of human and divine wisdom also enables Paul to gain a signiﬁcant rhetorical advantage over his audience. By denying his ability to use the persuasive speech that he associates with human leadership, Paul emphasizes his access to the divine truth not yet possessed by the Corinthians. Likewise, as Paul’s rhetoric distances him from expert, wealthy politicians, this rhetoric also equates the Corinthians with the very powerful elites that Paul aligns with human wisdom and eloquent speech. This contrast comes to a climax in 1 Cor. 4.8-13, where the Corinthians are characterized as rich and fulﬁlled kings,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0142064X13482798">89</xref></sup> while Paul and his fellow apostles are hungry, thirsty, weak, poorly clothed and beaten. I would argue that Paul, with the aid of these comparisons, seeks to present the Corinthians themselves as suspect according to the standards of democratic discourse. Perhaps even more damaging within this discourse, Paul uses the distinction between worldly and divine wisdom to question the Corinthians’ ability to arrive at truth through the very type of debate and judgment that characterizes the civic assembly—debate that is here directed towards Paul’s own leadership.</p>
<p>Paul’s challenge to Corinthian speech and collective judgment echoes ancient critics of democracy who question the capability of the gathered <italic>dēmos</italic> to govern effectively in the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0142064X13482798">90</xref></sup> Such critique calls into question the legitimacy of the Corinthians as a governing body. Here, his portrayal of wisdom and speech as being of two types, divine and worldly, deﬁnes <italic>ekklēsia</italic> authority and participation heavily in Paul’s favor. According to this redeﬁnition, the wisdom and speech that Paul associates with the Corinthians can no longer be considered an effective basis for conducting the community’s affairs or for arriving at truth. As in elite critiques of democratic government in the ancient world, Paul labels the Corinthians as immature because their wisdom is shown to be lacking in critical ways. Their worldly speech and wisdom fall short of that essential truth related to God and to Christ, and, by Paul’s account, can only lead further away from such truth. Meanwhile, Paul asserts possession of the inﬁnitely better, yet mysterious, divine wisdom and speech, thus placing himself among the ones who judge all things, yet are subject to no one else’s judgment (1 Cor. 2.15).</p>
<p>When Paul associates himself with superior, divine wisdom, he appropriates an authority that he denies to the Corinthian <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. Indeed, Paul appeals to this divine authority in arguing that he is impervious to the Corinthians’ judgment (1 Cor. 2.14; 4.3-4). An awareness of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse allows the reader of 1 Corinthians to discern the ways in which Paul’s rhetoric works not to afﬁrm his ‘authority as an apostle among apostles’, but rather to negotiate with the Corinthians’ own power in a bid to establish Paul’s unique claims to authority as the community’s ‘sole founder and father’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0142064X13482798">91</xref></sup> I would argue that Paul rhetorically sustains his claims to unique authority by introducing the issue of division into the community’s discussion. In these terms, Paul may be understood to reinterpret Corinthian debates over leadership and shared governance—debates which are themselves located in democratic discourse—as divisive party strife illustrating Corinthian immaturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0142064X13482798">Schüssler Fiorenza 1999</xref>: 118). However, the most serious division that Paul introduces into these early chapters regards the nature of wisdom and speech. Paul’s rhetoric indicates that the Corinthians envision themselves as transformed in Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0142064X13482798">Wire 1990</xref>: 31, 187). Indeed, Schüssler Fiorenza describes the contents of 1 Corinthians as follows: ‘The whole letter documents this baptismal self-understanding of the many who were nothing in the eyes of the world before their call, but who now have freedom, knowledge, wisdom, riches, and power over their own bodies and life in their new kinship-community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0142064X13482798">1999</xref>: 122). According to this description, the Corinthians would most likely consider their democratic power of speech and decision to be based in their new relationship with the risen Christ. However, Paul undercuts this very claim to be uniﬁed in superior speech and wisdom, contending instead that only a limited number of Christians speak ‘true’, divine wisdom. With the intimation that the Corinthians do not speak this wisdom, Paul questions the very basis for Corinthian power as a discerning assembly. In the context of such <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse, Paul carefully fashions his arguments towards an assembly with the authority to make communal decisions. At the same time, Paul rhetorically undermines the authority of this body to debate and critique his own leadership.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My interpretation of the early chapters of 1 Corinthians in terms of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse indicates that Paul constructed his authority and directed his message to a community deeply informed by the logic of Hellenistic democracy. Into the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc>, a vital democratic discourse constructed citizenship, civic participation and leadership in terms of public speech of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. Moreover, authors belonging to the early empire retained the classical connection of that speech to wisdom on the part of speakers and audiences alike. Scholars such as Betz, Martin and Welborn have contextualized the pairing of speech and wisdom in 1 Corinthians within ancient rhetoric.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0142064X13482798">92</xref></sup> However, they have not considered the place of this rhetoric in democratic discourse centered on the <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, thus overlooking Paul’s subtle power negotiation with his Corinthian audience. With an awareness of democratic discourse, Paul’s division of speech and wisdom into worldly and divine types becomes not just a theological claim, but also a fundamentally political one. Recognizing Paul’s rhetorical exercise of power through the deployment of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse reveals the Corinthians’ understanding of their own authority as a discerning assembly made up of participants with equal voice. In turn, such a reading of the argument precludes acceptance of Paul as a univocal source of authority and theology, and instead foregrounds his debates and negotiation with a diverse audience. Viewing the Corinthian church as a democratic assembly—where all participants share a right to leadership through deliberative speech, and all listeners share a claim to judgment—reconﬁgures our understanding of Paul’s own leadership, as well as our expectations for the way the community might respond to a letter like 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>A recognition of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse in the ﬁrst century <sc>ce</sc> not only illuminates Paul’s initial rhetorical strategies in 1 Corinthians, but it also brings into high relief later passages of this letter that display the <italic>topos</italic> of speech and the deployment of this discourse. In turn, the presence of this discourse in early Christian literature prompts new questions about the nature of participation and leadership in such Christian communities. As I have argued in this article, speech holds special signiﬁcance within democratic discourse as that action by which citizenship is realized, an action that further deﬁnes freedom and equality as they exist within democracy. In the case of 1 Cor. 1–4, Paul’s arguments about the exercise of speech and wisdom are sensible within this <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse. I believe we must extend this analysis of democratic discourse to later parts of the letter that also center on <italic>ekklēsia</italic> speech, and interrogate Paul’s rhetoric for further insights into the construction of citizenship in the Corinthian <italic>ekklēsia</italic>. A number of key questions present themselves if we use <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse as an interpretive lens. For instance, how might we revise our understanding of women’s citizenship and participation in this community? In what ways would women’s participation as full speaking members of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> challenge the constitutive exclusions of ancient democratic discourse? We must also consider the ways in which Paul’s own rhetoric not only deploys class and status but genders speech, and also consider what this gendering means for the boundaries he seeks to create regarding Corinthian citizenship. I have sought to demonstrate that the presence of <italic>ekklēsia</italic> discourse in 1 Corinthians reconﬁgures our understanding of the exercise of communal and individual exercise of power in this group. Moving forward, I suggest that we must not only question how such discourse circumscribed Paul’s rhetoric and authority, but also how it may have empowered the full range of individuals claiming citizenship in the Christian <italic>ekklēsia</italic>.</p>

<p>In the case of Dio, there remain a number of speeches that he gave before the <italic>ekklēsiai</italic> of various cities, including eight before the assembly in his home city of Prusa. These speeches help to establish the types of concerns that might have been brought before a civic assembly, but also demonstrate how these issues would have been discussed and ultimately settled. Although we retain no speeches that Plutarch may have actually delivered in an <italic>ekklēsia</italic>, we do have several political treatises, most notably <italic>An seni respublica gerenda sit</italic> (<italic>Old Men in Political Affairs</italic>) and <italic>Praecepta gerendae rei publicae</italic> (<italic>Political Advice</italic>), that dwell at length on the relationship of statesmen to an active civic assembly. These texts contain wonderful descriptions of the functioning ﬁrst-century <italic>ekklēsia</italic> that strongly suggest that Plutarch himself had considerable experience in the arena of the assembly during his public career. In their focus on political involvement rather than rhetorical teaching, they provide a contrast to some members of the Second Sophistic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0142064X13482798">Salmeri (2000</xref>: 66) suggests that Philostratus presents influential ﬁgures of the Second Sophistic as primarily involved in such teaching, in contrast to Plutarch and Dio’s more varied interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13482798">Graham Anderson (1993</xref>: 18-19) argues that Philostratus’s working deﬁnition of the sophist as ‘a specialist teacher and a specialist in ornamental oratory’ might be traced back to the Athens of Isocrates, but would come to be personiﬁed by ﬁgures of the Second Sophistic like Hermagoras and Dionysius Atticus.</p>

<p>This imaginative engagement with the democratic <italic>polis</italic> is also the foundation for the advanced rhetorical practice of declamation. D.A.

In this case the formula not only states the Corinthians’ self-praise but must also contain Paul’s critique and the clue to the following arguments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13482798">1989</xref>: 33). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0142064X13482798">Stanley Stowers (1986</xref>: 22) recognizes that Paul uses foreshadowing in the thanksgiving: ‘In 1 Corinthians (1:4-9), he gives thanks for the speech, knowledge and spiritual gifts of the Corinthians. In chapters 1–4, 8, and 12–14 the reader learns that the improper use of wisdom, knowledge, charismatic speech, and spiritual gifts are, according to Paul, central problems for the Corinthian church.’</p>

<p>This noun (συζητητής) is rarely used, found only here and in Ignatius’s quotation of the verse in <italic>Eph.</italic> 18.1. However, the verb (συζητεῖν) is more common.

<p>Lycurgus (1.79) suggests that the <italic>politeia</italic> is composed of three types of people: the ἀρχῶν, the juryman and the <italic>idiōtēs</italic>. Dio (<italic>Or</italic>. 49.11) attests the usage of ἀρχῶν as an ofﬁce in several places, notably in a speech in which he discusses his own candidacy for this ofﬁce (see also <italic>Or</italic>. 47.19). Plutarch uses this terminology numerous times in his political treatises <italic>An seni respublica gerenda sit</italic> and <italic>Praecepta gerendae rei publicae</italic>. I offer two particularly helpful examples: in <italic>Praec.

However, it is worth noting that this characterization of the <italic>ekklēsia</italic> as ‘king’ also ﬁnds a place in ﬁrst-century discussions of democracy, as we can see in Dio’s suggestion (<italic>Or</italic>. 32.27-28) that the power of the gathered assembly can be manifested in resemblance to a reasonable and righteous king or, perversely, in approximating a cruel tyrant.</p>

<p>One can hear echoes of a range of democracy’s critics in 1 Corinthians. Certainly Paul shares the concerns voiced by an author like Thucydides, namely that <italic>ekklēsia</italic> audiences appreciated eloquence over true wisdom. This comes through clearly in the famous speeches recorded by Thucydides for Cleon and Diodotus (Thucydides 3.37.1–3.48.2). A concern for the wisdom of the governing <italic>dēmos</italic> also comes through in discussions of ‘excessive’ freedom which means that ‘even women and slaves’ have a freedom that matches that of citizens. For this critique, see Plato, <italic>Resp</italic>. 8.557 B. Likewise, concern about democracy centers on the idea that this political system is a tyranny of the poor and the disadvantaged, and that a <italic>dēmos</italic> dominated by the poor will only seek their own interests rather than the best and wisest course for the city as a whole. See Plato, <italic>Resp</italic>. 8. 557 A; Aristotle, <italic>Pol</italic>. 1279 B-1280 A; 1290 A-B; Old Oligarch [Xen.], <italic>Ath. Pol</italic>. i.4-9.
