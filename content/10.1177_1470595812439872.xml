<abstract>
<p>The article offers a critique of the concept of cultural intelligence (CQ) from a semiotic perspective. It addresses three assumptions that underpin the CQ concept: that CQ exists, that conflict and misunderstandings are antithetical to CQ and that metacognition involves a cultural dimension. The analysis focuses in particular on the dimension of <italic>cultural metacognition</italic> which has recently been claimed to be the CQ concept’s main contribution compared to earlier concepts such as cross-cultural or intercultural competence, a claim which is found to be overstated. The article uses the example of CQ training to illustrate the need for greater attention to context and motivation when CQ is deployed for business purposes, as well as to the role of experience in cultural learning processes. At a broader level, the article urges caution in assuming that all human attributes can be trained for business purposes, especially through short-term interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Current discussions of <italic>cultural <sc>i</sc>ntelligence</italic> (CQ) comprise a highly complex and dense mesh of ideas, making it a challenging concept to use and apply in practical business situations. Despite this, CQ training has today become a thriving industry, much like its sister concept, emotional intelligence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470595812439872">Lindebaum, 2009</xref>). CQ has been presented recently as an important new insight into how to handle cross-cultural communication and negotiation – an ‘idea whose time has come’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 78). CQ’s claim to novelty is said to lie particularly in its emphasis on <italic>culture-general</italic> abilities that are not linked to any specific context, rather than <italic>culture- or place-specific</italic> knowledge.  Culturally intelligent people are, to quote two recently used metaphors, like chameleons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>), or like the ancient Greek character Proteus in Homer’s Odyssey, ‘a sea dweller who could change shape at will and become a fish, or a lion, or a tree, or a fire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>In this article, we argue that the CQ concept <italic>as it is currently defined</italic> has little new to add to key concepts that were previously used to describe the abilities needed in situations defined as cross-cultural, e.g. cross-cultural and intercultural competence (CCC and ICC), cultural literacy and global mindset.  We furthermore propose that CQ is also conceptually closer than is immediately apparent to frameworks such as Hofstede’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470595812439872">1</xref>
</sup> which seek to classify cultural differences in advance of intercultural encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470595812439872">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). Although CQ scholarship takes pains to demarcate itself from Hofstede’s framework (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812439872">Earley et al., 2006</xref>), ultimately it shares the goal of ensuring that behaviour is adapted to the customs of a specific place with a view to avoiding misunderstandings and conflict. Consequently, we do not find it so very different from prescriptive approaches to cross-cultural communication that construct cultural differences as objective and static.</p>
<p>Taking our point of departure in recent scholarship on CQ (Ang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812439872">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439872">Earley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439872">Earley and Ang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439872">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439872">Ng and Earley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470595812439872">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">2012</xref>), we explore some key assumptions that underpin the concept of CQ with a view to developing its theoretical foundations and to furthering the critical debates that are currently emerging around it. Specifically, we draw on a semiotic understanding of learning to question the link between metacognition and experience as depicted in CQ literature, and to offer an alternative to it. Our point of departure is that the CQ concept, while potentially useful, needs further refinement if it is to become a useful tool for business scholars and practitioners. To illustrate our theoretical points, we will discuss them in relation to the example of CQ training as a mean to secure employees cultural skills in global business.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>At a broader level, our discussion highlights some problems that can arise when concepts with roots in the humanities are imported into a business context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470595812439872">Thompson Klein, 2000</xref>: 6). With international business research today increasingly interdisciplinary and open to the ‘human’ dimensions of business as well as the technical or functional areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812439872">Cant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470595812439872">Wright and Ricks, 1994</xref>), some of the questions we highlight concerning the uses of the CQ concept in a business context are arguably also pertinent to future research in other highly interdisciplinary areas of business research, e.g. human resource management and organizational culture. In particular, we wish to draw attention to an assumption in some of these areas of literature that human beings can necessarily be trained to meet all business needs. Specifically, we argue that there may be limits to what can be achieved through short-term training interventions, especially when these are aimed not merely at job-related skills acquisition but at the development of personality attributes such as empathy (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470595812439872">Lindebaum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>: 68). As the title of our article implies, we should not take for granted that it is any more plausible to train people to adapt seamlessly to any context than to train them to fly, just because that happens to be what international business seems to need at a given point in time.</p>

<title>Cultural intelligence: definitions and assumptions</title>
<p>While definitions of CQ differ somewhat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>, for an overview), in general terms CQ is understood as the ability to behave appropriately in cross-cultural settings. This ability encompasses cognitive, emotional and behavioural dimensions, which are usually interpreted in terms of three proxies: knowledge/cognition, motivation/mindfulness and behaviour. The first proxy in CQ deals with <italic>knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>) or cognition and metacognition (Ang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812439872">2007</xref>; Early and Ang, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439872">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), described as knowledge of the ‘other’ culture. This, then, is the same as culture-specific knowledge. Ang and Earley, however, talk about cognition from a perspective based on social psychology, involving both culture-specific knowledge and <italic>metacognition</italic>, i.e. knowledge of how cognition is embedded in a specific cultural context. Metacognition is defined as ‘thinking about thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>: 105) and ‘knowledge of and control over one’s thinking and learning activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 131). The second proxy is usually labelled <italic>mindfulness</italic>, defined as enhanced attention to, or monitoring of, own thoughts, motives, emotions and the external environment with a view to adequate adaption to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470595812439872">Ting-Toomey, 1999</xref>); or <italic>motivation</italic>, explained in terms of identity formation and personality structures and the ability to ‘direct attention and energy toward learning about and functioning in situations characterized by cultural differences’ (Ang et al., 2007: 338; Early and Ang, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439872">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439872">Ng and Earley, 2006</xref>). The last of the three proxies is <italic>behaviour</italic>, understood as the ability to generate <italic>appropriate</italic> behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439872">Earley, 2002</xref>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 80) based on knowledge of a cultural context, and it is seen as the most tangible indicator that a person possesses CQ.</p>
<p>Although e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>) divide CQ into these three proxies, they argue that CQ is a ‘<italic>system</italic> of interacting knowledge and skills linked by <italic>cultural metacognition</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>; our emphasis). Cultural metacognition is, for Thomas et al., the dimension which integrates the other three proxies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 127–9). The concept of CQ is explicitly distinguished by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>: 125) from earlier concepts<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470595812439872">3</xref>
</sup> addressing cross-cultural interaction, such as ICC and CCC, cultural literacy, global mindset and cross-cultural adaptability, principally because the notion combines different abilities, and because it adds this dimension of <italic>cultural metacognition</italic>: ‘in contrast to previous definitions, we describe cultural intelligence as a unique construct that emerges as a result of the interaction of its facets’. In other words, cultural metacognition is the ‘x-factor’ which binds together the facets of behaviour, mindfulness and knowledge and enables people to be culturally intelligent, and which is at the heart of claims that CQ is a ‘significant development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 138) compared to its predecessors, ICC and CCC. CQ is also explicitly differentiated from the concepts of <italic>social</italic> and <italic>emotional</italic> <italic>intelligence</italic> inasmuch as these two constructs are considered ‘specific to the culture in which they were developed and do not necessarily relate to <italic>cross cultural</italic> interactions’ (emphasis added). An example given is that ‘social skills learned and honed in one country may be ineffective or even offensive in another culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 125). CQ is thus also considered a step forward because it supposedly enables its bearers to transcend place-specific knowledge and behaviours.</p>
<p>We find it pertinent to discuss the theoretical challenges and possibilities of the concept of cultural<italic> metacognition</italic>, both because it is deemed so crucial a theoretical advance, and because it is a very enticing concept in relation to the needs of today’s global workplace. We use the example of training in businesses operating globally to illustrate our theoretical points, as this is a key area where the CQ concept has been used lately with the aim of ensuring that employees have the necessary cultural skills for engaging in global business.</p>
<p>Thomas et al.’s (2008) recent article raises many timely and salient points with which we concur concerning the definition of the CQ concept and its uses. However, we further identify several key implicit assumptions that underpin the CQ concept, and which remain unchallenged. These assumptions have important implications for the concept’s practical applications in e.g. recruitment, training and more broadly for organizations’ overall strategy regarding cultural matters. They are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Assumption I: That CQ exists;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Assumption II: That conflicts and misunderstandings are antithetical to CQ;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Assumption III: That CQ involves a ‘cultural’ dimension.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We address each assumption in turn, relating the notion of CQ to a business context. We then discuss the theoretical implications if one or more of the assumptions should prove to be unfounded.  Based on these discussions and on a semiotic framework, we offer a critique of the concept of metacognition as it is currently deployed in CQ literature, and suggest some alternative ways in which firms might approach the questions of cultural training processes for staff working in international or multicultural environments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470595812439872">
<title>Assumption 1: That CQ exists</title>
<p>Imagine the perfect global executive. If we are to believe recent literature, s/he would combine many enviable personal attributes: sharp business acumen, empathy, openness and the chameleon-like ability to adapt to every imaginable cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>). Like all good chameleons, s/he would blend effortlessly into the surroundings, knowing what to wear and how to behave to fit in. S/he would be mindful, discreet and able to monitor his/her own behaviour in such a way as to further the company goals. So far so good, you may say, but what would this person actually look like? It is here where things get tricky because, although from time to time a sighting is rumoured, nobody has yet proven that this elusive figure actually exists.</p>
<p>Existing scholarly descriptions of the culturally intelligent person bear more than a passing resemblance to the figure we have just portrayed.  First, while definitions of CQ in the literature vary considerably, most scholars view it as a construct composed of various dimensions – e.g. cultural knowledge, cultural skills and cultural metacognition –  that interact to produce a whole: what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>: 132–3) refer to as the ‘chicken soup’ as opposed to the bits floating in it. The ‘bits’ are derived from the results of empirical studies in a wide variety of fields, including expatriate research, cultural adjustment, cognition, intelligence and performance. These ‘bits’ are then combined to make the ‘soup’: cultural intelligence.</p>
<p>CQ is thus a composite construct ‘resulting from the interaction of its facets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 125). This construct was not derived from repeated inductive observations of ‘culturally intelligent’ individuals, but from a wish to devise a conceptual antithesis to what we might crudely call culturally <italic>unintelligence.  </italic>But whereas cultural <italic>un</italic>intelligence<italic> –</italic>typically described in terms of misunderstandings, conflicts or ‘problems caused by intercultural differences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>: 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439872">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>: 527) – has been amply documented empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439872">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>), this is not the case for cultural <italic>in</italic>telligence. The CQ concept thus poses several methodological challenges which also have implications for its practical applicability.</p>
<p>The first challenge is that CQ has no observable exemplars. The empirical examples given in the literature are invariably of instances where communication is considered to have gone awry, leading to conflict or other forms of communication breakdown. These are examples of cultural unintelligence, not cultural intelligence. It is of course methodologically perfectly acceptable in social science to deploy concepts which do not have directly observable exemplars, i.e. that are theoretical rather than descriptive. Ideal type concepts, which are abstractions intended to represent commonalities among empirical cases of a given phenomena, are a well-known example of this. However, cultural intelligence would appear to be more an idealized than an ideal type since it represents the antithesis of an empirically founded abstraction – cultural unintelligence. This raises problems in terms of the verification, or testability, of CQ, which are important to address, since CQ testing is increasingly deployed in the business world, e.g. in recruitment.</p>
<p>Verifying CQ empirically means deploying parameters to measure how it is expressed, and this is where difficulties arise. So far, as mentioned above, the parameters used in the literature to assess a person’s CQ have mainly been based on notions of effective or appropriate behaviour or performance, which are typically rather vaguely defined as the absence of misunderstandings and conflict and/or the successful and effective achievement of work assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812439872">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>: 15 and 17; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439872">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>: 538). The individual attributes and skills thought to produce effective or appropriate behaviour/performance are, in turn, many and varied. Earley et al.’s (2006) PRISM model, for instance, identifies five dimensions that people can use to gauge their CQ readiness;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470595812439872">4</xref>
</sup> while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2012</xref>) focus in particular on two factors as particularly important: ‘information gathering or perceptual skills, and interpersonal or relationship skills’. However, the parameters used to define CQ and the skills presumed to produce culturally intelligent behaviour still seem too vague to be easily operationalized for the purposes of testing. Defining CQ in relation to such parameters is furthermore vastly complicated by many other factors that might intervene to produce effective or appropriate behaviours in a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439872">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>: 538; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Economic factors may, for instance, preclude effective business solutions even among highly culturally intelligent people.</p>
<p>Given that it has been such a challenge to define valid parameters to measure CQ or the skills that produce it, and that this field is still young (Ang et al. 2007), it is perhaps not surprising that to date only few scientific attempts have been made to actually measure it. Of these, one (Ang et al., 2004) ‘relies entirely on self-reports of past behaviour and cognitive processes’ which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2012</xref>) point out, limit its validity since people’s accounts of their own effectiveness are unlikely to be reliable. Another attempt, Thomas et al.’s (2012) own web-based assessment tool, aimed to test the three dimensions of CQ: knowledge, skills and cultural metacognition. The knowledge dimension was derived from existing literature on cross-cultural variations in beliefs and behavioural assumptions; and the skills dimension was derived from existing cross-cultural effectiveness instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). Cultural metacognition was assessed using responses to film-based scenarios acted by professional actors and based on a survey of ‘the most frequent failures in cross-cultural interactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). Scenarios were not based on respondents’ real-life experiences but on ‘questions and stimulus materials on a computer screen and through audio instructions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). Respondents were themselves classified according to ‘cultural clusters’ based on country of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>While self-reporting only constituted one aspect of Thomas et al’s approach, further problems arise when this test is analysed more closely. First, ‘culture’ and ‘cultural difference’ are defined in the instrument exclusively in terms of national culture dimensions derived from sources that have themselves been much criticized for their approach to culture, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812439872">Hofstede (1984</xref>; see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812439872">Ailon, 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812439872">Nakata, 2009</xref>, for a recent critique of Hofstede’s framework). Second, the scenarios to which participants were asked to respond were based on possible misunderstandings and failures in cross-cultural interaction: in other words, the tool assesses responses to behaviours perceived to be culturally unintelligent rather than culturally intelligent. This is arguably because appropriate behaviour usually goes unremarked, with only inappropriate behaviour generally incurring a noticeable reaction. The absence of conflict and misunderstandings in a given situation, conversely, is so open to interpretation that it is hard to see how it could be used as a valid indicator of CQ, since conflicts and misunderstandings may be suppressed due to a myriad of factors such as politeness conventions, social hierarchies, the need to sustain cordial working relations, etc. The interpretation of conflict and misunderstandings as failures in communication is also highly debatable, since they may instead constitute an ultimately positive learning moment in an encounter.</p>
<p>These attempts to operationalize the CQ concept for the purposes of testing or measuring thus underscore three key problems: an assumption that culture means <italic>national</italic> culture, an empirical focus on the CQ concept’s <italic>antithesis</italic> – cultural <italic>unintelligence</italic> – as an implicit proxy for CQ and, related to the latter, the notion that conflict is a sign of failed communication. We will return to this latter issue in our discussion of the remaining assumptions that underpin the CQ concept.</p>
<p>The second challenge arising from the composite nature of the CQ construct has to do with how the different dimensions of CQ should be related to one another, e.g. in assessing a person’s overall cultural intelligence (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470595812439872">March, 2005</xref>, for a critique of this point). Thus, for instance, does a person qualify as ‘culturally intelligent’ if they are exceedingly mindful but not particularly adept at adapting their behaviour?  Or if they possess a lot of factual knowledge about a particular culture but are not very mindful? Second, how do the proxies relate to one another: for instance, is knowledge always correlated to, or a precondition for, better behavioural skills/mindfulness? Third, are some dimensions more relevant than others for certain situations or professions, i.e. should businesspeople negotiating a contract mobilize different dimensions of their CQ than ex-pat spouses trying to integrate into a local community in a foreign country? And finally, what is the link between the culture-specific dimensions of CQ (knowledge and skills) and the all-important culture-general ‘linking function’, cultural metacognition? Notably, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>) conceptualize cultural metacognition as the integrating factor for the other proxies (2008: 128–32), they nonetheless conclude that ‘content knowledge of cultures is the foundation of CQ because it forms the basis for comprehending and decoding the behaviour of ourselves and others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 82).</p>

<title>Assumption II: That conflict is antithetical to CQ</title>
<p>As we have already touched upon, a further implicit CQ assumption we identify is that conflict-free communication is good communication. Several of the researchers who deal with the concept define cultural intelligence as the ability to effectively or successfully adapt to new cultural settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439872">Earley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439872">Earley and Ang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439872">Ng and Earley, 2006</xref>) or as a more effective tool for managing intercultural interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson 2004</xref>). Other scholars have praised the concept of cultural intelligence for offering the most effective tool so far to avoid misunderstandings in business contexts. From this perspective, successful adaptation means that those involved in the encounter will ‘experience no greater stress than they would experience in a similar interaction with a member of their own culture and in their own cultural context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 125; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812439872">Aycan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812439872">Brislin, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The assumption that conflict-free communication is good communication suggests that effective communication is about ensuring that messages are correctly received by the other party. Disturbances in this process are attributed to lack of understanding of other cultural systems. Yet, as others have pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812439872">Sperber and Wilson, 1986</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470595812439872">5</xref>
</sup> it is problematic to define effective communication as undisturbed transmission, since communication is a constitutive factor in the ongoing (re)production of social meaning and (re)creation of social realities. Consequently, all communication situations are susceptible to ‘failure’ since the relationship between what is said (a symbol or sign) and what is meant (its referent) is always imperfect and thus open to constantly reinterpretations (for a further discussion of the semiotic definition of signs see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812439872">Barthes, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439872">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439872">Peirce, 1931</xref>; Saussure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812439872">1983</xref>). The assumption that cultural differences per se constitute barriers to communication is underpinned by the perspective that communication is about <italic>transmission</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812439872">Craig, 1999</xref>), and fails to recognize that every encounter involves a (re)creation of shared experiences and is shaped by the specific context in which it occurs.</p>
<p>Shared social experiences are vital in order to create common social meaning. In a business situation, then, conflicts and misunderstandings are not necessarily a problem but a means of achieving understanding of the other’s goals. The function of conflicts and misunderstandings in such situations is to reveal or negotiate how symbols are interpreted, thereby offering the opportunity to develop shared goals. In that connection, the idea of CQ as a tool to generate conflict-free communication in business situations is also problematic in that it ignores the question of power relations. For instance, if conflicts do not occur, this may be because goals are guided by the more powerful part in the relationship, and are hence not open to interpretation. Business often takes place in contexts characterized by unequal power relations where each actor aims to prioritize their own agenda, optimize their outcome and minimize the effort and cost they have to invest to attain it. The ultimate aim of business negotiations is not to achieve empathy towards the other: rather, empathy may be used as a tool to gain strategic knowledge of the other or establish trust <italic>in order to</italic>maximize effectiveness.</p>
<p>This means that we need to ask what purpose cultural understanding, including conflict avoidance, actually serves in a global business environment, and in that connection what might motivate businesspeople to train their CQ. CQ literature offers few answers to these questions. One exception is Earley, who in most of his articles describes motivation from a social psychological perspective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439872">Earley and Ang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439872">Earley and Peterson, 2004</xref>) as closely linked to self-esteem and self-perceptions and their impact on interactions with others. However, Earley does not discuss motivation from a specifically business perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812439872">Templer et al. (2006</xref>) discuss motivational CQ as an essential and individual attribute that must be trained to spur high level of positive cultural adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812439872">Templer et al., 2006</xref>: 167). But they do not discuss how motivation develops and whether it is possible to train it. Ang et al. (2007) test the correlations between ‘motivational CQ’, cultural adaptation and task performance, but they take motivational CQ as a given, and do not discuss its development or preconditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>: 138) deliberately avoid this discussion in order to steer clear of: ‘unnecessary complication of a motivational facet of cultural intelligence’. We find it crucial to address the question of motivation, and will return to it shortly in our discussion.</p>

<sec id="section5-1470595812439872">
<title>Assumption III: That CQ involves a ‘cultural’ dimension</title>
<p>As outlined, the third assumption we address is the role played by culture in discussing whether CQ can be trained and learned. We take our point of departure for this discussion in the relationship between two key CQ concepts discussed by Thomas et al., namely the distinction between <italic>metacognition</italic>and <italic>cultural metacognition</italic>. Metacognition is in the leading CQ literature defined as knowledge of, and control over, one’s thinking and learning activities. It is this aspect of cultural intelligence that is furthest away from the notion of cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 131). In this literature, it is stressed that metacognitive thoughts are ‘deliberate, intentional, goal-directed and future-oriented mental behaviours that can be used to accomplish cognitive tasks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). If this is so, metacognition must then be understood as a context-driven process which leads individuals to relate to each other on the basis of intentional and/or goal-oriented strategies. In other words, it is not culturally defined norms and/or values that guide how individuals relate to each other, but cognitive processes that provide them with behavioural guidelines for how to engage in interpersonal relations.  </p>
<p>While other leading articles about CQ do not emphasize metacognition as the most important aspect of CQ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al. (2008</xref>) draw on the domain of social psychology in defining <italic>cultural metacognition</italic>as the active monitoring and regulation of mental processes. Cultural metacognition is, for these scholars, metacognition which takes place in a specific domain, namely the cultural domain (2008: 131). They define cultural metacognitive <italic>monitoring</italic> (their italics) as attention to conscious cognitive experiences, as well as to affective and personal-motivational states vis-à-vis a given cultural environment, which together determine a person’s course of action in an intercultural encounter. This definition of cultural metacognition positions culture outside the metacognitive sphere. Thus, culture is perceived as a static domain unto itself  – ‘a system of shared meanings enacted by a particular group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812439872">Schein, 1985</xref>). Thomas et al’s definition of cultural metacognitive <italic>regulations</italic> (their italics) further reinforces this notion of culture as an objective, bounded entity. They define these regulations as processes that people draw on to self-regulate and control cognitive activities and to ensure that a cognitive goal (e.g. effective handling of a cross-cultural situation) has been met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>While framed in a sophisticated manner, this approach is basically still descriptive/prescriptive along the lines of Hofstede’s (2001) cultural ‘dimensions’:  cultures are conceptualized as bounded entities and differences among them are regarded as real – ‘out there’. In our view, this perspective prompts an understanding of culture as constituting an objective non-contextual explanatory framework.</p>
<p>At the heart of this discussion lie two very different modes of perceiving culture: a primordial and a situational or constructionist mode. The first is based on the structural-functionalist tradition and the other on a post-modern tradition (for further discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470595812439872">Egholm Feldt, 2009</xref>). From a primordial perspective, culture is a set of real and shared rules, norms and values that goes beyond the individual and that is passed on from generation to generation. Cultures do change but their core remains the same. Culture is thus seen as a historically shaped, societal ‘glue’ that provides coherence among the various institutions in a society – in a similar way to how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470595812439872">Durkheim (1964</xref>) saw the role of religion in society.</p>
<p>Conversely, from a situational or constructivist perspective, culture is not seen as a fixed entity but as constructed with a specific purpose in mind and it is constantly in the making. From a post-modernist perspective, culture constitutes a mixture of horizontal as well as vertical historically constructed elements that individuals (re)organize for particular purposes. It is thus individuals, not institutions, that create their culture and history in order to defend a position in a given social, political, or economic context. Culture itself ‘does’ nothing. Seen from this perspective, the way culture is portrayed in much CQ literature as something that can be learned or studied in itself and thereafter used to steer a given cross-cultural encounter becomes highly problematic.</p>
<p>According to our understanding, cross-cultural encounters are based on generic metacognitive understandings of how to relate to unfamiliar experiences. Only in the event of derailed interpersonal relations will culture be drawn upon as a means of explaining difference. It is precisely in such situations that cultural stereotypes are created and mobilized. Perhaps, then, ‘cultural intelligence’ is not the right word for describing what goes on in a cross-cultural encounter. A more accurate term might be ‘metacognitive intelligence’, which describes how skilled a person is at critically monitoring and handling his or her own reactions towards unfamiliar experiences. In such a context culture can be conceived of as a strategic tool that can be deployed, if opportune.</p>
<p>To sum up thus far: in the first part of this article we identified three main assumptions that underpin the CQ concept, namely that CQ exists, that conflict is antithetical to CQ, and that CQ involves a ‘cultural’ dimension. Regarding the first assumption, we identified three implicit problems with the way the concept is defined that particularly affect its verification and, by extension, its measurement: first, that culture is normally understood to mean <italic>national</italic> culture; second that CQ’s antithesis, cultural <italic>un</italic>intelligence, is used as an implicit proxy for CQ; and third that conflict and misunderstanding are assumed to be a sign of failed communication. Based on these findings, the second assumption we explore is the notion that conflict is antithetical to CQ. Our take on this is that the <italic>goal</italic>of business negotiations is not to achieve empathy and understanding towards the other but to strategically employ relationships with, and knowledge of, the other in order to become more competent and resourceful in business. This raises questions about how we regard and define conflicts and misunderstandings in business relations, and about what might motivate businesspeople to train their CQ. The third assumption we address is that CQ involves a ‘cultural’ dimension. Our response to this was that cross-cultural encounters are based on generic metacognitive understandings of how to relate to unfamiliar experiences. Only in the case of derailed interpersonal relations will culture be drawn upon as an explanatory framework that depicts the other as different. As such, culture may be said to constitute a resource, not a sine qua non, in encounters perceived to be cross-cultural. In the following sections, we further elaborate on these observations with a view to disentangling the ‘Q’ from the ‘C’ in the CQ concept.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470595812439872">
<title>Metacognition and experience</title>
<p>Following our discussion of the underlying assumptions about culture in recent CQ literature, we now turn to our own view on the relationship between culture and metacognition. We begin with a brief discussion of the culture concept.</p>
<p>Culture is one of the most common ways of explaining and describing experiences of differences among diverse communities of people. Culture is defined through a demarcation and identification of who is inside and who is outside our community. Culture will therefore always change depending on the contexts in which this demarcation and definition take place. The absence of shared social experience among social actors has the potential to create conflicts and misunderstandings, but not necessarily so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470595812439872">Barth, 1969</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470595812439872">Brannen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812439872">Hastrup, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>From our perspective, a global business encounter is not a meeting between representatives of different cultures or communities trying to understand and adapt to each other’s different cultures, but an encounter between people who belong to many different communities with different shared social experiences, meanings and identities. A business encounter should therefore not require that people alter their own or others’ identities or sense of belonging: what matters is to establish one’s business goals as a common goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470595812439872">Heckscher and Adler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470595812439872">Lotz, 2009</xref>). If the involved parties lack shared experiences, any problems that may arise are likely to be related to the nature of the encounter as well as to how they construct difference and handle the resulting experience. </p>
<p>Relating this discussion to the use of cultural metacognitive skills as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al (2008</xref>), we agree that metacognition is involved every time we experience differences and unknown factors which we need to handle. Thus, the same cognitive structure is applied whether we are dealing with unfamiliar ways to regulate traffic chaos, or trying to understand why people behave as they do in different contexts. In all such situations, the goal is ‘to find out, from the consideration of what we already know, something else which we do not know’ (Peirce, 1932: 5.365).</p>
<p>To further existing conceptualizations of how people handle differences and unfamiliar experiences in today’s global encounters, we find it fruitful to expand the social psychological definition of metacognition with the pragmatic and semiotic concept of metacognition as described by Charles Sanders Peirce, which has been much used in the field of learning more broadly (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439872">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). The metacognitive concept used within the CQ literature relies on Flavell´s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470595812439872">1979</xref>) theories and is closely linked to Piaget´s cognitive psychology which focuses on context-independent phases of human cognition. The pragmatic and semiotic concept of metacognition does, as will be described, involve both the individual and its context.  </p>
<p>Metacognition is the ability to understand and acquire new knowledge based on what we already know. To obtain new knowledge we must be able to accept that our assumptions may be inaccurate and to recognize abnormalities so that we can challenge and adapt our existing beliefs. From Peirce’s perspective, our beliefs are not necessarily true: it is enough that we think they are true and act accordingly. Beliefs must be seen as habits of mind and, as such, they constitute the basic state of cognition from where the world makes sense to us. Doubts only arise when our beliefs are challenged to such an extent that they no longer help us to make sense of a specific context or situation. New knowledge typically arises from experience because our existing knowledge is insufficient to understand what we observe and thus motivates changes in the way we apprehend events.</p>
<p>Peirce has described different strategies which people deploy to handle challenges to their beliefs/frame of references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470595812439872">Cunningham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812439872">Peirce, 1877</xref>).The simplest strategy is to hold onto our beliefs even though new experiences challenge them. In a business situation, this might involve e.g. an unfamiliar approach to working hours that we do not understand and do not want to accept, so we stick to existing beliefs about the right way to organize working hours. Peirce also refers to authoritative, a priori and abductive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812439872">Peirce 1877</xref>). The first (authority) resolves doubts by seeking advice from others with credible authority. So, to take the working hours example, the challenge to existing beliefs might be met by ascertaining how the firm’s headquarters decides working hours norms. The second strategy (a priori) handles challenges arising from new unknown situations by integrating the new experience with our previous knowledge, thereby establishing coherence between our current frames of references and the new information. When confronted with new situations, we generally try to produce an explanation in which the new situation can also make sense based on our current scheme<italic>/</italic>frame of reference. Taking the example of working hours, we might try to integrate the new approach with our existing beliefs about working hours by modifying the latter. Only when this fails will we be encouraged to develop the third strategy (abduction), where we build up new basic structures, and thus change our beliefs. This is exactly what needs to happen if we are not convinced by a credible authority or we cannot use our existing knowledge to make sense of the new situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439872">Peirce, 1931</xref>). In such situations, we remove doubts by generating abductive hypotheses based on qualified guesses to explain the new situation. In other words, we use our metacognition. Qualified guesses are based on abstractions from already experienced situations which are then reconnected in new ways.  </p>
<p>Peircés discussion of cognition leads to a focus on past, present and future experiences as the basis for our beliefs but also for the change and transformation of them. Metacognition describes the capacity to make sense of the unknown using past experiences. We find it very useful to expand Thomas et al.’s social psychological definition of metacognition with the semiotic concept of metacognition formulated by Peirce. Peirce’s views also enable a refinement of Ng and Earleýs (2006) definition of cognition which recommends that people should <italic>refrain</italic> from using prior experience in trying to make sense of the unknown. The Peircian perspective dismantles the idea that people are able to discard their existing experiences, and instead proposes that experiences are used consciously in dealing with challenges to our beliefs or with the unfamiliar – this is metacognition in practice.</p>
<p>To sum up, the argument shows how experiences of difference, and especially of the unfamiliar and even unintelligible, are both a precondition and motivation for developing metacognition. Challenges to existing beliefs do not, of course, always result in changes in basic belief structures – they can serve to strengthen existing beliefs –including prejudices – or to integrate new experiences with what is already known. <italic>This raises the important question of whether certain types of experience are more likely to lead to the development of metacognition than others.</italic> And is it enough to expose business people to specific kinds of experiences or do we also have to consider other drivers to facilitate the challenge to current beliefs that foster the creation of metacognition? It is paradoxical that although metacognition is created and reinforced by new experiences, thereby altering existing frames of reference, CQ is described as a tool that can help to <italic>avoid</italic>misunderstandings and conflicts in cross-cultural business encounters. We therefore need to question the definition of success and effectiveness in business situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439872">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>: 526–30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), and to ask whether we can identify CQ empirically if we rely exclusively on observations of misunderstandings and conflict situations. We will address these questions.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470595812439872">
<title>CQ in practice: the example of CQ training programmes</title>
<p>The discussion so far raises the question of whether the CQ concept can be adapted to the needs of business and if so how? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas (2006</xref>: 93) points out, the concept’s ‘relationship to real-world business problems must be evaluated’. In this section, we address the implications of the outlined assumptions for a key area in which the concept is currently applied in business:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470595812439872">5</xref>
</sup> cultural training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>), and we offer some alternative suggestions. Our analysis raises several immediate issues for training programmes, which have to do with the type of characteristics/abilities that should be assessed and developed in potential and existing employees; and how best to approach this. We argue, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas (2006</xref>: 89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439872">Thomas and Inkson, 2004</xref>: 68), that these abilities cannot be acquired within ‘short time frames’ or through quick-fix interventions such as cultural crash courses designed to teach participants to navigate around potential cultural conflicts; rather, they are ‘learned over time through intercultural interactions’ and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>However, we differ from Thomas in our understanding of the relationship between cultural knowledge, (cultural) metacognition, experience and the behavioural dimensions of CQ. We propose that the CQ concept should be adapted to the particular purpose for which it is applied, and in particular that careful thought should be given to the role played by experience. We further raise the epistemological question of whether the kind of abilities associated with CQ are at all amenable to the kind of performance-based measurement instruments that e.g. recruitment and training programmes often employ.</p>
<p>To take an example: if we follow Thomas et al. (2006: 89) that the way people handle experience is a key dimension of metacognitive intelligence, this will also have consequences for the type of tasks that different employees should be assigned within a firm. We should stress here that we do not believe experience alone to be a good predictor of metacognitive intelligence, however. As mentioned in our discussion of Peirce’s metacognition, experiences may be used variously to confirm existing beliefs (including ‘negative’ ones such as prejudice), acquire new beliefs (new prejudices?), or alternatively to question our existing beliefs or even our entire frame of reference, i.e. the broad assumptions which shape our expectations, feelings, emotions and perceptions, and which we use to frame our experiences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439872">Mezirow, 1997</xref>: 5–6). Experiences, then, are not a good indicator of any particular capacity in themselves, what matters is the meanings that people attribute to them. Any effort to train based on the notion of metacognitive intelligence will therefore have to find a way to understand and work with the way that people interpret and use their experiences in situations perceived as intercultural. A focus on experience thus rests on the epistemological assumption that ‘real subjects’ exist who attribute meaning to their life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470595812439872">Denzin, 1989</xref>: 14), and that those attributions are shaped by their metacognitive ability and activities.</p>
<p>If we accept that experience alone is not enough, we also need to ask what motivates people to ascribe positive meanings to unknown and unfamiliar experiences which challenge their current frame of reference. The way we make sense of experiences has to do with how people constantly reshape their identity positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812439872">Weick, 1995</xref>: 20). Identity positions are both embedded in social role expectation and internalized in processes of cognitive identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470595812439872">Stryker and Burke, 2000</xref>).  Identity positions are, thus, always established in relation to the positions that are acceptable within a given social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812439872">Weick, 1995</xref>: 13). While metacognition arises from misunderstandings and conflicts, the motivation to learn from this can only arise in social contexts which accept and maintain identity positions where conflicts are not conceptualized as failures to be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470595812439872">Ames and Archer, 1988</xref>: 260).</p>
<p> Research has shown that motivations for learning vary significantly depending on the context and goal: they can, for instance, be ‘instrumental’ (motivated by the wish to manipulate the environment or improve performance); ‘impressionistic’ (aimed at shaping others’ impressions of us); ‘normative’ (so that others in a group are entitled to expect certain behaviours from us); or ‘communicative’ (where the aim of learning is to arrive at shared meanings and understandings of one another’s beliefs and values) (Habermas, 1981, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439872">Mezirow, 1997</xref>: 6). As we have pointed out, much intercultural business communication literature takes scant account of the <italic>business context</italic> for communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812439872">Varner, 2000</xref>), often assuming that the goal of cultural learning is to reach an understanding of the other at the <italic>communicative</italic>level, i.e. his or her presumed cultural beliefs and attitudes. In actual fact, in business encounters the goal and motivation for learning are arguably mainly <italic>instrumental</italic>. As Lovitt (1999 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812439872">Varner, 2000</xref>: 45) puts it: ‘the study of culture is not an end in itself but should take place in the business context’. Businesspeople arguably do not need the same kind of cultural insights as anthropologists. In business situations, the motivation to create metacognition and thus transform your identity position is often guided by instrumental motivation, i.e. how best to manipulate the environment to reach one’s goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas (2006</xref>: 84) also touches briefly on the issue of instrumentalism when he discusses the possibility that people with a high degree of CQ (sic) may be motivated to use their capabilities for ‘less than noble purposes’, but does not elaborate on what these may be.</p>
<p>For training purposes, if we accept that metacognitive intelligence has to do with the ways in which people perceive – and hence handle – difference, based on their experiences, then training must focus on ways to shape those perceptions. A key aspect when training businesspeople is that the subjects of learning are <italic>adults</italic> whose basic frames of reference are already established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812439872">Jarvis, 2005</xref>). In order that learning may occur, we consider it essential to understand what motivates people to alter their established frames of reference in relation to difference. Here, other identity markers such as age, gender, education and class are likely to play at least as significant a role as any national cultural identifications. Where we differ from Thomas et al. is that we regard learning not as the ‘cultural intelligence’ to avoid misunderstandings or conflicts or to produce the ‘appropriate behaviour from a well developed repertoire of behaviours that are correct for different intercultural situations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439872">Thomas, 2006</xref>: 88), but as people’s ability to be critical towards the basic worldviews and frames of reference that they have acquired through their prior experiences, so that they become aware of and reflexive about their own and others’ cultural assumptions and of the ways in which these may colour their judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439872">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). This will strengthen their capacity to refrain from a priori attributing essential or negative cultural characteristics to their interlocutors; to see misunderstanding or conflict as learning moments rather than failures or communication breakdowns; and to ‘recognise their own self-reference criteria’ so that they can revise their views according to new evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812439872">Varner, 2000</xref>: 46). Learning in this sense involves ‘exploring our own assumptions and constructions of reality’ (McWhinney and Markos, 2003: 19), not learning to monitor our thoughts with a view to producing ‘correct’ behaviours and adapt accordingly (Ang et al., 2007).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470595812439872">6</xref>
</sup> We therefore do not consider ‘culture-general knowledge’ or ‘cultural metacognition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439872">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>: 129) to be viable notions.</p>
<p>Thus, while a person’s motivation for communicating in a business encounter may be instrumentally motivated, this nonetheless requires the metacognitive capacity to scrutinize deeply embedded frames of reference. This is arguably a major challenge to learning. In motivation research, this type of task-related orientation is known as <italic>performance-oriented</italic> motivation, where the successful completion of a task is the main motivating factor; compared to <italic>mastery-oriented</italic> motivation where the learning process and the acquisition of new skills are the main motivating factors in themselves. People’s motivation for learning has, inter alia, been found to affect both their disposition to learn and the learning strategies that they adopt. Mastery-oriented motivation is generally associated with a lower risk of failure since normative outcomes and the risk of failure are downplayed, while priority is given to the learning process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470595812439872">Ames and Archer, 1988</xref>: 260).</p>

<title>Suggestions for further research</title>
<p>A focus on experience will also shape choices about what aspects to prioritize in training. Our discussion suggests that crucial factors in this regard include choosing employees for training who are willing to reflect self-critically on their experiences, and perhaps to refashion their interpretations of these, including the very way they have identified and classified their experiences as ‘cultural/intercultural’ or otherwise; as well as the way that they define, and the meanings that they attach to, particular situations, especially conflicts. Trainees must also be willing to question their taken-for-granted cultural beliefs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439872">Earley, 1987</xref>), scrutinize their own cultural identifications and learn to see them as relative. Since experiences are organized and attributed meaning in relation to identity, these processes will necessarily involve work with identity to some degree or another, and such a training programme therefore presupposes a willingness on the part of employees to engage in an extended, transformative learning process. Whether such a commitment is practicable or possible in the context of international business activities is thus also a question for further research. Finally, any tools used to measure the effectiveness of training must take into account that learning may not manifest itself in changed behaviour immediately or even particularly tangibly, that ‘appropriate behaviour’ is not necessarily equivalent to conflict avoidance but rather involves the capacity to reflect critically on one’s own behaviour; and that possibly the only real gauge, however tenuous, of how effective the training has been is the feedback from the employee him/herself.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article urges caution be exercised in deploying the concept of CQ both in practical and academic contexts. We illustrate this by examining three assumptions that underpin the concept. We recommend refining the concept using the pragmatic and semiotic definition of metacognition, which offers a stronger focus on the role of experience in learning processes. Second, we argue that the role of motivation in cultural learning processes is crucial, and that it varies according to the context in which learning occurs. In particular we draw attention to the paradox that, in business situations, the motivation for learning is often performance-oriented, whereas what is required in cultural learning processes is a more transformative, mastery-oriented process. In other words, performance-oriented activities are not necessarily conducive to the development of metacognitive intelligence. Based on these two observations and the assumptions which underpin the CQ concept, we propose that the notion of CQ must be more carefully adapted to the different situations in which it is to be applied.</p>
<p>The first assumption is that CQ exists at all. We conclude that CQ has so far been only scantily tested empirically in terms of cultural <italic>un</italic>intelligence, making it at best useful as a hypothesis. As it currently stands, the culturally intelligent person remains overridingly an ideal or mythical figure, constructed in response to the perceived needs of international business.</p>
<p>The second assumption is that misunderstandings and conflict are antithetical to CQ. Here, we show that metacognitive intelligence is developed precisely through exposure to differences, misunderstandings and conflicts, and that therefore these should be seen as learning moments, and not as barriers to successful interaction.</p>
<p>The third assumption is that CQ involves a cultural dimension. Although CQ scholars normally claim that CQ is a culture-general notion, we show that the <italic>knowledge</italic> dimension of CQ bears a close resemblance to prescriptive notions of culture. If, as we propose, culture should be understood as produced in social interaction, then it is experiences and how they are interpreted – and not knowledge – that become the crucial factor in CQ.</p>
<p>Finally, while we find the assumptions that underpin the CQ concept problematic, our intention in this article is not to argue that it serves no purpose. Rather, we urge that CQ should be treated as a hypothesis, rather than as a well-proven construct. This has implications for the nature of future work on CQ. Rather than devoting energy to constructing ways to measure and train something that we do not yet know for sure exists, we would be better advised to concentrate our efforts on documenting empirical examples and devising methodologies that can help us to test, amend or refine the concept.</p>
<p>The CQ case highlights a broader issue in current research on professional and vocational skills training, namely that, even though certain abilities may be seen as crucial for business success at different points in history, scholars must nonetheless remain cautious about assuming that people can be trained to acquire them. At the very least, we should remind ourselves from time to time that, just because business may one day demand that we grow our own wings and fly, that doesn’t mean we will be able to.</p>

<p>‘Cultural literacy’ refers to a body of information that has proven of lasting use to a culture (again normally implicitly national culture) (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812439872">Hirsch et al. 2002</xref>). ‘Global mindset’ has to do with the ‘cognitive capabilities of senior managers in multinational companies’, including moving away from an ethnocentric mindset and towards a geocentric or world-oriented one. Skills and traits associated with a global mindset include adaptability, openness and a cosmopolitan willingness to engage with the other, as well as cognitive complexity, i.e. the ability to see and interpret things from different perspectives (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812439872">Levy et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
