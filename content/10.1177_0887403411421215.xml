<abstract>
<p>Scholarly interest in self-protective behaviors is demonstrated in studies examining victimization; these behaviors are presumed to reduce the likelihood of experiencing crime. Protective behaviors are not taken by all citizens equally, however, so it is critical to explain these behaviors within the population. The current study extends existing works, most of which were based on urban samples, by examining the determinants of protective behaviors in a sample of rural residents in the United States. Predictors are derived from a modified risk interpretation model (Ferraro, 1995) and include risk, fear, victimization experiences, and perceived collective efficacy. Results show that household protective behaviors are influenced by perceptions of risk and, indirectly through risk, by perceived collective efficacy and victimization experiences.</p>

<p>Individuals concerned about their risk of property and violent victimization can engage in a variety of behaviors designed to decrease that risk. To reduce their risk of property victimization, individuals can install additional locks on doors and windows, keep a gun and/or guard dog in the home, engrave identification numbers on property, and improve outside lighting. Those concerned about personal victimization can take a self-defense class, avoid certain unsafe areas, or carry a weapon. These behaviors, commonly referred to as <italic>self-protective measures</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887403411421215">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0887403411421215">Ziegenhagen &amp; Brosnan, 1990</xref>) or <italic>constrained behavior</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403411421215">Mesch, 2000</xref>), have been the subject of a significant volume of literature. Whereas some have used self-protective measures as an independent variable to explain variation in victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887403411421215">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1998</xref>), others have viewed these behaviors as warranting their own explanation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study considers self-protective behavior as a dependent variable. The available evidence suggests that self-protective or constrained behavior participation varies based on a number of personal, experiential, and environmental factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>). For example, scholars have found that self-protective behavior is more likely among the fearful or those who perceive a higher risk of crime in their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates &amp; Rohe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; DeHart, 2007</xref>), the victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411421215">Adams, Rohe, &amp; Arcury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>), and those who find alternative social control mechanisms (e.g., the police) deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411421215">Kleck &amp; Kovandzic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403411421215">McDowall &amp; Loftin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403411421215">Young, McDowall, &amp; Loftin, 1987</xref>). Even though this research is extensive, gaps in the literature exist. First, researchers typically employ analysis techniques that prevent testing more complex relationships between variables or assessing indirect effects (e.g., influence of predictors through the risk variable). Second, the research suffers from an urban focus. Most of what is known about self-protective behaviors is the result of studies conducted in one or more big-city areas. Even in rare cases where small town and rural areas are the focus, or comparisons are made between urban and nonurban areas, the modeling issue noted above remains (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte &amp; Bordua, 1980</xref>). Consequently, relatively little is known about the predictors of self-protective behavior in small town or rural communities. The present study is designed to contribute to the literature by testing a modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro’s (1995)</xref> risk interpretation model using a rural sample. The model assesses the importance of fear/risk, victimization experiences, and perceived collective efficacy (neighborhood social control) in explaining household protective behavior.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro (1995)</xref> advocated a risk interpretation approach to understanding the relationship between fear, perceived risk, and self-protective behavior. The central argument is that individuals perceive or interpret their environments (including community characteristics) through their own personal experiences (influenced by demographic and experiential factors). Perceived risk of victimization is the linchpin connecting fear of crime, individual and community-level characteristics, and self-protective behavior. With respect to crime, this means that the risk of victimization is assessed and individuals react accordingly by altering their levels of fear and constraining behavior/taking self-protective measures. The model suggests that self-protective behavior is predicted by perceived risk of victimization, individual characteristics, and community/neighborhood characteristics. The effects of key variables derived from these categories are briefly reviewed below.</p>
<sec id="section2-0887403411421215">
<title>Fear of Crime/Perceived Risk</title>
<p>The central feature of the risk interpretation model is perceived risk of victimization, a variable often included in studies of self-protective behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). Heightened risk of crime is believed to produce a variety of outcomes, including constrained behavior (behavioral reactions) and fear of crime (emotional reactions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411421215">Ferraro &amp; LaGrange, 1987</xref>). Stated differently, “People may constrain their actions or adopt defense actions [self-protective measures] to deal with perceived high risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>, p. 19) or they may experience “a negative emotional reaction to crime or the symbols associated with crime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411421215">Ferraro &amp; LaGrange, 1987</xref>, p. 72). Interestingly, the model views fear as an outcome rather than a cause of self-protective behavior; people are more fearful when they engage in constrained behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). Whereas this approach has been adopted by some (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403411421215">Scheider, Rowell, &amp; Bezdikian, 2003</xref>), the vast majority of the research examining self-protective behavior includes fear of crime as a predictor in addition to or in lieu of risk. Scholars use fear as an independent variable because self-protective behavior offers individuals an opportunity to “diminish their feelings of fear [so that they] can then go about day-to-day lives relatively free of the burden the constant specter of [victimization] instills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; DeHart, 2007</xref>, pp. 7-8). Regardless of whether risk or fear is the predictor, the results are generally consistent, thereby suggesting a need to measure both in models of self-protective behavior.</p>
<p>Several studies have taken this approach, measuring both risk and fear simultaneously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates and Rohe (1987)</xref> found that survey respondents were more likely to avoid dangerous areas and take a variety of personal and household protective measures when their level of fear was high and where crime rates were high (an objective measure of risk; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn and Kennedy (1985)</xref> determined that risk, as measured by crime rates, influenced self-protective behavior indirectly through fear of crime. This finding only partially supports the risk interpretation model; risk influences fear but, contrary to the model’s prediction, fear explains self-protective behavior. Even when risk is measured subjectively via questions related to the likelihood of victimization, risk is still predictive of such self-protective behaviors as keeping guns in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403411421215">Luxenburg, Cullen, Langworthy, &amp; Kopache, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>), adding security bars to windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403411421215">Reid, Roberts, &amp; Hilliard, 1998</xref>), avoiding certain areas or routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>), or contemplating relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403411421215">Reid et al., 1998</xref>). Others examined the salience of fear exclusively, omitting risk measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403411421215">Warr and Ellison (2000)</xref>, for example, found that fear, measured as worrying about safety, predicted a variety of behaviors. Results from other studies similarly suggest that fear predicts self-protective behavior rather than the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; DeHart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403411421215">Reid et al., 1998</xref>; for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403411421215">Scheider et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Victimization</title>
<p>Like fear, prior victimization is often included as a predictor in studies of protective behavior. Unlike fear, however, the results are equivocal. The inclusion of victimization experiences as a possible explanation for protective actions is based on the belief that victims respond to crime by taking actions to prevent subsequent victimization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411421215">DuBow, McCabe, and Kaplan (1979)</xref>, reviewing the state of the literature over 30 years ago, noted that the relationship between victimization and protective measures was consistent. Studies published since then have generated more ambiguous results.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope and Lab (2001)</xref> examined participation in five domains of protective activities using data from the British Crime Survey. The domains included neighborhood watch, technological security (e.g., surveillance systems or alarms), fortress security (e.g., door and window locks), evening precautions (e.g., staying home at night), and self-defense (e.g., weapon or personal alarm carrying). While victimization predicted participation in these activities, the type of victimization was important. Prior robbery experiences were linked to domains intended to prevent personal victimization (evening precautions and self-defense), whereas prior burglary experiences predicted participation in domains intended to reduce the likelihood of property/household victimization (neighborhood watch, technological security, and fortress security). Similar results were found elsewhere; prior victimization influences a range of household, avoidance, and/or personal protective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411421215">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, other research has shown that prior victimization exerts no direct effect on protective measures. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao, Cullen, and Link (1997)</xref> determined that protective gun ownership (as opposed to ownership for sport) was related to both crime control attitudes and childhood socialization (e.g., exposure to and learning about firearms as a child); victimization had little effect. The limited explanatory power of direct victimization was also evident in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403411421215">Luxenburg et al.’s (1994)</xref> study of Edmund, Oklahoma residents. Prior-year victimization did not predict firearm or dog ownership for protective purposes. Even when the range of protective measures is expanded beyond firearms and dog ownership to include a more diverse array of behaviors (e.g., locking doors, participating in neighborhood watch, installing alarms, avoidance measures), some find that victimization is only weakly related to these behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0887403411421215">
<title>Self-Help and Collective Security</title>
<p>Protective behavior has also been viewed as a response to the failure of both formal and informal social controls. Two related arguments—the collective security and self-help hypotheses—have been proposed to explain this relationship. These hypotheses predict similar relationships between social control and various personal protection measures. Regardless of the name ascribed to the hypothesis, the evidence to support these relationships is generally strong.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403411421215">McDowall and Loftin (1983)</xref> argue that the primary responsibility for crime prevention and control in industrial society rests with governments rather than with individuals. The problem emerges when collective security is inadequately administered at the government level. As the authors write, “When the efforts of these governments are successful, people perceive crime as under control and offenders as receiving just punishment . . . However, when the ability of collective forces to provide security is in doubt, self-interest demands immediate self-protection” (p. 1148). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith and Uchida (1988)</xref> suggest that in circumstances where other forms of social control are weak, such as when governments are unable to provide collective security, individuals must take their own actions to compensate for these real or perceived gaps—they must help themselves by engaging in protective behaviors.</p>
<p>The collective security or self-help hypothesis is often tested by including measures that indicate the level of formal social control in an area such as the size of the local police force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411421215">Kleck &amp; Kovandzic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403411421215">McDowall &amp; Loftin, 1983</xref>), the quality of the agencies of the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte &amp; Bordua, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403411421215">Young et al., 1987</xref>), or neighborhood conditions such as actual or perceived crime rates or perceived disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte &amp; Bordua, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403411421215">McDowall &amp; Loftin, 1983</xref>). Although some studies question the relationship between formal social control mechanisms and protective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0887403411421215">Ziegenhagen &amp; Brosnan, 1990</xref>), others find compelling evidence in support of these hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411421215">Kleck &amp; Kovandzic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403411421215">McDowall &amp; Loftin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403411421215">Young et al., 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The collective security/self-help hypotheses have been extended beyond formal social control mechanisms to informal neighborhood-level social controls as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates &amp; Rohe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>). Evidence suggests that protective measures are less common when neighborhoods are stronger, measured by such diverse indicators as the commitment to the neighborhood, the willingness of neighbors to help each other, and the likelihood of neighbors rendering assistance in the event of a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates &amp; Rohe, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson and Mindel (2007)</xref> also found that collective efficacy, measured as participation in neighborhood watch and attending community meetings in the neighborhood, was a significant predictor of household and personal protective measures. Although this finding supports earlier work, the measure of collective efficacy is inconsistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403411421215">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997)</xref>. More specifically, collective efficacy is indicated by activities commonly considered protective behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403411421215">Scheider et al., 2003</xref>) leading to the problem of both the independent and dependent variables measuring the same concept.</p>

<sec id="section5-0887403411421215">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>The review above suggests an important place for risk of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). The literature is largely consistent, demonstrating that an individual’s risk leads to behavioral reactions, specifically self-protective behaviors. Moreover, these reactions are influenced by factors such as victimization experiences and perceptions of alternative social control mechanisms. Although the literature greatly contributes to the knowledge base on determinants of protective measures, two important limitations remain. First, researchers have been guilty of an urban focus, neglecting to examine self-protective behavior in small towns or rural communities. One reason for the neglect of nonurban residents in this line of inquiry is the assumption that protective behaviors and the predictors of those behaviors are invariant, operating in the same fashion regardless of locale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>). The second limitation relates to the analytical techniques employed in previous studies. If the risk interpretation model posits a central role for perceived risk of crime, many of the commonly studied predictors of self-protective behavior will not only influence such behavior directly but also work indirectly through the risk variable. Ambiguity in findings could be the result of model specification issues and the limitations imposed by simple ordinary least squares and logistic regression modeling. Both of these issues are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p>Much of the work examining self-protective behavior is based on study samples derived from large cities such as Cincinnati (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>), Baton Rouge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; DeHart, 2007</xref>), Omaha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403411421215">Marshall, 1991</xref>), Detroit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403411421215">Young et al., 1987</xref>), Dallas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>), Atlanta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates &amp; Rohe, 1987</xref>), or multiple large cities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403411421215">Mesch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403411421215">Scheider et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>). Even when larger statewide or national surveys are used, seldom are indicators included that would allow for an examination of a rural or small/town subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411421215">Kleck &amp; Kovandzic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403411421215">Warr &amp; Ellison, 2000</xref>; for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope &amp; Lab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte &amp; Bordua, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403411421215">Whitehead &amp; Langworthy, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The urban focus precludes assessment of the risk interpretation model’s scope as it relates to protective measures. One method available for examining this is to “determine how well a theory performs across different settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887403411421215">Reisig &amp; Cancino, 2004</xref>, p. 18). In the present study, the risk interpretation model is applied to a sample of rural county residents; if the theory’s scope is to be widened beyond urban environments, it is important to determine whether key predictors of protective measures/constrained behavior, specifically collective security, prior victimization, fear of crime, and perceived risk, are relevant in a nonmetropolitan setting. Moreover, even if rural and urban residents differ in magnitude on certain measures (e.g., urban residents are more fearful than rural resident; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403411421215">Baumer, 1985</xref>), the factors that predict protective measures may be equally applicable to residents of urban and rural areas as neither is a homogenous group (for a discussion of variation among rural residents, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403411421215">Hunter &amp; Krannich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403411421215">Krannich, Berry, &amp; Greider, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403411421215">Pain, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403411421215">Osgood and Chambers (2000)</xref>, for example, argue that the community social control mechanisms “are as relevant to crime and delinquency in small towns and rural communities as in urban neighborhoods” (p. 85). This line of reasoning suggests invariance; the same factors that emerge in urban sample studies of protective behaviors should prove salient regardless of the sample (for exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>; they noted that predictors of some protective measures varied depending on location or residence).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the same predictors of protective behavior may not be salient in rural contexts due to inherent urban–rural differences. For example, informal social controls (related to the concept of collective efficacy) may be stronger in rural communities compared with urban centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403411421215">Gardner &amp; Shoemaker, 1989</xref>). This would lead to speculation that rural residents would be less likely to take protective measures than their urban counterparts. Although perhaps true, this enhanced informal social control may be negated by the geographic isolation of many rural communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>). That is, although informal controls are considered strong, neighbors are often more distant and police response times may be slower. Consequently, collective efficacy may not have the same effect on protective behavior in rural contexts. Other common predictions such as fear, perceived risk, and victimization may also operate differently in nonurban environments. Whether fear and perceived risk, prior victimization, and collective security/self-help operate in the same fashion in rural communities are empirical questions and the focus of the present study. These factors may prove to be insignificant and unmeasured factors such as the rural culture of independence, the widespread availability of firearms, and a greater mistrust in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Wells, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403411421215">Weisheit, Wells, &amp; Falcone, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the number of rural/small-town studies pales in comparison with those focusing on urban areas. Existing studies of nonurban protective behaviors also tend to focus on singular types of protective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte &amp; Bordua, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403411421215">Whitehead &amp; Langworthy, 1989</xref>), use single city or regional samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411421215">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887403411421215">Menard &amp; Covey, 1987</xref>), or neglect to model both direct and indirect effects of explanatory variables (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403411421215">Whitehead &amp; Langworthy, 1989</xref>; see below for further discussion of this issue). The present study is designed to address this gap in the literature by testing the risk interpretation model in a rural sample.</p>
<p>The second problem relates to model specification. Most studies of protective behaviors are based on analyses employing linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411421215">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope &amp; Lab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403411421215">Luxenburg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403411421215">Whitehead &amp; Langworthy, 1989</xref>) or logistic regression modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411421215">Cao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411421215">Kleck &amp; Kovandzic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; DeHart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403411421215">Smith &amp; Uchida, 1988</xref>). As such, the models generally capture direct effects only, failing to account for indirect effects. This is potentially problematic, given the risk interpretation model. Risk, it is hypothesized, is interpreted based on a variety of cues through an individual’s own experiences. These include factors such as victimization experiences and weakened social control systems, both of which may heighten one’s perceived risk as well as demographic characteristics that influence how these cues are interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). When analyses examine direct effects of many predictors on only a single dependent variable, they fail to capture how these cues influence self-protective behavior indirectly through perceived risk of crime. Thus, to adequately test the model, it is critical to examine how factors such as victimization and perceived collective efficacy influence protective behavior indirectly by altering perceptions of risk.</p>
<p>Research studies addressing this problem exist but are relatively small in number (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411421215">Gates &amp; Rohe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403411421215">Lizotte and Bordua (1980)</xref>, for example, used path modeling to measure both the direct effects of a variety of demographic characteristics on home protection measures as well as the indirect effects through fear and risk. In contrast to the risk interpretation model, fear predicted self-protective behavior. In addition, perceptions of crime (arguably a measure of risk) were predictive of fear of crime. As noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411421215">Krahn and Kennedy (1985)</xref> found that an objective measure of risk influenced self-protective behavior indirectly through fear of crime. The failure to capture indirect effects might also be responsible for mixed findings in the literature. In the case of victimization, direct effects might be limited in some cases. If self-protective behavior variables are significantly, albeit in some cases weakly, affected by victimization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403411421215">Garofalo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887403411421215">Liska, Sanchirico, &amp; Reed, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887403411421215">Skogan &amp; Maxfield, 1981</xref>), then victimization might operate through the intervening variable risk rather than directly on protective behavior.</p>
<p>The present study aims to contribute to the self-protective measure literature by addressing these two issues. The study examines participation in a variety of household protective behaviors (e.g., installing an alarm system, installing extra locks) in nationwide sample of residents from rural counties. Two dimensions of self-protective behavior are identified (protection-specific and multipurpose measures) and represent the dependent measures in the analyses presented below. Path modeling is used to test a model derived in part from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro’s (1995)</xref> risk interpretation model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403411421215">Figure 1</xref> for expected relationships; each endogenous variable also controls for age, race, sex, and household income; exogenous variables are correlated with the control variables. The relationships have been omitted from the path model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403411421215">Figure 1</xref> for ease of presentation). Unlike Ferraro’s model, however, fear will be examined as a predictor of self-protective behavior rather than product of it. The results of the study will help overcome the urban-centric focus of prior studies and allow for more complete modeling of the interaction among predictor variables on protective behaviors.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The data for this study come from a 2009 phone survey that was conducted to gather information on U.S. rural residents’ perceptions about crime and disorderly behavior, community social processes, risk factors, and protective measures used to assuage concerns about local crime problems. The data collection strategy relied on a multistage random sampling procedure that targeted respondents who lived in rural counties across the country, and the surveys were completed by members of the Survey Research Center at the University of Illinois-Springfield. Rural counties have been operationalized in a number of different ways and each, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411421215">Lee (2008)</xref> notes, suffers from limitations. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for each county in the United States (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>). This classification scheme includes metropolitan counties based on population size and nonmetropolitan counties based on both population size and adjacency to metropolitan areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403411421215">Ghelfi &amp; Parker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403411421215">Hart, Larson, &amp; Lishner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887403411421215">U.S. Department of Agriculture, n.d.</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; Slack, 2008</xref> for an example of classification scheme employed in criminal justice research). The problem, however, is that there are more than 30 counties classified as nonmetropolitan with more than 100,000 residents (in one case, more than 182,000 residents). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411421215">Lee (2008)</xref> writes, “This definition seems to violate the spirit of rurality” (p. 458). Other examples of rural/nonmetropolitan include the U.S. Census Bureau’s classification as rural of those places with fewer than 2,500 residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403411421215">Osgood and Chambers’s (2000)</xref> definition involving counties not included in metropolitan statistical areas. These varied definitions illustrate that “there is no single simple definition that captures the essence of rural, is quantifiable, and is applicable to a variety of rural settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403411421215">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>, p. 311).</p>
<p>The present study identified rural counties using a method consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411421215">Lee’s (2008)</xref> criteria. Counties were defined as rural if they had between 1,500 and 24,999 residents. Extremely low populated counties were excluded (less than 1,500 people) because prior research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403411421215">Wilkinson (1991)</xref> indicated that residents in these geographic areas do not have consistent access to many context-based resources that are necessary for sustaining strong networks of social interaction. The extremely small size “forces the residents to rely on nearby communities for many basic needs and services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411421215">Lee, 2008</xref>, p. 458). Consequently, in these extremely small communities, it would be difficult to measure concepts that were part of the overall project (e.g., local government variables, presence of manufacturing).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403411421215">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A county population of under 25,000 people was the threshold since the focus of this study was on perceptions of rural crime patterns (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403411421215">Lee, 2008</xref>, p. 458; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403411421215">Lee &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403411421215">Lee and Thomas (2010)</xref> note, “We make no specific claim that an upper population boundary of 25,000 is absolutely optimal, it seems reasonable for our purposes, and we acknowledge that a different sample selection criterion might be equally useful” (p. 139). As there is no standard definition of rural and as the project drew a number of measures from Lee’s work, the 25,000 threshold is used here but the same cautions are acknowledged. With these estimated sampling parameters, 36 counties were randomly selected after being stratified by the U.S. census geographic regions: Northeast (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Midwest (<italic>n</italic> = 12), South (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and West (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Ultimately, between 25 and 45 respondents for each county were targeted for completion using a random-digit dialing sampling method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0887403411421215">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final sample of completed surveys was <italic>n</italic> = 1,097, which represented a 26.9% overall completion rate, where five “call-back” attempts were employed for each potential respondent to improve this response level. Although this completion rate is less than ideal, it is consistent with the modal response rate of 25% as seen in a recent study examining 80 telephone surveys that relied on random-digit dialing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887403411421215">McCarty, House, Harman, &amp; Richards, 2006</xref>). In an effort to identify the representativeness of the rural sample (<italic>n</italic> = 36 counties) drawn from the rural population (<italic>n</italic> = 1,550 counties), we examined the parallels on important structural, economic, and demographic county indicators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403411421215">Table 1</xref>). First, descriptive statistics illustrate that population size, education, residential stability, and income were fairly consistent between those counties sampled to represent the greater distribution (i.e., population) of rural counties. Population density was lower in the sampled counties but this is likely due to a sample that was disproportionately outside of metropolitan areas compared with all U.S. rural counties (see below).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403411421215">Blau’s (1977)</xref> classic structural measure of ethnic heterogeneity, which ranges from 0 to 1, is calculated by taking one minus the squared proportions of the population in each racial and ethnic group for each county. Thus, an indicator closer to 1.0 indicates a higher degree of racial and ethnic differences among the population residing within a given area. The population residing within the random sample of counties selected to represent the population of rural counties was slightly more likely to be ethnically and racially diverse (0.194 compared with 0.181). In addition, the residents in the sampled counties were slightly less likely to be non-Hispanic White (78.9% compared with 85.1%) relative to the rural population’s distribution. These minor differences in demographic profiles were perhaps most likely due to the undersampling of counties in metropolitan areas (8.6% compared with 15.3%) and the slight oversampling of nonmetropolitan areas that were not adjacent to metro areas or cities (40.0% compared with 21.9%). Taking these deviations into consideration, there does not appear to be intrinsic sampling bias between selected counties relative to the distribution of those in the overall population.</p>

<p>Self-protective behavior is widely recognized as a multidimensional concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887403411421215">Rosenbaum, 1988</xref>). The dimensionality of the concept extends beyond simply distinguishing between measures designed to prevent property victimization and measures designed to prevent personal victimization. For example, scholars have identified risk avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411421215">DuBow et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403411421215">Garofalo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>) and personal security measures/risk management behaviors (e.g., carrying weapons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887403411421215">Rosenbaum, 1988</xref>) as self-protective behaviors geared toward reducing personal victimization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab (1990)</xref> similarly identifies various dimensions of household protective behaviors including personal access controls (locks), personal security (keeping dogs or guns in the home), surveillance (neighborhood watch), and target hardening (burglar alarms and property marking). The multidimensional nature of self-protective behavior thus requires separate analyses for each behavioral construct rather than a single analysis predicting a single self-protective behavior measure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403411421215">Clotfelter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope &amp; Lab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403411421215">Luxenburg et al., 1994</xref>; for an example of self-protective behavior as an index, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403411421215">Scheider et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus of the present study is on household protective measures. Specifically, survey respondents were asked to indicate whether, during the 12 months prior to the survey, they took any of nine actions to protect themselves or their property from crime that takes place at home. The questions do not address actions taken prior to the 12-month reference period. The actions included installing a security system or alarm (“alarm”), asking police to perform a home security check (“check”), keeping dogs in the home for protection purposes (“dog”), engraving identification numbers on at least some belongings (“engrave”), installing extra locks on windows/doors (“locks”), keeping weapons inside the home for protection purposes (“weapons”), adding outside or automatic lighting (“lighting”), routinely locking home when leaving (“lock home”), and routinely locking vehicle at residence (“lock vehicle”). Each of the nine items is a dichotomous measure with the higher score indicating that the respondent engaged in the self-protective behavior during the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in the measurement model below, the indicators were representative of two latent constructs, protection-specific (alarm, check, engrave, locks, lighting, lock home, lock vehicle) and multipurpose behaviors (dog, weapons). Factor 2, although representative of self-protection behaviors, would have benefitted from additional measures to capture the underlying latent construct. For example, taking a martial arts class serves both self-protection and self-improvement; many people take such classes for the exercise and sports benefits without the need for self-protection. However, we only had two measures in this sample.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p><italic>Perceived risk</italic>, the central component of the risk interpretation model, captures a respondent’s assessment of their likelihood of victimization. Risk items are designed to “elicit general assessments of safety from the respondents rather than personal, more emotional experiences [fear]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403411421215">Rountree &amp; Land, 1996</xref>, p. 1354). Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro (1995)</xref>, risk is measured as an index combining eight indicators. Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale from 0 (<italic>not at all likely</italic>) to 10 (<italic>very likely</italic>), how likely they were to be the victim of each of eight separate crimes: break in while respondent is away, break in while respondent is home, theft by force, threatened with a weapon, assault, car theft, cheated/conned out of money, and theft or damage of personal property. Scores for each item were summed to create a <italic>perceived risk</italic> measure with possible scores ranging from 0 to 80 (α = .913).</p>
<p>Scholars have measured <italic>fear of crime</italic> using items asking respondents how worried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403411421215">Rountree &amp; Land, 1996</xref>) or afraid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro, 1995</xref>) they are of certain crimes or of victimization. In the present study, <italic>fear of crime</italic> was measured with the same set of crimes used in the risk measure but the focus was on the emotional response to crime rather than judgments about risk. Specifically, respondents were asked “how afraid [they] were of becoming victims of each of the following crimes.” Scores ranged from 0 to 10 for each item (higher scores indicating greater levels of fear). An index was created by summing all eight items creating a <italic>fear of crime</italic> measure with possible scores ranging from 0 to 80 (α = .939).</p>
<p><italic>Victimization</italic> captured a respondent’s experience with crime during the year preceding the survey. Consistent with many victimization surveys, respondents were presented with descriptions of crimes rather than actual labels as confusion may exist as to actual definitions. For example, respondents were asked whether someone attempted to or had taken something from them through actual or threatened force. If the answer was yes, the respondent was coded as a robbery victim. The dichotomous <italic>victimization</italic> measure indicates whether the respondent acknowledged being the victim of a robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, or larceny (1 = <italic>any victimization</italic>, 0 = <italic>no victimization</italic>).</p>
<p>The collective security/self-help hypothesis is measured in the present study through the inclusion of a <italic>perceived collective efficacy</italic> measure. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403411421215">Sampson et al. (1997)</xref>, collective efficacy represents a combination of neighborhood social cohesion and informal social control that work to inhibit neighborhood problems including crime and violence. When collective efficacy is weak, neighborhood residents are faced with greater challenges and the need to compensate for gaps in social control. As the collective security/self-help hypotheses suggest, this may include attempts at self-protection. Sampson et al. view collective efficacy as an objective quality of a neighborhood that can be measured by aggregating individual-level survey responses to the neighborhood level. In the present study, the <italic>actual</italic> level of collective efficacy is less important than how it is <italic>perceived</italic> by individual residents. In other words, it is argued here that self-protective responses are more likely to emerge if residents believe that others are incapable of protecting them, regardless of the actual efficacy of the neighborhood as a whole.</p>
<p>The operationalization of perceived collective efficacy has varied. Some have borrowed heavily from the original measurement of the concept (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403411421215">Gibson, Zhao, Lovrich, &amp; Gaffney, 2002</xref>) while others have measured perceived efficacy by capturing participation in protective strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411421215">Ferguson &amp; Mindel, 2007</xref>). The latter situation precludes studying the effects of perceived collective efficacy on protective behavior as the independent variable measures what it is designed to explain. In the present study, perceived collective efficacy is operationalized using items consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403411421215">Sampson et al.’s (1997)</xref> work. To measure informal social control, respondents were to indicate how likely neighbors were to assist in five situations: children skipping school and hanging out, children spray painting graffiti, a child showing disrespect to an adult, a fight in front of their house, and budget cuts to a local fire station. Respondents were also asked to provide their level agreement with five additional items measuring social cohesion: people in my neighborhood can be trusted, people in my neighborhood are willing to help their neighbors, this is a close-knit neighborhood, people in this neighborhood do not share the same values, and people in this neighborhood generally do not get along with each other (the latter two reverse coded). Scores for each item (ranging from 1-5) were summed to create a <italic>perceived collective efficacy</italic> score ranging from 10 to 50 (α = .821).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0887403411421215">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several additional variables are introduced as controls for the endogenous variables and correlates of the exogenous variables. These variables include <italic>respondent’s age, sex</italic> (1 = <italic>male</italic>, 0 = <italic>female</italic>), and <italic>race</italic> (1 = <italic>White</italic>, 0 = <italic>non-White</italic>). Each of these factors has been found in prior research to predict self-protective behavior (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403411421215">Lab &amp; Stanich 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403411421215">Warr &amp; Ellison, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0887403411421215">
<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the measurement and structural models, specifically employing weighted least squares mean and variance (WLSMV) estimator through Mplus, version 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887403411421215">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). WLSMV is appropriate for models with categorical predictors and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411421215">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887403411421215">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). We assessed each model fit through the chi-square test, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the weighted root mean square residual (WRMR).</p>
<p>The SEM empirical literature provides accepted cutoff values for fit indices. The model chi-square should be nonsignificant, indicating that the hypothesized model is not significantly different from a perfect fit to the data; thus, the chi-square <italic>p</italic> value should be greater than .05. The chi-square fit statistic, however, can lead to an unwarranted rejection of the model, especially in large samples because the chi-square test will be more sensitive to minor differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411421215">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403411421215">Kline, 2005</xref>, pp. 135-137; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887403411421215">Mulaik, 2009</xref>). Researchers therefore consider the chi-square statistic in relation to sample size and other fit indices. For the CFI and the TLI, values above .90 indicate a reasonably good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411421215">Bollen, 1989</xref>). An RMSEA less than or equal to 0.06 indicates a close fit, between 0.07 and 0.10 indicates a reasonable fit, and greater than 0.10 indicates a poor fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403411421215">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). The WRMR, specific to weighted least squares analysis, should be below 1.00; however, there is as yet no consensus on what signifies a good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403411421215">Finney &amp; DiStefano, 2006</xref>). We also evaluated the measurement model based on the substantive loading of each latent factor on the observed variables. We expected that each of the latent variables would have a reasonably high and statistically significant factor loading on the observed variables; a factor loading is considered reasonable if it is above 0.30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403411421215">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, because the protective measures were latent factors measured through observed binary variables, the unstandardized regression coefficients were probit coefficients. In addition, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>s for each categorical endogenous variables were the variance explained for the continuous latent response variable <italic>y</italic>* (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411421215">Bollen, 1989</xref>, pp. 439-446 for a detailed explanation).</p>

<p>The average sample respondent was a White female at about 50 years of age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403411421215">Table 2</xref> for descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation among predictors). The average fear of crime was toward the lower end of the 80-point scale (<italic>M</italic> = 20.98) as was the perceived risk of crime (<italic>M</italic> = 11.58). Only about 16% of respondents reported victimization. The adoption of individual prevention-specific behaviors ranged from a low of 10% for installing an alarm or asking police to perform a security check to a high of 76% for locking doors. For multipurpose behaviors, 35% had a dog and 50% had a weapon.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>We first evaluated the protective behaviors measurement model. Recall that protective behaviors were hypothesized to be two specific latent factors, which were called <italic>protection-specific behaviors</italic> (Factor 1) and <italic>multipurpose behaviors</italic> (Factor 2). This measurement model fit the data, although the chi-square <italic>p</italic> value was less than the .05 cutoff (<italic>p</italic> = .035), indicating that the model implied covariance matrix was significantly different from the observed covariance matrix. Given the sample size used to test the measurement model (<italic>n</italic> = 798), a significant difference is not surprising because small differences can be statistically significant with a large sample. The other fit indicators, however, were well within accepted cutoff levels (CFI = 0.990; TLI = 0.990; RMSEA = 0.025; WRMR = 0.793) and indicated that the measurement model did indeed fit the data well. An initial analysis indicated that correlating the error terms for two observed variables on Factor 1, locked vehicles and locked home, would improve the model fit. As these two variables were closely related behaviors, it made sense to correlate their error terms; locking vehicles and doors possibly represents the same impulse for protection. In addition, the two latent factors were correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .508; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). All of the factor loadings on both factors from the observed variables were significant and above 0.500. The measurement model for protective behaviors is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0887403411421215">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Structural Model</title>
<p>This structural model also fit the data but again the chi-square’s <italic>p</italic> value was less than the .05 cutoff (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Like the measurement model, the other fit indicators were well within accepted cutoff levels (CFI = 0.943; TLI = 0.950; RMSEA = 0.044; WRMR = 1.002). Thus, the path model fit the data well.</p>
<p>The first dependent variable examined was victimization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403411421215">Table 3</xref>). As predicted, collective efficacy was negatively related to victimization (<italic>b</italic> = −0.060). Furthermore, older respondents were less likely to report a prior victimization compared with younger respondents (<italic>b</italic> = −0.017); otherwise, there was no significant difference between White and non-White respondents or between male and female respondents. Collective efficacy and the control variables explained about 19% of the variation in victimization. Next, the perceived risk of crime was significantly associated with collective efficacy (<italic>b</italic> = −0.537) and prior victimization (<italic>b</italic> = 4.272) in the expected directions. There were no significant differences across the control variables. These predictors explained about 25% of the variation in perceived risk.</p>

<p>Fear of crime was higher when respondents had a prior victimization (<italic>b</italic> = 2.576) and a higher perceived risk of crime (<italic>b</italic> = 0.686) and lower when collective efficacy was stronger (<italic>b</italic> = −0.231). While age did not have a significant effect on fear of crime, Whites were less likely to fear crime than minority respondents (<italic>b</italic> = −8.682). Also, male respondents were less afraid of crime than female respondents (<italic>b</italic> = −4.128). About 39% of the variation in fear of crime was explained by these factors.</p>
<p>The final two dependent variables in the structural model were the latent factors representing protective behaviors, prevention-specific behaviors (<italic>F</italic>1) and multipurpose behaviors (<italic>F</italic>2). For prevention-specific behaviors, Whites were significantly different from non-White respondents (<italic>b</italic> = −0.416) in that they were less likely to use such protection-specific behaviors. There were no significant differences between male respondents and female respondents or for age. As for the predictor variables, collective efficacy did not have a significant effect on these behaviors, but victimization, perceived risk, and fear of crime were positively related to adopting prevention measures (<italic>b</italic> = 0.198, 0.020, and 0.015, respectively). About 24% of the variation in Factor 1 was explained by the predictor variables. For multipurpose behaviors, which included having a gun or a dog, older respondents were less likely to use such measures (<italic>b</italic> = −0.005) while male respondents were more likely than female respondents to do so (<italic>b</italic> = 0.377). Victimization and risk were related to adoption of multipurpose behaviors (<italic>b</italic> = 0.125 and 0.006, respectively), but not overall fear of crime. About 18% of the variation in multipurpose behaviors was explained by this model.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the direct effects of the various independent variables on the endogenous outcomes, the indirect effects of collective efficacy and victimization through risk to protective behaviors were also examined. All four indirect effects were significant: collective efficacy was negatively related to both protection-specific (<italic>b</italic> = −0.011) and multipurpose behaviors (<italic>b</italic> = −0.003); victimization was positively related to both outcomes (<italic>b</italic> = 0.068 and 0.026, respectively).</p>
<p>The analyses presented above were based on 798 cases for which complete data were available, representing slightly less than three quarters of the original sample size of 1,097. The reduction in sample size was largely due to missing data on the collective efficacy variable; approximately 20% of cases were missing valid data on this single measure. To examine for the possibility that missing data may have influenced the results, the measurement and structural models were reproduced using Mplus’ maximum likelihood imputation routine for missing data. The findings—both the significance and direction of relationships—were unchanged.</p>
<p>In sum, most of the hypothesized relationships were supported in the path model. The exceptions were that collective efficacy did not predict either multipurpose or prevention-specific behaviors, and fear of crime did not predict multipurpose behaviors. Also, counter to expectations, Whites were less fearful of crime than minority respondents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings offer three contributions to the literature on constrained behavior. First, residents of small-town and rural communities do take a variety of protective measures ranging from routinely locking one’s home (taken by 75.7% of respondents) to adding alarms (10.3%). These numbers are not consistently higher or lower than responses from urban dwellers found in a more-than-decade-old study of residents of 12 cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403411421215">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). For example, residents in rural counties were less likely than residents of these urban areas to add locks or alarms but more likely to add lighting or keep a dog or firearm in the home for protective purposes. Although the numbers are not directly comparable due to question wording and survey administration issues, the findings, consistent with earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope &amp; Lab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887403411421215">Menard &amp; Covey, 1987</xref>), suggest that rural community members are neither universally more nor less cautious than their urban counterparts.</p>
<p>Second, the results also reaffirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab’s (1990)</xref> contention that protective behavior is a multidimensional construct. The measurement model developed above distinguished between activities that were solely crime prevention oriented (e.g., adding lighting or locks) from those that served multiple purposes including crime prevention (e.g., keeping dogs or guns in the home). The importance of recognizing the dimensionality of protective behavior is clear. The relevant predictors of such behavior vary depending on the nature of the behavior (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411421215">Hope &amp; Lab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411421215">Lab, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the models tested also support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411421215">Ferraro’s (1995)</xref> risk interpretative model of self-protective behavior. The model presupposes that individuals make assessments about their likelihood of victimization (risk) and react accordingly. In the present study, risk was found to be influenced by both prior victimization experiences and perceptions of collective efficacy. Specifically, respondents who had experienced victimization in the recent past reported higher levels of fear relative to those who reported no recent victimizations. In addition, respondents seemingly assessed the collective capacity of the community to respond to crime; where efficacy was considered weak, respondents reported greater levels of risk which subsequently shaped self-protective behavior. Residents of rural counties tended to take more protection-specific and multipurpose actions when perceiving heightened risks. Moreover, both victimization and perceptions of efficacy influenced self-protective behavior indirectly by altering levels of perceived risk.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional nature of the study, however, raises questions about interpretation as temporal ordering is a potential problem. Of particular concern is whether the protective behaviors followed the characteristics indicated by the independent variables above, as modeled in the present study, or whether they preceded the independent variables. For example, it is possible that victimization followed self-protective behavior; that is, a respondent was victimized because of actions they failed to take. Although time ordering is a legitimate concern, it is mediated to an extent by theorized relationships. In the example above, one would expect a negative relationship (as protective behavior declines, victimization increases). This is contrary to the positive relationship that would be expected if protective behavior was a response to victimization. Thus, it is possible to say that the time ordering is consistent with theoretical expectations but caution should be exercised, given the inherent limitations of cross-sectional designs. In addition, due to lack of data, the model does not include other predictors found by some to be relevant (e.g., altruistic fear, vicarious victimization, or police-related variables).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Criminological inquiry has generally focused on studying crime and associated behaviors within urban contexts. There are practical considerations that support this situation (e.g., finite data collection resources may produce more robust results when distributed across a limited geographic area) and the majority of the U.S. population lives in areas defined by the Census Bureau as “urban.” This situation implies, however, that crime-related explanations and answers derived in urban contexts have sufficient utility in rural regions. The findings of this and other studies demonstrate that predictive models might generally hold between rural and urban venues; however, important distinctions can be noted. In general, criminology needs to provide more consideration of how core ideas and theories translate into rural regions and small towns. This is a matter of more than simply statistical precision. To the extent that research influences programs and practices intended to reduce crime, delinquency, and associated problems, these efforts may be misdirected if using urban findings in rural settings.</p>
<p>These results also have implications for the study of fear, risk, and associated perceptions and behaviors. Where feasible, analyses are likely to achieve more insightful results when they do not rely strictly on single model approaches. This includes the periodic tendency to treat self-protective behaviors in a unified fashion (e.g., creating a scale rather than treating behaviors as separate actions, possibly having separate predictors) as well as not using optimal analytic techniques, such as SEM, to better understand how key concepts produce direct and indirect effects on outcomes. The use of more robust techniques has the potential to produce more accurate understandings of how independent and control variables influence dependent variables. As suggested above, this situation is more than simply a matter of empirical precision. Understanding the paths resulting in a citizen’s choice to engage in protective behaviors can yield more effective public policy, a matter of pivotal concern in austere times for communities and the criminal justice system.</p>
