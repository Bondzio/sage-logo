<abstract>
<p>It is well documented that most trauma survivors recover from adversity and only a number of them go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, survivors of interpersonal trauma (IPT) appear to be at heightened risk for developing PTSD in comparison to survivors of noninterpersonal trauma (NIPT). Despite a robust association between IPT exposure and attachment disruptions, there is a dearth of research examining the role of attachment-related processes implicated in predicting PTSD. Using a sample of college undergraduates exposed to IPT and NIPT, this study explores the mediating effect of self-worth in the relationship between attachment and PTSD. It is hypothesized that insecure attachment will be related to posttraumatic symptomatology via a reduced sense of self-worth in IPT survivors but not in NIPT survivors. Mediation analyses provide support for this hypothesis, suggesting the importance of considering negative cognitions about the self in therapeutic interventions, particularly those offered to IPT survivors.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority of individuals (40% to 90%) have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431440">Breslau, Davis, Andreski, &amp; Peterson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431440">Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, &amp; Nelson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511431440">Norris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260511431440">Resnick, Kilpatrick, Dansky, Saunders, &amp; Best, 1993</xref>). However, the lifetime prevalence for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been estimated to be as low as 7.8% but in some cases up to 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431440">Breslau et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431440">Kessler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511431440">Perkonigg, Kessler, Storz, &amp; Wittchen, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, although noninterpersonal traumatic events (NIPT; 33.3%), such as natural disasters and motor vehicle accidents, have been shown to be much more prevalent than interpersonal traumatic events (IPT), such as physical assault and sexual assault (10.28% and 14.32% respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260511431440">Resnick et al., 1993</xref>), IPT survivors appear to be more at risk than NIPT survivors for developing posttrauma psychopathology, including PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431440">Breslau et al., 1991</xref>). Specifically, Resnick et al. found the lifetime prevalence of PTSD to be significantly higher in the aftermath of IPT (38.5%) than that of NIPT (9.4%). A meta-analysis revealed that IPT, when broken down into different types, was more related to PTSD if it was found in a noncombat scenario, such as domestic violence and sexual assault, rather than situations associated with combative trauma exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431440">Ozer, Best, Lipsey, &amp; Weiss, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that although differences in trauma exposure account for some variability in posttrauma functioning, there are likely individual differences that have an impact on the development of posttrauma psychopathology.</p>
<p>One vulnerability factor that has often been explored in relation to trauma exposure and PTSD is attachment. Bowlby’s attachment theory underscores the importance of healthy infant–caregiver bonds in an individual’s development in the areas of emotion regulation, cognition, behavior, and personality, which in turn has a strong influence on one’s long-term psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431440">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000</xref>). Attachment theorists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511431440">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431440">Bowlby, 1969/1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511431440">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>) have distinguished between secure and insecure styles of attachment. Secure individuals tend to display a positive regard for oneself and others and are comfortable with both intimacy and autonomy; individuals with an insecure style marked by anxious attachment tend to view themselves and others negatively, fear abandonment, and seek heightened intimacy in close relationships; individuals with avoidant attachment tend to be uncomfortable with closeness and dependency on others and prefer to be self-reliant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511431440">Ainsworth et al., 1978</xref>). Attachment is likely to be most germane to posttrauma functioning in cases of IPT because exposure to IPT tends to implicate attachment processes and affect an individual’s internal working models of perceptions about self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431440">Cicchetti &amp; Toth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431440">Cole &amp; Putnam, 1992</xref>). For example, betrayal trauma, which is defined as trauma that is inflicted by caregivers or intimate partners, entails a violation of trust by someone the survivor relies on for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431440">Freyd, 1994</xref>) and is highly associated with insecure attachment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511431440">Cook et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has established a robust relationship between IPT (in both childhood and adulthood) and attachment disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431440">Alexander, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431440">Muller, Sicoli, &amp; Lemieux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260511431440">Roche, Runtz, &amp; Hunter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511431440">Sullivan-Hanson, 1990</xref>). Studies on childhood maltreatment showed that between 70% and 100% of survivors are insecure, which is in stark contrast to findings by other studies, that there are only approximately 30% insecure individuals in nonabused samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511431440">Carlson, Cicchetti, Barnett, &amp; Braunwald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431440">Cicchetti, Cummings, Greenberg, &amp; Marvin, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431440">Crittenden (1997)</xref> proposed that growing up in an inconsistent or abusive environment may lead insecure individuals to concentrate on pleasing others, thus leaving little time and energy for self-enhancement. As a result, abuse survivors have frequently been observed to suffer from an impaired sense of self and concurrent inability to relate to others, which are related to attachment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431440">Briere &amp; Elliott, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431440">Gold, Sinclair, &amp; Bulge, 1999</xref>). Likewise, emerging research on adulthood IPT revealed that battered women are not only at increased risks for developing an impaired attachment compared to nonexposed women but are also more likely to form insecure attachment to their infants during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511431440">Huth-Bocks, Levendosky, Theran, &amp; Bogat, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite an increasing focus on attachment in IPT survivors, the role of attachment and related underlying processes implicated in predicting PTSD has been underinvestigated. Research has established that attachment disruptions contribute to the onset and maintenance of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511431440">MacDonald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431440">Stovall-McClough &amp; Cloitre, 2006</xref>); thus, factors that explain the link between attachment disruptions and PTSD deserve empirical exploration. Self-worth may well account for this link given that it is highly associated with both insecure attachment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431440">O’Connor &amp; Elklit, 2008</xref>) and the onset of PTSD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431440">Bradley, Schwartz, &amp; Kaslow, 2005</xref>). Broadly speaking, <italic>self-worth</italic> refers to the satisfaction and acceptance of oneself in regards to achievements and personal characteristics. Given the substantial impact of early infant–caregiver interactions on the formation of mental representations of self, attachment is critical in the development of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431440">Collins &amp; Read, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431440">Feeney &amp; Noller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511431440">Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994</xref>). Specifically, secure individuals tend to exhibit higher self-worth that is internalized and not sought through others’ acceptance and approval; in contrast, insecure individuals, particularly those with a fearful or preoccupied attachment style, tend to exhibit lower self-worth that is based on ongoing external validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431440">Bartholomew, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>There is ample evidence documenting the implication of self-worth in the etiology of a broad range of psychopathology, including depression and various types of anxiety disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260511431440">Roberts, Gotlib, &amp; Kassel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511431440">van Oppen &amp; Arntz, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, greater self-worth has also been found to be vital for adaptive posttrauma functioning. For example, research has consistently revealed that anxious, fearful, and preoccupied attachment styles, all of which reflect a negative self-regard, were most related to posttraumatic stress symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511431440">Browne &amp; Winkelman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431440">Muller et al., 2000</xref>). Conversely, secure and dismissing attachments, which reflect a positive view of self, were not connected to posttraumatic stress symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511431440">Mikulincer, Florian, &amp; Weller, 1993</xref>). IPT survivors with low self-worth may be predisposed to experience trauma-specific guilt and shame, which have been found to hamper trauma-related coping and place individuals at risk for the development of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431440">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431440">Foa, Steketee, &amp; Rothbaum, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511431440">Owens &amp; Chard, 2001</xref>). Possessing low self-worth may also hinder one’s ability to cope effectively and regulate affective responses, which is a key marker of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431440">Bradley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431440">Sandberg, Suess, &amp; Heaton, 2010</xref>). Being unable to process trauma-related information adaptively would lead trauma survivors to falsely perceive internal and external stimuli as ongoing threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431440">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>). In addition, positive regard for self, as typically displayed by secure individuals, may also allow for more tolerance of adversity and a greater sense of efficacy to mobilize and benefit from the use of internal and external supports posttrauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511431440">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431440">O’Connor &amp; Elklit, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, insecure attachment may likely contribute to posttraumatic stress via lowered self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431440">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>). The current study extends previous research by investigating the role of self-worth in the relationship between attachment and PTSD, particularly in regard to different types of trauma exposure (i.e., IPT and NIPT). The main hypotheses are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0886260511431440" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Consistent with previous studies, greater attachment anxiety and avoidance will be related to both lowered self-worth and heightened PTSD symptoms. Self-worth will also be inversely correlated with PTSD symptoms.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: There will be significant differences between individuals who experienced IPT and those who did not, in terms of attachment, self-worth, and PTSD symptom severity. More specifically, the IPT group will report greater overall attachment difficulties, lower self-worth, and greater PTSD symptom severity, compared to the NIPT group.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Self-worth will mediate the relationship between attachment and PTSD for the IPT group. However, self-worth will not mediate the relationship between attachment and PTSD for the NIPT group.</p></list-item></list>
<p>As such, we propose a moderated mediation relationship may exist. It is important to note that, depending on the theory being tested, a variable can be introduced as a mediator or a moderator. In this case, <italic>self-worth</italic> is proposed as a mediator because research has consistently shown a strong relationship between insecure attachment and PTSD; therefore, a mediator can serve to clarify the mechanisms behind this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431440">Frazier, Tix, &amp; Barron, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The present study is part of a larger data set collected at a Midwestern university, comprising a sample of 616 undergraduate students. Participants included in the present study endorsed at least one incident of trauma in their life and had complete data for the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431440">Kubany, 2004</xref>). In addition, participants were chosen if they could identify and report on a traumatic event that was “the worst” or “stuck with them” on the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431440">Foa, 1995</xref>). All other participants were excluded. The final sample of 228 undergraduate students had a mean age of 19.64 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.09), and 66.7% of participants identified as female (<italic>n</italic> = 152). Most participants were European American (68.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 157), 11.0% were African American (<italic>n</italic> = 25), 5.7% were Hispanic (<italic>n</italic> = 13), 3.5% were Asian (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and the remaining 11% identified as biracial or Other (<italic>n</italic> = 23); in some cases, the participants did not identify their ethnicity (<italic>n</italic> = 2). The sample was comprised of mostly freshmen (58.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 133) and sophomores (23.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 54).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260511431440">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from the introductory psychology subject pool and received class credit for their participation. Once participants signed up for the study, they were emailed a unique login name and password as well as a link to the questionnaires. Participants completed an informed consent form and a battery of questionnaires online, which took about 60 min to complete. A debriefing form along with resources and referrals were provided at the end of the study.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the study, two trauma exposure groups were created based on participants’ responses to the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431440">Kubany, 2004</xref>). An interpersonal trauma score was created that summed participants’ exposure to the interpersonal trauma items on the TLEQ. Participants who had a score of zero were placed in the noninterpersonal trauma (NIPT) group, and participants with nonzero scores were placed in the interpersonal trauma group (IPT). The groups did not differ in regards to age, <italic>t</italic>(226) = −1.86, <italic>p</italic> = .07; gender, χ<sup>2</sup> = .46, <italic>p</italic> = .50; ethnicity, χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.86, <italic>p</italic> = .35; or year in school, χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.70, <italic>p</italic> = .26.</p>

<title>Demographic Questionnaire</title>
<p>Participants were asked a number of questions focusing on demographics, including age, gender, ethnicity, education level, sexual orientation, current relationship status, and household/family and personal income.</p>

<sec id="section6-0886260511431440">
<title>Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Inventory (ECR-R)</title>
<p>The ECR-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511431440">Fraley, Waller, &amp; Brennan, 2000</xref>) is a self-report questionnaire that measures attachment difficulties, specifically attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. Each of the 36 items was scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>extremely</italic>). For instance, the item, “I worry that others won’t care about me as much as I care about them,” reflects attachment anxiety, whereas the item, “I try to avoid getting too close to others,” reflects attachment avoidance. Respondents rate each item on the extent to which they agree with each statement about their feelings toward close relationships. The subscales are created by averaging the responses to the 13 items on each subscale. A higher total score on each subscale indicates higher attachment insecurity. Missing scores on several items of the subscales were present for three participants and were in no particular pattern. These values were replaced by the series mean. Research using the ECR-R has shown strong psychometric properties, including strong internal consistency (α = .93 for avoidance, and α = .92 for anxiety), acceptable test–retest reliability, and strong validity across various populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511431440">Fairchild &amp; Finney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260511431440">Sibley, Fischer, &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>). Internal consistency in the present study was α = .93 for anxiety scale, and α = .94 for the avoidance scale.</p>

<sec id="section7-0886260511431440">
<title>The World Assumption Scale (WAS)</title>
<p>The WAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431440">Janoff-Bulman, 1989</xref>) assesses cognitive schemas about self and others. There are a total of 32 items that can be divided into subscales that assess benevolence of the world, benevolence of people, justice, controllability, randomness, self-worth, self-controllability, and luck. For the purposes of the present study, only the Self-Worth subscale was used by reverse scoring specified items and summing the responses to represent participants’ assumptions regarding self-worth. Items on the Self-Worth subscale include, “I am very satisfied with the kind of person I am,” and “I often think I am no good at all” (reverse coded). Responses are based on how much the respondent agrees with each statement on a scale of 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), with a higher score indicating more positive assumptions. Two participants had missing values on several items of the Self-Worth subscale, which were replaced by the series mean. Discriminant analyses conducted in the development of the measure revealed that three of the assumptions, including self-worth (Wilks’s Λ = .98), were able to discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431440">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>). Internal consistency for the Self-Worth subscale was acceptable (α = .73) in the present study.</p>

<sec id="section8-0886260511431440">
<title>Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale</title>
<p>The PDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431440">Foa, 1995</xref>) measures the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the previous month. Respondents are asked to identify a traumatic event that was “the worst” or “stuck with them” and answer a series of questions pertaining to that event that measure PTSD diagnostic criteria. It also assesses the extent to which symptoms have interfered with various areas of the respondent’s life. For the present study, a total symptom severity score, ranging from 0 to 51, was generated by summing the items on the symptom clusters (i.e., hyperarousal, reexperiencing, and avoidance). Symptom severity was rated as follows: 0 = <italic>no rating</italic>, 1 to 10 = <italic>mild</italic>, 11 to 20 = <italic>moderate</italic>, 21 to 35 = <italic>moderate to severe</italic>, and 36 and above = <italic>severe</italic>. The scale has demonstrated good reliability for the symptom severity scale (α = .92) and good test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431440">Foa, 1995</xref>). For the present study, internal consistency for the PTSD symptom severity scale was high (α = .92).</p>

<title>Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire</title>
<p>The TLEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431440">Kubany, 2004</xref>) assesses exposure to potentially traumatic events and how many times each of these events has happened. The types of trauma assessed include natural disaster, sexual assault, physical abuse, war or combat exposure, and motor vehicle accidents. Each of the 23 items was rated based on the following responses: <italic>never, once, twice, 3 times, 4 times</italic>, and <italic>more than 5 times</italic>. The TLEQ yields a total trauma history score by tallying the items, with higher scores indicating greater traumatic event exposure. Scores for both IPT and NIPT were generated. The IPT score was created by summing the items associated with sexual assault, nonsexual assault (e.g., physical assault, being robbed), or stalking; the NIPT score summed responses to items associated with accidents, natural disasters, war or combat exposure, death or illness of a loved one, miscarriage or abortion. Given that civilian or everyday traumas are of interest in this study and that the intent and dynamics of military-related trauma are very different from civilian trauma and may be differentially related to attachment and self-worth, we decided to categorize military-related trauma as an NIPT. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431440">Ozer et al. (2003)</xref> confirmed that noncombat IPT items, such as domestic violence and sexual assault, were more related to PTSD compared to that of combative trauma exposure. The TLEQ has demonstrated high test–retest reliability as well as high convergent validity with other measures of posttraumatic stress disorder such as structured interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511431440">Kubany et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>Participants in the present study reported exposure to an average of 7.55 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.09) total traumatic events, which indicates the total number of times each trauma occurred; thus, this number could include multiple exposures to the same type of event. In total, participants endorsed exposure to an average of 5.05 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.90) of the 23 different types of events assessed on the TLEQ, which ranged between exposure to only one type of trauma and exposure to all of the 23 different types of trauma. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511431440">Table 1</xref> shows the percentage of participants who reported at least one exposure to each type of traumatic event assessed on the TLEQ. Chi-square analyses indicated no gender differences in exposure to the traumatic events, with the exception of being robbed, military combat, and exposure to another’s death. Men were overrepresented in the robbed, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 8.14, <italic>p</italic> = .004, and military combat exposure group, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.01, <italic>p</italic> = .03, whereas women were overrepresented in the exposure to another’s death group, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.13, <italic>p</italic> = .01. In regards to IPT, participants reported exposure to an average of 3.73 total events (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.24) and an average of 2.69 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.11) different types of interpersonal traumatic events. The mean severity score in regards to PTSD symptoms was 9.43 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.45) and ranged between 0 and 48. Using a cutoff score of 28 to suggest diagnostic levels of PTSD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431440">Coffey, Dansky, Falsetti, Saladin, &amp; Brady, 1998</xref>), 8.8% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 20) achieved a symptom severity level that may qualify for a PTSD diagnosis. This number is slightly higher than levels of PTSD reported in the general populations (7.8%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431440">Kessler et al., 1995</xref>). Of the 20 individuals who qualify for a PTSD diagnosis, 16 were female. However, a chi-square statistic revealed that this did not constitute statistically significant overrepresentation by women, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.75, <italic>p</italic> = .19. In regard to attachment, the mean attachment scores for Anxiety and Avoidance subscales were as follows: attachment avoidance (<italic>M</italic> = 2.94, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18), attachment anxiety (<italic>M</italic> = 3.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27). Participant scores on the WAS Self-Worth subscale had a mean of 17.95 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.12). The attachment and self-worth scores were comparable to those reported for other college undergraduates who had been previously exposed to traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511431440">Lilly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431440">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>A correlation matrix of the variables of interest is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431440">Table 2</xref>. Consistent with the first hypothesis, attachment difficulties were significantly inversely related to self-worth and positively related to PTSD symptom severity. As hypothesized, self-worth was significantly inversely related to PTSD symptom severity. Hypotheses related to interpersonal trauma exposure were partially confirmed. Although interpersonal trauma exposure was significantly positively related to both PTSD symptom severity and attachment avoidance, it was not significantly related to attachment anxiety or self-worth. In addition, although noninterpersonal trauma exposure was significantly positively related to PTSD symptom severity, it was not related to attachment difficulties or self-worth. This provides preliminary support for our main hypothesis that self-worth will mediate the relationship between attachment and PTSD for the IPT group; however, self-worth will not mediate the relationship between attachment and PTSD for the NIPT group.</p>

<p>The second set of hypotheses proposed that there would be significant differences between the IPT and NIPT group, with the IPT group reporting greater overall attachment difficulties, lower self-worth, and greater PTSD symptom severity. Independent samples <italic>t</italic> test were conducted and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511431440">Table 3</xref>. As hypothesized, significant differences were observed between the IPT and the NIPT groups on attachment difficulties, self-worth, and PTSD symptom severity. Individuals in the IPT group reported overall greater attachment avoidance and anxiety, as well as greater PTSD symptom severity, whereas individuals in the NIPT group reported significantly greater self-worth, with small to moderate size effects.</p>

<p>Next, we aimed to examine whether self-worth mediated the relationship between attachment difficulties and PTSD symptom severity. We proposed that self-worth would mediate the relationship between attachment difficulties and PTSD symptom severity for those in the IPT group but would not mediate the relationship for those in the NIPT group. As such, we proposed that a moderated mediation relationship may exist.</p>
<p>According to Frazier et al., four statistical conditions need to be fulfilled to establish a mediation effect: (a) The predictor variable is significantly related to the criterion variable, (b) the predictor variable is related to the mediator variable, (c) the mediator variable is related to the criterion variable when controlling for the effects of the predictor variable on the criterion variable, and (d) inclusion of the mediator variable in the model must significantly reduce the magnitude of the relationship between the predictor variable and the criterion variable. A complete mediation is observed when this relationship is reduced to zero; otherwise, the relationship between the predictor variable and criterion variable is partially mediated, which is more prevalent (for further discussion on mediation and the distinction between mediation and moderation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431440">Frazier et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to running the regression analyses, the interrelationships between demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, income, race, and relationship status) and outcome variables in each step of the regression analyses were examined. Given that none of the demographic variables was significantly related to self-worth or posttraumatic stress symptomatology, no covariate variables were included in subsequent regression analyses. Using the procedures outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431440">Frazier et al. (2004)</xref>, we conducted a series of regression analyses, the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886260511431440">Table 5</xref> (attachment avoidance as predictor) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886260511431440">Table 5</xref> (attachment anxiety as predictor). First, we aimed to determine whether self-worth mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and PTSD symptom severity for individuals in the IPT group but not the NIPT group. In the first step, PTSD symptom severity was significantly related to attachment avoidance only in the IPT group (β = 1.63, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and not in the NIPT group (β = 1.73, <italic>p</italic> = .10). Given the lack of a significant relationship between the predictor variable and criterion variable for the NIPT group, it was determined that self-worth could not mediate the relationship between attachment avoidance and PTSD symptom severity. As such, the remaining analyses were only completed for the IPT group. Proceeding with the mediation, self-worth and attachment avoidance were significantly positively related (β = −1.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) to the IPT group. In the final step, PTSD symptom severity was regressed on both self-worth and attachment avoidance. Consistent with the presence of a partial mediation relationship, it was found that the mediator of self-worth was significantly related to PTSD symptom severity (β = −.65, <italic>p</italic> = .003) and that attachment avoidance no longer predicted PTSD symptom severity (β = .76, <italic>p</italic> = .31) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260511431440">fig. 1</xref>). A Sobel test was conducted to examine the significance of the partial mediation, which revealed a <italic>z</italic> score of 2.63 (<italic>p</italic> = .009).</p>

<p>The same procedures were adopted to determine whether self-worth mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and PTSD symptom severity for the IPT group but not the NIPT group. Unlike for attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety was significantly related to PTSD symptom severity for both the IPT (β = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and the NIPT (β = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> = .009) groups. Similar results were observed in the second step, as attachment anxiety was significantly related to self-worth for both the IPT (β = −1.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and NIPT (β = −1.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) groups. However, the regression models diverged in the third step. For the IPT group, a partial mediation model was suggested, as attachment anxiety no longer predicted PTSD symptom severity (β = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> = .16) whereas self-worth was significantly related to PTSD symptom severity (β = −.53, <italic>p</italic> = .03). A Sobel test of significance revealed a <italic>z</italic> score of 2.14 (<italic>p</italic> = .03), suggesting that self-worth significantly, partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and PTSD symptom severity for the IPT group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886260511431440">fig. 2</xref>). Consistent with the study hypotheses, a mediation model was not observed for the NIPT group, as neither attachment anxiety (β = 1.81, <italic>p</italic> = .07) nor self-worth (β = −.42, <italic>p</italic> = .19) were significantly related to PTSD symptom severity in the final regression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early experiences with caregivers have repeatedly been shown to bear profound influences on mental health well-being. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated the implication of attachment in a myriad of psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511431440">Bifulco, Moran, Ball, &amp; Lillie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431440">O’Connor &amp; Eklit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260511431440">van Buren &amp; Cooley, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which attachment difficulties lead to heightened risk of developing PTSD have remained relatively unknown. More effort is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the attachment–PTSD relationship to improve related therapeutic interventions, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431440">Sandberg et al. (2010)</xref>. Correspondingly, the present study sought to investigate the role of self-worth in the relationship between attachment and PTSD, particularly in regard to different types of trauma exposure (i.e., IPT and NIPT).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous research, findings in the current study revealed that insecure attachment was inversely related to self-worth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431440">O’Connor &amp; Elklit, 2008</xref>) and positively related to PTSD symptom severity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431440">Bradley et al., 2005</xref>). Self-worth was also significantly inversely related to PTSD symptom severity. These findings provide preliminary support for the proposed mediation—that self-worth will mediate the relationship between attachment and PTSD. However, although IPT exposure was significantly positively related to both PTSD symptom severity and attachment avoidance, it was not significantly related to attachment anxiety or self-worth. This finding is contrary to previous research that had shown attachment anxiety to be more associated with IPT and that attachment avoidance was more strongly related to NIPT. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431440">Elwood and Williams (2007)</xref> observed that IPT survivors tend to display greater attachment anxiety—but not more avoidance—compared to individuals who did not endorse IPT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511431440">Renaud (2008)</xref> also suggested that attachment avoidance, relative to attachment anxiety, may be more related to PTSD following NIPT such as combat exposure, likely because attachment avoidance is more pertinent to perceptions of external threat rather than perceptions of self (e.g., self-worth). One explanation for our finding is related to the composition of the IPT group in the current study; individuals in the IPT group may also have been exposed to NIPT, as the analyses indicate a positive, significant correlation between IPT and NIPT (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431440">Table 2</xref>). Alternatively, attachment avoidance, which involves distancing oneself from aversive emotions, may also serve as a self-protective adaptation in the face of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431440">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, these contradictory findings merit further investigation to clarify whether attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance indeed lead to differential outcomes in response to varying types of trauma exposure.</p>
<p>Consistent with both betrayal trauma theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431440">Freyd, 2009</xref>) and world assumptive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431440">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>), the IPT and NIPT groups were found to differ significantly on their attachment, self-worth, and PTSD symptom severity. In contrast to the NIPT group individuals, who reported greater self-worth, individuals in the IPT group reported greater attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and PTSD symptom severity, and thus, appeared to be less adaptive . These findings are consistent with past research suggesting that IPT exposure typically leads to heightened psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431440">Freyd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431440">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>). More specifically, because IPT is frequently inflicted by someone the survivor trusts or relies on for survival (e.g., caregiver or intimate partners), individuals exposed to IPT are likely to be less adaptive in the face of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431440">Freyd, 2009</xref>). Likewise, Janoff-Bulman proposed that IPT may be more detrimental to our core conceptual system and may subsequently lead to poor posttrauma functioning. Indeed, being harmed by another person can result in humiliation, questions of personal autonomy and strength of will, as well as shattering of self-worth. Furthermore, because NIPT such as exposure to natural disasters is usually considered an unfortunate event and not a result of one’s own doing, NIPT survivors typically receive greater support and validation from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431440">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings in the current study provide support for the hypothesized moderated mediation. As hypothesized, self-worth mediated the relationship between attachment and PTSD in survivors exposed to IPT, but the mediating effect was not observed in survivors exposed to NIPT. Consistent with previous research, insecure attachment may lead IPT survivors to believe that they are accountable for the occurrence of the traumatic event. These individuals are also likely to engage in characterological self-blame and attribute the occurrence of trauma to some enduring, negative self-trait, which in turn results in diminished self-worth and increased risk for developing PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511431440">Foa, Feske, Murdock, Kozak, &amp; McCarthy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260511431440">Silver, Boon, &amp; Stones, 1983</xref>). Insecure individuals may also be inclined to rely heavily on affect, rather than cognition, in directing their behaviors and have a highly sensitive emotional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431440">Crittenden, 1997</xref>). Their inability to process trauma-related information adaptively may in turn cause them to falsely perceive internal and external stimuli as ongoing threats, which is a prominent symptom of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431440">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-worth has also been associated with a greater sense of efficacy to mobilize resources for effective trauma-related coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511431440">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431440">Bradley et al., 2005</xref>). For that reason, secure individuals may be more likely than insecure individuals to seek social support following trauma, which has been shown to alleviate adverse effects on self-worth and thwart the development of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511431440">Brewin, Andrews, &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431440">Cuneo &amp; Schiaffino, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431440">Ozer et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, self-worth has also been found to be implicated in dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511431440">Lilly, 2011</xref>), which often co-occurs with PTSD following trauma. More specifically, Lilly proposed that dissociation may be used as a tactic in traumatic situations to defend against strong threats to one’s sense of self-worth. As observed in trauma survivors with PTSD, dissociative symptoms may also likely arise from feelings of being damaged or trauma-related guilt.</p>
<p>Several limitations in the present study need to be addressed in future studies. First, the use of a cross-sectional design in the present study makes it difficult to determine the direction of causality. Although the current study modeled insecure attachment and diminished self-worth as precursors of posttraumatic stress symptoms, it is possible that insecure attachment and diminished self-worth are instead outcomes of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Further studies using a longitudinal design that assess attachment and self-worth prior to and following a traumatic event are warranted to examine this relationship further. Second, it is important to distinguish exposure to childhood from later IPT in future studies, considering that attachment style and self-worth are developmental variables, and thus, may be more related to childhood trauma. Third, the use of a convenient college sample poses challenges in generalizing the current findings to a wider range of trauma survivors. A sample of college students who are exposed to trauma may be unrepresentative of trauma survivors at large because being able to attend college may be indicative of a relatively better psychological adjustment or having experienced less trauma, compared to other trauma survivors in clinical setting, in the community, or who dropped out of college following trauma. Fourth, self-selection bias could also influence the composition of the sample in this study. Participants were given a number of options for research studies in which to participate, and those who chose to participate in this study may represent a skewed sample of trauma survivors. In particular, individuals who have been exposed to severe or chronic traumatic events may likely avoid participating in trauma-related studies. Fifth, to generate a more holistic and accurate understanding of posttrauma functioning, it may be necessary to take into account all possible adverse mental health outcomes associated with trauma exposure. Sixth, it is difficult to gauge clinical significance of the outcome variables because the measures we used do not provide such information. For example, although there is some evidence that a cutoff score of 28 on the PDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431440">Coffey et al., 1998</xref>) may reflect the potential presence of a PTSD diagnosis, there are no norms for scores on the PDS that suggest clinically meaningful differences. Lastly, the use of self-reports may also introduce recall bias and socially desirable responding.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study represents an important contribution to the field of trauma recovery and mental health. Research has shown that insecure attachment is a risk factor in developing emotional difficulties following trauma. It is important to clarify this link between attachment and PTSD because attachment denotes a more enduring, distal factor that may be resistant to change. More important, a better understanding of the underlying etiology contributing to this association, which in this case implicates a negative working model of the self, can help design and tailor prevention and intervention strategies offered to trauma survivors.</p>
