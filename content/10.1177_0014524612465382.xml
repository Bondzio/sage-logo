<abstract>
<p>The laws of Deut. 22:20-24 arguably require the execution of women for consensual or forced sexual intercourse outside marriage. Interpreted within the theological and cultural contexts of Deuteronomy, these laws highlight both the significance of women within the covenant and the resulting control over women’s bodies and sexuality. Deuteronomy also includes laws that protect vulnerable women from abuse, and the biblical canon as a whole includes a number of stories in which women are not executed for sexual transgression. This canonical context provides readers with choices for interpretation.</p>

<body>
<p>The three laws of Deut. 22:20-24 require the execution of men and women for sexual transgression: a daughter who is accused of not being a virgin at the time of her marriage; a man and woman caught in adulterous intercourse; a man and a betrothed woman who have sex inside the city. These laws are surely rarely, if ever, heard in church gatherings; they are not included in the Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant lectionaries. The laws represent the values of a patriarchal society in which men had control over women’s bodies and sexuality, and sex itself was a public concern—a society foreign to many readers in the Western world. It would be easy to dismiss this text as irrelevant.</p>
<p>We live in a world, however, in which sexual violence against women and the violent punishment of women for perceived sexual wrongdoing are all too frequent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524612465382">1</xref></sup> To ignore the laws of Deut. 22:20-24 risks marginalizing this reality. It also risks the misinterpretation and misuse of these texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524612465382">2</xref></sup> In this article, I offer an explanation of these laws in their literary and cultural context. I also explore several balances to the execution of women in these laws from Deuteronomy and from biblical narratives of women suspected or accused of sexual transgression. The biblical canon offers readers interpretive options: execution is not the only possible response to illicit sex, even in a firmly patriarchal society.</p>
<sec id="section1-0014524612465382">
<title>1. Women in the world of Deuteronomy</title>
<p>In Deuteronomy, the ‘family’ is the group of people who live and work together in a household (cf. house, תִיַּב, in 12:7; 14:26; etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524612465382">3</xref></sup> Households could incorporate multiple generations, as Deut. 5:14, 12:12, and 16:11 suggest: a patriarch and his wife (or wives), their sons and unmarried daughters, their sons’ wives and children, and slaves. The household might also include the patriarch’s siblings, other relatives, or members of the community unattached to households.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524612465382">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deuteronomy depicts an agricultural society in which villages and cities are connected to and dependent on the land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524612465382">5</xref></sup> Historically, in this sort of society the whole family, men and women, the young and the elderly, would be required to work together to provide for their common life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524612465382">6</xref></sup> Women participated by preparing food, working in the fields, making clothes, and caring for the living space, and they could also run household-based businesses. The necessary participation of women gives wives and daughters their own measure of power in the household.</p>
<p>Wives also had the responsibility of bearing children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524612465382">7</xref></sup> This responsibility is in part economic in nature: to support the household, new workers were needed to replace those who left due to death or marriage. It is also theological. In Deuteronomy, ‘household’ can refer specifically to people who share an ancestral lineage (cf. 25:9). The covenant between Israel and Yahweh is an inheritance, passed on from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to the generations yet to come (29:9-14, 28 [ET 10-15, 29]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524612465382">8</xref></sup> The wife provides the husband with the means of participating in this inheritance. As such, Deuteronomy celebrates procreation as a blessing and protects the rights of land ownership and inheritance (7:12-16; 19:14; 21:15-17; etc.).</p>
<p>Inheritance in Deuteronomy passes through the male ancestral line (21:15-17). In this patrilocal system, a woman would live with her husband’s family (as in 24:1). Deuteronomy’s families are also patriarchal. Children of all ages are expected to honor the patriarch and his wife, an expectation which entails respect, obedience, and care for aged parents (5:16, 21:18-21, and 27:16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524612465382">9</xref></sup> For women, as seen in Deut. 22:13-29, patriarchal authority is particularly concerned with sexual control.</p>
<p>The patriarch’s control, or lack of control, over his household would be known in the community (cf. Deut. 21:18-21, 22:13-19). In this assumption, the text reflects historical reality. Due to house construction, village and city layouts, and long hours in the fields, household life in ancient Israel was open to public scrutiny.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524612465382">10</xref></sup> Economically, each household formed an essential link in the local economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524612465382">11</xref></sup> Theologically, the household was a microcosm of the nation. The functioning of the household, including the maintenance of tradition and authority, contributed to the safety and success of the local community and the nation, and likewise the disruption of a single household threatened the rest of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524612465382">12</xref></sup> These factors provide important context for interpreting the three laws of Deut. 22:20-24.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0014524612465382">
<title>2. Interpreting Deuteronomy 22:20-24</title>
<p>The series of laws in Deut. 22:13-29 addresses different instances of sexual misconduct. The laws are case laws: if (יכִּ in verses 22, 23, and 28; םאִ in verses 20 and 25<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524612465382">13</xref></sup>) a particular event occurs, then (וְ) a particular result should ensue. In the first law and final two laws, men are identified as the primary transgressors (vv. 13-19, 25-27, 28-29). In the three laws in the middle of the series, women are made equals of men in their involvement in and punishment for sexual transgression.</p>
<p>The laws of verses 20-24 require the execution of women involved in illicit sexual intercourse. In verses 21 and 24, the method of execution is specified as stoning, which is, according to J. J. Finkelstein, a penalty reserved for crimes that threaten the entire community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014524612465382">14</xref></sup> The significance of the threat is emphasized by the conclusion of each law: ‘so you shall purge the evil from your midst’ (vv. 21, 24 NRSV; ‘from Israel’ in v. 22). Evil in Deuteronomy is ascribed to acts like idolatry, false witness, and rebellion, acts that endanger the community with disorder and the threat of divine punishment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014524612465382">15</xref></sup> According to Deut. 22:20-24, sexual transgressions belong on this list.</p>
<sec id="section3-0014524612465382">
<title>2a. Deuteronomy 22:20-21</title>
<p>The first law in the series addresses the case of a bride whose new husband ‘hates’ her, claiming that she was not a virgin at the time of her marriage (Deut. 22:13-14). Her parents can clear this slander by providing the elders of the city with evidence of their daughter’s virginity (םילִ וּתבְּ), most likely a bloodstained cloth from the wedding night (vv. 15-17).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014524612465382">16</xref></sup> In this case, the husband is disciplined, fined, and prohibited from divorcing his wife (vv. 18-19). As the involvement of the parents indicates, the husband’s slander shames the young woman and her family. The punishment of the husband restores their honor.</p>
<p>If evidence of the woman’s virginity is not ‘found,’ however, the husband’s accusation is assumed to be true.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014524612465382">17</xref></sup> Consequently, the young woman is taken to the door of her father’s house and stoned to death by the men (or people) of the city (vv. 20-21). The stoning of the woman at the door of her father’s house associates her family with her transgression, in effect punishing them along with her.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014524612465382">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>This case is unusual in several respects. First, the location of the execution is unprecedented in Deuteronomy (compare with 17:5; 21:21; 22:24). Second, in contrast with the other laws in the series, the woman’s putative partner is not punished. Finally, and perhaps most troubling of all, there are no witnesses (contra Deut. 19:15), nor even positive evidence of wrongdoing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014524612465382">19</xref></sup> In fact, not all women bleed at their first intercourse. Moreover, the young woman could have been raped, thus potentially limiting her culpability (Deut. 22:25-27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014524612465382">20</xref></sup> Alternatively, she may have engaged in intercourse before her betrothal, an act which results in marriage, not execution, in verses 28-29. These possibilities are not recognized in verses 20-21, but instead the young woman is assumed to be guilty whatever her story may be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0014524612465382">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Deut. 22:21, the young woman is executed because she has committed an act of ‘foolishness’ (הלָבָנְ). In connection with sex, ‘foolishness’ more commonly describes rape and adultery (e.g., Gen. 34:7; Judg. 20:6; 2 Sam. 13:12-13; Jer. 29:23). The law in Deut. 22:21 is singular in making the young woman, rather than a man, the subject who performs the foolish act, and instead of rape or adultery, the young woman’s foolishness lies in prostituting the house of her father (הנז in v. 21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0014524612465382">22</xref></sup> This charge reminds the reader that a patriarch has authority over the sexuality of the women in his household. To challenge this authority is a ‘foolish’ act, an outrage that both brings shame on the woman and her family (note the young woman’s ‘evil name’ in v. 14), and also disrupts communal relationships (here, the marital bonds between two families).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0014524612465382">23</xref></sup> The condemnation of the young woman reflects the serious danger posed by her behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0014524612465382">
<title>2b. Deuteronomy 22:22-24</title>
<p>The laws in Deut. 22:22-24 address two cases of adultery. In biblical Israel, adultery hinges on the woman’s marital status. For a married man to have sex with a woman other than his wife or wives is only adultery if the woman is also married (or betrothed to be married). Adultery is a violation of a husband’s rights over his wife’s body, and it is thus a social offense. The inclusion of the prohibition of adultery in the ten commandments also identifies it as a covenant offense in Deuteronomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0014524612465382">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first case of adultery in chapter 22 involves a man and the wife of another man (literally, ‘the woman married to a husband,’ לעַ בָּ תלַעֻבְּ). If the man is ‘found’ lying with the woman, they are both to be executed (v. 22). The evidence in this case would seem to be irrefutable: they are caught in the act of breaking the seventh commandment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0014524612465382">25</xref></sup> This very brief law does not specify how or by whom the adultery is discovered, the method or place of execution, or the identity of the executioners. Perhaps, as in the following law, the two are stoned outside the city gates, a method of execution carried out by the people of the city in Deut. 13:11 (ET 10); 17:5, 7; and 21:21.</p>
<p>The case described in Deut. 22:23-24 involves a betrothed woman. Betrothal has the weight of marriage: the woman is a wife (v. 24). The man who ‘finds’ her and lies with her commits adultery. Or does he do something worse? According to verse 24, the man ‘dishonors’ the woman (הנע). The same descriptor is used of rape in Deut. 22:28-29; Judg. 20:5; 2 Sam. 13:12; and Lam. 5:11.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0014524612465382">26</xref></sup> It is possible that the man in Deut. 22:23-24 rapes the betrothed woman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0014524612465382">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this interpretation, ‘find’ and ‘lie with’ do not imply force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0014524612465382">28</xref></sup> Moreover, the encounter happens inside the city. According to verse 24, the woman is executed precisely because in this public space, which is inhabited by potential rescuers, she does not cry out. She is condemned on the basis of location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0014524612465382">29</xref></sup> Of course, this judgment assumes that a victim of rape is able to call for help. The betrothed woman’s knowledge of potential communal disapproval, however, may have silenced her, or the man could have physically prevented her from crying out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0014524612465382">30</xref></sup> Her complicity in the intercourse remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>These questions about the woman’s participation in sexual transgression are also important for Deut. 22:22. The wife in that verse could be a willing partner, or she may have been raped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0014524612465382">31</xref></sup> Notably, the women in both laws are objects, not subjects. The man ‘finds,’ ‘takes,’ and ‘lies with’ them. But according to both laws, the women bear equal guilt with the men, whatever their situations may be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0014524612465382">32</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0014524612465382">
<title>2c. Deuteronomy 22:20-24</title>
<p>The executions of the transgressors, notably by stoning in the first and last laws, and the ascription of ‘evil’ to the transgressions in each law indicate the danger of extramarital intercourse in Deuteronomy. In part, this danger develops from the challenge to patriarchal authority. For women, whether they be wives or daughters, to engage in sexual intercourse with men who are not their husbands disrupts household life and communal order (cf. the evil of a son’s rebellion in Deut. 21:18-21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0014524612465382">33</xref></sup> This disruption in turn threatens the survival of the covenant community. The evil must be eradicated for the good of all.</p>
<p>The covenant itself is also at stake in these laws. In Deuteronomy, the covenant is an inheritance (cf. 4:9-10, 29:9-14 [ET 10-15]). A woman who has sex with a man other than her husband could potentially bear an illegitimate child who would become part of her husband’s lineage, usurping his family’s land and place in the covenant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0014524612465382">34</xref></sup> This danger is borne out by the case of the suspected adulteress in Num. 5:11-31, in which a guilty woman is cursed in the womb and thus prevented from bearing an illegitimate heir to her husband. The execution of the women in Deut. 22:20-24 meets the same end (though in a much more drastic way).</p>
<p>Finally, foolishness, prostitution, and adultery in Deut. 22:20-24 draw these laws into conversation with the metaphor of Israel as the faithless wife of Yahweh. In Deut. 31:16 and 32:6, 15, Israel foolishly rebels against Yahweh, specifically by prostituting herself to foreign gods (לבָנָ, לבנ, and הנז). Both descriptions are echoed throughout the Torah and prophets (Exod. 34:15-16; Lev. 17:7, 20:5; Isa. 1:21, 32:6-7; Jer. 2:20; Ezek. 6:9; etc.), and the prophets also identify Israel as an adulterous wife (Isa. 57:3-13; Jer. 3:8-9; Ezek. 16:32-42; Hos. 3:1; etc.). Through this metaphor, the actions of the women in Deut. 22:20-24 become symbolic of Israel’s rebellion against Yahweh and the covenant. Israel’s relationship with Yahweh depends upon the removal of these threats (cf. Lev. 20:10, 22-23; Jer. 5:7-8).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0014524612465382">
<title>3. Deuteronomy 22:20-24 in the biblical canon</title>
<p>The three laws of Deut. 22:20-24 prescribe the death penalty for sexual transgression. In the first law, the woman is condemned on the basis of a lack of evidence. In the second law, the woman is caught in the act of adultery, but the circumstances are not explained. Neither this law nor the third includes a trial, and in the third law the man’s ‘dishonoring’ of the woman at the least associates their meeting with stories of rape. Notably, only in the first law is the woman the actor (and even there, an actual instance of sexual transgression is not identified). The wife and the betrothed woman remain objects of men’s action (a situation reflective of Hebrew usage, and a patriarchal mindset).</p>
<p>These laws are drastic. There is, on the surface, no space for the women to speak in their own defense—to tell their stories, which could be stories of seduction or of rape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0014524612465382">35</xref></sup> For Deuteronomy, no matter what the nature of the intercourse is, these women bring ‘evil’ into the community simply by engaging in intercourse with a man to whom their fathers have not married them. The execution of these wives and daughters protects the community from the disruption of husbands’ and fathers’ patriarchal authority. It also protects the inheritance of land and covenant. Moreover, through the analogy with idolatrous Israel, the execution of a foolish daughter or adulterous wife saves the nation from divine destruction.</p>
<p>While Deut. 22:20-24 can be understood in context, however, the text remains troubling on account of both the possibility of sexual violence against the women within the laws, and the potential for violence against women on the basis of these laws. For readers within the Church, the problem is compounded by the finality of the laws: cannot the woman be forgiven? These three laws have become ‘texts of terror’ (to borrow Phyllis Trible’s designation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0014524612465382">36</xref></sup>), and they represent a problem for interpretation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0014524612465382">
<title>3a. Reading Deut. 22:20-24 within Deuteronomy</title>
<p>Several factors within Deuteronomy provide a balance to the stark finality of these three laws. While these factors do not cancel out the problems of Deut. 22:20-24, they do offer interpretive options to readers. First, marriage and procreation are valued in the book. Children are a blessing given by Yahweh (7:12-16; 28:4). A man should give his wife ‘joy’ after their marriage (24:5), and the loss of a bride is one of the covenant curses of Deut. 28:30. Sex itself is not ‘evil’ in Deuteronomy, but rather it is celebrated when it occurs within lawful, acceptable relationships.</p>
<p>Second, the three laws of Deut. 22 occur in a series of laws in which women are protected from slander and abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0014524612465382">37</xref></sup> The law in verses 20-21 begins with the assumption of the woman’s innocence, and provides a way for the parents to contest the husband’s slander (vv. 13-19). The prominence and priority of this section of the law can make verses 20-21 little more than a postscript. In fact, Philo does not even consider the possibility that the woman could be guilty (<italic>Spec. Laws</italic> 3.79-82). Likewise, the companion law to Deut. 22:23-24 protects a betrothed woman who is raped in the countryside, away from communal help. In recognition of her inability to defend herself or find help, she is not executed (though her rapist is; vv. 25-27). This law is as absolute as verses 23-24 and thus balances the first case with mercy for a vulnerable woman (cf. vv. 28-29).</p>
<p>The cases described in verses 13-19 and 25-27 do not negate Deut. 22:20-24.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0014524612465382">38</xref></sup> The location of the three laws in which women are executed for sexual transgressions between laws that protect vulnerable women, though, does give interpreters space for reflecting on, questioning, and even tempering the absolutes of Deut. 22:20-24.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0014524612465382">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, in addition to adding emphasis to the serious problem of sexual infidelity, the analogy between the women of Deut. 22:20-24 and foolish, adulterous Israel offers the possibility of forgiveness. Israel’s punishment, which seems so absolute in Deut. 28:15-68 and 32:19-25, is followed by repentance and restoration in 30:1-10 and 32:36, 43 (cf. 4:29-31; Ezek. 16:59-60; Hos. 1-3). While the execution of the women in Deut. 22:2-24 effectively prevents their restoration to their households, the forgiveness of Israel provides an alternative for interpreters to consider.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0014524612465382">
<title>3b. Reading Deut. 22:20-24 with biblical narratives</title>
<p>The Bible includes a number of stories in which women suffer rape or commit adultery. Notably, none of these stories end in the execution of the women involved. The presence of these narratives in the biblical canon balances the laws of Deut. 22:20-24, reminding readers that laws tell what <italic>can</italic> happen—not what <italic>does</italic> happen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0014524612465382">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several stories in Genesis provide narrative examples of the laws of Deut. 22:20-24. The possibility of adultery is at stake in Gen. 20:1-18 (cf. 12:10-20, 26:6-11). When Abraham introduces Sarah as his sister in Gerar, she is taken into the household of the king. Before the king lies with her, though, God warns him in a dream that Sarah is ‘a woman married to a husband’ (לעַ בָּ תלַעֻבְּ; 20:3), language that is elsewhere found only in Deut. 22:22. To have sex with her would be a sin against God which implicates the entire kingdom and results in death (Gen. 20:3-7, 9; cf. 26:10). Of course, Abimelech does not commit adultery with Sarah, and neither he nor Sarah are executed (though note 20:17-18). But particularly in light of the explicit connection with Deut. 22:22, this story provides an example of how a wife might be innocent of wrongdoing even in what would seem to be a clear case of adultery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0014524612465382">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two additional stories in Genesis tell of actual, rather than potential, sexual transgression. In Gen. 34, Dinah, the unmarried daughter of Jacob, ‘goes out’ to the local women (v. 1). While she is there, away from the protection of her household, Shechem sees her, takes her, and lies with her. This act is described with language reminiscent of Deut. 22:20-24: Shechem dishonors Dinah (הנע, Gen. 34:2); he makes her like a prostitute (הנָזֹ in v. 31); he commits a foolish act against Israel (הלָבָנְ in v. 7).</p>
<p>Whether Dinah is a willing participant or a victim of rape is debatable. Her act in going out from her father’s protection, the absence of violent actions from verse 2, and Shechem’s love for her and desire to marry her in verses 3-4 suggest to some interpreters that this is a story of consensual sex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0014524612465382">42</xref></sup> On the other hand, as an unprotected woman Dinah would have been vulnerable to assault in Shechem’s territory, and Dinah’s father and brothers clearly blame the man alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0014524612465382">43</xref></sup> Whether the story represents rape or consensual sex, though, the shared vocabulary of sexual transgression in Gen. 34 and Deut. 22:20-24 suggests that both Dinah and Shechem are guilty and should be punished accordingly. In Genesis, of course, only the man is executed (along with the men of his city). The expectations of Deut. 22:20-24 are not met in this narrative.</p>
<p>In Gen. 38, the widow Tamar, living in her father’s house while she awaits levirate marriage to Judah’s youngest son (v. 11), becomes pregnant. Judah is informed that she has ‘prostituted’ herself (הנז), and as her patriarch-by-marriage, he orders that she be executed by burning (v. 24). The language of prostitution and the references to Tamar’s father’s house link this story to Deut. 22:20-21. Although the connection is complicated by Tamar’s marital status and Judah’s involvement, by the standards set in that law Judah is right in his condemnation.</p>
<p>It is thus significant that the execution is stayed on recognition of the complexity of the situation. The apparently clear-cut case of Tamar’s sexual misconduct is muddied by her revelation of Judah’s role: he is the father of the child (because, ironically, he thought she was a prostitute; Gen. 38:15). The story about a daughter-in-law’s prostitution becomes a story about a daughter-in-law fulfilling her responsibility to provide an heir for her husband.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0014524612465382">44</xref></sup> Judah thus reverses his judgment, declaring Tamar to be more right than himself in the matter (v. 26). Like the stories of Sarah and Dinah, Tamar’s story offers a corrective to the simple scenarios of Deut. 22:20-24.</p>
<p>Moving beyond Genesis, the story of Susanna, one of the additions to the book of Daniel in the Septuagint, hinges on a false accusation of adultery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0014524612465382">45</xref></sup> Two elders in the community lust after Susanna, the wife of Joakim, and they attempt to rape her when she is on her own (Sus. 20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0014524612465382">46</xref></sup> This scene, set in a garden, reflects Deut. 22:25-27, and Susanna does in fact cry out for help (Sus. 22-24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0014524612465382">47</xref></sup> No help comes. Instead, the elders claim that they caught Susanna having sex with an unknown man (Sus. 37-39), and in accordance with Deut. 22:22, Susanna is condemned to death (Sus. 41). Before she can be executed, though, Daniel intervenes and proves the elders to be false witnesses (vv. 45-59), and in the end the elders themselves are executed (cf. Deut. 19:16-20).</p>
<p>By including an official trial with two witnesses, the story of Susanna addresses some of the problems with Deut. 22:22. By presenting the witnesses as false witnesses, however, the story draws attention to the vulnerability of women in the ancient worlds. Susanna’s own words to the elders suggest that a rape victim is guilty of sin: if she has sex with them under duress, she will sin against God and die as an adulterer (Sus. 22-23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0014524612465382">48</xref></sup> The story of Susanna emphasizes the problematic nature of the laws of Deut. 22:20-24 and exemplifies the ways in which the laws could be abused, and in so doing the story complicates the interpretation and application of these laws.</p>
<p>One last story. In Matt. 1:18-19, when Mary is ‘found’ to be pregnant, her betrothed husband decides to divorce her so that she would not be shamed (though in the social world of Roman Palestine, it would be difficult to avoid public shame in this situation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0014524612465382">49</xref></sup>). The reader knows, of course, that Mary is pregnant from the Holy Spirit. For an observer without this privileged information, Mary would be identified as an adulterer (as later traditions like <italic>Protevangelium of James</italic> 14:1 and Origen, <italic>Contra Celsus</italic> 1.28, suggest).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0014524612465382">50</xref></sup> Like the bride and the betrothed woman of Deut. 22:20-21, 23-24, Mary should face execution for her transgression. Instead, like Susanna, Mary is saved by divine intervention. Mary’s story shows yet again the limitations of Deut. 22:20-24.</p>
<p>These stories provide an important interpretive balance for the laws of Deut. 22:20-24. The narratives include the context that the laws leave out: the ambiguities and complexities of life, the fallibility of men, and the agency (or absence of agency) of women. In sharp contrast to Deut. 22:20-24, in none of these narratives are the women executed. The absence of any such story from the biblical canon is a significant witness against the execution of women for sexual transgression.</p>

<title>4. Wives and daughters, sex and execution: An ambiguous conclusion</title>
<p>In Deuteronomy, women have a significant place in the covenant community. They provide their husbands with heirs to carry on his family line and the covenant itself. They also have the power to disrupt the community by challenging the patriarchal authority over them. The three laws of Deut. 22:20-24 require the execution of women who threaten the covenant and the covenant community by engaging in illicit sexual intercourse. Fundamentally, these laws teach their readers that wives and daughters should honor their fathers and husbands by their sexual chastity before and after marriage. Sexual fidelity is key to their role as bearers of Israel’s heirs.</p>
<p>Understanding these laws, though, does not remove their terror for readers, and it is thus important to recognize the factors that mitigate violence against women. First, the three laws of Deut. 22:20-24 are located between laws that protect vulnerable women. Second, the analogy with foolish, adulterous Israel provides the option of forgiveness for foolish, adulterous wives and daughters. Finally, and emphatically, execution is not the only biblical answer to illicit intercourse. The absence of narratives of the execution of women for sexual transgression from the biblical canon is as important as the presence of these three laws; readers of the canon might ask whether the laws of Deut. 22:20-24 were ever put to use. While these factors do not cancel out the laws of Deut. 22, they do create ambiguity which in turn gives readers space for reflection, and options for interpretation.</p>

<title>Weaver Revisits Nonviolent Atonement After Ten Years</title>
<p>J. Denny Weaver, <italic>The Nonviolent Atonement</italic> (2nd ed.; Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2011. $28.00/£18.99. pp. 362, ISBN: 978-0-8028-6437-6).</p>
<p>When the first edition of Weaver’s <italic>Nonviolent Atonement</italic> was published in 2001, it quickly became the most debated Mennonite theological work since John Howard Yoder’s <italic>Politics of Jesus</italic>. In this ‘greatly revised and expanded’ second edition, Weaver responds to his numerous critics and updates the research in order to defend his nonviolent conception of Jesus’ salvific work. The end result is a state of the art treatment of contemporary atonement theologies that considerably strengthens Weaver’s central argument.</p>
<p>That argument is that the three traditional atonement theories identified by Aulén—Christus Victor, satisfaction and moral influence—should be replaced by a ‘theory’ Weaver calls ‘narrative Christus Victor’. Although the name is new, Weaver claims it as a description of the New Testament authors’ basic understanding of Jesus’ work. Furthermore, he declines to call narrative Christus Victor a ‘theory’, an intellectual solution to a logical puzzle, but rather deploys it as a call to discipleship: ‘to accept narrative Christus Victor is to become engaged as a follower of Jesus’ (p. 324).</p>
<p>What separates narrative Christus Victor from theories of the atonement is its origin in the gospel stories. The traditional options, in Weaver’s view, abstract from these stories and speculate needlessly about spiritual battles, legal arrangements, divine honour or the subjective power of suffering love. The gospel narratives, however, depict Jesus as saving humanity through his concrete struggle with the forces of oppression. His death was a result of his refusal to compromise his mission of revealing God’s reign—refusing, preeminently, to take up violence to further his cause. In other words, his death was a by-product, not the purpose, of his mission. In the resurrection, God affirms the integrity of Jesus’ mission and thereby opens the way to salvation for any who would believe in and follow Jesus. In brief, Jesus enables unity with God by showing humans a way to live that coheres with God’s intended cosmic order.</p>
<p>Weaver sees intrinsic connections between the ‘Constantinian’ forsaking of Christian nonviolence for imperial rule, creedal christologies that replace the gospel narratives with metaphysical speculation and medieval atonement theories that envision God as requiring Jesus’ death. Christendom, Weaver maintains, had to repress memories of Jesus’ life in order to create a theological justification for imperialism. Violent atonement sacralises imperial violence by casting it as part of God’s response to sin. By contrast, narrative Christus Victor is a pre- and post-Constantinian theology of atonement that conceives of salvation as ecclesial participation in Jesus’ nonviolent resistance to empire.</p>
<p>In the new edition, Weaver deepens his criticism of Christendom theology by engaging recent works by Joerg Rieger and Rita Nakashima Brock and Rebecca Ann Parker. He also renews his conversation with black, feminist and womanist atonement theologies, which provide him with a broad understanding of the violence of the traditional theories. Although he remains deeply suspicious of Christendom theology, he now clarifies that the doctrine of the Trinity and a high Christology are at the root of his theology (pp. 270-271).</p>
