<p>To address the problem of surface-induced thrombosis and restenosis, an extracellular matrix–like biological membrane was constructed from collagen, heparin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and an anti-CD34 antibody. This membrane was assembled on a titanium surface using a layer-by-layer self-assembly technique and induced the spontaneous endothelialization of synthetic cardiovascular implants <italic>in vivo</italic>. The multilayer growth process was carried out by first depositing a single layer of positively charged poly-<sc>L</sc>-lysine on the negatively charged NaOH-treated titanium substrate. This was followed by alternating depositions of negatively charged heparin, containing vascular endothelial growth factor and an anti-CD34 antibody and positively charged collagen, terminating with an outermost layer of heparin containing vascular endothelial growth factor and the anti-CD34 antibody. The uncoated and coated titanium samples were exposed to platelet-rich plasma and endothelial progenitor cells, respectively, under static and flow conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Then, the samples were implanted into dog femoral arteries. The results suggest that the multilayering process led to reduced platelet adhesion and activation, promoted the attachment and growth of endothelial progenitor cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and induced the rapid and complete endothelialization of the lumenal surface of the implant. Thus, the approach described here may be used in the fabrication of titanium-based vascular implant surfaces to induce endothelialization <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biomaterial-induced thrombosis and restenosis are the primary complications in vascular implant devices, leading to the loss of implant patency. The formation of a layer of endothelial cells (ECs) on the lumenal surface of cardiovascular devices, analogous to the natural lining of blood vessels by ECs, endothelialization, may be a promising solution. There is strong evidence that rapid endothelialization attenuates neointima formation after vascular injury, and the promotion of endothelial recovery is regarded as the next target for restenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512468057">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512468057"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512468057">3</xref></sup> Spontaneous formation of a layer of ECs <italic>in vivo</italic> on synthetic vascular implants has been a target of recent research.</p>
<p>Critical progress toward this goal can be outlined as follows: (1) Biomimetic surfaces can promote endothelialization. One of the important reasons that synthetic, implanted grafts generally do not endothelialize is that these grafts are not biomimetic. Most current synthetic cardiovascular implant materials are designed to maximize bioinertness and lack biomimetic properties, leading to inadequate interaction at the tissue–prosthesis interface. It has been reported that implants coated with collagen (Col),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512468057">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512468057">5</xref></sup> some functional peptides,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512468057">6</xref></sup> and cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) showed better endothelialization than a bare implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512468057">7</xref></sup> (2) It has been confirmed that the cells involved in the endothelialization of the implant’s surface mainly originate from blood endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Typically, ECs endothelializing the implant surface come from host vessel-derived tissue growth across anastomotic sites (pannus ingrowth) or transinterstitial tissue migration (porosity structure implant). Mature ECs are terminally differentiated cells with a limited capacity for proliferation and migration, leading to a limited area of endothelialization of the grafts.</p>
<p>In 1997, Asahara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512468057">8</xref></sup> first reported the isolation of EPCs from human peripheral blood. It has then been shown that circulating EPCs may be recruited and incorporated into traumatized vasculature and play a crucial role in its endothelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512468057">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512468057">10</xref></sup> The hypothesis that deposited cells on an implant’s surface come from the blood dates back to 1963 (called “fallout healing”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512468057">11</xref></sup> In 1998, Hammond et al. first proved that circulating cells with endothelial progenitor status constitute a major source of endothelial fallout.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512468057">12</xref></sup> Based on the idea that EPCs play a crucial role in endothelializing cardiovascular implants, EPCs were targeted to induce rapid spontaneous endothelialization on cardiovascular implant surfaces <italic>in vivo</italic>. Blindt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512468057">13</xref></sup> coated stents with cyclic Arg–Gly–Asp peptides (cRGD), which have a high affinity for EPCs by binding αvβ3 integrin at the EPC membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512468057">13</xref></sup> Their results clearly showed that cRGD supported the outgrowth, recruitment, and migration of EPCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and significantly reduced stenosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Kipshidze and Aoki, et al. designed a novel EPC-capturing stent for rapid stent endothelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512468057">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512468057">14</xref></sup> The surface of a stainless steel stent was covalently coated with murine monoclonal anti-human CD34 antibodies (anti-CD34 Ab) via a coupled polysaccharide intermediate. Anti-CD34 Ab specifically targets CD34-positive (+) cells, which include EPCs by binding the CD34 protein (antigen) to the CD34+ cell’s membrane. In a pig coronary artery implantation study, anti-CD34 Ab-coated stents showed &gt;70% cell surface coverage with EC marker-positive cells 1 h after stent implantation. Bare stainless steel stents showed little to no cell coverage after 1 h.</p>
<p>In the first human clinical investigation, the above-mentioned stent was demonstrated to be safe and feasible. However, neointimal hyperplasia was not significantly reduced in patients with the EPC capture coating stents compared with those with conventional bare metal stents. The authors argued that the EPC capture coating covered only the stent struts, and that, theoretically, an early functional endothelial lining would not be expected in the inter-strut space. Furthermore, the bioactivity of their anti-CD34 Ab coating could have been reduced. In addition to the reasons given by the authors, we hypothesize that captured EPCs may differentiate into smooth muscle cells. Scott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512468057">15</xref></sup> reported that the surface of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) pledget, placed in the aorta of dogs, was covered with ECs, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, monocytes, and capillary-like structures derived from circulating stem cells after 55 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512468057">15</xref></sup> Therefore, we maintain that EPCs should be discouraged from differentiating into smooth muscle cells forming neointimal hyperplasia; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be incorporated into anti-CD34 Ab-containing surfaces to prevent captured EPCs from differentiating into smooth muscle cells. VEGF specifically induces EPCs to differentiate into ECs rather than smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>Titanium (Ti) and its alloys have high biocompatibility and have been previously used in cardiovascular implants such as heart valves, blood pumps, and vascular stents. However, Ti is highly thrombogenic, a property that limits its use. In this study, we describe an optimized modification of a Ti surface for the induction of endothelialization <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, a biomimetic anticoagulant ECM-like biofilm was constructed on the Ti surface. The biofilm was mainly composed of Col, the main component in the ECM, and heparin (Hep), a glycosaminoglycan in the ECM. Col is expected to promote endothelialization of the implant surface, while Hep is expected to act as an anticoagulant prior to endothelialization. The surface’s anticoagulation properties are believed to be a very important part of the biomimetic surface design. Without this feature, blood clots may interfere with the endothelialization process. Second, a biospecificity marker was incorporated into the film to recognize and capture blood EPCs at the material’s surface. Anti-CD34 Ab was selected as the marker. It was expected to bind to membrane-bound CD34 proteins of EPCs by antigen–antibody (Ab) binding and to capture EPCs from the peripheral blood. Third, VEGF, which induces the differentiation of EPCs to ECs, was included in the membrane. This ECM-like coating is expected to accelerate the endothelialization of Ti cardiovascular implants <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Preparation of titanium surface with NaOH</title>
<p>Titanium (Ti) samples (5 × 5 × 2 mm, or 10-mm-diameter disks) were polished to a reflective mirror-like finish. The specimens were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in a detergent solution, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water and then dried at 60°C. The cleaned specimens were soaked in a 5 M NaOH solution at 60°C for 24 h, followed by soaking in deionized water at 80°C for 24 h. The specimens were removed and extensively ultrasonicated in deionized water. After drying at 60°C, the specimens were treated by ultraviolet (UV) ozone cleaning for 30 min. Specimen surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; QUANTA 200; FTI, Holland), diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DR-FTIR; IR 550; Nicolet, Madison, WI, USA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; XSAM800; KRATOS, England), and atomic force microscopy (AFM; SPI3800N; Seiko, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section6-0883911512468057">
<title>Preparation of multilayers on the surface of NaOH-treated titanium</title>
<p>Col was dissolved in 0.5 M acetic acid with a final concentration of 2.0 mg/mL. A 5 mg/mL Hep solution containing 0.01 mg/mL anti-CD34 Ab and 200 ng/mL VEGF was prepared by dissolving the reagents in deionized water. The pH value was adjusted to approximately 4 with 1% (V/V) acetic acid solution and 0.1 M NaOH. A 2.5 mg/mL PLL solution was prepared by dissolving the reagent in phosphate buffer solution (PBS; pH = 7.4).</p>
<p>The NaOH-treated samples had a net negative charge at a physiological pH, so they were immersed in PLL solution for 30 min to adsorb the polycations. The layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly process was initiated from the positively charged PLL percursor layer. The multilayer construction sequence is given in the following. The PLL primed titanium substrates (Ti/PLL) were immersed in Hep solution for 15 min, which changed the surface charge to a net negative charge. Samples were rinsed twice in deionized water for 1 min and dried with a stream of nitrogen. Then, the samples were exposed to the positively charged Col solution for 15 min, thus generating a positive net surface charge. The samples were rinsed and dried, and the cycle was repeated n times to obtain the desired film, with the outermost terminal layer being a layer of Hep. The samples were denoted as Ti/PLL/(Hep/Col)<sub>n</sub>/Hep. Based on SEM observations, the number of cycles (n) was chosen so that a smooth and fully covered surface was obtained. After the final assembly cycle, the samples were thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried with a stream of nitrogen.</p>
<p>The multilayer was characterized by DR-FTIR, SEM, AFM, and static contact angle (DSA100; RÜSS, Germany). The multilayer mass was measured by electronic analytical and semi-microbalances with an accuracy of 0.001 mg (Sartorius ME-5; Sartorius, Germany). The film thickness was measured by an XP stylus profiler (Ambios Technology, Inc., USA). The presence of CD34 Ab was confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay, as described in section “Immunofluorescence staining assay.”</p>

<p>The Ti test samples were fabricated as oval disks (6 × 4 mm diameter × 0.5 mm thick) with some degree of arch to attach to the vessel wall. Pure titanium was used as control to the multilayer-coated titanium samples. Six adult mongrel dogs (15−20 kg) were purchased from the Central Laboratory of Animals, affiliated with Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). The animals were anesthetized and maintained using intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The Ti specimens were implanted into the femoral artery and fixed to the intima surface using standard aseptic surgical techniques. Each femoral artery received two Ti pieces, mesialy and distally. After the surgical implantation, no anticoagulant was administered to the dogs. The specimens were removed 2 h, 15 days, or 90 days after the implantation. At retrieval, the implants were carefully removed, washed with PBS, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde solution, dehydrated with ethanol, and critical point dried. They were sputter coated with gold and examined using SEM.

<title>Immunofluorescence staining assay</title>
<p>Adherent cells or platelets on uncoated and coated Ti were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and rinsed with PBS (5 min × 3 times).

For the CD34, P-selectin, and VEGFR-2 stain, the permeabilization step with Triton-X100 was not needed. A total of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added and incubated with the adhered cells for 1 h at 37°C to block the nonspecific binding sites. The primary antibodies of anti-actin, anti-CD34, anti-P-selectin, and VEGFR-2 in 1% BSA/PBS were added and incubated for 40 min at RT and rinsed with PBS buffer. Fluorescein-6-isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated secondary antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS were added, incubated for 40 min at RT, and rinsed as described earlier. Stained cells were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Leika Microsystem Wetziar GmbH, Germany).</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The LbL self-assembly method for biofilm construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512468057">Diagram 1</xref>) was selected for the following reasons: (1) The LbL method is based on the consecutive adsorption of polyanions and polycations via electrostatic interaction on a charged substrate. This permits the preparation of polyelectrolyte complex films with very versatile structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512468057">19</xref></sup> Many biological activities, such as gene signal transportation, enzyme activity, and antigen–Ab bonding, are associated with polyelectrolyte complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Many cell components and ECM proteins, such as polysaccharides, duplex DNA, and cytoskeleton proteins, exist as polyelectrolyte complexes. (2) The conditions for the formation of polyelectrolyte complex multilayers are easily replicated, denaturation of the biological molecular structure is difficult, and biological activity is likely to be retained. (3) Polyelectrolyte complex hydrogels have already shown great efficiency as a carrier in drug delivery. Therefore, it was expected that the Col–Hep multilayer prepared here would release VEGF effectively. (4) No covalent graft technique was used to immobilize biologic molecules, as grafting VEGF covalently to the prosthesis surface may influence its function. VEGF naturally binds to other biological molecules through electrostatic interactions. VEGF’s action requires it to bind and activate transmembrane receptors and then internalize them within the cell,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512468057">20</xref></sup> which must be taken into account when immobilizing VEGF onto a self-endothelializable vascular implant surface. In other words, binding must proceed through noncovalent bonding. Our method of loading VEGF by LbL is in accordance with this growth factor’s natural interaction with other molecules in the physiological environment. (5) Hep has a strong affinity to VEGF.</p>

<p>During the preparation of the multilayers on the titanium surface, the titanium substrate was initially treated with NaOH solution to achieve a surface with a large number of hydroxyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512468057">Figure 1(b)</xref>), excellent hydrophilicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512468057">Figure 5</xref>), and micron and submicrometer porous morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512468057">Figure 2(b)</xref>). Increasing the concentration of −OH groups on the oxide surface prepared the surface to bind directly to biomolecules. Proteins can be bound to the titanium surfaces via hydrogen bonds with the surface hydroxyl groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911512468057">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911512468057">22</xref></sup> However, the higher surface energy, hydrophilicity, submicron and micron porous morphology, and net negative surface charge at physiological pH also facilitated the adsorption of positively charged proteins. Thus, a precursor layer with a stable positive charge was obtained with PLL (a point of zero charge at pKa = 10.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512468057">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The biofilm was constructed by alternating the adsorption of polyanionic Hep containing anti-CD34 Ab and VEGF and polycationic Col. The last layer was a Hep layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512468057">Diagram 1</xref>). The electrostatic attraction between the (NH<sub>3</sub>)<sup>+</sup> groups of Col and the (OSO<sub>3</sub>)<sup>−</sup> and (COO)<sup>−</sup> groups of Hep is the main chemical interaction leading to the LbL assembly. In preparing the multilayers, Col carried a positive charge (the zeta potential, ζ = +33.3 mV, was determined by zeta-potential measurement under experimental conditions). The Hep layer carried a negative charge (ζ = −27 mV). The concentration of CD34 Ab and VEGF was very small, so the contribution of their charges to the multilayer is also very small.</p>

<p>The number of adsorption cycles of Col and Hep was based on SEM observations and set to achieve a smooth, fully coated surface. The smooth surface is very important to reduce platelet adhesion to the vascular implant. Approximately 17 cycles of adsorption of Col and Hep were needed to ensure that the Ti surface was fully covered by the coatings. The mass of the biofilm was 28.9 ± 5.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> and its thickness was approximately 2.0 µm.</p>
<p>The anticoagulant activity of the multilayer was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> by platelet adhesion, APTT and PT tests. The multilayer-processed surfaces displayed reduced platelet adhesion and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512468057">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512468057">7</xref>) and prolonged clotting time in APTT and PT tests compared to untreated Ti (mean increase, 134 s vs 44 s for APTT, and 34 s vs 17 s for PT).</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0883911512468057-fig7.tif"/></fig>
<p>The fact that the coated surface-inhibited platelet adhesion and activation is mainly attributed to Hep’s enhancement of antithrombin III (AT III) activation. AT III inhibits thrombin and polyfibrinogen formation. Thrombin is the most potent platelet activator, and polyfibrinogen can bind to glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors on platelet membranes and activated platelets. Thus, lesser the thrombin and polyfibrinogen that form, fewer the platelets that adhere and activate. In contrast, the hydrophilic, mirror-like surface and hydrophilic polymer hydrogel multilayer coating also contribute to the limited platelet adhesion. AT III inhibits Xa, IXa, XIa, XIIa, and IIa formation, which interfere with the coagulation pathway. Thus, the coated Ti prolongs the clotting time in the APTT and PT tests.</p>
<p>After the EPCs were cocultured with the experimental materials for 5 days under static conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>, the multilayer-coated Ti promoted greater EPC proliferation than the untreated Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911512468057">Figure 8</xref>). With the exception of the reason discussed earlier, VEGF contributed to the rapid growth of EPCs on coated Ti. This is likely because VEGF is a strong mitogen of EPCs to promote EPC proliferation.</p>

<p>Showing that coated Ti has the ability to capture EPCs is a key result of this study. There were significantly more adherent EPCs on the multilayer-coated Ti than on the uncoated Ti (after the EPC suspension was perfused to the flow chamber at a shear rate of 1.0 Pa for 4 h <italic>in vitro</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0883911512468057">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, after the samples were implanted in dog femoral arteries for 2 h <italic>in vivo</italic>, many EPCs were deposited on the surface of the coated Ti sample, but little thrombus formation was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512468057">Figure 10(c)</xref>). Conversely, large thrombi formed on the surface of the untreated Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512468057">Figure 10(a)</xref>). The adhered cells were identified with the EPCs/ECs marker VEGFR-2. As shown by the immunofluorescence assay results, the adhered cells on the coated Ti were almost always positive, whereas few cells were positive on the bare Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512468057">Figure 10(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512468057">(d)</xref>). These results demonstrate that the coated surface could specifically capture EPCs from the circulating blood. Furthermore, we emphasize that the anticoagulant property of the biofilm is very important for inducing endothelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512468057">23</xref></sup> This is because blood clots form very fast, and a thrombus deposited on the material surface will inhibit the endothelialization process by interfering with the properties of the surface.</p>

<p>We hypothesize that the following reasons contribute to the bioaffiliation of coated Ti to EPCs: first, nonspecific attachment between the EPCs and the coating; ECM-like coatings resemble natural ECM with self-assembled hydrogels composed of Col, proteoglycans, and cell growth factors; these show excellent affiliation with EPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911512468057">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512468057"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512468057">26</xref></sup> and second, is the biospecific recognition between the CD34 antigen on the EPCs’ membrane and anti-CD34 antibodies on the coating film; the key problem regarding the incorporation of antibodies into binding materials is how to maintain the activity of the Ab by exposing its antigen-binding site. There are two strategies to immobilize an Ab on the material surface: the antigen-binding site is a random array on the surface and the antigen-binding site is oriented away from the surface. Because of steric hindrance, the random immobilizing Ab generally denatures the majority of the Ab, whether the Ab is noncovalently adsorbed or covalently coupled on the surface. Butler et al. have reported that more than 90% of monoclonal and 75% of polyclonal antifluorescyl capture antibodies (CAbs) were denatured by passive adsorption in the immunochemistry sandwich of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911512468057">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911512468057">28</xref></sup> This theoretical analysis is based on antigen–Ab molecular binding (protein–protein binding), but for binding to cells, the effect of steric hindrance may be very different. It is assumed that each Ab molecule has a 104 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512468057">2</xref></sup> footprint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911512468057">29</xref></sup> but an EPC is approximately 10–15 µm. Thus, the residually active Ab may be efficiently bound to the cells. In the current experiment, anti-CD34 Ab is immobilized on the coating by static charge adsorption, a random procedure, but the results still showed an efficient effect in capturing EPCs. An immunomagnetic cell sorting system is known to be efficient in separating cells, but in this system, the Ab is also randomly immobilized to magnetic beads. Ko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512468057">30</xref></sup> randomly immobilized a mark of lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (a membrane Ab) onto a cellulose membrane to directly bind to the cells. Their results showed that this method was also effective.</p>
<p>After 15 days of <italic>in vivo</italic> implantation, the coated sample had an arranged layer of cells growing in the direction of blood flow covering the entire lumenal surface, except for the suture holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0883911512468057">Figure 11</xref>). After 3 months, the cell layer on coated Ti was more mature and similar to the intima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0883911512468057">Figure 12</xref>). However, further cell identification is needed to evaluate the presence of ECs on the surface of these implants. Conversely, after 2 weeks of implantation, the uncoated Ti surface was fully covered with thrombi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0883911512468057">Figure 11</xref>). The levels of thrombi were higher and denser compared to the 2 h samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512468057">Figure 10</xref>). At 3 months, thrombi occluded almost the entire lumen. Large hyperplastic fibrins had accumulated and orientated with the direction of blood flow, and the surface of the fresh thrombus was filled with random fibrins and platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0883911512468057">Figure 12</xref>).</p>
