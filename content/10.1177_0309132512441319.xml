<p>Reference to something ‘African’ conjures up images of people of African origin and their continent that are integral to the whole project of inventing Africa. Unlike other continents, constructions of Africa did not only simplify cultural complexities but were also founded on an external order conveying western traditions, values and systems of thought. These constructions accentuate difference, and thereby deny the continent and its citizens the same place as that of other civilized nations of the world. Visions of Africa and its people permeate scholarly writings and continue to influence perspectives on, and interpretations of cities in Africa. In urban studies ‘it is still generally the case that cities in Africa are ignored, banished to a different, other, lesser category of not-quite cities, or held up as an example of all that can go wrong with urbanism’ (pp. 3–4). Garth Myers engages these imageries of African cities with the goal of challenging prevailing theories and models of urban geography. His immediate objectives are to weave African urban concepts and experiences into theoretical and practical concerns in urban studies and to free African cities from western metrics and models used to measure them. His argument, which I find compelling, is that the multiplicity of urbanity in African contexts and the stories African cities offer enhance our understanding of urbanism and African studies. The central and critical question <italic>African Cities</italic> raises is: ‘can we start from a city like Lusaka to offer themes that resonate in other cities in Africa, and potentially other cities in the world?’ (p. 42). Myers uses this question as an attempt to de-centre reference points in urban studies. In order to place African cities at the centre of urban studies he first confronts the familiar challenge of variations in Africa and its cities. He acknowledges that African cities differ from one another in patterns, processes, forms and functions. Myers suggests that these cities could, despite their variations, be properly theorized by engaging cross-cutting themes that constitute a unified totality. Such themes can be extracted and aggregated from conceptions of the city by scholars, politicians, artists, planners, engineers, ordinary citizens and so on. For Myers, common themes in African cities are postcolonialism, informality, governance, violence and cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p>Taking postcolonialism as a continuation of the past in the present, Myers argues that aspects of colonial relations persist in African cities, and that colonial tactics are replicated by post-independence governments. For example, Abuja (Nigeria) replicated ‘spatial-ideological features of colonialism’ (p. 62) while most of the cities in the continent are characterized by the disconnection of urban growth from organic economic development processes. Even African cities such as Dodoma that were created from scratch by post-independence governments suffer from the same disconnect. Notwithstanding its colonial features, the postcolonial city in Africa is shaped by local activist organizations and other non-state actors who challenge the orderliness imposed by state planning. The poverty that characterizes informal settlements limits the capacity of these settlements ‘to give birth to a genuinely workable or reproducible postcolonial alternative to the model capital’ (p. 61). Informal settlements also constitute the ‘real city’ in Africa as the majority of urban dwellers live in informal housing where government rules for land and housing development are challenged or often ignored. The informality of African cities is a product of complex processes and histories and is also bound up with the exercise of formal instruments. Myers is of the view that, historically, many African urban areas grew informally and were governed by informal institutions and rules. Colonialism had a role in the creation of informal settlement and, in some instances, state agencies and formal institutions acted in ways that produced informality.</p>
<p>The informality of African cities poses serious challenges to ideas of urban governance. Myers observes that ‘poverty, inequality, and injustice are inseparable in African cities, and thus so would be any governance reforms that would proffer solutions to them’ (p. 126). Thus, urban governance in these cities should incorporate a developmental agenda that is simultaneously attentive to service delivery and socio-environmental justice. Government urban programmes and policies should be embedded in existing cultures and modes of life, and should give voice to the poor. Informality opens up possibilities for understanding how African cities were ‘wounded’ during struggles for independence and how violence persists in the form of crime, injustice and displacement. Relying on Soja’s insights, Myers argues that these wounded cities ‘might be constructive of alternative modes of seeing cities’ (p. 140) and are also ‘a locus of passion, of action, of lived situations’ (p. 153). These cities are connected to the rest of the world and their citizens have roots and lifestyles that go beyond the borders of their state.</p>
<p>
<italic>African Cities</italic> offers a compelling Afro-centric argument for a revision of how cities in Africa should be discussed and written about in urban and African studies. Myers’ attempt to develop cross-cutting themes for African cities is an important step towards a useful theorization of African issues. The challenge, though, is to lift these themes beyond descriptive analyses which tend to paint a new picture of Africa that remains disconnected from what is going on in the rest of the world. While Myers has done a great job in inviting us to think about the ‘logics’ by which African cities and the everyday life in those cities are organized, these logics are not fully explained and the cross-cutting themes tend to be inward-looking. Chapter 5 exemplifies this missed opportunity more clearly. The chapter consists of a mixture of US foreign policy in Somalia as dramatized by the Black Hawk Down; western representations of the city and its people; and the lived spaces of Mogadishu as seen through the novels of Nuruddin Farah. The connection between Mogadishu and other cities in the continent and elsewhere is lost in the process of reviewing Farah’s novels. This blemish aside, Myers offers a new avenue for understanding the world and its future through the lens of Africa, and for advancing the link between urban theory and practice.</p>
