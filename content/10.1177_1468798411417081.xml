<abstract>
<p>This article examines how a second-grader demonstrates that reading is not about decoding letters and words in linear order but is a more complex activity involving the reader's decisions with respect to several aspects of their knowledge of their language and how comprehension is key to transacting with texts. The paper observes and documents the reader's reading comprehension process using eye-movement and miscue analysis (EMMA). EMMA data illuminate this reader's strengths as a reader while also demystifying misconceptions about the reading process, thus challenging the politicized phonics-first perspective found in many English-speaking countries regarding how reading is being assessed and taught.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468798411417081" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A reader spends 13 seconds on vocalizing the first two words of the second sentence of a story she is attempting to read, 22 seconds if you add the subsequent time she is silent. If one simply listens to this reader, Ali, one could think she has a reading problem. Some hear her difficulty and believe she needs more extensive instruction in sound-symbol relationships.</p>
<p>However, Ali's oral reading miscues from this sentence, together with the added information from her eye movements, present a different picture. Eye-movement data reveal why a transactive view of reading is needed and what ‘correct-the-reader’ practice fails to recognize. Although a focus on letter-sound relationships may appear obvious to an unquestioning adult, which has led to the persistence of the belief that reading problems may be solved by ‘sounding out’ letters, this is a misleading assumption in English.</p>
<p>Literacy education in the USA, as well as in other countries, is in need of critical, theoretical and practical knowledge to support educators in resisting legislative mandates that require prescriptive myopically-designed programmes. Pre-service and in-service teachers often have unexamined prejudicial assumptions about readers and the reading process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411417081">Cole, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411417081">Garan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411417081">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Many of these assumptions, that reading is decoding symbols, that it is strictly sequential, are spread through public media-reported ‘common sense’ notions about reading instruction. Legislation comes to rely on research that is questionably interpreted, although loudly proclaimed as ‘scientific’, and limits reading to being a mechanical process and hence readers to a set of unreflective and uncritical behavioural responses.</p>
<p>In the face of the US propensity to opt for reductionistic and logistically expedient denotations of reading and to glean simplistic ‘accountability’ attributes from such complex events, eye-movement and miscue analysis (EMMA; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411417081">Duckett, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411417081">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411417081">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468798411417081">Paulson, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411417081">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411417081">Paulson et al., 2003</xref>) researchers have sought to deepen their understanding of what readers do. The use of miscue analysis has contributed much to this interest. Miscues are any unexpected renderings a reader makes with respect to a given text. These are recorded, not to be judged as mistakes but to be analysed as information that shows patterns in a reader's activity.</p>
<p>The basic procedure is to present a reader with a complete text that is new to them and ask the reader to read aloud as if they were reading by themselves, and then to retell after reading. Departures from an expected (accurate) rendering of a text are neither good nor bad in themselves. They do however provide information about how a reader is working with a text, insight into a reader's understanding of the text, and help reveal strategies the reader is using (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411417081">Davenport, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411417081">Goodman et al., 2005</xref>). A substitution miscue is an example of a miscue category, when a reader replaces one word for another. It may be a word that is graphically similar but unrelated in meaning (revealing a focus on phonics); or, it may be a synonym (revealing a focus on meaning), or even a repeated non-word that may be used as a temporary placeholder (as meaning is being formed). The quality of a miscue, which reflects information about the reader generating it, is significant in miscue research. By examining readers’ departures from a given text, miscue analysis has found proficient readers to be comprehension focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411417081">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411417081">Strauss et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past decade, researchers have begun to use miscue analysis and eye-movement data in tandem as a research perspective. EMMA researchers have worked with scores of readers from many age groups. This has involved readers reading a variety of genres and has investigated the reading in a multitude of different languages. EMMA research adds to almost a half century of research utilizing oral reading miscue analysis as a procedure for understanding readers.</p>
<p>For the reader we discuss here, the eye-movement data were acquired using eye-tracking equipment from Applied Science Laboratory (ASL). This includes a camera that records an infrared light reflected from a reader's eye and a unit that calculates the location of the eye with respect to reading material presented on a computer screen. A video recording is made during the reading to provide a real-time relationship between the movement of the eye (represented by an active cursor moving over the image of the text) and the voice of the reader. It is the video recording we share with pre- and in-service teachers. Using ASL software, the eye-movement data are processed, thus rendering eye movements as a series of fixations and saccades. For the purpose of this paper we also provide processed data from the sentence discussed. The reading example we present was obtained at the EMMA laboratory at the University of Arizona, Tucson. A miscue coding and eye-movement analysis of one sentence introduces Ali as a reader. The implications of Ali's oral reading, her eye-movement data and responses from pre- and in-service teachers will be discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468798411417081"><title>Ali and her reading</title>
<p>Ali is a bright monolingual second-grader with light reddish hair. She is softly spoken and has demonstrated an interest and ability in art. Her school has adopted a major phonics-based reading programme. Concern over her poor scores in tests of phonics skills led her parents to purchase phonics reading products for their home in the hope of helping Ali with her reading. Her father, a university scientist, became puzzled by the limited nature of the materials they purchased and brought Ali to the reading laboratory to see if a more understandable reason for her problem could be found. In the lab, we recorded her oral reading and eye movements with respect to the text she read.</p>
<p>Ali sits in front of the computer to read <italic>The Man Who Kept House</italic>, a folk tale about a woodcutter who believes his wife's work at home is easy. The man switches places with his wife with predictably catastrophic results. For Ali's reading we follow the protocols of miscue analysis, as mentioned: Ali reads a complete story she has not read before, she reads without interference, probes or outside help, and she is asked to retell what she reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411417081">Goodman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468798411417081"><title>What a teacher hears: The sounds of Ali's miscues</title>
<p>In apparent recognition of a major difficulty, as Ali begins the second sentence in the story she produces the first of three miscues that will be discussed. Her reading is as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411417081">Figure 1</xref>, with coding for the second sentence).
<fig id="fig1-1468798411417081" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Ali's miscues as she reads the second sentence of <italic>The Man Who Kept House</italic> Note: Underlining indicates words included in her miscue. Above-line text is a representation of her oral miscues. The circled ‘c’ indicates self-correction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411417081-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>When Ali comes to the first two words of the second sentence, ‘One evening … ’, she begins to stumble. Her oral miscues for the second sentence are shown as follows:</p>
<p>Ali: ‘On every – one – every, when e-, one-every-t-, e(h)ery-(th)ing, every-(h)in’, at which point she becomes silent for nine seconds. Later in the text, she substitutes ‘does' for ‘do’. And in the last part of the text, she says ‘I'm’ for ‘I am’. All of these, she self-corrects during her oral reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468798411417081"><title>‘One evening … ’: Ali's first miscue</title>
<p>Ali miscues the first word of the second sentence of the story, and at the second word, ‘evening’, she appears to rethink her reading. She self-corrects ‘on’ to ‘one’ and yet remains stuck on ‘evening’. She then abandons her correction and tries something else, testing the word ‘when’, but returns to ‘one’ after a single substitution proves ineffective. She applies a phonics strategy in earnest, but without success. The process she is using can be discerned by listening to how she manipulates the graphophonic or letter-sound system, for example ‘on’ and ‘one’, and her attempt with a similarly sounding word, ‘when’. In listening to her, it can be seen that she has two choices: focus more directly on the letters, or continue reading. For 13 seconds she focuses on letters, but this does not provide her with access to acceptable language. So she becomes silent.</p>
<p>When this oral reading sample is presented to and discussed by in-service and pre-service teachers, this miscue is commonly a major focus of discussion. The types of questions presented are: ‘What kind of reader is Ali?’, ‘What, if anything, does she need to know or do to understand the text?’. Invariably, several in the room point out that Ali is indeed in trouble and not attending closely enough to the text: ‘She relies on sounding out and she … cannot read the word.’, ‘She seems like an extremely struggling reader because she keeps repeating the same things over and over again.’, ‘She wasn't really reading’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468798411417081"><title>Comprehension: Listener and reader</title>
<p>To anyone who understands the words it may appear obvious that she is skipping the letter ‘n’ in ‘evening’<italic>.</italic> Hearing her attempts to break down the words into sounds, to formulate and test her own versions, it appears that a more direct focus on the letters might help. There is no ‘r’ or ‘th’ in ‘evening’ for example. Ali herself seems to support this assessment by changing letters so much that her reading sounds confused. Her variance of letters and sounds may also show that she is experimenting, seeking to find potential words that might be sensible in the text. But listeners are more inclined to affirm that Ali's vocalized attempts show she is not attending to what seems obvious to them. Readily knowing, they think, what Ali appears to miss, they prescribe increased attention to phonics, to the ‘sounding out’ of letters and, on occasion, even derive from Ali's reading of these two words several phonics-based rules and axioms to suggest. Hearing only her stumbling at the beginning of the second sentence, Ali is seen as a deficient reader, not a learning one. Commenting on her silence, they often believe she is simply staring at the words because she possesses insufficient phonics skills to decipher them, or has simply quit and is waiting for outside help. This puts aside the more complex comprehension questions: ‘What could she say?’, ‘What would make sense?’. Is this reader lost, or is she actively involved in testing potential solutions using the information given, working with what she tacitly knows about her language to reach meaning?</p>
<p>If Ali's activity is seen as meaning-making, as her very recognition that ‘On every’ is insufficient suggests, this would question whether added attention to a graphophonics (letter-sound) regimen is instructionally productive. Her problem is not that she is aware that she does not know particular letter-sound relationships, her problem is that what she is saying is not fitting her expectations for language. Even if she were focusing at word level, she could have settled for ‘on every’ as real words and gone on. Indeed, she may have no trouble with these words in other contexts. Although ‘evening’ does not occur again in this story, as a word ‘one’ occurs four times. In the previous sentence Ali renders it correctly. In the sentence under discussion she both corrects and abandons her correction. Later, she renders it correctly, and in the last instance acceptably substitutes ‘the’ for ‘one’ in the sentence: ‘So he put one end of a rope …’. Something other than word recognition or letter-sound knowledge must be involved. To add to the time spent on one particular aspect of a text that is not making sense can disrupt the meaning a reader is constructing; she could become distracted by an expectation of meaning.</p>
<p>For meaning-oriented readers, however, as they become further involved in a text their miscues change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417081">Menosky, 1971</xref>). The first few miscues may not show a significant degree of concern for meaning. As context develops, the broadening meaning begins to inform the reader regarding semantically acceptable language, the quality of the miscues changes, and a degree of concern for meaning may become clear. For example, in the first sentence, Ali made two miscues, substituting the word ‘woman’ for ‘woodman’ and ‘on’ for ‘no’, and left these unchanged. If Ali were merely sounding out or word calling for the sake of speed or ‘fluency’, the semantically unacceptable substitutions would continue. Her silence could actually mean that she has disengaged from the text. It may be, however, that she is searching for more information, in thought or, as her eye movements reveal, actively seeking information elsewhere on the page. For Ali, in the second sentence, she begins to reveal her concern for meaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468798411417081"><title>What Ali's eyes see</title>
<p>Ali's eye movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411417081">Figure 2</xref>) show how she resolves her quandary and affirm that her successful strategy is to focus on comprehension rather than on letters and sounds. Her demand for sense overpowers puzzling over sounds. We told her to read the text as if she were by herself, to read as she usually reads. She took her time, although clearly her persistence in, and strategy for, seeking comprehensible language would not produce strong scores on a ‘timed test’ or be found in a phonics drill classroom experience.
<fig id="fig2-1468798411417081" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Ali's repeated attempts represented by multiple fixations over the words ‘One evening’ (numbered eye fixations 71–87) and her silent look ahead (fixations 87–95) Note: Circles represent points at which Ali's eyes fixate upon the text. A fixation is when the eyes stop and information to approximately 1–2° and, depending on font size and distance from the reader, a three- to six-letter width area may be clearly in focus. The lines between fixations are saccades, during which the eyes are moving and no text information is perceived.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411417081-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411417081">Figure 2</xref> represents both Ali's voiced attempts at ‘One evening’ and her eye movements during her silence. As she vocalizes her multiple attempts of ‘One evening’ her eyes hover over those words of the text (fixations 71–87). The large collection of her eye fixations appears as the mass of overlaid circles and numbers at the left. Then, as she becomes silent, her eyes proceed across the sentence (fixations 87–95). After fixation 95, she returns to the beginning of the sentence to read aloud again, at which point she confidently produces ‘One evening when he came home from work …’. Using information she gained during her silence, from the sentence she is reading, she self-corrects.</p>
<p>Ali goes to great length, 22 seconds, in her search for language that works. From a phonics perspective it is clear that, in the beginning, she is not in sync with the text, although at one point or another the letter-sound artefacts are present. And although hearing Ali's initial misrepresentations of words may elicit correction responses from some listeners, correction is unnecessary. The activity of the reader is far more sophisticated and self-managed. Her effort and resolution demonstrate that she is aware that her first renditions are not acceptable, that she is making decisions about her strategy use, and has concern for finding meaning in what she is reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468798411417081"><title>Is there knowledge underlying Ali's first miscue?</title>
<p>Both the first and second sentences are shown with Ali's miscues in the second sentence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411417081">Figure 1</xref>). Consider the opening sentence: ‘Once upon a time there was a woodman who thought that no one worked as hard as he did.’ If this thought were continued, one could next expect something like, ‘On every job …’ or ‘On everything he worked …’. These are potential routes for the author of the story and possible structures that Ali may have expected or been testing. The thought could have been that everything the woodman did was harder than anything anyone else did.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second sentence begins a slightly divergent thought, some would argue a new paragraph, sounding almost like the beginning of a new story, ‘One evening …’ which is so akin to ‘[Late] one evening …’. As mentioned, she may know these words in other contexts, hence more context in the text may have helped: ‘Then, one evening, …’. Or, there could have been a comma after ‘evening’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411417081">Fries (2008)</xref> points out, specific words are influenced by the contexts in which they are used. As contexts vary for any word, that word may become a significantly different word. At the least, there are potential structures that Ali may be considering, her miscues triggered by inadequacies in the text itself. When Ali realizes that the text is not matching her expectations, she experiments to try to reach what she can sense to be a meaningful sentence. Her miscues may reflect her attempts to realize potential contexts she is positing as solutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468798411417081"><title>What of Ali's silence?</title>
<p>After her manipulations of the text, Ali becomes silent for nine seconds. It is because of her silence that many in an instructional position believe that Ali is lost and requires help. Historically, research and evaluation procedures have often allowed only five seconds before the researcher or scripted instructor checks a word as unknown, or simply provides a word to a reader. Long pauses during oral reading have traditionally meant that children are not on task or, at the least, that they have run out of options and are doing nothing. Ali, however, spends her silent time actively extending her search of the text for more information.</p>
<p>We offered Ali no interruption. We did not point to the words, nor ask her to re-read any of the text. Ali's resolution is spontaneous, completely in line with her own abilities and needs. Also, she uses a look-ahead strategy, as seen by many reading researchers who have examined reading and eye-movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411417081">Buswell, 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411417081">Duckett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411417081">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411417081">Paulson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411417081">Paulson and Freeman, 2003</xref>). As she proceeded, she notably set aside her experience with phonics-based instruction.</p>
<p>In summary, Ali's eye movements show her to be working to resolve her problem with the beginning words of the sentence, first, by testing her graphophonic knowledge, and then by going beyond the words ‘One evening’. As she goes silent, providing no vocal or visual information to an observer, her eyes proceed forward across the sentence, after which she returns to the beginning of the sentence to vocalize her self-revision, the conventional text. Even using 22 seconds, she does not spend so much time that, for her, the maintenance of comprehension suffers, and she does return to the text to produce it conventionally. As her first miscue's self-correction indicates, she is a self-managed reader. Similarly with her second.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468798411417081"><title>A further sleight of Ali's eye: Her second miscue</title>
<p>Consider Ali's second miscue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411417081">Figure 1</xref>). As Ali reads on, a similar expression of her reading occurs in an instant as she reads ‘What does’ and self-corrects to ‘What do’.</p>
<p>To a listener, Ali's second miscue may at first appear to be simple. She substitutes ‘does' for ‘do’. And, again, she self-corrects, this time relatively quickly, to produce the text conventionally. Her own analysis does not seem as involved as with the previous miscue; it is, however, as obscure to listeners. Also, her eye movements respective to her voice reveal the same concern as before: English she can accept. A listener who hears her saying ‘What does – What do …’ may easily consider that Ali's self-correction is based on her looking more closely at the text. Having said ‘does’, she sees the text in the moment, focuses in, and suddenly realizes that it is not ‘does’, and therefore self-corrects. However, the interaction between Ali and the text is less simple. In this instance, as Ali completes her voicing of ‘does’, the video recording shows her eyes are on the following line, on the word ‘you’. Her eyes are on ‘you’ a full second <italic>before</italic> she voices her self-correction. ‘What does’, an acceptable prediction, becomes unacceptable as she progresses through the text. ‘Does’ is a prediction. She does not say ‘doe’ (phonic correlate of ‘go’, ‘so’) nor stall at other possible sounds for ‘o’. ‘What does’ begins a viable sentence since both ‘does’ and ‘do’ are auxiliary verbs. She uses a word that is acceptable and meaningful to that point in the sentence. Only after seeing ‘you’ does she return to begin the sentence again. It is not within her dialect to say ‘What does you …’. Such a sentence is syntactically and semantically unacceptable to her. According to Ali's eye-movement data, by fixating on ‘you’, not continuing to fixate on ‘do’, Ali shows she does not need to look more closely at ‘do’ to see that it was not ‘does’. It is when she fixates on ‘you’ that she realizes ‘What do’ is the grammatically acceptable form.</p>
<p>While her earlier silent looking ahead with ‘One evening’ might yet be argued to be an extension of simply decoding more information, Ali's self-correction here is clearly one of her changing her prediction of ‘does’ because it is constrained when followed by ‘you’. Just as her self-correcting ‘One evening’ required more context, not more attention to letter sounds in the words, her self-correction is again prompted by reading ahead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411417081">Figure 3</xref>), gaining more information from subsequent text, disconfirming her prediction, and deciding that the language she is producing is not acceptable to her. She is seeking the best fit for what she knows of her language.
<fig id="fig3-1468798411417081" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Ali's noted fixations with times (marked from onset of recording) and correlated audio Note: Correlation based on conjunction of audio-voiced ‘d’, video cursor and fixation point occurring at (2).

Fixation 3 is on ‘you’ as Ali completes vocalizing ‘does’, after which she returns to the sentence beginning and voices her self-correction. Fixations 4–5 are on ‘What’ and then slightly above ‘do’. As she is orally producing ‘do’ her fixation 6 is on the later occurring ‘am’.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411417081-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468798411417081"><title>Ali's third miscue and her instructional experience</title>
<p>Ali's response to the third miscue from this sentence is a significant one due to her self-correction. She continues reading and very efficiently makes a contraction of the text's ‘I am’ when she says ‘I'm’. While her concern has, until now, been demonstrably one of meaning, at this point she appears to be comfortable enough to expend energy on text reproduction. Instructionally, accurate text reproduction has been a primary concern in her classroom experience and here it is also revealed to be a concern for her, even when her miscue shows linguistic competence. Although her use of ‘I'm’ indicates and genuinely supports a judgement that she is comprehending, a sign to a listener that her comprehension is intact, she chooses to correct it. This is an unnecessary correction if she is focused on meaning, yet, it may be said at this point, that her comprehension is broad enough and she is confident enough that she can afford such deference to what her classroom instruction and tests seem to value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468798411417081"><title>The strengths in Ali's reading</title>
<p>While the influence of an instructional focus on phonics is clearly discernible in Ali's reading, she has other strengths that support her reading. As shown in her flexible use of strategies, her tacit requirement that what she reads should make sense is her greatest overall strength. As comprehension provides the reason for any reading, her strategic sampling of text, as her eye movements show during her nine seconds of silence on ‘One evening,’ as well as her look ahead at ‘you’, provide information that she uses to reach acceptable comprehensible language.</p>
<p>Ali uses her graphophonic knowledge in a malleable self-regulated fashion. She includes other aspects, such as her syntactic knowledge, word meaning knowledge, linguistic knowledge of the structures possible in the language, and what the language means in the context of the story. It is probable that her background experience with the genre of folk tales plays some part because our readers have often remarked how much information they come to expect from reading something that begins with ‘Once upon a time’. The 22 seconds Ali takes before self-correcting may be an unusually long time to experiment, even if exploring more than one strategy, yet Ali did not over-extend herself in her interest for knowing ‘One evening’. It is her own decisions that allow her to move forward in the text. Sense, its presence and sensitivity to its disruption, is something that only readers themselves can immediately judge.</p>
<p>Ali's instructional experience with a single reading strategy could explain her silence during her nine seconds of looking ahead. In looking ahead for more information she knew she would not be following her experience of her teacher's instructions. As many readers we have worked with indicate, Ali may have become silent because she had ceased attending to the troubling words and believed that ‘looking ahead’ would be cheating. Becoming silent at this point would conceal her setting aside her instructional experience because a teacher listening would not know that she was circumventing the expectation of looking closer at a word to sound it out. Ali's concern, however, is with comprehending a text, not as trying to pass a phonics test. This, not test scores, will carry her through her life as a reader.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411417081"><title>Singular emphasis reconsidered</title>
<p>In the US climate of the phonics/anti-phonics debate it is clear that Ali uses her knowledge of phonics in her reading. Her miscues indicate that she may be overemphasizing the graphophonic cueing system by not choosing to look ahead sooner or by making miscues that have high sound and graphic similarities. The critical question is not whether readers do or do not, should or should not, use a particular strategy, but whether it is appropriate to emphasize one single aspect of reading instructionally, and judge the ‘reading’ of early readers on the limited grounds of that single aspect. Ali's example suggests instruction that recognizes and accommodates the contributions and interrelatedness of all aspects of a reader's experience of a language.</p>
<p>Historically, however, it appears that reading has been considered to be the unhesitant and unbroken accurate oral reproduction of a text, and that this can be achieved by a mechanical ‘sounding out’ or decoding of letters on a page. In the face of much confounding research and classroom knowledge, the tenacity of this belief about reading is surprising. There is a problematic relationship of letters to sounds in English as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411417081">Clymer's (1963)</xref> study or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411417081">Johnston's (2001)</xref> study of elementary school texts that found a poor relationship of phonic rules to the words in students' texts. Given programme-compliant instructional texts that hence use unnatural controlled vocabulary, we wonder if the low correspondence of phonics rules to the natural language children experience creates the very sense in beginning readers of ‘reading’ as separate from learning.</p>
<p>Adherence to a left-to-right, letter-by-letter, sound-by-sound belief would clearly be detrimental for Ali. Yet it persists as an instructional focus. It is as if given a ‘d’ followed by an ‘o’ the sound of the ‘o’ is obvious (doe, do, done, dog…) or that saying the letters ‘“i” “o” inch’, for ‘10 inch’ is a letter-sound relationship. There are no phonics rules that will tell how to ‘sound out’ the word R-E-A-D. Syntactic information is needed to read ‘read’, information that may not even be found in a sentence such as: ‘That's the book I read in my social studies class. Was it yesterday, or is it ongoing today?’. One's predictive nature will not let one stop at ‘read’, wondering if it is ‘red’ or ‘reed’, questioning which phonic rule(s) may be applied, or if such rules exist– one will try the most probable predictable form, and only later self-correct, if and when more context evolves to suggest correction. This is the case even if that context requires waiting for information well beyond the reading of a given text. Yet, for programmed instruction, such questions remain ignored, left to the status of students’ extracurricular lives.</p>
<p>Currently, in the USA, one part of the DIBELS, a simplistic test for youngreaders used extensively throughout the country, uses ‘nonsense words’ (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411417081">Goodman, 2006</xref>). Using non-words in tests of reading, implies, arguably teaches, that saying letter sounds is what reading is. Questionable as the lesson is, as time spent in school this cannot but influence the ideas children have of what reading is. To the extent that any aspect of language is overemphasized, it becomes a distraction from meaningful reading. The treatment of students’ graphophonic knowledge as an end rather than as ameans to comprehension places an external and rigid restriction on what areader requires to become internal and flexible. Similarly, an over-concern for reading words perfectly at first sight renders reading a tedious and unpleasant experience. Through single-emphasis programmes, artificial texts and the correlated testing of abstracted skills (e.g. using non-words as nonsense rather than placeholders), reading becomes an independent subject that can be failed, rather than a tool to gather information, construct new understandings of the world, explore the thoughts of unfamiliar authors, or even enjoy a familiar one. Unfortunately for students who most experience them, single-emphasis low-context programmes at best undermine the credibility of instruction. At worst, they can create a disenfranchised stratum of self-proclaimed non-readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411417081">Bacon, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468798411417081"><title>Perceiving comprehending: The importance of teacher awareness</title>
<p>In teacher education, it is important to understand how Ali is processing text. There are too many occasions in which the obvious obscures the actual. For teachers, of reading in particular, an understanding of the role of comprehension and the activity of comprehending in reading is critical to advising and supporting developing readers effectively.</p>
<p>As for all readers, there is text that may be miscued, just as for any reader there exists text that may at first seem incomprehensible. The data for Ali's reading of the one sentence as presented are not representative of how data from all other sentences she confronts would look (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411417081">Paulson et al., 2003</xref>). What her eye movements do show in this one sentence, however, are processes that miscue analysis suggests underlie all reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411417081">Hudelson, 1981</xref>). They show Ali to be first and foremost an actively engaged reader who is intelligently self-managing her efforts. In the decisions she makes as she reads, she shows she is sensitive to meaning; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417081">Menosky's (1971)</xref> work suggests, meaning itself is a resource for reading.</p>
<p>Yet this understanding is too often pushed aside, if not ignored entirely. As mentioned, teachers who have heard Ali's reading sample often miss the last miscue, the over-correction of ‘I am’ from ‘I'm’. Just as phonics-taught readers may roll right through text rendering nonsensical language (even when an oral reading may ‘sound’ right to a listener, comprehension may be quite limited), it is common for observers of readers themselves to miss a young reader's high-quality miscues. In virtually any context, some variation of, or alternative for, words used is possible. The particulars of a language can change and be changed, just as a letter may sound different in different words, or at a different time an author would not write the same piece, even when making the same point. Indeed, in tape-recorded analysis of adults reading with children it is clear that adults themselves often make the same constructive ‘errors’ as the early readers they listen to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411417081">Page, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Among students themselves, ‘good’ readers tend to overlook their strengths, strengths that if consciously known could be invaluable to ‘good’ and to ‘poor’ readers alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411417081">Bacon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411417081">Goodman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411417081">Moore and Gillis, 2005</xref>). For the youngest of readers, preschool or emergent readers, their acceptable departures from a given text, or high-quality miscues, may be glossed over; if noticed, they could be recognized as a way to maintain their developing sense of story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411417081">Applebee, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468798411417081">Wells, 1986</xref>). As schooling progresses, this comes to be, at the least,rhetorically rejected. The notion of the exact reproduction of a text becomes the premier reading measure considered. In not recognizing their own transactions with text, many come to believe that schoolchildren must learn the “basics” first, not make miscues or circumvent directions, but master what single emphasis programmes reward. Over time, proficient readers, no doubt supported by a history of high test scores and what they have learned a ‘mistake’ means, become the most resistant to accepting that even they can make miscues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417081">Costello, 1996</xref>). When confronted with a new text, better readers come to believe they read accurately when they make sense, but, as tape recording can reveal, this is distinctly not the same as saying that they reproduce the text exactly as it is written.</p>
<p>Leaving the strengths demonstrated by high-quality miscues unrecognized allows low-quality miscues to be isolated from the contexts in which they occur. Once stripped of context, a resource Ali clearly employs for judging revision, by narrowing attention from ideas down to single words, and even down to letters, any correspondingly reduced instructional effort can hardly meet the challenge of creating the high-quality reading it professes to strive for because this is lacking in its very practice. The result is that, in many US schools, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411417081">Allington (2007)</xref> points out, those who are most in need of a rich experience in literacy are those who are most remediated away from that experience.</p>
<p>Underscoring the importance of understanding the constructive and strategic reader, and often as hidden to a listener's understanding as a reader's eye movements, some children unintentionally obscure their own thinking processes from teachers. In accommodating their instruction, they form their own meanings for terms that they hear. Children cite ‘sounding out’ as their strategy even when it does ‘not reflect their actual reading behaviors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411417081">Compton-Lilly, 2005</xref>: 445). There are surprisingly complex interpretations that children use astacit knowledge for ‘sound it out’. A reader may interpret ‘sound it out’ as trying a multiplicity of possible sounds or words to find what will fit within the context of a given text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411417081">Brown, 1996</xref>). ‘How does that sound to you?’ takes on a resonant sense, without serious connection to a specific letter or word. But these results of meaning-making are invisible to teachers who are trained to teach the dictums and jargon of pre-packaged instructional programmes, especially when their <italic>own</italic> measure of success is to get uninspired students to score well on a programme's tests.</p>
<p>As shown by miscue analysis, all readers make miscues in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411417081">Goodman, 1996</xref>). As Ali's EMMA data reflect, comprehending rests with the strategic self-managed reader working through a multifaceted awareness of how a text can be made meaningful. This is not to say that all readers are aware that they miscue, nor do all readers consciously recognize the resources they use and processes they participate in when they read. For teachers of young readers, however, such an awareness of how readers are actually processing text is critical. For instruction to be supportive of readers, an appreciation of the confluence of all aspects of language is needed to understand a reader, as all these will be employed by a reader if reading is to serve a reader's purpose.</p>
<p>As teachers become aware of the reading process and strategic reading, they begin to value how readers make sense of what they read and begin to see significance in the complexities of how readers make a text comprehensible to themselves. After discussing Ali's example, many pre- and in-service teachers begin to understand that there is more to reading than reproducing text. As one pre-service teacher put it, ‘… because you get a better understanding of how the reader thinks’ (Kim et al., in press). Though schools and legislation may make it appear that reading is something that can be mastered by third grade, as a second-grader, Ali demonstrates constructive activity in her reading that is found in seventh- and eighth-graders, in high-schoolers and in adults alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411417081">Goodman and Marek, 1996</xref>) and, as mentioned, found in the reading of a multitude of languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411417081">Brown et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411417081"><title>EMMA and the reading process</title>
<p>The miscues and added information from eye-movement studies show that readers are not passive reproducers of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411417081">Paulson et al., 2003</xref>). Ali is actively and continually seeking information. Her eye movements and miscue data show that she is integrating multiple cognitive reading strategies. Eye movement research, as in Ali's case, suggests that readers are acting to their full capacity in their search for meaning. When miscues happen it is a question of the nature of the information, insights and strategies the reader is using. To direct a reader instructionally to the word they happen to be saying is simplistic and can, as would happen with Ali, divert the reader from the information that he or she is negotiating. Readers do not fixate on every word. Predictable words and phrases may be skipped while the reader not only looks ahead but also at illustrations or other sections of the text without a break in their oral reading. Readers’ eyes are commonly looking at text ahead of what they are orally producing (referred to as the eye-voice span; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411417081">Buswell, 1920</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411417081">1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411417081">Rode, 1974</xref>-5). Readers say words they do not look at and look at words they do not say. They employ multiple cueing systems, graphophonic, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic, to arrive at their ideas of what a text means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411417081">Duckett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411417081">Paulson and Freeman, 2003</xref>). Even without specific eye-movement information, as we have provided in our example of Ali, a significant means for supporting comprehension is for educators to understand how oral deviation from expected text can reflect comprehension and to recognize which strategies these might indicate. The quality of miscues can inform instructional direction through teachers’ recognition of when and how comprehension occurs.</p>
<p>With respect to the traditional view of reading, as with Ali's example, miscues (substitutions, omissions, insertions and corrections) are not a problem in reading but a means to understand the strategies readers use (sampling, predicting, confirming, correcting, integrating). Eye-movement data emphasize their significance and reflect readers’ constructive activity, even beyond what a teacher may hear. When a reader becomes silent, the meaning-centred reader is already forming a question, contemplating possibilities. Simply, patience can provide opportunities to support a reader's meaning-seeking. In an interactive situation, to ask questions, such as ‘What is your question?’, ‘What do you know about the story/text so far?’, ‘What could be put there?’, ‘Does that make sense?’, ‘What are you thinking?’ or ‘Why is that?’, can add considerable depth to a teacher's, as well as a reader's, understanding of the reader's cognitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411417081">Goodman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411417081">Goodman and Marek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411417081">Moore and Gillis, 2005</xref>). It is a constructive listener who will hear strategies at work. For the reasons mentioned, it may take time for some readers to respond to a change in instruction, a shift to one that emphasizes a non-competitive qualitative view of reading. This is especially true for older readers who have also learned so many programme-based or otherwise abstract reasons to think of themselves as non-readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411417081">Bacon, 2006</xref>). How much of a reader's growing comprehension is arrested by the reader who stops reading with the instruction-bound self-assessment of ‘I don't know that word’, or by a teacher implying as much, in saying ‘Look at that word again’?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1468798411417081"><title>Concluding comments on the significance of Ali's reading</title>
<p>With the current, and seemingly recurrent, reductionistic political climate in many English-speaking countries, as found in the USA, many teachers and students are required to use highly prescribed skill-based scripted reading programmes and assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411417081">Strauss, 2005</xref>). Yet, as such programmes are being implemented in a variety of schools across the USA, the Office of Inspector General (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411417081">Office of Inspector General US Department of Education, 2007</xref>) reports that they are ineffective in helping children to develop reading comprehension. Historically, such programmes have done little to improve the general reading ability of students, despite testing of particular programme foci having revealed particular related effects. The complexity demonstrated in Ali's reading implies that much of the direct, scripted and instructional practice fails to support readers who are actively seeking to understand texts.</p>
<p>Ali's example shows that a simplistic definition of reading is inadequate to address her abilities. A left-to-right letter-by-letter word-by-word interpretation is an inadequate conception of reading. A focus on such a view will not support Ali's growth in reading, nor will further testing of her phonics skills be an adequate form of assessment. There are commercial programmes, as evidenced in the textbooks of education's history, that purport to solve reading problems. These programmes often place a specific, narrow and rigid focus on one particular aspect of a language, language that is, rather, demonstrably malleable and related to a more complex representation of reading, one accessible to, controlled by and presented to an informed observer by the reader. Often a programme's interests distract a reader from, if not devalue, the work and interests of the individual reader, most notably the reader constructively confronting a challenging text that he or she values. How many teachers have increased their focus on the apparent obviousness of a reader's letter-sound correspondence activity only to cut that reader off from their own thinking, or have limited readers, by instructing them to look more closely at a word they are saying out loud, by asking them to follow along with their fingers, in effect covering oncoming text, or have told readers to point only to the word they are orally producing? Like the International Teaching Alphabet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411417081">Downing, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411417081">1969</xref>), or the use of transformational grammar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411417081">Roberts, 1956</xref>) or any of so many well-defined shortcuts to learning to read that have been and are currently being tried, any silver-bullet skill-emphasis direct-instruction programme or linked assessment tool will no doubt go the way of history. Ali shows us that she is an engaged constructor of meaning. For reading instruction to be meaningful and effective for young children, the complexities of reading must be understood by teachers and researchers, and that instruction must reflect a view of reading that understands the activity of the reader. Irrespective of the attempts to override children's own practices in favour of simplistic interpretations of reading, reading for meaning, for understanding, will continue, maybe more so outside of school, but hopefully within.</p>
