Histological grading evaluated the tumor architecture, the amount of solid neoplastic areas, the nucleus–cytoplasm ratio, and the nuclear polymorphism.

Antigen retrieval was accomplished by pretreatment module heating at 97°C for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). Nonspecific antibody binding was then blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 mol/L of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween for 30 minutes at RT. Following these steps, slides were incubated with the primary antibodies CD44, CK19, or a CK19 + CD44 cocktail by diluting at the desired concentration at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies were rabbit monoclonal CD44 antibody (EPR1013Y, Abcam Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts, dilution 1:1000) and CK19 antibody (A53-B/A2, Abcam Corporation, dilution 1:50). For single target slides, the antibodies were incubated with goat anti-mouse (for CK19) or anti-rabbit (for CD44) secondary antibodies conjugated separately to a horseradish peroxidase–decorated polymer backbone (Envision, Dako North America, Inc, Carpinteria, California). For multiplexed immunohistochemistry, the slides were first incubated with anti-mouse antibody for 1 hour at RT. Cy5-tyramide (1:50) was added to each slide and incubated for 10 minutes and then benzoic hydrazide was used to block peroxidases. Anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were added to the multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) slide and followed with Alexa-750. Peroxidases were blocked again. Each slide was incubated with chicken monoclonal pan-cytokeratin (1:100, lab made, affinity purified) in 0.3% BSA/TBS at 4°C overnight. Goat anti-chicken secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 546 were diluted at 1:200 and used to stain each slide.

The details of AQUA have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112461183">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112461183"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112461183"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112461183"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112461183">28</xref></sup> Briefly, the AQUA technology is a fluorescence immunohistochemistry–based method that generates objective and continuous protein expression scores in tissue by using automated fluorescence microscopy and advanced image analysis algorithms. The AQUA scores are directly proportional to molecules per unit area or protein concentration. Unlike traditional immunohistochemistry, the AQUA system produces strictly quantitative in situ protein expression data on a continuous scale rather than subjective, categorical data. Tissue samples are stained with markers that define the subcellular compartments of interest and the specific target (or targets) being studied. To measure the target gene expression, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole is used for the nuclear mask, anti-cytokeratin antibodies are used to identify and differentiate epithelium from stroma (tumor mask) and establish the cytoplasmic mask and an antibody directed against the target is used to visualize the target gene protein expression of interest. A high-resolution automated image acquisition is utilized after the TMA is stained. These images are individually thresholded to remove nonspecific signal then combined to produce a virtual image that represents pixels that are not only epithelial-specific but also represent cytoplasm and nuclear-specific pixels. Pixel intensities from a specific target that has been labeled for readout in a third fluorescent channel can subsequently be quantified within this ‘‘PLACEd’’ image.</p><p>The foundation of the AQUA score is the pixel-based locale assignment for compartmentalization of expression (PLACE) image analysis algorithm. Tissue is a complex mixture of various tissue components (ie, epithelium, stroma, and blood vessels) and subcellular components (ie, cytoplasm, nuclei, and membrane). The PLACE enables differential localization of image pixel intensities associated with target gene expression in these different components or masks. A critical step in the AQUA software is the setting of intensity thresholds that are used to delineate background or nonspecific pixels from signal-specific pixels. The AQUA analysis begins by generating a tumor mask through pixel intensity thresholding (binary gating) and spatial image analysis procedures. Images that have been masked in this way are subsequently combined in a mutually exclusive fashion such that pixels above the thresholds are assigned to specific subcellular compartments. Once pixels have been assigned to each compartment, the signal for the target biomarker can then be averaged over all of the pixels assigned to a given compartment, which is the AQUA score for that sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112461183">28</xref></sup></p><p>For this study, serial monochromatic high-resolution image acquisitions were performed from each histospot by HistoRX PM-2000 platform (HistoFx, New Haven, Connecticut). For each histospot, in- and out-of-focus images were obtained using the signals from the DAPI channel, from the cytokeratin–Alexa 546 channel, from the CD44-Cy5 channel and from the CK19-Alexa 750 channel. A tumor mask, defined as the region of cytokeratin signal, was used to distinguish tumor cells from stromal and lymphocytic elements. Only expression within the tumor mask was calculated as a positive score. To measure the frequency of CK19 and CD44 coexpression, we binarized the CK19 signal within the tumor mask and created a CK19 compartment, which allowed us to measure the CD44 pixel intensity within the CK19 compartment. The AQUA score of a given target within the tumor mask or the CK19 compartment were calculated by dividing the signal intensity of the tumor mask area or CK19 compartment within the histospot. Histospots containing 5% tumor or less, as assessed by the percentage positive for cytokeratin, were excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1933719112461183"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Biomarkers’ expression and their correlation with the following clinicopathologic features were evaluated by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test: age, histological type, FIGO stage, degree of tumor differentiation, and optimal (≤1 cm) versus suboptimal (&gt;1 cm) debulking.</p><p>The X-tile program generated an optimal cutoff point of a marker’s AQUA score that best separated the cohort by the largest outcome difference, that is, time to disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112461183">29</xref></sup> However, the cutoff point in one particular cohort can be cohort specific, that is, the same cutoff point may not be able to separate another cohort by the same outcome, and therefore X-tile generated cutoff points usually need to be validated in a secondary cohort. Nevertheless, X-tile generated cutoff points provide preliminary trend information when studying biomarkers. We have found in some biomarker studies that X-tile cannot generate an optimal cutoff point. In these cases, the distribution of biomarker expression in fast-progression tumors has a similar shape to the distribution in slow-progression tumors. Therefore, if X-tile is unable to generate an optimal cutoff point for a biomarker, at least it indicates that there is a difference in the biomarkers’ distribution between fast- and slow-progressing tumors.</p><p>The primary end point of this study was progression-free interval, defined as the time from when the first-line treatment was completed to the date of recurrence.

Many of these studies used antibodies for specific variants of CD44 but not pan-CD44. In addition, the method used to quantify the expression of the proteins in paraffin section such as IHC has some inherent limitations. CD44 is extensively expressed on stromal and immune cells and this creates a problem for semiquantitative methods, such as the H score. The application of the TMA and AQUA system for the quantification and identification of CD44+ cells improves the reliability and reproducibility of the results. It also decreases the methodological bias, since it allows the simultaneous studying of multiple specimens, the uniform handling of all specimens, and a far more efficient workflow. The AQUA system can easily preclude the nonepithelial cells from tissue removing potential contaminants. In addition, based on the high specificity and sensitivity of fluorescent techniques, it can target multiple antigens at the same time and on the same slide. The yield of these methods has been demonstrated in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719112461183">44</xref></sup></p><p>Limitations of this study are the relatively small cohort and need of data validation for the X-tile generated cutoff points. Although the use of TMA has numerous advantages, especially since it allows the evaluation of multiple patients’ samples under the same conditions, one of its limitations is the fact that it only reflects the condition of a small area of the tumor. A clinical application of our findings will require the quantification of multiple sections of the tumor. Therefore, the results of this study can be characterized as hypothesis generating and need to be validated in a larger sample size. The small sample size limited the statistical power and did not allow adjustment for all potential confounding factors.</p><p>In conclusion, the frequency of CD44+/CK19+ EOC cells was associated with chemoresistance and decreased progression-free interval in patients with ovarian cancer. Use of the AQUA system may allow the appropriate quantification of these cells in tissue samples and therefore its potential clinical application.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-1933719112461183"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1933719112461183"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: in part by grants from <grant-sponsor>NCI/NIH</grant-sponsor><?release-delay 12|0?> (grants numbers <grant-num>RO1CA127913</grant-num>; <grant-num>RO1CA118678</grant-num>); The Sands Family Foundation; and the Discovery To Cure Research Program.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1933719112461183"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holschneider</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Berek</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Ovarian cancer: epidemiology, biology, and prognostic factors</article-title>. <source>Semin Surg Oncol</source>. <year>2000</year>;<volume>19</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>3</fpage>–<lpage>10</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-1933719112461183"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nossov</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Amneus</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> <article-title>The early detection of ovarian cancer: from traditional methods to proteomics.
