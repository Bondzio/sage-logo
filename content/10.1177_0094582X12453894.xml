<p>In a recent New York Times opinion piece Joshua Goldstein, the author of <italic>Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide</italic>, and Stephen Pinker, author of <italic>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</italic>, argue that war and violence more generally are on the decline around the globe, making this perhaps the most peaceful era in human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12453894">Goldstein and Pinker, 2011</xref>). Their definition of war is armed conflict, whether civil or interstate, in which at least 1,000 soldiers and civilians die per year as a direct result of war violence (in other words, they do not count those who die as an indirect cause of the war such as hunger). They go on to say that this reduction in violence and war is related to a “growing repugnance toward institutionalized violence.” While they may be correct that large-scale armed conflict and certain forms of human violence (they list cannibalism, human sacrifice, chattel slavery, and others) have diminished and that violence has become less “institutionalized,” this will be little consolation to people living in Central American countries who are experiencing levels of violence that are “worse than the war” (referring to the civil wars of the 1980s) even as peace accords have been signed and democracy now prevails. In Guatemala, for example, murder rates have risen to the point that it is estimated that “there has been a higher rate of killings overall in the time of peace than during the time of war” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12453894">MacNeish and Lopez Rivera, 2009</xref>: 54). Hume, in <italic>The Politics of Violence</italic>, finds the same to be true for El Salvador. Honduras, which had no official civil war (though there were military dictatorships and repressive forces), has recently been named the murder capital of the world with over 80 deaths per 100,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12453894">Programa Estado de la Nación, 2012</xref>: 367). While this violence may not be institutionalized (purposefully and systematically carried out by the state as was the case during the civil wars), it does permeate all levels of society, affecting individuals on a daily basis and leading many to wonder what it means to live in a “democratic post-conflict society” that has at least as much violence as during the war.</p>
<p>This dilemma forms the basis of the major questions asked by the three books here under review: How is violence experienced in Central America, where there is supposed to be “peace” or at least an end to armed conflict? How is it experienced in a context of “neoliberal democracy” in which blame and risk management are no longer collective endeavors (of the state against the guerrillas or vice versa) but have been individualized in a largely urban and migratory population confronting the effects of neoliberal economic policies? What are the dominant discourses of violence, by whom are they produced, what alternative discourses do they silence, and what kinds of policies do they lead to? All three books show how certain forms of violence become normalized and attached to certain kinds of bodies (namely, poor urban males), which serves both as a common explanation for these kinds of violence (that’s just the way “they” are) and as a justification for other forms of violence perpetrated by the state (as in mano dura [iron-fist] policies) or ignored by the state (as in domestic violence and femicide). What is particularly worrying for these writers is the irony that by referring to these forms of violence as “new” or “post-war,” we run the risk of failing to recognize that many of them are not at all new. They were not simply produced by the war or U.S. immigration policy or the gangs or iron-fist policies or the backlash of men against women in the workforce. Rather, they are forms of “violence as usual” that have been used to terrorize and control certain segments of the population for centuries. At the same time, the authors of these three books argue that, though these forms of violence are not new, we must continue to be shocked by them in order to avoid their ideological normalization and justification and to continue to fight for effective policies to deal with them. Thus these books are not so much an analysis of the causes of violence in these countries (with the exception of a few chapters in <italic>Terrorizing Women</italic>) as they are an analysis of how violence is lived and experienced in local communities and how violence is discussed and handled by the state. All three writers do this to remind us that current forms of violence should never come to be seen as “normal.”</p>
<p>Ellen Moodie’s book <italic>El Salvador in the Aftermath of Peace: Crime, Uncertainty, and the Transition to Democracy</italic> is based on research conducted in San Salvador in multiple visits between 1994 and 2008 in what seems to be a largely middle-to-upper-middle-class set of Salvadorans (she often describes interviewing them in their gated communities or meeting them at the gym). She is primarily interested in their “crime narratives” and what they tell us about the way crime is experienced in postwar, neoliberal democratic El Salvador and how this experience meshes with the dominant discourses of the media and the state. She finds that, while these crime stories do reproduce dominant narratives (especially regarding race and class), the insecurity and disappointment that they reflect reveal an oblique critique of the state and those narratives.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of her analysis is what she calls “critical code-switching.” She shows that before the peace accords were signed there were two dominant narratives about violence. The state promoted the National Security Doctrine’s representation of the nation and state as under attack by irrational communist forces, thereby justifying militarization and human rights abuses, while the left represented all violence as politically motivated by the state (or its allies) violating the human rights of an innocent population that was demanding its right to economic and political equality. Within these two discourses, then, violence was always political and always critical of the social/political ideologies of the opposing force. She argues that since the signing of the peace accords in 1992 crime has come to be represented by the state and media as individual and “random,” disconnected from politics or social conditions. Thus murders that before would have been assumed to have been politically motivated assassinations are recoded as the result of delinquency, and criminal activity that before might have been seen as a form of resistance or social critique of the state or extreme inequality are now seen as simple banditry. In this way the state is seen neither as being in a crisis nor being critiqued, since delinquents are assumed to have no political agenda. This depiction of postwar violence is convenient for those who want to see the conditions that created the war and the tactics of state repression during the war as an exception in Salvadoran history rather than the rule. Indeed, by denying any social or political content to current crime rates and trends, the state can institute such policies as the “iron-fist,” which allows for arrests without due process of young people who appear to belong to gangs without the public’s seeing this as a return to state terrorism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12453894">Angelina Snodgrass-Godoy (2006)</xref> has made a similar argument for why the Partido Patriota in Guatemala has received so much support for similar policies even in areas of the highlands that were hit especially hard by state repression during the war. As in El Salvador, Guatemalan politicians manage to present their tough-on-crime stance as a return to law and order rather than a return to systematic human rights abuses. The best evidence of this is the recent election of the former general Otto Perez Molina to the Guatemalan presidency despite his widely known involvement in human rights abuses during the war.</p>
<p>Like Snodgrass-Godoy, Moodie tries to understand not only state discourses around violence but also how they affect San Salvadorans who must negotiate this new climate of fear. In talking to residents of the capital, Moodie finds that their crime stories in many ways mimic state representations of crime as random and senseless. For example, one of the ways in which violence is seen as “worse than the war” is that not only have the rates risen but one can never know when and where it will strike. She finds that Salvadorans of different classes and political leanings wax nostalgic about the war as a time when they knew how to manage risk by staying out of certain areas, allying themselves with certain people, or relying on the state to protect them (in the case of the more privileged). In their memories, violence during the war had patterns and factions that were knowable and therefore manageable, in contrast to the individual, senseless, and random nature of crime today. This is interesting, since one common argument about the war is that the violence was made even worse and in fact became a form of terrorism precisely by fostering a climate of “not-knowing”: not-knowing when violence was going to strike, who was an army informant and who was not, how much repression was going to result from even apolitical actions on the part of communities (such as organizing a cooperative), and whether one was going to be tortured, assassinated, or disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12453894">Binford, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12453894">Sanford, 2003</xref>). The civil patrols were the ultimate strategy of turning communities against themselves and not-knowing who was really on what side. And yet Moodie reports that Salvadorans’ current crime stories are full of accounts of not-knowing: not knowing why it happened in the middle of a busy intersection, why it happened in their gated community, why that man or young woman, who did not necessarily “look” like a criminal (read: race and class), did it, and so forth. In this way people’s responses to incidents of crime (car-jackings, muggings, kidnappings) are narrated as individual responses as opposed to the collective experiences and responses during the war. She sees this individualization of crime as both buying into the discourse of the state by failing to recognize that crime is still propelled by social-structural inequalities (as opposed to random deviance) but also obliquely critiquing it by suggesting that levels of violence are intolerable and the state’s response is inadequate. Thus crime stories are also an expression of disillusionment with a “neoliberal democracy” in which inequality persists and strategies for dealing with it have been privatized, whether through privatization of services and security forces or through individual migration and reliance on remittances. Though these critiques are not always directly stated, they form part of the “structures of feeling” that come to be part of these crime stories, which circulate and become standardized narratives that reflect new understandings and orientations toward violence.</p>
<p>Mo Hume, in <italic>The Politics of Violence: Gender, Conflict, and Community in El Salvador</italic>, is also concerned with Salvadorans’ experiences of violence and the many discourses that circulate comparing violence during the war with violence today. The differences are that (1) her research (spanning the years 2001–2008) focuses on the populations of two marginal neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Salvador that were formed largely through urban migration during the war; (2) she is interested in both “public” forms of violence (gangs and delinquency) and “private” forms (intrafamilial violence); and (3) gender is an extremely important aspect of her analysis. She argues that one of the problems is that much of the discourse on violence in Central America in general and El Salvador specifically has focused mainly on human rights abuses enacted in the name of politics during the war and then later the problem of delinquency and gangs, without taking into consideration other forms of violence that people deal with on a daily basis in times of war and peace, such as domestic violence. For the San Salvadorans that Hume talks to, crime is carried out not by strangers who enter their otherwise safe and private space (as was a common narrative among Moodie’s informants) but by neighbors, sons, husbands, and parents living in their neighborhoods and homes. For her informants, then, the line between “public” forms of violence and ”private” ones is blurred in terms of both where they take place and their relationship to the perpetrator. Thus she asks us to pay special attention to the fact that violence is experienced differently by race, age, class, and gender and the discourses around them also vary.</p>
<p>As for Moodie, one of Hume’s main concerns is the definition of violence in such a way that certain forms of violence come to be seen as legitimate, necessary, and justified or sometimes not violence at all but “discipline” or “law and order” while others are seen as irrational and deserving of draconian measures. She argues, as does Moodie, that just as state violence during the war was legitimized as acting in the name of “national security,” so current iron-fist policies are enacted in the name of protecting the citizenry from delinquency. By blaming urban youth, gangs, and the poor, the state silences other possible definitions of violence that might include critiques of the policies that perpetuate structural violence in the form of extreme inequality (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12453894">Pine, 2008</xref>, on Honduras). It also silences alternative visions of the current situation as not “new” but the current iteration of long-standing patterns of structural, physical, and symbolic violence on the part of the state and violent reactions on the part of the marginalized. Thus hierarchies of meaning are created in which some forms of violence are seen as meaningful and shocking while others are dismissed as normal.</p>
<p>Where Hume’s analysis adds to Moodie’s insights is in recognizing the role that gender plays both in the forms that violence takes and in the discourses around it. She says that she is going to present a feminist analysis of violence. By this she does not simply mean “add women and stir”; rather, she pays close attention to the role that constructions of femininity and masculinity play in manifestations and experiences of violence, whether the forms are considered a public menace (drug trafficking, gangs) or are those that the state has historically ignored, considering them private matters (mainly domestic violence). In the case of delinquency she notes that even though statistics clearly show that males are most likely to be the perpetrators of violence and are overwhelmingly the victims of violence (perpetrated primarily by other males) (see also Sagot and Carcedo Cabañas in Terrorizing Women for statistics on Costa Rica), thus far the media, the state, and the public have not recognized this as in any way related to masculinity. Rather, discussions focus primarily on poverty, youth, connections to U.S. gangs, and broken families, without considering how these intersect with gender. In fact, among her informants, it was taken for granted that males were naturally violent and therefore while crime and gangs were seen as problems violence against women and children was naturalized as “discipline.” This is certainly not a new discovery, but what Hume suggests is that we should use this insight to analyze not only violence against women but also violence in general. Drawing on masculinity studies, she suggests that we look at how men (especially poor and minority men) are socialized to be violent and are in some instances let off the hook for it but in others demonized for it. Making this aspect of the problem visible is necessary to generate the possibility for social critique and change. Hume points out that, though some of this work is already being done by women’s movements in Central America, a more gendered analysis of violence is still lacking. This means not simply looking at instances in which gender is a motivating factor for violence (as in violence against women) but also using the insights of feminist theory to examine the way discourses are produced within relations of power that are based on gender, race, and class and to investigate what those discourses silence.</p>
<p>A final aspect of Hume’s analysis that is very interesting is her discussion of how residents of these marginal neighborhoods manage violence. As with Moodie’s informants, residents of the outskirts of San Salvador have little faith in the power of the state (the justice system) to protect them from the current situation of violence and seem to lack a unified response to it (in contrast to the sense of unified struggle characteristic during the war, what Moodie calls the “community of care”) and therefore learn to manage it individually. Unlike Moodie’s informants, Hume’s informants are not in a position to do this by retreating into their race/class privilege (certain safe neighborhoods and places with private security) but must do it by being vigilant but silent (“see, hear, shut up”), moving, migrating, joining a gang for protection, and, in the case of victims of domestic violence, not provoking the abuser, escaping to live with family, or, for some girls, joining a gang. None of these is a unified response that challenges the state or even makes demands on the state. Instead, these responses individualize and privatize risk management and silence criticism. For both Hume and Moodie, the point is that while the state is not necessarily enacting human rights abuses directly on the same scale as it did during the war, there is a general feeling that it should still be held accountable for its failure to protect its citizens from the current crime wave and follow through with the promises of democracy and structural changes much more sweeping than simply an end to dictatorship.</p>
<p>The final book under consideration here is <italic>Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas</italic>, edited by Rosa-Linda Fregoso and Cynthia Bejarano. The majority of the chapters in this edited volume deal with the problem of feminicide in Mexico, but a few contributors write about Central America (primarily Guatemala) and thus add to the overall discussion of postwar violence there. I will focus my comments on those chapters. Whether speaking about countries like Guatemala, where there was a civil war and thus a “postwar” period, or of Mexico and Costa Rica, where there were no civil wars, all the contributions are concerned with the rise in violence against women and the discourses that either highlight them as human rights abuses or hide them behind sexist definitions of masculinity and femininity. As do Moodie and Hume, they point to the fact that violence against women is endemic to patriarchal societies, not individual and random but what Montserrat Sagot and Ana Carcedo Cabañas, in their chapter on Costa Rica, call a “total social conspiracy” made possible by structural inequality between men and women and gendered ideologies about male and female sexuality. Whether these forms of violence are taking place in the context of war or “peace,” Fregoso and Bejarano argue, they are “low intensity warfare waged on women’s bodies” with the overall effect of a terrorism that is keeping women silent and disempowered.</p>
<p>The contributors to this volume are concerned that violence against women has historically been labeled in ways that justify and/or ignore it as “private” matters or as the random acts of social deviants. Instead, they want readers to recognize that domestic and sexual violence are long-standing and highly patterned. Also, rather than seeing violence against women as merely a result of the overall rise in violence in general, they draw attention to the specific ways in which women are killed and violated, the ideologies that support that violence, and the social structures that have historically minimized its social importance. Though this can also be said of other forms of violence (e.g., the “social cleansing” of the poor), violence against women has specific gendered methods and contexts that need to be made visible. Thus they use the term “feminicide” to point to the fact that often women are killed because they are women. This means that their deaths are somehow linked to gendered ideologies about women (the end result of domestic violence, killed by a jealous lover, etc.), that the murders themselves or the violence that leads up to it include gender-specific forms of degradation, and that the violence occurs in a climate in which the state fails to protect women and bring the perpetrators to justice. Though “feminicide” specifically refers to violent deaths of women, drawing attention to their differences from violent deaths of men (who, the editors argue, are usually not killed because they are men), the power of the word also lies in drawing attention to the specific forms of violence that lead up to the murder, the social and legal structures that make it possible, and the effects on the surviving family members. Thus, the editors argue that feminicide constitutes a human rights abuse that is systematic and widespread, affects large groups of people, and is only weakly responded to by the state. In contrast to the construction of gangs, drug traffickers, and delinquency in general as a public menace, the most common forms of violence against women that often culminate in feminicide (domestic and sexual violence) have been seen by the state as private matters of little importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12453894">Red de la no Violencia contra las Mujeres, 2006</xref>). Here again we have Hume’s “hierarchies of violence,” in which some forms are given social meaning and others are ignored.</p>
<p>In Guatemala and El Salvador silence around violence against women began to be challenged as a result of the horrific gender violence that took place during the wars. As has been documented by Guatemala’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12453894">Commission for Historical Clarification (1999)</xref> and has appeared in numerous testimonies of Salvadoran women (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12453894">Tula and Stephen, 1994</xref>), women were routinely raped, forced to service soldiers, tortured in ways specific to their sex, and killed and mutilated. Pascha Bueno-Hansen points out in her chapter that, though the war is officially over, women’s groups in Guatemala note that the cadavers of women found today still bear the marks of many of these same forms of violence and torture, leading them to draw direct linkages between forms of violence learned during the war and those enacted today (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12453894">Sanford, 2008</xref>). However, they also note that the violence carried out during times of war is often simply an exaggeration of what happens during times of peace. Thus, while the methods may have been learned during the war, the motivations are based on gendered ideologies that were common before the war (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12453894">Forster, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12453894">Carey and Torres, 2010</xref>) and persist afterwards. Indeed, as studies such as that conducted by Sagot and Carcedo Cabañas show, most feminicides are the culmination of long histories of domestic and sexual violence enacted on the woman by the perpetrator (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12453894">Grupo Guatemalteco de Mujeres, 2010</xref>). Thus, as noted by Hume and Moodie, the signing of the peace accords may have brought about the end of the “war,” but without fundamental consideration of other forms of violence no real change has occurred and for many sectors of the population, including women, things are just as bad as or “worse than the war.”</p>
<p>Where Hume and Moodie observe that, in comparison with the massive organizing of the 1970s and 1980s, there is no unified response to violence today, the contributors to Terrorizing Women argue that there is a growing movement of women’s and human rights organizations that is actively addressing the issue through community organizing and pushing for legislative changes. For example, Hilda Morales Trujillo and Angelica Chazaro and other colleagues discuss the ways in which women’s organizations have challenged Guatemalan legislation that both depended on sexist assumptions and perpetuated gender inequality (e.g., the adultery law that punished only women and Article 200 of the Penal Code, which gave a woman the option of marrying her rapist in order to exonerate him and regain her honor). Though many of these laws have been abolished or revised (and new laws created), new legislation is still largely ineffective because of a lack of public will, the perpetuation of sexist ideologies within the justice system, and a lack of resources and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12453894">Musalo, Pellegrin, and Roberts, 2010</xref>). In this sense, then, the term “feminicide” still applies: the state continues to fail to protect women and bring perpetrators to justice. Deborah Weissman, however, argues in her chapter that while the state should be held accountable, we should also pay attention to the limitations placed on the state by international economic pressures to privatize social services, reduce public funds, and adopt development models that lead to the disintegration of the family through migration and urbanization and undermine incomes and labor rights. She argues that the state has also been undermined by drug traffickers and other “parallel powers” that divert state resources to fight the “war on drugs,” which is itself a great generator of gender violence. This serves to underline the fact that since all of these various forms of violence (gangs, drug trafficking, state repression, and violence against women) are human rights abuses, it is the responsibility of both the Central American states and the international community to address them.</p>
<p>This volume synthesizes a growing interest in examining the way in which gender shapes violence by focusing on violence against women (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12453894">Menjivar, 2011</xref>). Though there is clearly a need for this, it limits the discussion of gender violence to violence against women without considering other forms that gender violence may take. Hume suggests, for example, that we also look at the use of violence to beat manhood into boys, soldiers, and gang members and the fact that much state violence is justified in terms of patriarchal logics that feminize indigenous peoples, the poor, and other marginal groups. With this broader view of gender violence we can begin to see how many forms of violence are justified through the social construction of masculinity and femininity, whether it be intrafamilial or intra-gang or even political. This is not meant to detract from the power of using gender to analyze violence against women but rather to add an otherwise overlooked dimension to the analysis of other forms.</p>
<p>Overall these three books are powerful contributions to making different forms of violence visible by relabeling them as public health problems, terrorism, “low-intensity warfare” (Fregoso and Bejarano), “total social conspiracies” (Sagot and Carcedo Cabañas), and “atrocities of peace” (Moodie). All three books argue that in the case of Central America violence has not been reduced since the end of the war but repeats patterns engrained in societies based on extreme forms of structural inequality (in itself a form of violence) and supported by discourses that label violence in specific ways, creating repressive systems of state control in some cases and silence in others. Read together, they show that violence is experienced differently by different sectors of the population according to generation, class, and gender. Thus we should be careful not to let “the end of war” lull us into a false sense that violence in Central America has declined.</p>
