<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a crucial component of diabetes management. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends SMBG at least 3 times daily for patients using multishot insulin regimens or insulin pump therapy. Furthermore, SMBG is a useful tool to gauge success of therapy in individuals using less frequent insulin injections, noninsulin therapies, or medical nutrition therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431637">1</xref>
</sup> The 2011 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend that patients receive instruction in SMBG use and pattern management to guide therapy. The frequency and timing of SMBG should be individualized to the therapeutic goals and needs of each patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431637">1</xref>
</sup> In order to facilitate proper diabetes management, the accuracy and precision of blood glucose monitors must be ensured.</p>
<p>Commercially available home blood glucose monitors are allowed a margin of error of ±20% in order to be granted approval by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431637">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431637">3</xref>
</sup> This clinically acceptable error margin has been determined through a consensus of articles and studies, many of which have previously been published in Diabetes Care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011431637">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431637">5</xref>
</sup> A 1996 consensus statement from the ADA suggests a more stringent goal of ±5%,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011431637">4</xref>
</sup> although no monitor to date has been able to cost-effectively achieve this standard.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the Prodigy product line (Prodigy Diabetes Care, LLC; Charlotte, North Carolina) offers blood glucose testing supplies that are significantly less expensive than other commercially available products such as the Accu-Chek Aviva, Ascensia Contour, and OneTouch Ultra (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011431637">Table 1</xref>). The Prodigy AutoCode blood glucose monitor has little data other than manufacturer reports for FDA approval available to testify its accuracy and precision,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431637">6</xref>
</sup> whereas other monitors have undergone independent testing to ensure accuracy requirements are met.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011431637">7</xref>
</sup> Prodigy was the only line of blood glucose monitoring products currently covered by the North Carolina Medicaid formulary at the time this manuscript was accepted for publication. Additional data is needed to ensure proper diabetes management of Medicaid beneficiaries in North Carolina.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The objectives of this study were to determine the accuracy and precision of the Prodigy AutoCode blood glucose monitor. Accuracy was assessed by comparing finger stick blood glucose results with those obtained via venipuncture. Precision was assessed using consecutive finger stick blood glucose results from 2 different Prodigy AutoCode monitors, hereafter referred to as meter 1 and meter 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190011431637">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This open-label, prospective equivalence study was approved by the Campbell University Institutional Review Board and conducted at the Wilson Community Health Center in Wilson, North Carolina. Subjects were recruited between October 22, 2010 and January 25, 2011, and were not compensated for participation.</p>
<p>Patients who entered the phlebotomy area of the clinic for routine blood work were screened for study eligibility. Eligible patients were able to read and understand English, at least 18 years of age, and had current orders for venipuncture laboratory assessment including serum glucose. Patients were excluded if they had not fasted for at least 8 hours prior to venipuncture. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to sample collection.</p>
<p>Within 5 minutes of venipuncture, a finger stick was obtained using a disposable lancet and blood was immediately used to perform a test on meter 1 and meter 2. Standard blood and bodily fluid precautions were used and personal protective equipment worn when collecting blood samples. Results were immediately recorded on the study log sheet by the investigators. If a subject was found to have an excessively high (&gt;300 mg/dL) or low (&lt;60 mg/dL) blood glucose, the ordering provider was notified and immediate care undertaken per study and clinic protocol. Venipuncture blood samples were sent to LabCorp (Burlington, North Carolina) for analysis, with results available the following business day. Venipuncture glucose results served as the standard reference value.</p>
<p>Using the guidelines suggested by Mahoney and Ellison,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011431637">8</xref>
</sup> percentage differences between blood glucose values obtained from meter 1 and meter 2 versus venipuncture blood glucose results were calculated. Mahoney and Ellison propose that a study include samples from a minimum of 40 different subjects, as a higher number of samples leads to increased accuracy of results.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011431637">8</xref>
</sup> Using nQuery Advisor (version 7.0, Statistical Solutions; Sagus, Massachusetts) and an equivalence design, a sample size of 40 subjects would have the ability to detect an effect size of 0.4, with a one-sided α of 0.05 and power of 80%. In addition to percentage difference, paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess the variation in finger stick blood glucose results from venipuncture. A signed rank test was used to confirm the results of the paired <italic>t</italic> test; the signed rank test makes no assumption regarding the distribution of data or distribution of variance. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute; Cary, North Carolina).</p>
<p>To determine accuracy, finger stick blood glucose readings were plotted against the corresponding reference value from venipuncture. As the ISO and the FDA use a 20% error margin in assessing accuracy, a ±20% deviation from venipuncture was considered clinically meaningful. The proportion of results falling within the clinically acceptable error margin was recorded for each monitor.</p>
<p>Regression of the finger stick blood glucose results onto the gold standard venipuncture results was computed using a mixed-effect model. As specified by the ISO and the FDA, if 95% of the blood glucose values were contained within the 20% error margin, the meter would be considered equivalent to the gold standard venipuncture. Precision was assessed by comparing consecutive finger stick blood glucose values via 2 different Prodigy AutoCode monitors. Within-subject and between-subject variability was analyzed using a mixed-effect model from the data generated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190011431637">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 53 consenting subjects were included in data analyses. Two additional subjects consented but were unable to produce a sufficient blood sample for 2 finger stick readings. One subject consented but finger stick results were not obtained within the specified time due to a required battery change on one meter. Eighteen subjects (34%) were known to have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>Finger stick results for meter 1 produced 14 blood glucose values (26%) outside the acceptable error margin of ±20%, whereas meter 2 produced 13 blood glucose values (25%) outside the acceptable error margin. Based on these results, neither monitor met the requirements of the ISO and the FDA for equivalence to gold standard. These results were consistent regardless of the diabetes status of the patient, with all blood glucose values representing overestimations of blood glucose relative to venipuncture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011431637">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finger stick blood glucose results from each meter were also compared to venipuncture using a paired <italic>t</italic> test and signed rank test. Neither meter was found to be accurate using these analyses (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for both meter 1 and meter 2).</p>
<p>In order to assess precision, consecutive finger stick blood glucose readings from meter 1 and meter 2 were compared. No significant difference in results between monitors was found, indicating that consecutive readings were precise (meter 1 vs meter 2, <italic>P</italic> = .533, mean percentage difference ± SD: 1.0 ± 7.7%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190011431637">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of the accuracy of the Prodigy AutoCode revealed that finger stick blood glucose readings obtained were not accurate when compared to venipuncture results. Neither of the meters used in this study met the 95% standard set by the ISO and the FDA, indicating that the meter is inaccurate. Notably, all values which fell outside the acceptable error margin were overestimations of blood glucose values. This is especially concerning as falsely elevated readings may lead to untreated or undertreated hypoglycemia, particularly in children or individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness.</p>
<p>Detected differences in blood glucose between the Prodigy AutoCode monitors and venipuncture support the prestudy power calculations and the study as being adequately powered. Gold standard methodology was used in determining clinically meaningful differences between blood glucose detection methods, strengthening the internal validity of the results. A wide range of glucose readings were evaluated in patients with and without diabetes, increasing external validity of the aforementioned findings.</p>
<p>The range of blood glucose values assessed in the present study was 75 to 325 mg/dL, representing a limitation due to the inability to assess the accuracy and precision of the monitors’ full range of 20 to 600 mg/dL. Other medical conditions such as anemia that may affect the accuracy of finger stick blood glucose values were not screened for or listed in the study’s eligibility criteria. While anemia is commonly encountered in the outpatient setting, the authors do not find it plausible that this concurrent disease state could be the source of such a large percentage of readings outside the acceptable 20% error margin. Although the present results cannot be extrapolated beyond the highest or lowest observed blood glucose values, attempting to assess meter accuracy in patients who were exhibiting symptomatic hypoglycemia would be highly unethical. The authors feel that these results fail to provide any assurance that the Prodigy AutoCode monitor would produce accurate results in patients with hypoglycemia, as 67% of venous blood glucose values obtained in the present study were below 100 mg/dL.</p>
<p>Improper sampling technique is also a concern when assessing the accuracy of a blood glucose monitoring device. All study investigators were trained on proper use of the Prodigy AutoCode prior to subject recruitment and thus sample collection represents an unlikely source of error in the current study. Although this study was conducted at a single site, given the wide range of glucose values tested, it is unlikely that contradictory results would be obtained in a multicenter study.</p>
<p>Several reports have been filed with the FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database regarding overestimation of blood glucose values with use of the Prodigy AutoCode monitor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431637">9</xref>

</sup> A report from December 2010 involved a patient who experienced a seizure secondary to hypoglycemia. When the patient’s home blood glucose was checked, the Prodigy monitor produced a reading of 61 mg/dL. Emergency medical services were dispatched and the patient was admitted to a hospital for further treatment and evaluation. Upon facility arrival, the patient’s blood glucose was checked with his home Prodigy monitor, 2 facility Accu-Chek monitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana), and venipuncture. The Prodigy monitor produced a reading of 92 mg/dL, both Accu-Chek monitors 51 mg/dL, and venipuncture serum glucose 50 mg/dL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011431637">12</xref>
</sup> This report of overestimation of blood glucose by a Prodigy monitor provides further validation to the results of the current study and, more importantly, supports the authors’ concerns that life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes may occur as a result of falsely elevated readings produced by this monitor.</p>
<p>While there is no blood glucose monitoring system without negative MAUDE reports, North Carolina Medicaid recipients with diabetes have been forced to use the products made by Prodigy Diabetes Care, a North Carolina-based company. This represents the authors’ primary concern, as the current study failed to provide additional evidence for the accuracy of the Prodigy product line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190011431637">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Prodigy AutoCode blood glucose monitor demonstrated precision between 2 different monitors but was inaccurate when compared to venipuncture blood glucose results. Significantly less than the required 95% of blood glucose values from each monitor fell within the acceptable 20% error margin relative to gold standard venipuncture. All readings which fell outside the acceptable error margin were overestimations, raising significant concerns about the potential for untreated or undertreated hypoglycemia. While the cost of testing supplies for the Prodigy AutoCode are lower than other commonly used blood glucose monitors, these findings may indicate noteworthy safety concerns for North Carolina Medicaid enrollees currently using the product.</p>
