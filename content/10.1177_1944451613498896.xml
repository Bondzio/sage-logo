<p>High anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) is a frequently observed laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Usually HAGMA occurs as a result of common disease processes. However, rare diseases often manifest themselves by mimicking common disease processes with subtle differences, occasionally making the diagnosis challenging. In the following case, the metabolic workup of a patient revealed HAGMA acidosis. After ruling out the usual causes, diligent investigation by our team of subtle laboratory clues revealed a rare cause for HAGMA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rare diseases often present themselves by mimicking common disease processes with minute differences, making a conclusion of diagnosis challenging. Any delay in identifying these subtle clues may lead to complications and disease progression. We report a case presenting with unexplained high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and high osmolar gap.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 42-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, confusion, and malaise for 2 days. She denied any fever, abdominal pain, toxic substance ingestion, recent prescription medication, or drug use and any symptoms suggestive of focal neurological deficit. There were no recent sick contacts. Her past medical history was significant for a similar presentation 10 years ago when she was 3 months postpartum. At that time, she was found to have abnormal thyroid function tests and HAGMA (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], 0.01 µU/L; T4, 20.7 ng/dL, T3, 2.02 pg/dL, positive antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibody). She was treated for postpartum thyroiditis complicated by thyrotoxic storm with propylthiouracil, dexamethasone, propranolol, and potassium iodide. As a child, she had been diagnosed with Reye’s syndrome. A detailed review of symptoms and family history were noncontributory. She was not taking any medications prior to admission.</p>
<sec id="section3-1944451613498896">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Patient was admitted to medical ICU (MICU) because she appeared somnolent with signs of dehydration. Her blood pressure was 115/70 mm Hg, with heart rate of 125 bpm, temperature of 36.6°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On admission to MICU, she was confused, disoriented to time, place, and person. No meningeal or focal neurological signs were present on admission. The rest of her physical examinations appeared within normal limits. Her initial laboratory workup revealed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets; complete metabolic profile showed a blood glucose of 58 mg/dL (normal 65-100 mg/dL), anion gap (AG) 22 mmol/L (normal 8-12 mmol/L), urea 23 mg/dL (normal 8-25 mg/dL), creatinine 0.59 mg/dL (normal 0.7-1.4 mg/dL), bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (normal 0-1.5 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase 109 U/L (normal 0-45 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 75 U/L (normal 7-40 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase 90 U/L (normal 40-150 U/L). The admission arterial blood gas in room air revealed pH 7.20, pCO<sub>2</sub> 12 mm Hg, pO<sub>2</sub> 167 mm Hg, HCO<sub>3</sub> 5 mmol/L, and lactate 1.2 mmol/L. Urinalysis was positive for ketones. Her electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable; pregnancy test was negative. Further laboratory workup showed a high serum osmolar gap of 17 (measured osmolality 314 mOsm/L and calculated osmolality 297 mOsm/L), elevated serum ammonia 300 mmol/L (normal 11-38 mmol/L), and β-hydroxybutyrate 2.75 mmol/L (normal 0-0.3 mmol/L). The patient was given supportive treatment with aggressive intravenous hydration, correction of electrolytes and blood glucose.</p>
<p>A tentative diagnosis of ethylene glycol toxicity was made and she received intravenous fomipezole and sodium bicarbonate infusion. However, the HAGMA worsened, with repeat arterial blood gas showing pH 7.15, pCO<sub>2</sub> 13 mm Hg, HCO<sub>3</sub> 4 mmol/L, AG 38 mmol/L, and lactate 0.9 mmol/L. She was started on hemodialysis to correct the acidosis. Within the next 12 hours, AG was corrected and mental status improved. She did not require further hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Her subsequent toxicology studies were negative for toxins, including ethanol, acetaminophen, opiates, barbiturates, amphetamine, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids and phencyclidine. The thyroid function tests were consistent with hyperthyroidism (low TSH, high free T3, and high free T4). The patient’s antithyroglobulin antibody and TSH receptor antibodies were positive as well. She was started with methamizole 5 mg daily for her thyrotoxicosis.</p>
<p>The patient’s creatine kinase, myoglobulin, amylase, and lipase levels as well as hepatitis panels were normal. An ultrasound examination of the liver revealed patent vasculature, normal biliary tree, and normal gall bladder. The extended toxicology panel was negative for tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methanol, paraldehyde, or acetaldehyde. In summary, the patient’s metabolic profile showed HAGMA, increased osmolar gap, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hyperammonemia in the background of hyperthyroidism but etiology remained elusive.</p>

<sec id="section4-1944451613498896">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Differential diagnoses of HAGMA in adults are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451613498896">Table 1</xref>. In this case, the most commonly encountered causes of HAGMA were ruled out. The useful clues for the diagnosis of this patient were the presence of hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia with elevation of liver enzymes, and urinary ketones. Given the patient’s negative toxicology panel, we investigated rare causes with similar clinical picture and metabolic profile. Serum and urinary organic acids were ordered with the suspicion of an inborn error of metabolism. Quantitative liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed markedly elevated urinary and serum glutaric acid, 2-hydroxygluatric acid, ethylmalonic acid, isobuterylglycerine, isovalerylglycine, hexanoylglycine, and suberylglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451613498896">Figure 1</xref>, panels A and B). The massive excretion of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid and lactic/pyruvic aciduria suggested severe catabolic state. In addition, her plasma total carnitine and free carnitine levels were low at 18.30 µmol/L (normal 29.13-73.03 µmol/L) and 9.48 µmol/L (normal 23.31-57.90 µmol/L), respectively. The above findings were consistent with a diagnosis of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, commonly known as glutaric acidemia type-II (GA-II).</p>

<title>Management</title>
<p>Management of GA-II involves correction of acute metabolic abnormalities, followed by dietary management during remission to avoid acidosis. Concurrent treatment of associated illness, which may have precipitated the metabolic decompensation should be initiated. Many experts recommend withholding protein for 24 to 48 hours during the acute decompensation and reintroducing as a low-protein diet later, as tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613498896">1</xref>

The usual treatment is <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (200-300 mg/kg per day intravenously or 200 to 300 mg/kg per day divided in 2 to 3 doses per os) to enhance the formation and excretion of acylcarnitine conjugates, which are toxic to the brain, liver, and kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613498896">4</xref></sup> Hyperammonemia may require hemodialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613498896">5</xref></sup> Riboflavin is often used as an adjunct to the therapy although data supporting its use are lacking. After the initial management, a follow-up with a dietitian and medical geneticist is recommended. Later, our patient was started on levocarnitine 330 mg twice daily. She was also provided with dietary advice and genetic counseling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GA-II is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the α- or β-subunit of ETF or ETF dehydrogenase deficiency at the mitochondrial electron transfer complex affecting fatty acid metabolism with lipid storage in muscle and liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1944451613498896">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451613498896">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613498896">7</xref></sup> The presentation varies in severity from a fatal neonatal form (GA-II types I and II) to a mild late-onset form (GA-II type 3). Symptoms include muscle weakness, muscle pain, respiratory failure, and/or metabolic decompensation, commonly in the presence of a stressor leading to metabolic encephalopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613498896">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451613498896">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613498896">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451613498896">8</xref></sup> Other complications may be recurrent hypoglycemia, infections such as moniliasis, and osteoporosis with fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451613498896">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613498896"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451613498896">11</xref></sup> Pancreatitis may be a complication of organic acidemia and should be considered if patients develop abdominal pain, vomiting, encephalopathy, or shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613498896">12</xref></sup> Our patient presented with metabolic decompensation leading to encephalopathy but lacked the typical symptoms of myopathy—absence of muscular symptoms, normal muscle enzymes, and respiratory failure.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the patient at the time of presentation had deranged thyroid function, suggesting hyperthyroidism along with antithyroid receptor antibodies. Additionally, <sup>123</sup>iodine uptake scan showed a diffuse uptake, all of which are consistent with the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Her metabolic decompensation was thought to be driven by the catabolic state from hyperthyroidism and stress induced by a new exercise regimen that she enrolled in 10 days prior to presentation. In essence, this episode was a recurrence of a similar event she had 10 years ago, when the true cause of her acidosis went undiagnosed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>GA-II can present in normal healthy individual as recurrent unexplained metabolic acidosis in the background of any catabolic stress. It is listed as a rare disease by the Office of Rare Diseases of National Institute of Health and may be underreported for lack of recognition. A high degree of suspicion for an alternative diagnosis should be entertained when assessing critically ill patients presenting with metabolic acidosis where working differential diagnoses cannot explain the entire clinical picture.</p>
