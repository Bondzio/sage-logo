<p>State attempts to influence land use and development patterns have waxed and waned over the years and vary extensively from state to state. Among the approaches, states have taken toward these ends are the construction, adoption, and implementation of state development plans (SDPs). This article examines SDPs in five states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island with a particular focus on their institutional structure. Unlike the institutional structure of local planning, where the participants and their roles are relatively well established and uniform nationwide, there exist considerable differences in the development, adoption, and implementation of state plans. Each of the five states thus offers unique insights for addressing intergovernmental relationships in land-use planning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of state government in land-use planning has taken a variety of forms. Some states merely authorize local governments to plan while others review local plans against statewide goals and guidelines. Some states adopt plans in specific functional areas, such as transportation, housing, and economic development while others adopt comprehensive state development plans (SDPs). Because they are relatively uncommon and remain unexamined, this article explores the institutional structure of SDPs in five states that have adopted such a plan. Specifically, this study applies a content analysis of the state plans of Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, and Florida. Maryland, widely recognized as a leader in land use and environmental policy, is now creating its own SDP which will become the nation’s first new SDP in fifteen years.</p>
<p>The institutional structure of SDPs relates to how the plan prescribes the roles and responsibilities of the organizations involved, their horizontal and vertical relationships, and how the plan is articulated in maps. The examination of organizational responsibilities focuses specifically on the roles of the state legislatures, state agencies, local governments, and citizens in the creation, adoption, and implementation of the plan. The examination of horizontal relationships focuses on how the plan serves to coordinate the actions of state agencies. The examination of vertical relationships focuses on how the plan serves to coordinate state and local land-use plans. And the examination of state plan maps focuses on how the objectives of the plan are expressed spatially. Institutional relationships such as these have always been a subject of interest to students of, and professionals in, state and local governments. But in this era of increasing concern about climate change, sustainability, and intergovernmental coordination, these relationships have become increasingly salient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X11429712">

<sec id="section2-0160323X11429712">
<title>Overview of State Planning</title>
<p>State planning emerged in the United States in the 1930s during the New Deal era, shortly after the ascendance of local planning in the 1920s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X11429712">
2
</xref></sup> From the early 1930s until it was dissolved in 1943, a federal agency called the National Planning Board encouraged state planning and provided funding for such efforts. In 1938, at the height of this initial era, forty-seven states had state planning boards, forty-two of which were established by statute.</p>
<p>This era of state planning waned after World War II though some states, including Maryland, Tennessee, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania continued some state planning activities. Not until the early 1960s did state planning substantively re-emerge. Hawaii adopted the first state plan in 1961 as well as statewide zoning. California and New York also prepared variations of state plans in the 1960s and early 1970s. By 1968, federal incentives spurred fourteen states to create state planning organizations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X11429712">Meck 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>State planning continued in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s though the form changed over time. In 1971, Bosselman and Callies famously characterized the growing role of state government as a “Quiet Revolution in Land Use Control.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X11429712">Meck (2002)</xref> identified five types of state intervention in land-use control: state-promoted planning (like Georgia); state review (mini-National Environmental Policy Act—like California and Washington); state-mandated planning (like Oregon); state permitting (like Vermont), and state development planning (like New Jersey). State development planning, however, continues to be the most rarely used approach.</p>
<p>The future of state planning is difficult to ascertain. The state of Maryland is currently preparing a SDP; but no other states are seriously considering a similar endeavor. Statewide functional plans, however, are common. In compliance with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, every state must have a long-range transportation plan and a transportation improvement plan to receive federal transportation funding. States are also required to develop hazard mitigation plans, which are long-term plans to reduce disaster loss and protect the community (US FEMA 2010). Many states have housing and economic development plans. A growing number of states have adopted climate and energy plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X11429712">Wheeler 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>SDPs, however, remain uncommon. As comprehensive approaches to land use and development, SDPs must address a number of interrelated functional areas, such as land use, transportation, housing, economic development, and so on. They must interface effectively with local land-use plans, provide guidance for state budget and regulatory decisions, and offer a vision for the spatial development of the state. How state plans address these issues provides useful insights for crafting an intergovernmental approach to land use and sustainable development.</p>

<sec id="section3-0160323X11429712">
<title>Analytical Framework</title>
<p>Little has been written on SDPs in general and institutional structure of state plans in particular. But the concepts of institutional structure and horizontal and vertical relationships are not novel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X11429712">Burby and May (1997)</xref> offer a paradigm for analyzing the policy design of state planning mandates in three types of consistency requirements. These include vertical, horizontal, and internal consistency. Vertical consistency refers to state mandates that local plans are consistent with state policies and goals. Horizontal consistency refers to consistency among neighboring local governments. Internal consistency relates to the relationship between planning and zoning at the local level. These features have been used in several studies to describe and analyze growth management strategies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X11429712">Weitz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X11429712">Gale 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X11429712">Baer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X11429712">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X11429712">Howell-Moroney 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X11429712">Wassmer 2006</xref>) These studies, however, focus primarily on local plans and horizontal relationships among local governments rather than state agencies. Previous research has not applied these concepts to SDPs. This study is the first examination of SDPs in general and their institutional structure in particular.</p>
<sec id="section4-0160323X11429712">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>This article focuses on the institutional structure of SDPs. To explore this issue, a tightly framed content analysis approach is employed. Content analysis has been defined as “a research technique for the objective, systematic, and quantitative description of manifest content of communications” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X11429712">Berelson 1952</xref>). This analysis draws on the plan evaluation literature in general and on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X11429712">Burby and May (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X11429712">Burby and Dalton (1994)</xref> in particular. That is, content analysis is used to characterize key institutional or administrative features of state plans. More specifically, from the analysis of material in the plan, the following questions are addressed:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What organizations are responsible for plan development, adoption, and implementation?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How does the plan structure the horizontal relationship between state agencies?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How does the plan structure the vertical relationship between the state plan and local land-use plans?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How does the plan express the objectives of the plan on a map?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Based on a review of the plan consistency literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X11429712">Burby and May 1997</xref>), these questions address the key administrative or institutional elements that must be addressed in any state or regional plan.</p>
<p>Identifying SDPs requires defining what an SDP entails. For the purposes of this study, an SDP is defined as a plan that addresses multiple functionally distinct topics, like transportation, housing, infrastructure, and—especially—land use, at a scope that includes the entire state. Excluded are state-level plans limited in scope to functional areas like transportation, housing, economic development, or climate, often mandated by the federal government. Also excluded are plans developed by state agencies for a limited geographic regions, like coastal areas, state forests, flood plains, or other specific substate regions. The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety “Summary of State Land Use Planning Laws” provided a source for identifying such plans. (Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety 2009) This summary was based on surveys of state and local officials, developed with the assistance of the American Planning Association in 1998, and is updated annually.</p>
<p>Using this document as a starting point, plans for entire states were identified. Only six states had a state plan updated in the last twenty years: the five included here plus Hawaii. Hawaii is excluded because land-use authority in Hawaii, including zoning, is held at the state level. This eliminates the vertical dimension of the Hawaii plan.</p>
<p>The states that had SDPs by this definition include: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Connecticut was the first state in the modern era to adopt such an SDP, but the plans of Florida and New Jersey are perhaps better known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160323X11429712">3</xref></sup> Surprisingly, almost nothing has been written about the state plans in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware in the national planning literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160323X11429712">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Analysis entailed reviewing the plans of each of these five states to obtain the answers to the four questions listed above. Then, key participants in, or analysts of, the state planning process in each of the states reviewed this assessment and confirmed the conclusions. This external review ensured that this study accurately captured the content of the plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160323X11429712">5</xref></sup>

<title>Key Institutional Elements of State Plans</title>

<title>Institutional Roles</title>
<p>Institutional roles refer to the organizations involved and the roles they play in the planning process. Unlike planning at the local level, where the roles of planning departments, plan commissions, and city and county councils are well established and largely uniform throughout the country, the institutional framework of state planning varies significantly from state to state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X11429712">Table 1</xref>

<p>In examining the institutional roles expressed in the SDP, four key questions were explored: who instigated the plan, who created the plan, who adopted the plan, and who’s responsible for its implementation. The requirement to create a state plan was codified in statute by the legislature in all five states; that is, the legislature instigated the plan in all five states. In Delaware, the plan was created by an agency of state government, adopted by a cabinet committee, and implemented<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160323X11429712">7</xref></sup> by a council dominated by representatives of state government. Ostensibly, the Delaware plan is a state government plan created with only limited direct citizen or local government participation. In Connecticut, the General Assembly adopted the plan, which it helped to create, and it is implemented by the Office of Management and Budget. It too, has few direct links to citizens or local governments. In New Jersey and Rhode Island, a planning commission or council that includes a wide range of citizens and public officials prepares, adopts, and with the assistance of a state agency, implements the plan. The institutional structure of state planning in these states more closely resembles the structure of local planning and is thus more accountable to the public at large. The Florida state comprehensive plan was mandated, created, and adopted by the state legislature and assigned to the Department of Community Affairs for implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160323X11429712">
<title>Horizontal Structure</title>
<p>Horizontal structure refers to how the plan is designed to influence the plans, expenditures, and regulatory actions of state agencies. As mentioned above, a single state agency, such as a Department of Community Affairs, is often responsible for oversight of plan implementation; but because many state plans were developed for the purpose of coordinating state agencies, other agencies are often required to use the state plan in various types of agency decision making. (An overview of the horizontal implementation mechanisms used by each state is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X11429712">Table 2</xref>

The state may also impose a development moratorium until the local government adopts an acceptable plan, or takeover local planning.

Comprehensive plans must be updated every six years and local governments are encouraged to submit plans for plan endorsement by the Office of Smart Growth, which carries incentives both during the process and after endorsement. During the endorsement process, municipalities receive technical assistance funding. Upon receiving endorsement, municipalities are eligible for further financial incentives. It is through plan endorsement that the state hopes to increase the degree of consistency among plans and to facilitate implementation of these plans.</td>

<p>The plans of the five states use a variety of mechanisms to coordinate or influence the actions of state agencies. These mechanisms include requiring state agencies to prepare functional plans consistent with the state plan, requiring budget expenditures to be consistent with the state plan, and requiring that projects over a certain threshold are subject to review.</p>
<p>To encourage coordination and consistency with the state plan, some states require that state agencies prepare plans that are consistent with the SDP. Delaware’s requirement that state agencies produce agency plans consistent with the state plan appears the strongest. State agency plans in Connecticut are also reviewed by the Office of Policy and Management for consistency with the state plan. Florida statutes require that executive agencies adopt functional plans to ensure that actions are consistent with the state plan. This requirement, however, has been largely ignored and was repealed in 2000. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X11429712">Pelham 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Some states require that budget requests are consistent with the plan. Delaware examines the budget requests of state agencies for consistency with the plan, a step which is simplified by the location of the Office of State Planning Coordination within the Office of Management and Budget. Connecticut requires that allocations by the State Bond Commission must be consistent with the state plan.</p>
<p>Some states require project review by an interagency committee or in other ways require scrutiny for plan consistency through environmental review. Connecticut employs strong mechanisms for horizontal consistency by requiring that projects above a certain monetary threshold are subject to environmental review. Rhode Island requires project review for a limited number of projects including projects requesting federal funding, economic development projects, and projects requiring environmental impact statements, among others.</p>
<p>In sum, the structures for assuring horizontal consistency in the five states vary from virtually nonexistent to relatively strong. Consistency requirements in Florida and Rhode Island are weak, while Delaware and Connecticut are strong in employing a multidimensional approach to horizontal consistency. Delaware requires that agency plans are consistent with the state plan and reviews funding requests for consistency with the plan while Connecticut uses plan and review consistency in addition to project review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160323X11429712">
<title>Vertical Structure</title>
<p>Vertical structure refers to how the plan structures the relationship between the state plan and the local plans. Because land-use control is closely guarded by local governments in every state, vertical relationships are sensitive political features of state plans and are certain to remain critical elements of any future state or regional approach to planning. (An overview of the vertical implementation mechanisms used by each state is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X11429712">Table 2</xref>.) For this reason, all five state plans contain extensive language that addresses the vertical relationship between state and local plans, but the mechanisms for addressing this relationship varies from an explicit proclamation in Connecticut that the state plan is not intended to reflect current and future land uses to a complicated and politically charged cross-acceptance process in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Vertical relationships between the state and local governments are perhaps the key features of SDPs that distinguish them from local comprehensive plans and from state functional plans. The vertical relationships prescribed in state plans can be classified into three types: state review of local plans, joint state/local development of the state plan, and/or state financial incentives for local plan consistency.</p>
<p>All of the five states explicitly or implicitly acknowledge the sanctity of local authority over land use, but in all five states, local governments are encouraged or required to address state strategies or goals in local comprehensive plans. The Florida approach is largely procedural, where the state ensures that local plans address key goals and objectives through mandatory review. In recent years, this review has focused primarily on plan amendments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X11429712">Pelham 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The New Jersey approach involves an extensive state-local cross-acceptance process to reach agreement about the state plan and its impact on local government. The intent of the cross-acceptance process is to obtain compatibility among local, county, and state plans. Cross-acceptance encourages intergovernmental dialogue during the plan creation process. County and local governments comment on areas of agreement and disagreement and the state then modifies the plan accordingly. Rhode Island uses a bidirectional process where local plans must be consistent with state goals, but state actions then must be consistent with local plans.</p>
<p>Delaware, Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey ostensibly use the power of the purse in some manner—that is, some form of state incentive—to encourage local governments to promote state goals and objectives. In Delaware, local governments do not receive funding for infrastructure projects and other state investments if their plans are not reviewed and certified by the state. Connecticut and Delaware both provide technical assistance funding to local governments to encourage plan consistency. Florida also offers technical assistance funding, but only a subset of local governments are eligible, including those with limited planning capacity or those attempting innovative approaches. New Jersey also offers incentives for states seeking “plan endorsement,” or state sign off.</p>
<p>Florida is the only state that uses sticks rather than carrots to influence local planning. Plan review is mandatory, but if a local government does not address plan goals, the state has the authority to impose development moratoria or take over local planning. The state also has the authority to withhold Community Development Block Grants or sales tax revenues.</p>
<p>While all states seek consistency between local plans and state objectives, how states encourage consistency and review varies considerably across states. In some cases, the approach is procedural by negotiating state plans. Incentives and disincentives are also common.</p>

<title>Spatial Articulation</title>
<p>By the definition employed for the purposes of this study, SDPs must address land use. Addressing land use usually involves the construction of a map. How that map is constructed to articulate the intentions of the state plan can be among the most contentious aspects of state planning. Citizens often immediately go to the map to see how their residence or community is identified. Local governments similarly immediately compare the state map designations to local designations. Florida avoids this problem by excluding a map altogether.</p>
<p>Four state plans feature a land-use map. Maps in SDPs can be characterized by answers to three questions: What’s on the map? How was the map generated? And how is the map used by state government? Maps in SDPs generally exist to guide state agency spending in all states and, unlike local land-use maps, do not explicitly indicate future land uses. (Details about map construction, the use of the map, and categories included on each map are discussed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160323X11429712">Table 3</xref>

<p>Maps in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Delaware are generally divided into different types of development and conservation categories. Development areas are locations where the state intends to make investments in urban infrastructure, like roads, schools, safety, and water and wastewater services. Conservation areas are areas where the state does not intend to spend on urban infrastructure and instead intends to spend on land preservation or agricultural productivity. Conservation areas are further refined in the Connecticut and New Jersey state plans but all areas receive equal priority for state investments. Delaware identifies Investment Tiers numbered I to IV; each tier receives a higher priority for certain types of investments.</p>
<p>In urban areas, New Jersey has the most detailed maps and the most restrictively defined state investment strategy for each designation category. Perhaps for this reason, the maps are constructed and vetted with direct local government and public involvement through the cross-acceptance process.</p>
<p>Rhode Island used scenario analysis to develop a plan map. The Rhode Island map, called the Future Land Use Map, divides the state into potential future land uses, conservation areas, committed use areas, transportation areas, and conservancy areas. Vertical integration of the Rhode Island map is unique also, as the state identifies inconsistencies between local maps and the state map, and the local governments must revise local maps to be consistent with the state map in the next update of the comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>The maps of all the SDPs share several important common features. They are less detailed than local plan maps; they are expressly not linked to local zoning or other local regulatory powers, and they primarily serve to guide state investment decision making.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>For many years, states have sought ways to shape the process of land-use planning by coordinating the actions of state agencies and local governments. SDPs offer an interesting and relatively unexplored approach for doing so. This research reveals that, unlike local planning, the institutional framework for state development planning varies extensively. Some state plans are adopted by state planning commissions, others by the legislature, and yet others by state agencies. Some states go to great lengths to assure consistency between the state plans and local plans while others merely offer incentives and hope for the best. Some states require state agencies to develop and adopt coordinated state agency plans while others encourage agencies to align their spending and regulatory actions to consider the state plan. Finally, the planning maps of states address land use but most include only general land-use categories.</p>
<p>For states like Maryland now considering the adoption of an SDP, this research offers a menu of options for designing the administrative structure of such a plan. For those seeking to promote sustainability, breaking down silos, and encouraging intergovernmental coordination, SDPs offer models for doing so. Whether state plans have measurably changed land development patterns in their respective states is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
