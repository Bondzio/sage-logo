<abstract>
<p>Theories of family stability and change, demographic processes, and social psychological influences on behavior all posit that parental attitudes and beliefs are a key influence on their children’s behavior. We have evidence of these effects in Western populations, but little information regarding this social mechanism in non-Western contexts. Furthermore, comparisons of mothers’ and fathers’ independent roles in these crucial intergenerational mechanisms are rare. This article uses measures from a 10-year family panel study featuring independent interviews with mothers and fathers in rural Nepal to investigate these issues. We test the association of specific attitudes, rather than broad ideational domains, about childbearing and old-age care with sons’ subsequent marriage behavior. Our results indicate that both mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes have important and independent influences on sons’ marriage behavior. Simultaneous study of both parents’ attitudes reveals that gender-specific parenting contexts can shape the relationship between parental attitudes and children’s behaviors. This crucial mechanism of intergenerational continuity and change is strong in this non-Western setting, with substantial implications for studies of intergenerational influences on behavior in all settings.</p>

<p>Substantial empirical evidence demonstrates that parental attitudes and expectations shape their children’s subsequent behavior. This evidence is limited to rich, industrialized countries with individualistic orientations toward social life and a high degree of personal independence and freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412464041">Sewell et al. 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122412464041">Thompson, Alexander, and Entwisle 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122412464041">Whitbeck, Simons, and Kao 1994</xref>). There is little systematic, general population investigation of this relationship among the majority of the world’s population, who live in poorer and more agrarian countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These populations tend to have more collectivist orientations and lower independence than in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412464041">Jayakody, Thornton, and Axinn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122412464041">Sastry and Ross 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122412464041">Thornton and Lin 1994</xref>). In these societies, some of which are characterized by strong beliefs about the importance of both living parents and deceased ancestors, families play a central role in people’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122412464041">Goode 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412464041">Lee, Parish, and Willis 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412464041">Ogburn and Tibbitts 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122412464041">Thornton and Lin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122412464041">Westermarck [1891] 1894</xref>). Parents’ attitudes and expectations, therefore, should be especially powerful predictors of their children’s behavior.</p>
<p>Rural Asian populations provide strong examples of societies with more collectivist orientations than are found in Western populations. Asian societies historically emphasize selfless subordination to family and extended kinship, especially to senior kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122412464041">Goode 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122412464041">Sastry and Ross 1998</xref>). Also, decisions about family formation have typically been considered too important to be left to the young themselves, making parents important decision-makers in their children’s family formation behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122412464041">Macfarlane 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122412464041">Watkins 1996</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of economic prospects outside the home, parental inheritance remains the primary source of livelihood and wealth for young people, especially sons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412464041">Cain 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122412464041">Gertler and Lillard 1994</xref>). Hence, parents in these settings have a great deal of opportunity to influence their children. This article investigates the consequences of parents’ attitudes and expectations for their sons’ marriage timing in such a setting: rural Nepal. We expect parental influences on children to be powerful in these settings relative to societies with more individualistic orientations. Of course, both collectivist and individualistic societies are characterized by high heterogeneity within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412464041">Lesthaeghe and Surkyn 1988</xref>), making direct comparison across societies complex and beyond the scope of this investigation.</p>
<p>We construct a new framework for the study of intergenerational consequences of parental attitudes and expectations. This framework is specially designed to extend established intergenerational and attitude–behavior frameworks to the study of radically different social and economic contexts. Theoretically, this framework advances the study of intergenerational influences in three ways. First, we address a crucial issue in the study of ideational influences on behavior—differences between broad ideational domains and specific attitudes and expectations. Our empirical investigation then focuses on specific attitudes and expectations. Second, we use this framework to identify hypotheses that go beyond linking behavior to attitudes about that specific behavior. Rather, we identify specific attitudes and expectations about family behaviors, other than marriage, that we expect to shape children’s marriage behavior. Third, we illuminate context-specific mechanisms likely to create important differences in the consequences of mothers’ versus fathers’ attitudes and expectations.</p>
<p>Juxtaposition of mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes is an especially important advance in this area, as each parent’s influence may depend on the role they hold within the family. Because these mechanisms are context-specific, their identification in a radically different family context such as rural Nepal provides an essential contrast to potential parental gender differences in settings such as the United States. To further clarify the independent influence of parents’ attitudes we also investigate young peoples’ own attitudes, which are well known to be shaped by—but independent of—their parents’ attitudes, as another key influence on marriage timing.</p>
<p>Empirically, this article takes advantage of unique intergenerational panel data spanning more than a decade that document family change and variation in rural Nepal. These data feature a representative sample of linked parent–son triads; measures of attitudes and expectations from key family domains; direct personal interviews with mothers, fathers, and sons; and 10 years of monthly panel data on sons’ subsequent marital behavior. Independent measurement of the attitudes of mothers, fathers, and their sons in a panel study with subsequent measures of behavioral consequences is exceptionally rare; this unique empirical resource provides the means to dramatically advance our knowledge of intergenerational attitude–behavior linkages.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>To extend established intergenerational and attitude–behavior frameworks to radically different social and economic contexts, we first differentiate between broad ideational domains and specific ideas. Both are relevant to behavior, but we focus on specific ideas, acknowledging that these ideas are often linked to broad ideational domains. The framework also identifies key specific ideas that vary within a population and are likely to be closely associated with specific behaviors. We focus on marriage timing behavior among males in rural Nepal—this specificity in behavior and study population allows for identification of specific ideas likely to influence that behavior. Finally, the framework identifies the role that both parents’ ideas may play in behavioral decision-making. Following the central theme of important long-term intergenerational effects on children, we focus on the role of parental attitudes, comparing and contrasting potential consequences of mothers’ versus fathers’ attitudes.</p>

<title>Broad Ideational Domains versus Specific Attitudes and Expectations</title>
<p>Many social scientists argue that a key difference between South Asian settings, such as Nepal, and Western Europe or the United States lies in broad ideational domains. These domains might include individualism, collectivism, fatalism, freedom and equality, materialism, familialism, or developmental idealism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122412464041">Goldscheider and Goldscheider 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122412464041">Goode 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412464041">Hechter et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412464041">Lesthaeghe and Surkyn 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122412464041">Thornton 2005</xref>). Research reveals that within a single population, some behavioral trends and individual-level variations are associated with variations in these broad ideational domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122412464041">Goldscheider and Goldscheider 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412464041">Lesthaeghe and Surkyn 1988</xref>). Ideational contrasts at a societal level may thus be reflected in individual-level ideational variations within populations, and these individual-level variations may be connected to subsequent behavioral choices.</p>
<p>Social psychological scholarship on the mechanisms linking ideas to actions often focuses on specific ideas—that is, specific attitudes or expectations—rather than broad ideational domains. The leading research in this area argues that attitudes toward a particular behavior, along with subjective norms, predict intentions, and intentions predict behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122412464041">Ajzen 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122412464041">Fishbein and Ajzen 1975</xref>). Thus, positive attitudes toward marriage, coupled with social influences favoring marriage, increase the likelihood and speed of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton, Axinn, and Xie 2007</xref>). Following this perspective, the strongest ideational predictor of most behaviors is likely the attitude toward that specific behavior. For example, attitudes toward childbearing predict childbearing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412464041">Coombs 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122412464041">Freedman, Freedman, and Thornton 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122412464041">Thomson 1997</xref>), attitudes toward contraception predict contraceptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122412464041">Biddlecom, Casterline, and Perez 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122412464041">Odimegwu 1999</xref>), attitudes toward marriage predict marital behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412464041">Bayer 1969</xref>), attitudes toward premarital cohabitation predict cohabiting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412464041">Clarkberg, Stolzenberg, and Waite 1995</xref>), attitudes toward divorce predict divorce behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122412464041">Thornton 1985</xref>), and attitudes toward educational attainment predict educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122412464041">Astone and McLanahan 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412464041">Sewell et al. 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Our framework’s second contribution, in its extension of established attitude–behavior frameworks, is the identification of both closely related and opposing attitudes as equally important predictors of behavior. This theoretical extension of the reasoned action and planned behavior theory is crucial to our framework because it maintains a focus on specific attitudes but broadens the range of attitudes that may be relevant. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412464041">Barber (2001)</xref> shows that attitudes toward educational attainment shape behaviors that influence pregnancy, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn (1998)</xref> show that attitudes about childbearing shape the timing of marriage. We expect that people enter adulthood with numerous specific attitudes and expectations that may shape marriage behavior in addition to their attitudes about marriage itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122412464041">Ajzen 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122412464041">Fishbein and Ajzen 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, specific attitudes may well be a reflection of broader ideational domains. For example, highly individualistic people may hold more negative attitudes toward marriage and highly familistic individuals may hold more positive attitudes. But specific attitudes may also be independent of broader ideational domains. We are fortunate to have measures from a study that was designed to collect data on both specific attitudes and broad ideational domains. This unique measurement resource gives us the means to focus our empirical investigation on specific attitudes rather than broad ideational domains.</p>
<p>A third extension of our framework, in addition to identification of <italic>which</italic> specific attitudes are likely to be important, is the context-specific reasoning in identifying <italic>whose</italic> attitudes are likely to be influential. We limit our reasoning to sons’ marriage timing, rather than both sons and daughters, because sons’ and daughters’ marital experiences differ greatly in Nepal, as in South Asia more generally. For example, although the majority of daughters (76 percent) experience arranged marriage in this setting, half of sons enjoy considerable input into the choice of both whom and when they marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). As a result, the context of marriage is quite different for men and women, especially concerning <italic>which</italic> and <italic>whose</italic> specific attitudes are likely to be influential. In fact, because daughters’ marriages are arranged by parents in such high proportions, observed correlations with parental attitudes need not reflect intergenerational mechanisms. The remainder of our theoretical framework is designed to generate testable hypotheses regarding consequences of specific attitudes for sons’ marriage behavior.</p>

<title>Which Attitudes?</title>
<p>The setting for this research is Chitwan Valley in south central Nepal, near the Indian border. The majority of people in this region identify as Hindu. They practice arranged marriage, where older generations of relatives seek spouses and negotiate marriages for younger generations. Sons, however, have been gaining autonomy in spouse choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). Marriage timing is also changing rapidly, with males’ mean age at marriage rising from 16.8 years for those married between 1950 and 1959, to 21.9 years for those married between 1990 and 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2005</xref>). Marriage and childbearing are closely linked and both are nearly universal. Children are needed for short-term economic productivity and longer term old-age security, and marriage is an essential step toward childbearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412464041">Cain 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2004</xref>). Sons are especially valued for this economic assistance, old-age care, and the performance of death rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122412464041">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122412464041">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In rural Asian settings like this one, specific attitudes about ideal family size and sons’ responsibility to care for elderly parents are particularly likely to influence decisions about marriage timing. Timing of the marriage transition drives the production of children, and both the pace and the total number of children have consequences for parents, grandparents, and the wider kin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>). In U.S. settings, parental attitudes about family size and children’s childbearing are powerful in shaping parents’ desires for their children to marry quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>). Attitudes about family size and children’s responsibility to care for older parents are likely to be just as powerful in rural Asian settings.</p>
<p>A desire for many children, or pressure to have many children, likely leads to earlier marriage in most settings. In settings of high variation in marital behavior, such as the United States, the desire for many children speeds marriage because couples prefer to be married for childrearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412464041">Manning 1995</xref>). In Nepal, a setting of relatively low variation in marital behavior and virtually no premarital births, childbearing attitudes may be even more important. Marriage is not only desirable for childrearing, it is also a necessary status for childbearing.</p>
<p>Although essentially everyone in Nepal marries, individuals who desire many children may be among the fastest to marry, while those who prefer fewer children will wait for later marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412464041">Gipson and Hindin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412464041">Hirschman and Rindfuss 1982</xref>). Because sex outside of marriage is rare in Nepal, and pregnancy outside of marriage is even rarer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412464041">Retherford and Thapa 1998</xref>), individuals who want many children have motivation to marry quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412464041">Gipson and Hindin 2007</xref>). Research in the United States suggests that people will prefer to marry if they want children, not only because marriage is the most socially acceptable union in which to raise children, but also because marriage facilitates childrearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412464041">Manning 1995</xref>). These mechanisms thus work in the same direction in both generations, potentially making attitudes about family size an exceptionally strong influence on marriage timing in Nepal.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><italic>Analytic implications</italic>: Specific attitudes regarding family size preferences are likely an important influence on marriage timing in this setting.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Research on fertility transition in general, and fertility behavior in South Asia in particular, frequently identifies old-age security needs as a motivation to have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122412464041">Cain 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412464041">Lillard and Willis 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122412464041">Willis 1980</xref>). In fact, the demand for kin care networks is so high in rural South Asia that we expect the need for old-age security to relate to marriage timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412464041">Niraula 1995</xref>). In a setting like Nepal, where the political economy is unstable, the government social security scheme is minimal, and private pensions and health insurance are rare, parental need for old-age care from the younger generation is exceptionally high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412464041">Lillard and Willis 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412464041">Niraula 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122412464041">Willis 1980</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122412464041">3</xref></sup> Children’s marriages are the first step toward construction of a kin care network for old-age support. Therefore, variations in attitudes toward responsibility for care of elderly parents are likely to be a strong influence on variations in marriage timing. In Nepal, sons have historically taken on the care of their own parents, while daughters often coreside with and provide care for their husbands’ parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412464041">Goldstein, Schuler, and Ross 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412464041">Niraula 1995</xref>). This specific attitudinal domain is thus likely to be associated with sons’ marriage timing because a son’s marriage usually brings an additional caregiver into the home.</p>

<sec id="section4-0003122412464041">
<title>Whose Attitudes?</title>
<p>Mothers, fathers, and sons will not always hold the same attitudes, and sons’ behaviors may not respond to each person’s attitude equally. In fact, parents’ attitudes may have more influence than sons’ own attitudes in domains in which parental attitudes are particularly important to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122412464041">Axinn and Thornton 1993</xref>). Of course, children’s attitudes may also be independent of parents’ attitudes, especially in a setting such as Nepal, where the younger generation has exposure to a wider range of non-family experiences than did the older generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). In the following section, we discuss the theoretical reasons for studying mothers and fathers separately, as well as why sons may make decisions independent of their parents’ desires.</p>

<title>Parents’ attitudes</title>
<p>Previous evidence clearly demonstrates that parental attitudes, values, and beliefs about a range of issues can influence children’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412464041">Barber 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412464041">Bengtson 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412464041">Glass, Bengtson, and Dunham 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122412464041">Longmore et al. 2009</xref>).This can happen through social control, where children behave how their parents want them to behave to please their parents, rather than behaving that way because it is what the children prefer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412464041">Gecas and Seff 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412464041">Goldstein et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412464041">Smith 1988</xref>). Children may behave in ways they believe will make their parents happy even when parents do not invoke social control techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122412464041">Barber 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>). Parents’ influence can also spread through socialization, where children conform to their parents’ attitudes by internalizing those attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412464041">Manning, Longmore, and Giordano 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412464041">Starrels and Holm 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In rural Asia, strong value is placed on obedience and respect for elders and parents, and parents often have complete control over the means of production and household decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412464041">Goldstein et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412464041">Niraula 1995</xref>). It is thus especially likely that parents influence their children through the mechanism of social control. Parents have many ways to exert social control over their sons’ marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412464041">Goldstein et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412464041">Lee et al. 1994</xref>). For example, parents who value marriage may use their resources to steer their children toward marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>). This may entail refusal to invest in sons’ education, because educational enrollment is a deterrent to marrying quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412464041">East 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412464041">Thornton, Axinn, and Teachman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2004</xref>). In Nepal, parents also exert social control on marriage by finding potential spouses for their children. In an effort to encourage marriage, parents may begin the process of arranging a son’s marriage early. These mechanisms are examples of how parents’ attitudes may influence their sons’ marriage behavior directly and independent of sons’ own attitudes.</p>
<p>Socialization may also be a powerful parental influence on children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412464041">Mead 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412464041">Peterson and Rollins 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412464041">Starrels and Holm 2000</xref>). Parents who prefer early marriage likely display this value in consistent ways, thereby teaching their children similar attitudes. Parents might express negative impressions of young adults who remain unmarried, or enthusiasm when celebrating the marriages of friends and family. Parents might also influence children’s attitudes in their choice of surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412464041">Bengtson 1975</xref>). For example, parents who value education and work over marriage may choose to live in a place where their children have more exposure to schools and the workplace. Having greater exposure to these settings, in turn, may lead children to value things like education and work over marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412464041">Mead 1934</xref>). In these ways, parents may socialize their children to hold the same attitudes and values. Although the relevance of parental preferences for children’s behaviors may decline with age, the considerable influence that parents have over their children’s behavior likely shapes children’s opportunities and constraints in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122412464041">Elder 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412464041">Glass et al. 1986</xref>). Of course, socialization and social control are potentially closely interrelated, so both may simultaneously influence children.</p>

<title>Mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes</title>
<p>Ample evidence shows that parents’ attitudes influence their children’s behavior, but less is known about the different influences exerted by each parent. Although a great deal of intergenerational research documents mothers’ important effects on their children, much less research has examined fathers’ effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412464041">Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122412464041">Thornton 2001</xref>). Even less research directly compares the effects of mothers to the effects of fathers. The absence of research on fathers’ roles was recognized as a major weakness of demographic work in the 1990s; since then, research on fathers has become an especially high scientific priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412464041">Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122412464041">Nock 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0003122412464041">Thornberry, Smith, and Howard 1997</xref>). Most of this work centers on family research in the United States and other Western settings, but we have even greater reason to investigate fathers’ roles in Asian settings like Nepal, where intergenerational property and social transmission is paternal in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412464041">Lee et al. 1994</xref>). Under these circumstances, fathers’ effects may be independent of mothers’ effects. Documentation of such independence constitutes a crucial theoretical advance in intergenerational studies, likely to motivate greater research on mothers’ and fathers’ roles.</p>
<p>Mothers and fathers may share similar attitudes. If their attitudes are extremely similar, it would be difficult to empirically distinguish independent influences of each. In this case, it would make sense to study parents’ attitudes combined as a predictor of children’s behaviors. One might expect this type of similarity given that spouses are typically matched on a wide range of characteristics before they marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412464041">Mare 1991</xref>). For example, married couples in Nepal typically come from the same or a similar caste, and caste standing is related to culture and socioeconomic position. This similar positioning within the social system may lead to similar attitudes throughout parents’ young lives, prior to their marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412464041">Bengtson 1975</xref>). After marriage, husbands and wives share similar experiences due to their shared lives: they reside within the same surroundings, they share neighbors and friends, and their attitudes likely influence one another. These similar and shared experiences, along with transmission of attitudes through spousal communication, lead us to posit that each parent might have the same influence on children.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes do not overlap completely, the attitudes of each parent may affect their children independently. Although spouses may be similar, no two people share the exact same experiences through their life course, and differences in background or events experienced may lead them to hold different attitudes. For example, a mother may come from a large family with many siblings, leading her to place value on having many children. Her husband, however, may have been raised in a smaller family, leading him to place less value on having many children. Moreover, the more gendered that social experiences are, the more independent we might expect husbands’ and wives’ attitudes to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122412464041">Mason and Smith 2000</xref>). There is strong reason to believe that social life in rural Nepal is highly gendered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>), creating substantial independence in husbands’ and wives’ life experiences. We thus investigate the independent effects of parents’ attitudes to determine these potentially independent consequences. In the following paragraphs we outline reasons to expect that parents influence sons. Because there are compelling reasons for each parent to be influential, we do not argue that either will be more influential than the other.</p>
<p>If parents’ attitudes are indeed different, we would expect fathers’ attitudes to have an important influence on their sons. First, children may be more likely to model their behaviors after the attitudes of the same-sex parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412464041">D’Angelo, Weinberger, and Feldman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412464041">Starrels and Holm 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0003122412464041">Treiman and Terrell 1975</xref>). For this reason, sons may more intentionally identify with and model after their fathers than their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412464041">Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998</xref>). Second, sons might exhibit behaviors more similar to fathers’ attitudes due to biological inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122412464041">Udry 1995</xref>), which may be partly determined by the same-sex parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412464041">D’Angelo et al. 1995</xref>). Third, sons may develop attitudes more similar to their fathers than their mothers because they are likely to have more exposure to similar kinds of gendered and non-family activities as their fathers, such as employment, military service, and travel. Fourth, because men historically hold much of the decision-making authority in households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>), sons may see their fathers as authority figures and behave in accordance with their fathers’ attitudes.</p>
<p>We also have reason to believe that mothers’ attitudes will have an independent effect on sons’ behaviors. Mothers, in their role as caregivers and nurturers, generally spend more time with their young children than do fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412464041">Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie 2006</xref>). Mothers are thus often children’s primary source of socialization. Through this regular and constant interaction, sons become aware of mothers’ attitudes and this may influence their behavior. Researchers have found this pattern in the United States, and there is reason to expect it in rural South Asia, where mothers are even more likely to be children’s primary caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412464041">Lee et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412464041">Paneru 1981</xref>). In fact, mothers may be closer with their sons in this setting, where men typically spend more time outside the home in order to provide financial support for the family. Mothers may focus on building especially close bonds with their sons so they can ensure support for their future. For these reasons, mothers may have a strong influence on their sons.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><italic>Analytic implications</italic>: Both mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes likely influence sons’ marriage timing, although the influence from each parent may not necessarily be the same.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Mothers’ and fathers’ relative influence may also vary across substantive domains. For example, an effect of mothers spending more time than fathers in caring for children is that mothers may have significant influence on their sons in the attitudinal domain related to childrearing. Compared to fathers, mothers likely have stronger feelings about the ideal family size and are more likely to adamantly impress these attitudes onto their sons. Likewise, sons may see mothers as having greater expertise than fathers in childrearing, so mothers’ attitudes about family size may be treated with more credibility. Of course, for the reasons described earlier, fathers’ attitudes about ideal family size may affect their sons’ behaviors independent of mothers’ attitudes, even in a domain associated with mothers.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><italic>Analytic implications</italic>: Both mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes in favor of childbearing likely speed sons’ marriage timing.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as mothers have expertise in the domain of childrearing, Nepalese fathers have expertise in the domain of sons’ responsibilities to care for elderly parents. Elderly parents in Nepal usually depend on sons for old-age care. Fathers are thus much more likely than mothers to have had personal experience with this responsibility, and are therefore more likely to be treated as experts in this substantive domain. As explained earlier, this experience is also quite likely to increase fathers’ appreciation for the role a wife can play in performing the actual caregiving tasks for elderly parents. As a result, fathers may have an influence on their sons in this domain, speeding a son’s acquisition of a wife.</p>
<p>There is a theoretical basis for expecting mothers’ attitudes toward sons providing elderly care to have the opposite effect of fathers’ attitudes. Both psychological theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122412464041">Freud 1937</xref>) and research on relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122412464041">Rossi and Rossi 1990</xref>) point toward especially close and affectionate relationships between mothers and their sons. The rural Nepalese context likely heightens this. Virtually all mothers in Nepal breastfeed their sons for as long as they are lactating or until their next pregnancy, physically reinforcing an intense affectionate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412464041">Paneru 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122412464041">Retherford et al. 1989</xref>). In fact, the Nepalese have a saying common among men, “<italic>Ama Ko Dhudh ko Bhara</italic>,” which means “the son can never repay the debt of mother’s milk.” The conflict between this intense mother–son relationship and a son’s relationship with his wife is symbolized when the mother feeds yogurt to her son during his marriage ceremony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412464041">Paneru 1981</xref>), signifying her last breastfeeding before giving him to his new bride. Although rural Nepalese mothers generally want their sons to marry and produce grandchildren, these mothers also have reasons to wish to delay their sons’ marriages.</p>
<p>Even more crucial for our context-specific reasoning, these maternal desires to slow sons’ marriages are likely to be stronger when mothers have high expectations of old-age care from their sons. As social changes emphasizing the conjugal bond spread through settings like rural Nepal, maternal expectations for poorer quality relationships with their married sons than with their unmarried sons are likely to be exacerbated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412464041">Allendorf 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412464041">Caldwell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412464041">Niraula 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412464041">Paneru 1981</xref>). This expectation may not be limited to rural South Asian contexts—some evidence indicates that mothers in the United States report less positive relationships and less care from their sons once sons are married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412464041">Merrill 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122412464041">Sarkisian and Gerstel 2008</xref>). But in the rural Nepalese context, it is not surprising that mothers sometimes view their sons’ wives with competitive feelings, including concerns that the new wife may threaten a son’s willingness and ability to provide high-quality old-age care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122412464041">Stone 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122412464041">Watkins 1996</xref>). While a mother may transmit the idea that it is a woman’s task to provide caregiving—motivating sons to marry—she might also transmit the preference for her son to delay marriage so that his caregiving remains focused on mother rather than wife.</p>

<title>Sons’ attitudes</title>
<p>As described earlier, sons and parents are likely to have similar attitudes because parental socialization plays a powerful role in shaping young people’s attitudes and beliefs. There are also theoretical reasons to expect that parents’ and sons’ attitudes have independent effects on sons’ behaviors. Three important mechanisms may produce independence of parent and child attitudes. First, although parents and children share similar surroundings and experience similar events, they experience these things at different points in their life course. Having the same experience at a substantially different point in the life course likely yields differences in attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122412464041">Elder 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122412464041">Hagestad and Neugarten 1985</xref>). Second, macro-level changes can create considerable differences in social context between parents’ and children’s generations. Rapid growth in schooling, non-family work, government services, and mass media outlets in Nepal has created substantial differences in parents’ and children’s life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122412464041">Axinn and Barber 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412464041">Axinn and Yabiku 2001</xref>). These differences in childhood experiences are likely to produce independence between parent and child attitudes. Third, the new experiences spreading in Nepal introduce ideas from outside the parental home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). Exposure to the media, schooling, and peer groups transmit ideas to children that differ from parents’ ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). For these reasons, we expect parents’ and sons’ attitudes to be different and to potentially have independent consequences for sons’ behaviors.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) offers measures from identical individual interviews with mothers and fathers, in addition to sons, allowing us to predict sons’ marriage timing over the subsequent 10 years. Special care was taken during data collection to interview mothers and fathers simultaneously in two different locations to enhance the independence of their responses. These detailed and comparable measures provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate intergenerational influences from <italic>both</italic> mothers and fathers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122412464041">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CVFS includes a baseline interview, conducted in 1996, that consists of a structured questionnaire interview and a semi-structured Life History Calendar interview. These interviews collected information on attitudinal and experiential measures, which we employ in our analyses. The CVFS interviewed all members of households age 15 to 59 years in sampled neighborhoods and their spouses (even if spouses were outside this age range or living elsewhere). The overall response rate was 97 percent. Beginning in 1997, monthly follow-up interviews were conducted that collected information about household members on a range of demographic events, including marriage. Drawing on the CVFS, we analyze all unmarried men, age 15 to 17 years in 1996, whose mother and father were both alive and interviewed in 1996 (<italic>N</italic> = 205 son, mother, father triads).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122412464041">5</xref></sup> Sixteen of these sons have brothers in the sample. Our analysis follows their monthly hazard of marriage for 126 months. We study men age 15 to 17 years in 1996 because less than 4 percent of Nepali men under age 18 were married in 1996. This percentage climbs to 12 percent by age 18 and continues to rise rapidly thereafter. Rates of entering marriage are thus highest for this group of under-18-year-old males, maximizing our opportunity to examine consequences of parental attitudes for marriage behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>We focus on first marriage because remarriage in Nepal is a rare event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2006</xref>). We use 126 months of data on marriage to operationalize the monthly hazard of marrying in discrete-time. The discrete-time approach yields results similar to a continuous approach because the incidence of marriage in any one month is quite low, but this approach allows us to avoid making any parametric assumptions regarding the distribution of the underlying baseline hazard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122412464041">Yamaguchi 1991</xref>). We coded the marriage measure as 0 for every month in which the son is not married and 1 for the month in which the son marries, at which time he ceases to contribute to person-months of exposure to risk of marriage.</p>

<title>Attitude Measures</title>
<p>Prior to fielding the 1996 study, great effort was taken to construct measures of attitudes specific to the rural Nepalese context. Five pilot studies were used in sequence with ethnographies and cognitive interviews to arrive at Nepalese language measures of core family attitudes. Some of these measures are often used in U.S. studies of family attitudes and some are tailored to the Nepalese context. Attitudinal measures in this round of the study were deliberately designed to represent specific attitudes and not broad ideational domains. A second round of the CVFS attitude survey was conducted in 2008, with the aim of measuring attitudes that fit into broad ideational domains. In 2008, the CVFS also repeated the 1996 baseline measures designed to measure specific attitudes about specific behaviors. Results from factor analyses of these 2008 measures reveal that the 1996 specific measures repeated in 2008 do not load strongly with broader attitudinal domains. Here, we present English language translations of the two specific attitude items from the 1996 Nepalese instrument. The original Nepalese question wordings and response options can be found at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://perl.psc.isr.umich.edu">http://perl.psc.isr.umich.edu</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="section12-0003122412464041">
<title>Ideal family size</title>
<p>We use the most widely investigated measure of ideal family size: the Coombs scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122412464041">Axinn, Clarkberg, and Thornton 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412464041">Coombs 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412464041">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412464041">1979</xref>). This measure indicates the number of children that respondents want to have and is calculated based on responses to a series of questions. Respondents were first asked how many children they would want if they could have the exact number they wanted. Respondents who already had children were asked how many children they would like to have if they could start life over. They were then asked a series of follow-up questions, indicating whether they would prefer fewer or more children if they were unable to have the exact number previously indicated. Research shows the Coombs scale produces the most accurate indicator of fertility preferences compared to other survey measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412464041">Coombs 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412464041">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412464041">1979</xref>). On the single-item measure of ideal family size, a majority of people in the CVFS (60 percent) reported a preference for exactly two children. The Coombs scale measure produces variance in responses, pushing respondents to report whether they would prefer a <italic>minimum</italic> of two children or a <italic>maximum</italic> of two children. This variance allows for high accuracy in estimating the effects that family size preference has on marriage timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Responses are coded into a scale with values ranging from 1 to 25; a higher value indicates a preference for more children. For example, a respondent who said he prefers two children, and two is the maximum number of children he would prefer, received a code of 4, as compared to a code of 7 for a respondent who said that two is the minimum number of children he would prefer. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412464041">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration of the coding scheme. Among the CVFS sample, respondents with higher values on the Coombs scale have a greater desire for more children (single-item measure correlates at <italic>r</italic> = .92), actually <italic>have</italic> more children (achieved fertility correlates at <italic>r</italic> = .33 among respondents ever married), and prefer a younger age at marriage (ideal age at marriage correlates at <italic>r</italic> = −.16). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122412464041">Table 1</xref> shows, the mean value is 7.80 for mothers, with a standard deviation of 2.90, and 7.54 for fathers, with a standard deviation of 3.17. The mean value for sons is lower, at 5.96, with a standard deviation of 1.65. Mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes are not strongly or significantly correlated, at <italic>r</italic> = .07. Correlations between mothers’ and sons’ attitudes and fathers’ and sons’ attitudes are also weak and insignificant, at <italic>r</italic> = .09 and <italic>r</italic> = .07, respectively.</p>

<title>Responsibility for old-age care of parents</title>
<p>Our measurement of attitudes about sons caring for their parents in old age comes from a survey item specifically developed and tested for this Nepalese population. Respondents were asked: “Some people think that a married son should take care of his parents in their older age. Do you strongly agree, somewhat agree, or don’t agree at all?” We coded the item from 1 to 3; a higher value indicates a more positive attitude. Mothers and fathers have similar mean values on this measure, at 2.31 and 2.25, respectively, with a standard deviation of .79 for each. Sons’ mean value is slightly greater, at 2.54, with a standard deviation of .62. Mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes are not strongly correlated, however, at <italic>r</italic> = .13. Parents’ attitudes are neither strongly nor significantly correlated with sons’ attitudes, at <italic>r</italic> = −.08 for mothers and sons, and <italic>r</italic> = .03 for fathers and sons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122412464041">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-0003122412464041">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>We control for a range of parental characteristics that may influence parents’ attitudes as well as sons’ marriage timing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122412464041">7</xref></sup> First, we control for parents’ marital experiences, starting with the extent to which their marriage was arranged. We coded a scale ranging from 1 to 5 to indicate the level of choice that mothers and fathers had in their spouse, from having no choice (1) to having complete choice (5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). We use the mean of this scale for full models that include both mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes because, although they are in the same marriage, husbands and wives often have different levels of choice in their spouse. We also control for parents’ age at marriage. Again, in the full models, we use the mean of mothers’ and fathers’ age at marriage.</p>
<p>Next, we control for parents’ experiences with non-family activities. We use an indicator of each parent’s years of education to control for the first generation’s educational attainment. We use the mean of mothers’ and fathers’ years of education in the full models. We also control for whether parents ever worked. In the full models, we use a variable that is the sum of two dummy variables, again reported by parents themselves, indicating whether the mother or father ever worked for pay outside the home. Many mechanisms link parents’ education and work to both their own attitudes and their children’s marital timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We also control for key indicators of family circumstances that may shape parental attitudes and sons’ marital timing. First, we control for the family’s ethnicity using dummy variables for the different ethnic groups in Chitwan: Brahmin/Chhetri, Dalit, Newar, Terai Indigenous, and Hill Indigenous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122412464041">8</xref></sup> In our analyses, Brahmin/Chhetri is the reference category. Second, we control for the community context in which families resided in 1995. Following the practice of previously published research using these data, we measure community context with a neighborhood-level indicator that is the sum of the number of services—bus stop, health center, employer, school, and market—that are within a five-minute walk of a respondent’s neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412464041">Axinn and Yabiku 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412464041">2006</xref>). Third, we control for son’s age in 1996. Fourth, we control for the presence of an unmarried brother in the household. This measure accounts for assignment of the same parents to multiple sons in our sample. Fifth, we control for respondents’ birth order. In rural Asia, both birth order and having a coresident brother can influence parental motivations for a particular son to marry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122412464041">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, to account for the duration of exposure to marriage risk, we use a control for time, which is the duration of time, in months, since the first monthly interview. Previous research shows this functional form fits the baseline hazard of marriage in Nepal well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412464041">Yabiku 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122412464041">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412464041">2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122412464041">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0003122412464041">
<title>Analytic Approach</title>
<p>We employ discrete-time event history analysis to model the risk of marriage, with person-months of exposure as the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122412464041">Peterson 1993</xref>). We use multilevel logistic regression to account for clustering of the CVFS sampling design at the neighborhood level. We estimate the monthly hazard of marrying, controlling for key family and parental characteristics as discussed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412464041">Barber et al. 2000</xref>). Our logistic regression analyses produce multiplicative coefficients. We discuss the results as odds ratios, which is the anti-log of the coefficient. These odds ratios can be interpreted as the amount by which the odds are multiplied for each unit change in the respective independent variable. If an odds ratio is greater than 1, the effect is positive; if the odds are less than 1, the effect is negative. We test our unidirectional hypotheses for attitudinal influences using one-tailed tests of significance and we test the control measures using two-tailed tests of significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We begin by investigating the consequences of attitudes toward childbearing, then move on to an investigation of attitudes about responsibility for old-age care. We present both models with each family member’s attitudes analyzed separately and models in which all three family members’ attitudes are analyzed together. In separate estimates (not shown here), we found results consistent with the planned behavior/reasoned action framework: sons’ attitudes toward the ideal age for men to marry predict sons’ marriage timing. However, these analyses did not reveal any direct effects of parents’ attitudes about the ideal age for men to marry. This result highlights the importance of investigating different specific attitudes to advance our understanding of intergenerational associations. Below we focus on the specific substantive domains in which context-specific reasoning predicts intergenerational associations.</p>
<sec id="section17-0003122412464041">
<title>Attitudes about Ideal Family Size</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref> displays odds ratios from models estimating the effects of attitudes about ideal family size on the hazard of first marriage. Because the theoretical expectations outlined for parents’ and sons’ attitudes are unidirectional, we test the influences of these attitudes with one-tailed tests. As expected, we find that mothers’ attitudes in this domain have a substantial positive association with sons’ subsequent marriage timing that is independent of the effect of fathers’ or sons’ attitudes. In fact, mothers’ attitudes have a significant positive association when included as the sole attitude to predict sons’ marriage timing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref>, Model 1) and when included in a model with fathers’ and sons’ attitudes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref>, Model 4). When included in the full model with other family members’ attitudes, mothers’ attitudes in favor of large families speed sons’ marriages by 13.8 percent for each unit increase on the Coombs scale. Because the Coombs scale has a large range, this association is substantial: a 6-point increase in mothers’ attitudes (e.g., the difference between wanting two children at most and wanting three children at least) leads sons to marry about 2.17 times faster. Thus, the association of mothers’ attitudes about desired family size with sons’ marriage timing is substantively large, statistically significant, independent of fathers’ attitudes, and not explained by including sons’ own attitudes in the model.</p>

<p>Fathers also have a positive influence in this domain, although the magnitude of the association with fathers’ attitudes is not statistically different from the association with mothers’ attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122412464041">11</xref></sup> In the full model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref>, Model 4), each unit increase on fathers’ Coombs scale increases the hazard of sons marrying by 6.7 percent. This effect is again substantial: a 6-point increase in fathers’ attitudes on the Coombs scale leads sons to marry about 1.48 times faster. As is the case with mothers, fathers’ attitudes have a significant association independent of mothers’ attitudes and unexplained by sons’ own attitudes.</p>
<p>Sons’ attitudes, on the other hand, do not have independent associations with marriage timing in this domain. This is true in the models using only sons’ attitudes to predict their marriage timing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref>, Model 3) and in the full models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Table 2</xref>, Model 4). These results are consistent with the conclusion that sons whose parents want larger families will marry faster, independent of sons’ own attitudes.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, sons whose mothers prefer larger families are motivated to marry more quickly so they can begin childbearing. Research indicates that mothers’ attitudes related to childbearing have a similar socializing influence on their children’s marriage timing in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>). In this radically different Nepalese setting we find the same result. However, measures to compare consequences of mothers’ and fathers’ childbearing attitudes are not available from the United States. In the Nepalese setting we find that fathers’ childbearing attitudes also have a significant association with their sons’ marriage timing independent of mothers’ and sons’ attitudes. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that both parents’ attitudes have the potential for independent influences on their children’s marital behavior.</p>
<p>Many of the controls have independent associations with sons’ marriage timing, as well. Sons of parents who experienced more participation in spouse choice, and sons of mothers who have work experience, marry more quickly. On the other hand, sons of mothers who married at older ages and sons of parents who have more education marry more slowly. Sons’ own characteristics are also associated with their marriage timing. Sons who were older in 1996 marry more quickly. Their sibling composition also has an important influence: having more siblings and having a coresident brother both slow marriage timing. This result may indicate that sons experience less pressure to marry if they have siblings to absorb some of that pressure. Finally, the parameters we use to specify the baseline hazard are also significant.</p>

<title>Attitudes about Old-Age Care</title>
<p>Based on the highly gendered relationships between each parent and their sons in this setting, we expect that independent associations of specific parental attitudes may have opposing consequences for marital timing in the domain of old-age support. Results of our analyses are consistent with this expectation. Mothers’ attitudes about old-age care slow the rate of sons’ marriages (although this is not statistically significant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412464041">Table 3</xref>, Model 1), but fathers’ attitudes about old-age care speed the rate of sons’ marriages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412464041">Table 3</xref>). When these two opposing forces are estimated in the same model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412464041">Table 3</xref>, Model 4), both associations are statistically significant and substantial, although the measurement metric for this attitude has only three units. A one-unit increase in mothers’ beliefs that sons should care for parents <italic>reduces</italic> sons’ marriage rate by 20.7 percent, but a one-unit increase in fathers’ beliefs <italic>increases</italic> sons’ marriage rate by 50.2 percent. Also interesting, in this domain sons’ own attitudes appear to have independent consequences for their rate of marriage in a similar magnitude as fathers’ attitudes. A one-unit increase in sons’ beliefs that sons should care for elderly parents increases their marriage rate by 50.8 percent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412464041">Table 3</xref>, Model 4).</p>

<p>To investigate whether this attitude has independent associations from attitudes about ideal family size, we tested a model that included both attitudes for all three family members (not shown). The direction and significance of each family member’s attitudes did not change compared to the final models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412464041">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412464041">3</xref>. The two attitudes are thus independently associated with sons’ marriage timing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122412464041">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The statistical independence of the consequences of these three different family members’ attitudes toward the same topic—sons’ care for their parents in old age—highlights the complexity of ideational influences on behavior even within a single substantive domain. Sons’ marriage timing responds similarly to both fathers’ and sons’ attitudes about old-age care. The independence of these two estimates is important. It means that while substantial socialization may produce similarity, paternal attitudes can have an influence independent of sons’ own attitudes, even when sons’ attitudes are quite relevant to the outcome. Both fathers and sons may anticipate the advantages of adding a wife to the family if sons are responsible for providing parents’ old-age care, but each person exerts an independent influence on sons’ marriage timing. Parental social control mechanisms are likely in play even when fathers’ and sons’ motivations are in the same direction. As a result, the sum of these two independent associations is that sons who expect to care for elderly parents, and who have fathers who expect them to provide such care, marry much more rapidly than do others.</p>
<p>By contrast, mothers’ positive attitudes about sons providing old-age care slow their sons’ marriages. This opposing consequence of mothers’ attitudes is both independent of and statistically different from the consequences of fathers’ and sons’ attitudes on this topic. It may be that the potential competition between mothers and their daughters-in-law leads mothers who expect their sons to provide old-age care to be apprehensive about bringing a new wife into the household. Historically, daughters-in-law have been an important source of labor for young men’s mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>). Recently, however, men and women are entering into more affection-based relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>), which may change how mothers-in-law feel about daughters-in-law. With this type of marriage on the rise, mothers may think that married sons will put more effort toward caring for their wives than for their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122412464041">Stone 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122412464041">Watkins 1996</xref>). If this is the case, mothers who expect old-age care from their sons may have motivation to slow their sons’ marriages. More investigation of this intriguing result is required to determine the mechanisms responsible for this observed association.</p>
<p>In the context of our investigation, this result demonstrates two crucial points. First, mothers’ attitudes can have a socializing influence on their sons’ behaviors independent of fathers’ attitudes and sons’ own attitudes. In spite of mothers’ and fathers’ assortative marriages, parental socialization of children, and a shared social environment, there are enough differences in experiences and circumstances to produce independence in the consequences of these three different family members’ specific attitudes. Second, mothers’ attitudes may actually shape sons’ behaviors in the opposite direction of fathers’ attitudes on the same topic. In this particular context, with respect to an attitude about a specific behavior, even when mothers and fathers agree on the topic, the consequences for their sons’ behaviors can be in opposing directions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We used innovative measures from multiple family members to estimate the influence of parents’ attitudes on sons’ marriage timing. We found that parental influences are strong in rural Nepal, as in other parts of the world with more individualistic and less collectivist orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412464041">Liefbroer and de Jong Gierveld 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412464041">Sewell et al. 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122412464041">Thompson et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122412464041">Whitbeck et al. 1994</xref>). A major limitation of previous research on the influence of parental attitudes on children’s behavior is the absence of measures of fathers’ attitudes to compare with mothers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412464041">Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122412464041">Thornton 2001</xref>). Our results reveal that both mothers and fathers can simultaneously influence their sons, and these influences can be in opposing directions.</p>
<p>Theoretically, we identified setting-specific mechanisms likely to produce not only independence in the consequences of mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes, but for some specific attitudes, consequences in opposing directions. Parental attitudes toward childbearing constitute an important influence in children’s marriage timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>). In this setting, we had reason to expect that mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes would each have an independent influence. But we also had strong reasons to expect parental expectations for old-age care from children would be an important influence on children’s marital timing. With no other institutional forms of old-age care, children and their families are the exclusive source of protection, support, and care for the elderly in Nepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412464041">Brauner-Otto 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412464041">Fricke 1986</xref>). However, attitudes concerning a new daughter-in-law’s role in helping a son provide that care is differentiated by parents’ gender—mothers, unlike fathers, may feel competition for sons’ care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412464041">Merrill 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122412464041">Sarkisian and Gerstel 2008</xref>). For this reason, we argued that parental attitudes toward children’s care of the elderly will be consequential in Nepal, but in opposing directions.</p>
<p>Empirically, we found that associations between fathers’ attitudes and sons’ behaviors are independent of associations between mothers’ attitudes and sons’ behaviors. In the domain of ideal family size these independent associations are in the same direction, but in the domain of old-age care they are in opposing directions. Fathers’ positive attitudes toward sons’ care of elderly parents speed sons’ marriage timing, but mothers’ positive attitudes slow sons’ marriage timing. This finding is consistent with our reasoning that fathers with a strong belief in sons’ responsibility for old-age care focus on the advantage of having a daughter-in-law to perform caregiving tasks, whereas mothers with the same belief are more hesitant to admit a new wife, who may reduce the quality of the mother–son relationship, into the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412464041">Merrill 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122412464041">Sarkisian and Gerstel 2008</xref>). These associations are important in worldwide consideration of parental influences on children’s behavior because they demonstrate that mothers and fathers not only have the potential for independent influences on their children, but these influences can be in opposing directions.</p>
<p>Why is the study of parental influences on marriage timing in Nepal relevant to scientists studying marriage and family in any other setting, especially settings as different as the United States or Western Europe? The remote Himalayan setting provides a comparative perspective on intergenerational family dynamics, making it exceptionally relevant to all research on these topics. First, our findings reveal the importance of employing specific attitudes to study parental influences on behavioral outcomes across a wide range of social, economic, and cultural circumstances. Specific parental attitudes influence children’s behavior independent of children’s own attitudes, consistent with substantial social control mechanisms and broad socialization that reaches beyond a single specific attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122412464041">Barber 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412464041">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412464041">Gecas and Seff 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412464041">Smith 1988</xref>). This appears to be just as true in Nepal as in the United States, and it is likely true in every social, economic, and cultural circumstance in between—and probably those not “in-between” as well.</p>
<p>Second, we document that attitudes about family behaviors other than marriage can have an important influence on marriage behavior in a radically different setting. Evidence from the United States demonstrates that one of these attitudes—the attitude toward childbearing—accelerates marriage timing just as it does in this analysis of Nepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412464041">Barber and Axinn 1998</xref>). In the United States, parental attitudes on topics like education and work also influence marriage timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412464041">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>). In Nepal we found attitudes about old-age care do, too. This means that a substantively wide range of specific parental attitudes can be important in predicting any particular child behavior across a wide range of settings. Moreover, different attitudes may be important in different settings or populations. This is all consistent with theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122412464041">Ajzen 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412464041">Barber 2001</xref>), but empirically the door is wide open—all manner of specific attitudes may be highly relevant, depending on the specific behavior and setting.</p>
<p>Third, by adding direct measures of both mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes we were able to compare the role of each parent’s attitudes. Our results reveal that each parent has a substantial independent influence on their sons’ marriage timing, but both the magnitude and the direction of the influence varies depending on the specific substantive domain. Because Western literature also reveals a strong parental influence, this result suggests future family studies in these individualistic contexts should consider the individual pressure that each parent may exert on their children. These results also suggest that researchers should consider specific family relationships when studying intergenerational influences, to add substantial complexity. Attitudes of many other closely connected people—individuals, their parents, siblings, other relatives, and close friends—deserve careful investigation. Again, the implications for research across all settings are mammoth: multiple different others’ attitudes may be simultaneously relevant to each specific behavioral decision, but perhaps differently so in different settings.</p>
<p>Although the context-, attitude-, and relationship-specific nature of our investigation inherently poses a limitation to the generalizability of our findings, our results point toward many new, high-priority topics of investigation. Parallel investigations of specific attitudes juxtaposing comparable measures from mothers and fathers across a wider range of settings are among the highest priorities. Even in comparable settings, future investigations of similar models of daughters’ behaviors have the potential to contribute greatly to our understanding of same-sex parenting. Our findings point toward substantial complexity in intergenerational and ideational influences on behavior. Nevertheless, a clearer understanding of the independent consequences of mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes has the potential to significantly advance models of parental influences on children.</p>

<p>As of 1995/2000, the total fertility rate for women in Nepal was 4.4; it dropped to 2.9 by 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122412464041">Population Reference Bureau 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122412464041">United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2011</xref>).

<p>Attitudes about ideal family size and sons’ responsibility to care for parents in their old age are not strongly correlated.

<p>We test models for mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes separately as well as together in one full model.

<p>Expectations for sons’ care of parents vary systematically across ethnic groups in Nepal; this is a key reason why we include ethnicity as a control. Historically, Nepalese expected sons to remain living with or near their parents and to care for them in their old age, and this pressure was often highest for the eldest son (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412464041">Bennett 1983</xref>). Recent social changes in Nepal have greatly enhanced sons’ independence and variance across families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412464041">Ghimire et al. 2006</xref>). We tested models with interactions for birth order and presence of a brother and found they are not significant.</p></fn>

<label>10.</label>
<p>In analyses not shown, we also controlled for parents’ age at first birth and their total number of children (which is highly correlated with birth order). Including these controls does not change our results.</p></fn>

<p>We also ran the models with mean measures of neighbors’ attitudes for each attitudinal domain. This did not weaken the independent influence of parents’ attitudes.</p></fn>
