<p>This article examines the devolution of social welfare services in the Philippines, focusing on its ideological underpinnings and implications for social welfare. It argues that the devolution resulted in a policy environment that allows for varying levels of social support across municipalities and, consequently, the fragmentation of Filipino citizenship.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This is an analysis of the impact of the Philippines’ Local Government Code of 1991 on Philippine social policy and social welfare. The Local Government Code of 1991 is one of the most significant pieces of legislation in the Philippines within the last two decades. A key consequence of the adoption of the Code was the devolution of certain social welfare programs and services. Some of the effects of the devolution are just being seen and its full impact is still unfolding. It is argued here that the devolution ushered in important changes in social policy which need to be critically examined.</p>
<p>This article is based on a study conducted with Philippine Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officers (MSWDOs) as the primary participants. MSWDOs were among the thousands of national government personnel transferred to local governments as part of the devolution process under the Local Government Code of 1991. Devolution, as implemented in the Philippines, involved the handing down of certain administrative and fiscal authority and responsibility from the national government to provincial, city and municipal governments. Most notable among these, insofar as social policy is concerned, was the transfer to city and municipal governments of responsibility for primary health care and social welfare services and the construction and maintenance of school buildings used for primary education. What used to be the functions of the national Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and Development and the Department of Education were placed in the hands of city and municipal governments. As a consequence of the devolution, city and municipal authorities now have discretion over the amount of resources to put into primary health care, social welfare services and basic education facilities. In a way, devolution came in the form of the decentralization of power and authority from central government to local governments, thus the two terms will be used interchangeably here, especially in reference to similar changes in other countries.</p>

<title>Devolution across the globe and in the Philippines</title>
<p>This analysis of the impact of the devolution in the Philippines is informed by the debate over the merits of such an approach in fostering social welfare and development. Devolution is offered by proponents as a mechanism for increasing local decision-making and control of resources. But there are those who argue that strategies and approaches that have been taken in implementing devolution on the whole result in the reduction of support for public needs as localities are given a more active role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811421618">Carson and Wadham, 2001</xref>). Some point out that devolution forms part of an approach in social policy and administration characterized by increased market orientation and managerialism with the main objective of increasing efficiency, constituting the hallmarks of neoliberal philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811421618">Christensen and Lægreid, 2002</xref>). Among the many questions pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811421618">Schneider and Netting (1999)</xref> in relation to devolution efforts are: With the grant of more freedom to local governments, will policy differences among them widen? What will determine priorities in resource allocation? Can local governments be trusted to protect the rights of vulnerable populations?</p>
<p>There has been a devolution trend across the globe motivated in part by calls for democratization and, to a notable extent, by the supposed economic benefits of the decentralization of authority and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Bwire, 2004</xref>). Such countries as Brazil, Mexico, India, China, the USA, and some European countries to name but a few, have seen such initiatives in various forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill, 2003</xref>). In the UK, devolution was heralded as having the potential to usher in the development of ‘radically different social policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811421618">Mooney et al., 2006</xref>: 483). Of course, the extent to which power and resources are distributed or centralized is and has always been a contentious issue in the United States of America (USA). Some experiments in devolution, like that of Pakistan, seem to suggest that it creates ‘genuine change’ in terms of opportunities for citizens to have their concerns heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811421618">Asian Development Bank et al., 2004</xref>: 2). In the UK, the dominance of the Labour Party in the early 2000s maintained normative reference points for policy innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811421618">Woods, 2004</xref>). But the experience of Canada shows how devolution can provide space for the influence of neoliberal ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811421618">McBride and McNutt, 2007</xref>). Based on studies on the link between devolution and regional economic growth in Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the USA, it seems that devolution does not necessarily result in greater economic efficiency and there appears to be a correlation between worldwide devolution initiatives and growing income inequalities across regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Bwire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill (2004</xref>: 2097) point out, the global trend in devolution has been the ‘renunciation of the traditional equalization role of national government in favour of . . . economic and public competition . . . leading to greater development of initially rich and powerful regions to the detriment of poorer areas’.</p>
<p>In the case of the Philippines, there were apprehensions that devolution posed problems for a strong, rights-based conception of social welfare. At the start of implementation of devolution, there were doubts over the ability of local government units to absorb the devolved functions and fears for the further deterioration of the health delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811421618">Borlagdan et al., 1993</xref>). It was argued by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811421618">Congressional Commission on Health (1993)</xref> that the devolution of such concerns as the administration of health care was inconsistent with a strong rights-based perspective. Indeed, it has been found that the devolution has had a negative impact on primary health care and health care in general as the mandate and burden of financing shifted from the national government to local governments and, consequently, to the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811421618">Bautista, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811421618">Del Prado et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811421618">Magno, 2001</xref>). Others have pointed out problems in the devolution of social welfare services in terms of getting funding support and the interference in the work of professional social welfare staff from local chief executives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811421618">Asia Development Consultants, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811421618">De Leon, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872811421618">Poblador (2000)</xref> thus questioned the wisdom of the devolution in how it undermined a strong centralized system of governance deemed useful for a unified strategic response to the challenges of globalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811421618">Silva (2005</xref>: 399) argues that devolution ‘plays a direct and interactive part in preserving and/or promoting regional disparities in the country’. What does it mean for the country to commit to the achievement of such standards as the Millennium Development Goals when it leaves discretion and responsibility for primary health care, social services and basic education to local governments?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020872811421618">
<title>The impetus for the devolution in the Philippines</title>
<p>Efforts for the devolution came on the heels of the people power revolution that toppled the Marcos dictatorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811421618">Brillantes, 1998b</xref>). The Marcos dictatorship had consolidated power in the hands of a few and this was seen by many as a key source of problems in how it facilitated the abuse of authority. The Marcos regime thus nurtured distrust for a strong, central government among its opponents, many of whom chose to work outside government if not outside the fold of the law. Working mostly within non-government organizations, they took pride in their independence from government. Consequently, they carried over their philosophy in their work in the post-Marcos years under the mushrooming of non-government organizations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It can thus be said that the move towards devolution came as part of efforts to purge the Philippine state of Marcos’s legacies which included a strong, highly centralized national government.</p>
<p>The devolution was framed by proponents as a vehicle for democratization, local empowerment and national advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811421618">Brillantes, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811421618">Iglesias, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811421618">Padilla, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811421618">Tapales, 1992</xref>). No less than the law’s author, former Senator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811421618">Aquilino Pimentel (1993)</xref>, hailed it as ‘the key to national development’. The argument was that national development could only be achieved with the strengthening of local government units. As articulated in the law’s declaration of policy, the local governments were to ‘enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities’ (Section 2.a). A system of decentralization providing local government units more power and authority was put in place toward this end.</p>
<p>Apart from engendering self-reliant communities, the devolution came with the promise of providing space for innovation and responsiveness on the part of local government units to meet the needs of their local constituencies. With more power and authority granted to local government units, there was conceivably more space for the development and innovation of programs and services that were more attuned to local needs and conditions. The delegation of such power and authority was also thought to make local governments more directly accountable to their constituents. As conceived by proponents, the devolution would lead to the development of thousands of local government units which would then go on to creatively and autonomously respond to the challenges of local conditions and, in the process, collectively contribute towards national development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872811421618">
<title>The devolution</title>
<p>In line with the purpose of strengthening local government units, the Code provided local governments with a significantly broader range of powers and functions, including the provision of basic services such as those classified under social welfare, health and agriculture support services. In fulfilment of the law’s mandate, the national Department of Social Welfare and Development went on to devolve a broad range of social welfare services. This included programs covering ‘child and youth welfare, family and community welfare, women’s welfare, welfare of the elderly and disabled persons; community-based rehabilitation programs for vagrants, beggars, street children, scavengers, juvenile delinquents, and victims of drug abuse; livelihood and other pro-poor projects; nutrition services; and family planning services’ (Section 17, Article B.2.iv). Only disaster management, handled by interdepartmental bodies at various levels, and special projects have been retained at the national level.</p>
<p>In the area of health, local governments were mandated to provide health services including ‘the implementation of programs and projects on primary health care, maternal and child care, and communicable and non-communicable disease control services’ (Section 17, Article B.2.iii). Responsibility for primary health care is now delegated to local government units instead of being the mandate of the national Department of Health. Local government units now have the discretion over the amount of resources to put into primary health care and whether or not to give priority and attention to primary health care at all. As with local social welfare and health services, important components of the agricultural support provided by the national Department of Agriculture were also devolved. Like the other two, local government officials now have discretion over the level of support they give to this concern.</p>
<p>On the whole, the devolution represented an unprecedented divestment of power and authority from the national government in favor of local government units. This came with the belief that local government units would be in the best position to develop and manage basic social welfare, health and agricultural support services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872811421618" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The informants of the study were what are commonly known as Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officers (MSWD Officers) serving as unit heads of Municipal Social Welfare and Development Offices (MSWD Offices) who are directly under the supervision and control of municipal mayors under the developed setup. There are currently around 1500 MSWD Officers in the country, roughly corresponding to the number of municipalities, the majority of whom are licensed social workers and members of the Association of Provincial, City and Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officers Association.</p>
<p>A number of methods were used in the study. A survey on the conditions and issues in local social welfare and development work was conducted with a sample of 120 MSWD Officers randomly selected using the Association’s directory of members as a sampling frame. Philippine municipalities are classified into six income classes according to their average annual income during the last three calendar years, with First Class municipalities representing those with the highest incomes (PhP50m or more) and Sixth Class municipalities having the lowest (below PhP10m). Sampling for the study was confined to the three lowest classes. This sampling process serves the purpose of limiting the sample to a relatively homogenous group of municipalities, at least in income terms, which provides some revealing insights as shown in the discussion of findings. Of 120 invitations sent out, 37 valid returns were received. From the survey which included a built-in snowball sampling process to identify those who have had problems under the devolved set-up, 10 key informants were identified for interviews. Two of these had reported that they experienced no problem in relation to the organizational changes that came after devolution, two reported having experienced problems and six of them were among those who had been removed from office under questionable circumstances. A focus group discussion was held during one of their Association’s annual national conventions to validate the initial findings. An invitation for participation in the focus group discussion was sent in advance through the president of the Association. Then, during the conference itself, posters were placed in conspicuous locations in the conference venue. The focus group discussion for this study was one of a number of small sessions held as part of the conference. A total of 11 participants volunteered for the focus group.</p>
<p>There are two main limitations in the present study that need to be acknowledged. The first limitation is that this study is mainly confined to devolution in the Philippines and therefore generalizations cannot be extended beyond the national scope. A second limitation of the study is that it is solely informed by accounts of MSWD Officers as against having corroborating accounts from their immediate superiors, the mayors. The latter were deliberately excluded as participants in the study because to have done otherwise would have compromised the identity and anonymity of the main informants of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020872811421618" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and discussion</title>
<p>The devolution granted local government units a substantial amount of power and authority and this resulted in the financial and political strengthening of a number of local governments. The Code provided sufficient space and opportunity for local government units to transform themselves in the areas of tax administration, budget management and local financing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811421618">Ilago, 1997</xref>). The local governments of economically advanced cities and towns suddenly found themselves getting a more sizable portion of the fees and taxes paid by businesses in their areas. Some towns and the provincial governments of certain regions gained a windfall from having a more direct hand in the administration of quarrying and other environmental resource extraction operations in their localities. Unfortunately, many were not as fortunate as others in obtaining income from local enterprises. Some argue that these local government units simply have not yet learned how to more actively and creatively exercise their taxation powers and to tap local sources of funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811421618">Cuaresma, 1997</xref>). The law mandates the provision of supplementary funds for these local government units but such supplementation from the national government has never been generous and forthcoming.</p>
<p>Understandably, the devolution provided more political power to local government officials. This power, however, is not well distributed. Many local chief executives, mayors as they are called, hold a substantial amount of power at the local level, even in relation to the local legislative body. One respondent, referring to the existence of local legislative bodies, remarked that ‘that is just a structure’ (Lourdes, 50), indicating that mayors hold sway even over local legislators who, as a collective, supposedly comprise a co-equal, independent branch of local government. It can thus be said that the devolution did to a certain extent provide the resources and political space for local government units. But as to which direction this has taken is, of course, another issue. For local social welfare services, there are indications that the promises of the devolution are not being fulfilled.</p>
<sec id="section7-0020872811421618">
<title>Post-devolution local social welfare</title>
<p>When asked to identify the ‘three most frequently availed programs and services’ of their office, MSWDOs named emergency financial assistance, day care and supplemental feeding, self-employment assistance, marital counseling and referrals to other institutions at the top of the list. These were all part of the programs and services devolved from the national Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). It is instructive to note, however, that not all municipalities have provided continued support for all these programs. A number have discarded some of these altogether while others are providing very minimal, token funding support for some services. And when asked what programs beyond those devolved by the DSWD they were implementing, virtually none of them could identify something that can be regarded as having emerged from local innovation in response to local conditions. This result was validated by MSWDOs who participated in the focus group discussion held as part of their association’s annual convention. This finding suggests that devolution has not really given way to local initiatives and, for the most part, the programs and services MSWD Officers are administering today are not much different from those that they inherited from the DSWD. It may therefore be argued that, on the point of providing space for innovation and responsiveness in local social welfare, the devolution failed to deliver its promise.</p>
<p>There were some changes in terms of the extent to which old DSWD programs and services were carried over in the post-devolution setup. Twenty-four or about 65 percent of the survey participants indicated that some of the old programs and services were no longer in operation. The devolved programs which were most frequently reported as being no longer implemented include 1) livelihood assistance, 2) youth welfare services, 3) services for the disabled, 4) supplemental feeding, and 5) skills development and job placement. The common reason for the discontinuance of devolved programs as indicated by 25 or 67 percent of the survey participants were resource-related concerns, primarily in terms of budget limitations. In the devolved set-up, local social welfare and development initiatives are now contingent on the ability and willingness of local governments to allocate resources for such purposes. One respondent complained of being confined to providing financial assistance and day care services explaining that ‘these are all we can afford to implement’ (Stella, 42) given the minimal funding their local government provided for their unit. The experience of MSWD Officers suggests that the scaling back of some programs reflects the varying financial resources and funding priorities of different local government units. Just how varied these are can be gleaned from an analysis of the implementation of the most frequently availed service, the Aid to Individuals in Crisis Situations or AICS as they are called by most MSWDOs.</p>
<p>The AICS was examined in terms of the population reached, entitlement levels and total resource allocation. The AICS involves the grant of financial assistance to individuals and families in emergency situations. This assistance, which may be given for such purposes as burial expenses and the procurement of medicine, is generally contingent on means testing. The survey participants indicated that the number of AICS recipients in the previous fiscal year ranged from 2 to 1115, with 17 or 58.6 percent (of 29 valid responses) reporting 100 or fewer AICS recipients. The figures suggest that the participants differed significantly in terms of the number of AICS recipients they assisted.</p>
<p>Responding to the question of whether or not there was a fixed maximum amount for AICS, 28 or about 76 percent of the participants indicated that there was, while 8 or almost 22 percent indicated that there was no such limit. As to the question of who decided on the maximum amount to be given, 12 or around 32 percent stated that it was done jointly by the mayor and the MSWD Officer while 11 or around 30 percent indicated that the MSWD officers did so on their own. When asked to quote the amount fixed for maximum AICS grants, the 30 respondents gave a range of figures from a low of 500 Philippine pesos (PhP500 = US$11) to a high of PhP10,000 (around US$220). Forty percent indicated that the maximum amount set for their municipality was PhP1000 (US$22)or less. Seven or more than 23 percent of the respondents quoted figures above the median (PhP4750 or US$105). This is a relatively significant variation considering that the maximum amount of AICS granted by the different municipalities ranged from about two days to more than a month’s worth of minimum wages. A wide variation of as much as tenfold was also found between municipalities on the question of how much was disbursed for AICS the preceding fiscal year, something that can only be partially accounted for by differences in the income levels of the various municipalities represented. Again, this suggests that there is a substantial range of variations across municipalities in terms of resources allocated for this particular program. Some municipalities provide scholarship assistance to disabled persons and for out of school youth while others do not. The same is true for Self-Employment Assistance. The variations across municipalities over a range of programs and services evince a pattern that represents a reconfiguration of Philippine social welfare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020872811421618">
<title>The devolution’s effects on Philippine social welfare</title>
<p>Many MSWDOs and local social welfare officers were initially apprehensive about the prospect of being placed under local chief executives because of the uncertainty accompanying the changes that were happening and, to some extent, because of a certain degree of loyalty to their discipline. As one can imagine, the idea of being under the direct control and supervision of local chief executives who were most likely non-social workers was not so appealing to workers who took pride in the fact that they formed part of a professionalized discipline.</p>
<p>However, devolution was, in a way, an emancipatory experience for many. Being under the administrative supervision of the national DSWD was taxing for many MSWDOs. Some MSWDOs still remember how they used to have to transport mounds of documents as part of their regular reporting requirements to higher officials. Visits by technical experts and monitoring staff from the DSWD Central Office was always accompanied by a degree of anxiety and discomfort considering how such visits often led to the scrutiny of the technical and administrative shortcomings of their work. Now, under mayors, the MSWDOs do not feel such kinds of pressure. Instead of being answerable to at least one regional director, several technical officers, the DSWD Assistant Secretary for Programs, DSWD undersecretaries, and the DSWD secretary, they now are just accountable to one person, the mayor, who is in many ways not as exacting. In fact, with their being the most knowledgeable persons on social welfare and development at the local level, MSWDOs now enjoy a certain degree of autonomy and authority they never experienced before. Many local social welfare officers recognize the fact that most mayors really do not know much about how they are supposed to do their work, and they take this as an opportunity to maximize whatever autonomy and privileges can be afforded by this state of affairs.</p>
<p>For many in the non-government sector, the devolution fitted well with their notion of development work that gave importance to the local and community self-reliance. This represents one of the key effects of the devolution. But the price paid for that appears to be the emergence of a notable variation across municipalities in terms of scope and scale of social service provision. While it could be argued that the problem may be one of implementation as against social policy due to the failure of the national government to provide mandated supplementary funds, one simply cannot overlook the implications of the policy of devolution as carried out in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The devolution allowed the Philippine state to further divest itself of its already minimal role in social welfare. This was creatively fashioned with the DSWD’s repositioning from a ‘rowing’ to a ‘steering’ function which, for many, forms part of the so-called new public management philosophy informed by free market ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811421618">Christensen and Lægreid, 2002</xref>). Apart from local governments, non-government organizations and other members of civil society now are given a greater role in local social welfare. The devolution promoted localized rather than integrated, national efforts in social welfare. The kinds and levels of provisions given to citizens have now been made contingent on the capability and preferences of local governments. In doing so, the devolution could be seen as having undermined the notion of a national, collective effort in addressing the basic social welfare needs of citizens. The devolution has resulted in a patchwork of services varying from one municipality to another. Given the current set-up, the kinds and levels of support citizens can expect from government now varies depending on the municipality in which one resides and, perhaps, on the local government administration currently in power. In a sense, there is no general standard of basic entitlements citizens can expect from government. In a way, this has consequently redefined Filipino citizenship. What it means to be a Filipino, insofar as local social welfare and related services are concerned, now varies from one locality and local administration to another. What one is entitled to in one locality is not necessarily assured in the next. With this come variations in the state’s commitment to citizens’ rights and welfare. A strong, rights-based perspective would put into question this approach in the promotion of social welfare.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The implementation of the Local Government Code of 1991 and the devolution of local social welfare services in the Philippines came with the promise of promoting local autonomy, empowerment and development through the provision of space for innovation and responsiveness on the part of local government units. The measures that have been taken towards this end have given all local government units a notable amount of political space and some local governments the financial resources to determine and fund their priorities in local social welfare as with devolved health care and agricultural support functions. This study found that the goal of allowing innovation and responsiveness in local social welfare provision has not really been achieved. Moreover, a much more fundamental issue was uncovered in how the devolution has reconfigured Philippine social policy. The Philippines’s experience in devolution provides credence to the concerns raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811421618">Schneider and Netting (1999)</xref> about how such moves can result in the widening of policy differences across localities and how this can compromise the protection of the rights of vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>What has not been clearly pointed out in most accounts of the devolution in the Philippines is how it represents a significant ideological shift in Philippine social policy. To many, the devolution may have appeared innocuous and may have even been deemed desirable. Couched in elegant language borrowed from what has become the veritable bible of new public management, the devolution accompanied by the DSWD’s repositioning was not met with notable resistance from social workers and development workers within and outside government, many of whom were enthralled by the promise of local empowerment, development and democratization, as a bigger role was given to local governments, non-government organizations and civil society, in general. But in welcoming devolution, social workers welcomed the advance of a policy regime underpinned by conservative ideology as a national social welfare system was dismantled in the name of local empowerment and development. In place of a national system is a patchwork of non-mandated, unregulated local initiatives after the new local government code divested provincial governors and the national DSWD with oversight powers over municipal governments. While ostensibly not deliberate, it hid from view the far-reaching implications of what is regarded by some as a legitimate development policy. It was, perhaps, for this reason that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811421618">Spies-Butcher (2002</xref>: 173) warned us of how the discourse on social capital and the uncritical valuing of the local can be used as an ideological ‘Trojan Horse’.</p>
<p>What practitioners need to realize is that the devolution does not only represent a change in their location in the institutional space comprising the national bureaucracy. Even if it does not appear to do so, devolution represents a fundamental change in the character of Philippine social policy and, as a consequence, of their work. The Philippines’s experience in the devolution of local social welfare can be likened to the shattering of Filipino citizenship into a thousand pieces in the way differences in policies and provisions between municipalities have widened and how the protection of vulnerable populations is now left to the discretion of local executives. What does it mean to be a Filipino? What does it mean when the national government commits the country to the promotion of social justice, the protection of human rights and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals? Given our experience with the devolution, the answer now seems to depend on which locality one resides in.</p>
<p>This study, of course, mainly applies to the Philippines. But, as noted earlier, globalization has seen a thrust across the globe towards the devolution of authority and resources from nation-states to regions and localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill, 2003</xref>). This raises the question of what effects devolution initiatives have had on social welfare services and social policy in other countries. Thailand’s decentralization process, started at around the same time as that in the Philippines, has also seen to a transfer of functions for primary health care and basic education to local government authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811421618">Amornvivat, 2004</xref>). Indonesia undertook what has been described as a ‘massive and drastic decentralization’ in 2001 which involved the transfer of functions and two million civil servants to local governments, supported in part by limited intergovernmental fund transfers from the central to local governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811421618">Brodjonegoro, 2004</xref>: 1). The experience of Pakistan in devolution has, according to the review undertaken by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811421618">Asian Development Bank, the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the World Bank (2004)</xref>, engendered more reliable and responsive service from the medical and teaching staff of devolved health and education services. But while most of the accounts speak of the merits of decentralization in enhancing responsiveness and improving service delivery, no critical discussion is being offered about how the processes of devolution have shaped the landscape of social policy and social welfare programs and services across these countries and what it means to be a citizen of these countries. The findings in this study suggest that there is a need to critically examine the ideological and practical implications of devolution initiatives in countries where these have occurred. At the very least, they point out that there is wisdom in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811421618">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill’s (2003)</xref> prescription for caution in the promotion of devolutionary efforts.</p>
