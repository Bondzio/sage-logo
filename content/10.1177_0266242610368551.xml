<abstract>
<p>This article reports the findings of a study that compared cross-national differences in how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) monitored political responses to the economic and financial crisis of 2007–2009. Original, empirical data collected through an online survey of 206 small business managers in France, Sweden and the UK were analysed to explore the extent that they monitored policy responses to the crisis, their motivations for doing so, and the sources of information they used for political intelligence gathering purposes. The findings show that the monitoring of political initiatives by SMEs in response to the recession varied in accordance with the extent to which their countries are affected by the recession. Also, small business managers on the whole considered it more important, despite the international nature of the crisis, to monitor political responses in national rather than supranational political settings. Contrary to our expectations, we found that SMEs across all three countries drew on similarly wide sources of information when monitoring policy responses to the crisis. Also surprising was the finding that SME managers in the UK relied heavily on official government sources when gathering intelligence on attempts to alleviate the recession’s effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2009, appropriately labelled a ‘global financial crisis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242610368551">Riaz, 2009</xref>), hit firms around the world on a scale not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Businesses that were long considered to rest on solid foundations failed on an unprecedented scale as the effects of the rapid financial downturn took their toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242610368551">Riaz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242610368551">Wong, 2009</xref>). The collapse of financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual in the USA sent shockwaves around the world, as witnessed by headlines in the <italic>Financial Times</italic> such as ‘Modern history’s greatest regulatory failure’ and ‘The end of American capitalism as we know it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242610368551">Wong, 2009</xref>). The crisis spread rapidly to other continents, countries and business sectors, with, for example, five European banks collapsing in as many days. This and other associated events called for governments around the world to take drastic measures to prevent a complete meltdown of their countries’ economies.</p>
<p>Although the media trained their attention during the crisis on the high-profile cases of corporate failure and bankruptcy, the effects of the financial crisis were also felt by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Indeed, a survey of 50,000 European small businesses conducted in April 2009 by UEAPME, the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, found that the financial crisis has adversely impacted most of Europe’s SMEs, reducing their rates of development and increasing the number of bankruptcies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242610368551">1</xref></sup> Small businesses in the European manufacturing and construction industries were hit particularly hard, with business confidence among small business managers falling to record low levels and firms increasingly turning to redundancies as a means to cut costs.</p>
<p>One consequence of the financial crisis was that the future survival of firms, both large and small, became increasingly dependent on political decisions taken to deal with the effects of the crisis. In this regard, the global financial crisis shared many commonalities with earlier large-scale crises experienced by both developed countries (for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991, Japan after 1989) and less developed countries (for example, Latin America in 1982, Asia in 1997, Russia and Brazil in 1998, Argentina in 2002). Just as these earlier crises, the financial crisis of 2007–2009 resulted in cancelled investments, reduced production, redundancies and reduced purchasing power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610368551">Allen and Snyder, 2009</xref>). The measures undertaken by governments to deal with the effects of the crisis were therefore vital in helping firms in their respective countries to survive the crisis.</p>
<p>This increased dependency of small businesses on government decisions raises a number of interesting research questions for academics, policymakers and small business owners. Indeed, because of the severity of the crisis, companies needed to keep informed about decisions taken by policymakers and how these decisions were likely to affect them. But how did small business owners keep abreast of the policy responses introduced by policymakers to alleviate the effects of the recession? Given the international characteristics of the crisis, which sources of information did they ultimately use to collect this intelligence?</p>
<p>In this article, we draw theoretical inspiration from existing research into strategic management, competitive intelligence gathering and corporate political activity (CPA) to develop and test hypotheses that analyse the approaches used by SMEs to monitor the initiatives introduced by policymakers in response to the international financial and economic crisis. Specifically, the hypotheses generated focus on (1) the extent to which SMEs engage in political monitoring and their motivations for doing so, (2) the sources of information they utilize for monitoring their political environments.</p>
<p>The primary contributions of this research are threefold. First, it engages actively with the political activities of SMEs. This is significant since, to date, scholars have tended to investigate the political actions of large firms. In addition, the research investigates the international political activities of SMEs where existing research had tended to focus on cross-border political activities from the perspective of multi-national enterprises (MNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610368551">Windsor, 2007</xref>). Second, the article deals with a policy issue that to date has not been addressed by existing CPA research. Crucially, whilst recent research has analysed firms’ attempts to monitor policy issues such as climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610368551">Kolk and Pinkse, 2007</xref>) or the regulations of chemicals use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242610368551">Lorenz et al., 2008</xref>), this article specifically addresses the highly topical issue of political responses to economic and financial crises. In particular, the research responds to the concerns raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610368551">Herbane (2010)</xref> that scholars need to pay closer attention to how small business owners think and act during crisis situations. Third, the research adopts a cross-national, comparative perspective to highlight similarities and differences in CPA across three countries with specific political traditions, notably ‘statist’ France, ‘corporatist’ Sweden and the ‘pluralist’ UK. This is important since the lion’s share of research into CPA is based on theories developed by and for North American scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242610368551">Hillman and Hitt, 1999</xref>). The cross-country perspective adopted here, we hope, will alert managers and business practitioners to cross-national differences in corporate political activity.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. In the next section, we draw on evidence patterns from existing literature to develop a framework of hypotheses addressing the extent to which SMEs engage in political monitoring. The third section describes an online survey of SMEs in France, Sweden and the UK that was used to test these hypotheses. We establish our methods of analysis, and present our findings in the fourth section. The article closes off with a discussion of the results, and proposes future avenues of enquiry.</p>

<title>Contextual background and hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section3-0266242610368551">
<title>Extent of and motivations for political monitoring by SMEs</title>
<p>The wide literature on strategic management teaches us that, in addition to gathering competitive, marketing and economic intelligence, firms also need to gather and analyse political intelligence as part of their environment scanning activities. Indeed, the commonly used frameworks for PEST (political, economic, social and technological), SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) and STEER (socio-cultural, technological, economic, ecological and regulatory factors) analyses all encourage firms to monitor how and to what extent they are affected by political factors, including political stability and specific policies in the areas of tax, employment law and environmental law.</p>
<p>This need for political monitoring is also emphasized in the literature on CPA, defined as ‘a concerted pattern of actions taken in the non-market environment to create value by improving overall performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610368551">Baron, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242610368551">Mantere et al., 2009</xref>). Monitoring is essential for CPA since, from a companies’ perspective, participation in the political process requires intelligence about decision-making at various levels in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242610368551">Taminiau and Wilts, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers active in the field of CPA have sought to understand what motivates firms to conduct political activities, including political monitoring (for an extensive review of the CPA literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610368551">Getz [1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242610368551">2001</xref>]). One explanation of why firms become politically involved is informed by resource dependency theory, which posits that an organization’s dependency on another for resources affects the nature of relationships between organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610368551">Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978</xref>). To date, empirical work has shown that the political activity of firms increases if they operate in highly regulated industries such as the telecommunications sector or if they depend on governments for favourable regulations, sales or trade protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610368551">Hart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610368551">Schuler et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of dependency, we argue, is also important for understanding why firms engage in political activities during the current economic and financial crisis. The increased dependency of firms on government action is observable, for example, in the construction industry. In the UK, for instance, the house-building industry is increasingly reliant on state aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610368551">Thomas, 2009</xref>), including for example the GBP 2.1 billion of housing investment announced by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown in June 2009 to fund the construction of 110,000 new homes by 2011 and create 45,000 new jobs in the construction sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610368551">Pickard, 2009</xref>). Research conducted by the National House Building Council suggests that, amid a historical slump in the UK housing market, the UK government is currently funding almost one-half of all new home building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610368551">Thomas, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In France, the automotive industry has been partly able to weather the economic storm thanks to a EUR 6 billion government support package announced in December 2008 which included the introduction of the EUR 1000 trade-in incentives offered to buyers of new cars implemented as part of a government-funded car-scrapping scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242610368551">Bintliff and Hollinger, 2009</xref>). In the retail sector, the decision taken by Alistair Darling, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, in November 2008 to reduce VAT from 17.5 to 15 per cent as part of the British government’s package of policy measures to boost the economy have helped to raise retailers’ turnover by GBP 2.1 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242610368551">McWilliams, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike France, the automotive industry in Sweden has been hit hard by the global recession. Because of fears that government support would be channelled to parent companies in the USA, the Swedish government has not issued loans to the car manufacturers. Furthermore, the government policy made clear that it was not in the interest of the Swedish state to support production of cars, for which there were no buyers. The support packages that the government proposed to supplier companies in the Swedish car manufacturing industry have been criticized because of their complexity; very few companies have been able to benefit from them. Just as in the UK, the construction industry has more or less halted as a result of financial crisis. Although representatives of the Swedish government have repeatedly stated that state finances are sound, the global economic downturn with weakened exports has had a direct impact on the country’s economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266242610368551">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The industries affected by the current economic downturn comprise not only the large, high-profile companies that have been rescued by government intervention. Rather, the industries are also populated by many SMEs, which either operate independently of the large players or act as suppliers to or customers of those large companies. Consequently, small businesses are also directly or indirectly affected by the ‘credit crunch’ and its subsequent recession and thus have an interest in tracking political responses aimed at alleviating its effects.</p>
<p>It should be stressed, however, that not all countries have been affected by the crisis to the same extent. Crucially, the European Commission’s analyses of the macro economic indicators during the first six months of 2009 demonstrate that the decline of industrial output in Sweden had been sharp. Although the UK economy also took a hard hit during this same period, it was apparent that the decline was not as severe as in Sweden. The negative trend had been apparent in the French industry during the first four months of 2009, while the figures reported for May and June demonstrated that decline had halted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0266242610368551">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Commission’s figures are corroborated by statistics published by the OECD. In the UK, for example, real GDP contracted 1.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2008, which was the steepest quarterly decline for 28 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0266242610368551">4</xref></sup> In total, the UK economy was expected to decline by 4.3 per cent and recover only mildly in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0266242610368551">5</xref></sup> In Sweden, the economy was facing a deeper contraction than during the domestic banking crisis of the early 1990s. Falling GDP was expected to produce a large output gap calling for measures to support demand and further measures to cap the rise in unemployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0266242610368551">6</xref></sup> In France, the real GDP was expected to fall by 3 per cent during 2009, with the pace of the economic contraction gradually diminishing later during the year. While France was less exposed to the collapse in the world trade than some other countries, the recovery during 2010 was predicted to be slow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0266242610368551">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additional data collected by the OECD and reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242610368551">Table 1</xref> suggest that France appeared to be less exposed to the collapse in world trade than Sweden or the UK.</p>

<p>Growth in GDP in each country peaked in 2006 at 2.4 per cent (France), 4.5 per cent (Sweden) and 2.8 per cent (UK) between 2006 and 2009. French GDP contracted from 2.4 to -3 per cent. The decline in GDP was much sharper in Sweden and the UK where over the same period GDP fell from 4.5 to -5.5 per cent and 2.4 to -4.3 per cent, respectively. In August 2009, it was reported by the French office of national statistics (INSEE) that consumer and public spending remained robust, the latter buoyed by large government stimulus programs that had helped the French economy grow by 0.3 per cent in April, May and June, thereby bringing the country officially out of recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242610368551">Wiesmann, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Assuming that firms monitor political developments during economic crises because they are dependent on policy outcomes, and assuming that the severity of the crisis’s effects differs across countries, we first hypothesize that:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1: SMEs in countries that are more strongly affected by the recession increase the time that they spend on political monitoring.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to understanding why firms engage in political activities, researchers in the field of CPA have also sought to identify where firms engage in corporate political activity. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610368551">Getz (1997)</xref> argued that firms become politically active in political settings where they believe their problems can best be resolved. Here, resource dependency theory suggests that, when monitoring political developments, managers focus their attention on policymaking bodies upon whose decisions their businesses are dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610368551">Getz, 1997</xref>). It follows, therefore, that when firms monitor political developments, they will direct their intelligence gathering activities at those political settings considered to have the greatest influence on their businesses.</p>
<p>Given the international characteristics of the current economic and financial crisis, initiatives to alleviate its effects are being formulated and implemented by elected officials in international political settings. This internationalization of policy measures to kick-start the global economy can be observed, for example, in the co-ordinated macro-policy measures agreed by the financial ministers and central banks for the G20 nations during the conference held in London in April 2009. Internationally coordinated policy responses to the recession can also be seen at the European level. Against a background of a seemingly increasing ‘Europeanization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610368551">Héritier et al., 2001</xref>), commonly understood as the influence of EU legislation on the practices and preferences of economic, social and political actors in its members states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610368551">Fairbrass and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610368551">Fairbrass, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610368551">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610368551">Greenwood, 2007</xref>), the European Commission has sought to initiate EU-wide policy measures aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial difficulties experienced by introducing directives, for example, that promote ‘responsible lending’ by banks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0266242610368551">8</xref></sup> In addition, one of the tasks of the Swedish presidency of the EU beginning in July 2009 was to agree on changes to the thorny issue of European financial regulation through the creation, for example, of a pan-European financial watchdog organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0266242610368551">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A closer inspection of policy measures introduced at the international and European levels to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis suggests, however, that they appear limited to longer-term solutions whose effects may take some time to trickle down into national legislation. By contrast, the shorter-term, ‘bread-and-butter’ policies that have a direct and immediate influence on firms, and in particular on SMEs, are being formulated and implemented primarily in domestic political settings. In the UK, for example, the government unveiled in November 2007 a GBP 20 billion emergency plan to steer the UK economy through the recession. At the heart of the measures was an immediate 2.5 per cent cut in VAT. Also included in the package was a financial support package worth GBP 7 billion for companies, including a delay in the planned 1p increase in corporation tax for small firms, and a GBP 600 increase in personal tax allowances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242610368551">Pickard et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In France, President Sarkozy unveiled in December 2008 a EUR 26 billion stimulus plan to help France fend off financial crisis. The measures introduced included a EUR 1 billion loan to car makers and their suppliers, EUR 5 billion of new public sector investments and EUR 11.5 billion worth of credits and tax breaks on company investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242610368551">Annan Diego Iscaro, 2008</xref>). For its part, the Swedish government presented several measures in response to the recession in its Budget Bill for 2009. Specifically, the government presented measures for jobs and adjustment worth a total of SEK 8.4 billion in 2009, and proposed to allow employers to defer tax payments in certain cases. Together with previously announced reforms, this means that the government put a total of SEK 41 billion into measures to respond to the crisis in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610368551">Stabrawa, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Assuming that firms will direct their intelligence gathering activities at those political settings considered to have the greatest influence on their businesses, and given that policy responses to the economic and financial crisis are being formulated mostly in domestic political settings, we hypothesize that:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2: The managers of SMEs consider it more important to monitor political responses to the financial crisis in domestic rather than international political settings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266242610368551">
<title>Sources of information used by SMEs to monitor political developments</title>
<p>When monitoring political responses to the financial crisis, firms have at their disposal a potentially wide range of information sources. In an article addressing the use of open source data for competitive and marketing intelligence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610368551">Fleisher (2008)</xref> presents a grid that illustrates the broad variety of information sources that are available to managers who deal with the gathering of intelligence. Examples of the sources highlighted by the grid include employees, customers, media, governmental reports and interest groups.</p>
<p>Elements of Fleisher’s grid illustrating the variety of intelligence sources available to firms can be found in the political monitoring activities of firms. Indeed, there has emerged a plethora of ‘how to’ books written by lobbying practitioners that describe the political intelligence gathering activities of firms and associations engaged in political action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610368551">Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242610368551">Clamen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242610368551">Thomson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242610368551">Geiger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610368551">Zetter, 2008</xref>). According to these volumes, firms can collect intelligence using the press, the information services of governments, trade associations, employers’ organizations, specialized public affairs cabinets and through personal contacts with political decision makers.</p>
<p>The literature on corporate political activity suggests that firms use cost as a selection criterion when choosing which sources of intelligence to use when monitoring political developments. Indeed, scholars have demonstrated that larger firms are more politically active than small firms precisely because they have at their disposal more resources for conducting political actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610368551">Schuler and Rehbein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242610368551">Hillman and Hitt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610368551">Schuler et al., 2002</xref>). Other researchers have focused attention on the concept of ‘organizational slack’, arguing that large firms with high levels of slack are able to pursue political activities because they possess the necessary under-utilized financial resources to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610368551">Meznar and Nigh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610368551">Schuler et al., 2002</xref>). Armed with the necessary resources, large firms are able to use internal sources, such as political action committees (PAC) and government affairs officers, to track political developments and inform policymakers of the consequences of a certain decision on their firms’ operations. In the absence of financial resources needed for such designated liaison people, SMEs are more reliant on external sources, such as business associations of which they are members, for the gathering and exchange of political intelligence. This reliance on business associations, we argue, is particularly true in the current climate of economic and financial uncertainty.</p>
<p>Following the discussion above, we propose to sharpen existing understandings of the sources of information used by SMEs to track political developments by drawing insights from cross-national research in political science. As has been discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610368551">Kohler-Koch (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610368551">Schmidt (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610368551">Eising (2003)</xref>, relationships between state actors and organized business interests (including firms) differ across countries. Some countries, such as Belgium, Ireland, the UK and Italy, have ‘pluralist’ systems, which are characterized by a large number of business groups involved in policymaking, each representing the interests of specific firms or industries and offering specialized information services tailored to the needs of their members.</p>
<p>In ‘corporatist’ countries such as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, only a limited number of business interest groups are directly involved in the policymaking process, typically national-level associations representing the interests of employers and employees, As a result, policy negotiations in such countries can be monopolized by a select number of groups. In Germany, for example, the programme of ‘concerted action’ launched by Economics Minister Karl Schiller in the 1960s and the Alliance for Jobs created by former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 1998 provide evidence for a long tradition of limiting participation in policymaking to the Federation of German Industry (BDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610368551">Casey and Gold, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In ‘statist’ countries, business interest groups play only a limited role in the policymaking process, which is otherwise dominated by state actors, including ministers, elected officials and civil servants. The participation of business interests in policymaking is allowed, if at all, only after the main contents and direction of a policy have been established. Countries regarded as having a statist system of interest intermediation include France, where interest group activity has historically been repressed and participation in the policymaking limited strictly to a small number of outside actors, such as like-minded technocrats and business personalities who attended the same prestigious education establishments as politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242610368551">Maclean et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These cross-national differences in relationships between the state and business, we contend, can influence SMEs’ choice of sources when gathering political intelligence. Crucially, because they have at their disposal a large number of business interest groups, many offering specialized information services, SMEs in pluralist countries will be able to consult a wide range of external information sources when engaged in political monitoring. Since political participation in corporatist countries is limited to a small number of national-level business associations, SMEs from such countries will tend to use the information services provided by national level associations. Since policymaking in statist systems is dominated by an elite of politicians, civil servants and leading business personalities, with business associations having only a limited role in the process, SMEs from such countries will tend to rely on official, government sources for political intelligence rather than the information services of business associations.</p>
<p>Thus, assuming that, given their absence of resources, SMEs are likely to be more reliant on business associations for gathering and exchanging political intelligence, and assuming that the number and role of business associations differ across countries, our third hypothesis is that:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3a: The number of business associations representing the interests of SMEs differs between the three countries.</p>
<p>H3b: SMEs in pluralist countries are more likely to utilize the information services of a wider range of intelligence sources than SMEs in corporatist and statist countries.</p>
<p>H3c: SMEs in corporatist countries are more likely to utilize the information services of national-level associations than SMEs in pluralist and statist countries.</p>
<p>H3d: SMEs in statist countries are more likely to utilize the information services of domestic governmental bodies than SMEs in corporatist and pluralist countries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses, managers of SMEs in France, Sweden and the UK were asked to answer a questionnaire on their political intelligence gathering activities during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. The questionnaires were distributed via email with a cover letter asking the respondents to answer an online questionnaire. Emails with such requests were sent to 1995 managers in the three countries; 684 in France, 536 in Sweden and 775 in the UK. Spam filters and incorrect email addresses made it necessary to exclude 183 addresses. These excluded addresses were roughly evenly distributed between the three countries.</p>
<p>The French SMEs were identified from a database of companies predominantly headquartered in north-western France maintained by the ESC Rennes School of Business. In the absence of such a database of Swedish and British companies, it was decided to compile a convenience sample from the membership lists and business directories of regional chambers of commerce in each country. Companies were randomly selected from these lists. The initial samples of pre-selected companies were further reduced by selecting only those companies that published the contact information of their management staff on their websites.</p>
<p>In the case of Sweden, the majority of the respondent companies were located in southern Sweden. Roughly one-quarter of the companies came from Värmland in western Sweden and about 15 per cent are located in the region of Mälardalen, which is west of Stockholm. In the UK, just over one-half of the sample companies are located in England, and approximately one-third were located in Scotland. The remaining companies were fairly equally divided between Wales and Northern Ireland. No companies headquartered in Paris, Stockholm or London were contacted for the purpose of the survey. This was because companies located outside capital cities have reasons for organizing regional interest groups and lobbying organizations with respect to political decision makers located in Paris, Stockholm and London, respectively.</p>
<p>The survey was distributed the first time at the end of May 2009, followed by a reminder two weeks later and a second reminder at the end of June. The response rate remained fairly even over time: we received 77 responses from the initial mailing, and 71 and 58 responses from the subsequent reminder mailings. In all, the survey rendered 206 eligible responses, which translates as a final response rate of 11.4 per cent (206/1812). To assess the possibility of non-response bias, we split the data into three parts according to the dates of responses to our online survey. Because of the ordinal data that some of our questions rendered and because some variables did not meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance, we used a non-parametric test (Kruskal–Wallis H) to test for differences between the variables obtained at each collection time. This test revealed that there is no significant difference between the variables for the different collection periods. There is no evidence of non-response bias, which means that there is no significant difference between those who responded and those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242610368551">Armstrong and Overton, 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610368551">Table 2</xref> summarizes information about the distribution between the three countries and the industrial sectors of the respondent companies.</p>

<title>Motivations for political monitoring by SMEs</title>
<p>It was first hypothesized that SMEs in countries strongly affected by the recession would attach greater importance to political monitoring. To measure the importance that firms attach to political monitoring, we asked respondents to tell us how much time they invested in it. The more time they invested, the greater the importance we assumed they would attach to political monitoring. To measure how strongly France, Sweden and the UK were affected by the recession, we examined changes in each country’s GDP. From the figures presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242610368551">Table 1</xref>, we saw that the country hardest hit by the recession was Sweden, followed by UK. The country least affected by the recession – indeed the country that officially emerged from recession during the summer of 2009 – was France. Thus, we predicted that SMEs in Sweden would attach the greatest importance to monitoring, followed by SMEs in the UK. SMEs in France, we expected, would attach the least importance to political monitoring.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was tested using the Kruskal–Wallis H test. This test was chosen because the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test revealed that data was non-normally distributed. A second reason for choosing a non-parametric test was the ordinal data obtained from the respondents’ assessments of whether the amount of time that they spent for monitoring of political initiatives to deal with the crisis had increased, stayed the same, or decreased. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610368551">Table 3</xref>, there is a significant difference between the SMEs in the three countries with regard to the effects of the recession on the time that they spent monitoring political initiatives.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610368551">Table 3</xref>, the Kruskal–Wallis H test demonstrates that there is support for H1 (H = 6.83, df = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.050). The descriptive data also displayed in the table illustrate that in particular respondents from Sweden had increased the time that they spent monitoring political initiatives. The SMEs from France and UK also reported such changes but the number of those which had increased their monitoring was considerably lower than in Sweden. We can therefore conclude that there is a positive relationship between the depth of the recession and the amount of political monitoring.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis argued that SME managers would consider it more important to monitor political responses to the economic and financial crisis taken at domestic rather than in international political settings. The data used to test this hypothesis were obtained from questions asking respondents to assess on a five-point scale (ranging from not important to extremely important) the importance of monitoring developments at the local/regional, national, European and international level respectively. The descriptive data obtained from asking this question are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242610368551">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>The variable representing the importance attached to domestic level monitoring was based upon the mean values of the respondents’ assessment of monitoring political initiatives at the local/regional and the national levels. Correspondingly, the variable representing the importance attached to international monitoring was based upon the mean values of the managers’ opinions on the importance of following political developments at the European and the international levels.</p>
<p>A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test revealed that the variables representing the opinions of managers in the three countries violated the assumption of normality. We therefore used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test whose results supported H2, revealing that the perceived importance of domestic monitoring levels was significantly higher (<italic>Z</italic>= -2.790, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.050) than the perceived importance of international monitoring levels for European managers as a whole.</p>
<p>As a matter of interest, we also analysed the data collected to identify any cross-country differences regarding whether SMEs in one particular country were more or less likely to undertake political monitoring at the international or domestic levels. Knowing that ANOVA is robust to violations of assumptions of equal variance and difference in sample sizes, we tested the data using one-way ANOVA with Hochberg’s GT2 and Tamhane’s T2 post hoc tests to find out which countries differed significantly from the others in their perception of the importance of domestic and international monitoring. Hochberg’s GT2 test was chosen to deal with the problem of different sample sizes. Tamhane’s T2 test was chosen since it is able to deal with situations in which variances differ.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242610368551">Table 5</xref> illustrates that there are significant differences (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) between SME managers’ views on the importance of monitoring of political developments at the domestic level in the UK, France and Sweden, with the UK expressing the most concern for this issue (followed by France and Sweden who do not show much difference in the perception of importance of domestic monitoring). The post hoc tests showed that the UK’s score differed significantly from those of Sweden and France (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the scores for these latter two countries (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5). In other words, SME managers in Sweden and France find it less important to monitor in a domestic setting than managers in the UK.</p>

<p>With regard to the monitoring of political developments at the international level, our findings demonstrate that there is also a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042), between the opinions of SME managers in the three countries, with Sweden attributing the most importance to international monitoring, followed in this case by the UK then France. Post hoc tests showed that there were significant differences in this variable between Sweden and France (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.50), but that there was no significant difference between the UK and Sweden or between the UK and France. Thus we can say that Swedish managers regard the monitoring of international political initiatives in response to the current economic crisis to be more important than their colleagues in France.</p>
<p>The final testing was conducted on each country separately to investigate whether there were significant differences with regard to the respondents’ opinions about the importance of monitoring political developments in a domestic or in an international setting. Results from the Wilcoxon’s Sign-Rank Test revealed that respondents from the UK and France thought that it was more important to monitor initiatives at the domestic rather than at an international level (<italic>Z</italic>= −3.463, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.050). The test of the Swedish SMEs, by contrast, indicated that respondents thought that both levels were equally important to monitor (Wilcoxon’s Sign-Rank T-test <italic>Z</italic>= −0.298, <italic>p</italic> = 0.766). However, an interesting finding is the fact that the SMEs from France and the UK think that it is more important to monitor political initiatives at the domestic level than on the international level. Thus, managers’ opinions in these countries explain much of the support for H2.</p>

<title>Sources used by SMEs to monitor political developments</title>
<p>Our third hypothesis (H3a) was based upon the assumption that the number of business associations representing the interests of SMEs differs across the three countries. To test this hypothesis, we asked respondents to specify which business associations represented their interests. Six possible answers were proposed: local/regional chambers of commerce, regional business associations, national employers’ association (specifically, the Confederation of British Industry in the UK, the Medef in France, and Svenskt Näringsliv in Sweden), main national-level small business associations (specifically, the Federation of Small Businesses [FSB] in the UK, the General Confederation of Small and Medium sized Enterprises [CGPME] in France, and Företagarna in Sweden), national trade associations, and European trade associations. The list of possible answers was adapted for each country to reflect cross-national differences in the names of business associations.

<p>Two interesting observations emerge from this data. First, more Swedish SME managers, compared to their French and British counterparts, claimed that their political interests were represented by national-level SME associations. Indeed, 51 Swedish respondents (or 24.6 per cent) claimed that Företagarna represented their interests, compared to 6 (or 14 per cent) of the British and 6 (or 10.5 per cent) of the French respondents who claimed that the FSB and the CGPME, respectively, represented their interests. Second, fewer Swedish SME managers, compared to their French and British homologues, claimed that national-level trade associations represented their interests. Specifically, only 11 of the Swedish respondents (or 5.3 per cent) claimed that such associations represented their interests, compared to 20 (or 47.6 per cent) of British respondents and 24 (or 42.1 per cent) of French respondents.</p>
<p>Based on the descriptive data, the number of associations representing SMEs’ interests could range from 0 to 6 types of association, meaning that parametric tests could then be used to compare mean memberships at a country level in the subsequent analysis. The assumption of homogeneity of variance was met for the tested variable. H3a was then tested using ANOVA, which revealed that there is support (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for this hypothesis. The three countries differed with respect to the number of associations that SMEs use to gather political intelligence. To further examine the differences between countries, we used Hochberg’s GT2 post hoc test to handle the different sample sizes. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0266242610368551">Table 7</xref>, the post hoc test demonstrates that the number of associations that the Swedish SMEs utilize for political intelligence purposes is significantly higher compared with the number of associations utilized by SMEs in France and in the UK.</p>

<p>We also predicted (H3b) that SMEs in a pluralist country such as the UK would utilize the information services of the widest range of intelligence sources, (H3c) that SMEs in a corporatist country such as Sweden would be most likely to utilize the information services of national-level associations, and (H3d) that SMEs in a statist country such as France would utilize more information services of national government agencies than SMEs in the other two countries.</p>
<p>The variables used to test these specific hypotheses were gathered by presenting respondents with 13 predefined sources of political intelligence (the press, local/regional chambers of commerce, local/regional government, national-level employers’ associations, national level small-business associations, national trade associations, national government, international trade associations, international organizations, contacts in political parties, consulting companies, personal networks and other sources). Respondents were asked to indicate the frequency with which they used such sources. Here, the possible options were never, rarely, occasionally and frequently. The final variables used for testing H3b, H3c and H3d were calculated using the average frequencies with which SME managers respectively used all 13 sources (for H3b), national associations (for H3c), and national governmental bodies (for H3d). This calculation resulted in a numerical mean suitable for parametric tests.</p>
<p>Levene’s test revealed that the variables used for testing of H3b–d met the assumption of homogeneity of variance. We used ANOVA to examine the differences among the mean values of the variables. The differences of the mean values that ANOVA demonstrated was then examined further using Hochberg’s GT2 post hoc <italic>t</italic>-test to deal with the different sample sizes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the descriptive data show that, compared to their Swedish homologues, British and in particular French SME managers are less likely to use their national SME associations as a source of political intelligence. Specifically, only 9 (or 15.8 per cent) of the French and 10 (or 23.8 per cent) of the British respondents claimed to frequently or occasionally use, respectively, the CGMPE and the FSB for gathering information about political responses to the recession. This contrasts sharply with respondents from Sweden, 55 (or 51.4 per cent) of whom claimed to frequently or occasionally use the information services of Företagarna to collect such intelligence.</p>
<p>The results of the ANOVA test conducted on this descriptive data are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0266242610368551">Table 10</xref>.

<p>Comparing the results obtained from all three countries, it is SMEs from the UK that utilized intelligence from governmental bodies the most frequently. Contrary to our prediction that SMEs from a statist country such as France would most frequently use governmental bodies as a source of political intelligence, our test demonstrates that SMEs from the UK are more active in utilizing such sources. Our findings, therefore, suggest that there is no support for H3d. The differences between the countries that ANOVA pointed out were due to the mean value of the Swedish SMEs being significantly lower than those reported for SMEs in the UK and France.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266242610368551" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and discussion</title>
<p>The above results include several key findings. First, they show that the monitoring of political initiatives by SMEs in response to the recession varies in accordance with the extent to which their countries are affected by the recession. Our findings are, therefore, in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242610368551">Sawyerr et al. (2003)</xref> in demonstrating that times of environmental uncertainty affect SMEs’ monitoring activities. Specifically, we found that it was in Sweden, the country in our survey hardest hit by the recession, where SMEs had most increased the time they invested in political monitoring. In France, the country least effected by the recession, SMEs had least increased the time they invested in political monitoring. This finding is consistent with those of scholars in the field of CPA who explain firms’ motivations to become politically engaged using resource dependency. However, it extends the existing research by suggesting that firms depend on government not only because they operate in highly regulated industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610368551">Hart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610368551">Schuler et al., 2002</xref>), but because, during times of economic uncertainty, they are also dependent on government action to secure their long-term survival and well-being.</p>
<p>Our second finding is that, notwithstanding the international characteristics of the recession and the political initiatives undertaken at the international level to alleviate its effects, the managers of SMEs, on the whole, consider it more important to monitor political responses to the economic and financial crisis taken at domestic rather than in international political settings. However, when the responses obtained from SMEs in the individual countries are compared and contrasted, we find that respondents from Sweden attach greater importance than their counterparts in France and the UK to monitoring political responses to the recession at the international level. One possible explanation for this finding can be found in the specific characteristics of the Swedish economy. Indeed, compared to France and the UK, Sweden has a relatively small national economy and is thus heavily reliant on foreign trade. Since the Swedish economy is highly dependent on the economic health of its international trading partners, it is probable that Swedish SMEs find it necessary to monitor political developments affecting those partners.</p>
<p>In any case, these two findings confirm existing research suggesting that, when firms monitor political developments, they direct their intelligence gathering activities at those political settings that they consider to have the greatest influence on their businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610368551">Getz, 1997</xref>). It is clear that SMEs in France and the UK believe that domestic politicians have more influence over their businesses than their counterparts in supranational organizations, such as the EU. This makes sense insofar as SMEs in these two countries perceive policy initiatives taken at the domestic level are those that can most directly help firms that are in trouble. They may also perceive that international initiatives may take some time to have an impact on SMEs, especially since, in the case of EU directives, they need to be passed into national law by domestic governmental institutions. It is also apparent that SMEs in Sweden perceive that policymakers in other countries also have an influence over their businesses. Again, this is logical in the context of Sweden’s interdependence with other trading nations.</p>
<p>The finding that SME managers, on the whole, consider it more important to monitor political responses to the crisis taken in domestic political settings is consistent with the findings of other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610368551">Bennett, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610368551">Coen and Dannreuther, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610368551">Greenwood, 2007</xref>) who demonstrate that, in terms of gathering and exchanging information about policy developments, national political arenas are perceived to be more important than the European political stage. However, our findings build on the existing research insofar as they apply explicitly to individual SME managers operating in a crisis (eg. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610368551">Herbane, 2010</xref>), rather than to the business associations that represent them.</p>
<p>The finding also challenges scholars of Europeanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610368551">Héritier et al., 2001</xref>) who suggest that firms in the EU member states are increasingly affected by policy decisions taken by the European Union and its institutions. For example, prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610368551">Fairbrass and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610368551">Fairbrass, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610368551">2004</xref>) has demonstrated that European telecommunications, energy and environmental policies are having a greater impact on firms, which as a result are increasingly targeting their information gathering and interest representation activities at the European level. However, our finding that SME managers from France and the UK consider it more important to monitor policies in response to the recession in their national political arenas rather than in Brussels suggests that not all policy decisions taken in Brussels have the same effect on firms in the EU’s member states, or that the respondent firms in France and the UK underestimate the influence of European policy decisions on their businesses.</p>
<p>Our testing of H3a demonstrated that the number of business associations representing SMEs was higher in Sweden than in France and the UK. However, although Sweden is the country that has been hit the hardest among the three countries, the higher number of associations may not be explained by the effects of the financial recession alone. Rather, it is probable that, owing to Sweden’s small domestic market, SMEs have used the services of national business associations to obtain information and assistance when searching for market opportunities abroad. Furthermore, Sweden has a tradition of dominant national-level associations in which membership connects individual SMEs to a wider network. Thus, it is this tradition rather than being severely hit by the effects of the financial crisis that could possibly explain why the number of associations representing the Swedish SMEs was higher than in the other two countries. In other words, the cultural traits of each country are partly determining the number of associations that represent SMEs in the same way that national culture influences the networks that SMEs develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242610368551">Drakopoulou Dodd et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The interesting observations that emerged from the descriptive data underpinning the testing of H3a (as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0266242610368551">Table 6</xref>) also merit further discussion. That more SME managers from Sweden than from France or the UK claimed that their political interests were represented by national-level SME associations may possibly be explained by the different reputations of SME associations in different countries. For example, the FSB in the UK has a historical image as a militant association which has struggled to attract and retain a more stable membership and obtain insider advantages in the policymaking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242610368551">Jordan and Halpin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242610368551">Bennett and Ramsden, 2007</xref>). Such reputational issues may also account for our finding, when analysing the descriptive data underpinning the testing of H3c (as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0266242610368551">Table 9</xref>), that British and French SME managers are less likely than their Swedish counterparts to use their national SME associations as a source of political intelligence.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, when testing H3b, we did not find support for our hypothesis that SMEs in a pluralist country such as the UK would utilize a wider range of sources to obtain intelligence about political initiatives to deal with the effects of the financial crisis than in France and Sweden. Rather, there was only a marginal difference between the three countries with regard to the number of sources that the SMEs utilized for this purpose. This finding could possibly be explained by the fact that our survey was conducted during the campaigns for the European Elections, which took place in June 2009. During these campaigns, policymakers in all three countries made significant efforts to inform and convince voters about their domestic plans to respond to the recession. Consequently, policy initiatives in response to the crisis were reported extensively by the media in each country. We can also expect that the managers of SMEs discussed political parties’ plans to alleviate the effects of the recession with the members of their personal networks. This wide availability of information about solutions to the crisis in the public domain could possibly have reduced the differences in political intelligence gathering activities that we expected to observe between countries characterized as pluralist, corporatist and statist systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610368551">Kohler-Koch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610368551">Schmidt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610368551">Eising, 2003</xref>) after testing of H3b.</p>
<p>In line with our predictions when formulating H3c, we found evidence to suggest that SMEs in a corporatist country such as Sweden would be most likely to utilize the information services of national-level associations. This finding is, therefore, in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610368551">Eising (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610368551">Kohler-Koch (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610368551">Schmidt (1999)</xref> since the Swedish corporatist system puts the national-level associations in a more or less monopolized position in negotiations with policy makers. Acting in this position, the national-level associations become an important interface that channels information between policymakers and the SMEs. Although not statistically significant, an interesting observation is that SMEs from France were the ones with the lowest number of national-level associations representing them. This observation, therefore, further confirms the proposals of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610368551">Eising (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610368551">Kohler-Koch (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610368551">Schmidt (1999)</xref> in demonstrating that SMEs from a country representing the statist system, where only a few outsider actors may participate in the policymaking process, have the lowest incentives to join such associations and use their information services.</p>
<p>Also contrary to our expectations, we found when testing H3d that SMEs in the UK use the information services of domestic governmental bodies more frequently than their French counterparts. This seems all the more surprising since our survey was conducted at a time when Gordon Brown’s Labour Government was suffering a crisis of credibility, being blamed by large swathes of the British business community for having caused the recession and trailing behind the opposition Conservative Party in the political polls. One speculative explanation for this unexpected use of governmental sources of political intelligence by British SMEs could be that, given that the recession has affected the UK economy more strongly than the French economy, the British government has, compared to its French counterpart, more actively sought to introduce and, above all, publicize measures designed to alleviate the effects of the crisis. The effects of the European Election campaigns, as discussed above, may also have raised the British SMEs’ attention towards initiatives of national governmental bodies to alleviate the effects of the recession.</p>
<p>A further, interesting finding that emerged from testing H3d was that Swedish SMEs report a lower frequency than their counterparts in France and the UK with regard to obtaining intelligence from governmental bodies. This finding further confirms the conclusions drawn from H3a. Indeed, it demonstrates the effect on SMEs of the corporatist system with its dominant associations at national level representing the Swedish SMEs in the communication with the policymakers. In spite of Sweden being hit harder by the recession than France, the Swedish SMEs did not turn to governmental agencies to obtain information about rescue packages and other efforts to alleviate the crisis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article used original primary evidence, collected through an on-line survey of 206 small business managers in France, Sweden and the UK, to analyse the political monitoring activities of SMEs. Unlike previous research in the field, the article, first, engaged actively with the international political activities of SMEs. Second, it dealt with a topical policy issue, chiefly the economic and financial crisis of 2007–2009. Third, it adopted a cross-national, comparative perspective to highlight similarities and differences in political monitoring among SMEs in three culturally and politically diverse countries.</p>
<p>As expected, the monitoring of political initiatives by SMEs in response to the recession was found to vary in accordance with the extent to which their countries are affected by the recession. Also, small business managers on the whole consider it more important to monitor political responses to the economic and financial crisis taken in national rather than supranational political settings. What we did not expect, however, was that SMEs across all three countries would draw on similarly wide sources of information when monitoring policy responses to the crisis. Neither did we expect that small business managers in the UK would rely so heavily on official government sources when gathering intelligence on attempts to alleviate the recession’s effects.</p>
<p>These findings engage with debates across numerous academic disciplines. Indeed, they build on the existing body of knowledge about firms’ political activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610368551">Getz, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242610368551">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242610368551">Taminiau and Wilts, 2006</xref>), first by specifically addressing SMEs’ needs for intelligence about political decision-making at various levels of society, and, second, by focusing on how firms react to policy respon-ses to economic crises. The research contributes to resource-dependency-based accounts of CPA research by suggesting that firms engage in political activities not only because they operate in highly regulated industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610368551">Hart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610368551">Schuler et al., 2002</xref>), but also because they rely on government action for their long-term survival and well-being.</p>
<p>In addition, the findings contribute to prior research into Europeanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610368551">Héritier et al., 2001</xref>). Crucially, they highlight that country-specific political structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610368551">Eising, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610368551">Kohler-Koch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610368551">Schmidt, 1999</xref>) continue to affect the political activities of SMEs. They also add to existing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610368551">Fairbrass and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610368551">Fairbrass 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610368551">2004</xref>) by suggesting that not all policy initiatives implemented in Brussels have the same impact on firms in each of the EU’s member states. Moreover, since our findings are based on the SME managers’ perceptions during a time of great economic and financial uncertainty, they confirm the proposals of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242610368551">Sawyerr et al. (2003)</xref> that such conditions affect SMEs’ monitoring activities. However, our findings build further on these proposals by exposing national differences with regard to political monitoring by SMEs.</p>
<p>In addition to its theoretical implications, our research also has important implications for practitioners and policymakers. For example, from the perspective of SME managers, our findings cast light on the sources of information that their competitors are using to weather the economic and financial storm. Our research also has implications for the managers of business associations that represent SMEs’ interests. Specifically, the finding that SME managers consider it more important to monitor political developments at the regional and national level should encourage the managers of domestic business associations to focus on providing intelligence on regional and national-level policy developments when designing their information-service offerings. This finding also suggests that the managers of European associations representing the interests of SMEs must undertake a more concerted effort to convince SME managers of the impact of European policy measures on their businesses. Last but not least, the findings are also important for policymakers, both in domestic and European policy arenas, insofar as they expose the information sources frequently used by SMEs managers to gather political intelligence. By revealing the sources of political intelligence used by SME managers, our research thus highlights the channels through which policymakers can communicate their policy proposals more effectively with the SME community.</p>
<p>These findings, of course, should be handled with caution given the relatively small sample sizes obtained from France and the UK. Similarly, since our study demonstrates that countries differ with regard to SMEs’ approaches to obtain political intelligence, care should be taken in not assuming that our results will apply to SMEs in other national contexts. These are clearly areas for further work. The unexpected findings of our research also demonstrate the need for further enquiry. For example, our explanations as to why small business managers in the UK made considerable use of governmental information sources when monitoring the recession remain largely speculative. Thus, a survey could be undertaken to ask SME managers why they prefer to use certain sources of political intelligence over others, and more clearly identify the factors that encourage or discourage them to use the information services of national governments. Factors that could be explored in the survey might include the governing party’s track record in supporting business, its time in office, the market for political intelligence services, and the trust placed by SME managers in other providers of political intelligence (such as business associations).</p>
<p>Future research could also focus on better understanding the effects of Europeanization on SMEs domiciled in the EU member states. This is because our findings may be interpreted to mean that policy decisions taken in Brussels are perceived, especially amongst British and French respondents, to have little impact on the day-to-day running of SMEs. Further research could be conducted to ascertain whether this finding applies across all policy areas, or whether there are instances when SMEs do actually consider it more important to monitor political developments at the European level than at the national level. Drawing on theoretical insights from resource dependency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610368551">Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978</xref>), one potentially fruitful avenue of research could focus on whether ascertaining the propensity of SME managers to monitor European political developments is linked to whether they operate in industries that face high levels of regulatory scrutiny from Brussels.</p>
