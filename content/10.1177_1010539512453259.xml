<abstract>
<p>Human resources for health (HRH) are a crucial component of a well-functioning health system. Problems in the global HRH supply and distribution are an obstacle to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals and other health outcomes. The Pacific Island region, covering 20 000 to 30 000 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, is suffering a serious HRH crisis. Yet updated evidence and data are not available for the 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The objective of this study was thus to explore the current HRH situation in the Pacific Island region, focusing particularly on the issue of health workforce migration. HRH trends and gaps differ by country, with some showing increases in HRH density over the past 20 years whereas others have made negligible progress. Currently, three Pacific Island countries are facing critical HRH shortages, a worsening of the situation from 2006, when HRH issues were first brought to widespread global attention. In this region, skilled personnel migration is a major issue contributing to the limited availability of HRH. Political commitment from source and destination countries to strengthen HRH would be a key factor toward increasing efforts to train new health personnel and to implement effective retention strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Profound inadequacies in available human resources for health (HRH) pose a persistent global challenge with far-reaching repercussions. Critical shortages are often coupled with skill mix imbalances and uneven geographic distribution. The resulting HRH crisis creates a serious bottleneck for achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals and other health development objectives, including the emerging health systems agenda of tackling noncommunicable diseases in low-income and middle-income countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453259">1</xref></sup> Health workforce insufficiencies also negatively affect preparedness for and response to global security threats posed by emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, including avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and hemorrhagic fevers, as well as natural and man-made disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453259">2</xref></sup> Moreover, with the growing impact of climate change on health, the need for skilled health workers is greater than ever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453259">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) underscored the key challenges facing the world’s health workforce in its annual World Health Report (WHR) for 2006, titled, “Working Together for Health.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453259">4</xref></sup> Among the key HRH challenges highlighted was the adverse effect of health workers out-migration, a factor that continues to be especially significant among the low-income countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453259">5</xref></sup> Loss of health workers through migration not only weakens already compromised health systems but also represents a costly loss of scarce and expensively trained human capital. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, financial losses due to migration of doctors from only nine countries was estimated at more than $2 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453259">6</xref></sup> Loss of significant numbers of key health workers affects core national strategies for health sector development, creating problems for health care as well as for human resource planning and development. Countries most affected by such impacts tend to be relatively poorly performing economies, notably the small Pacific Island states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453259">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite advances in bringing the health workforce to the fore in international health policy arenas and alongside individual examples of progress in tackling the problem, the health workforce continues to be acutely felt in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). Based on projections for health care professional shortages in 2015, the greatest doctor shortages will be in PICTs—Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Vanuatu, both of which have a 0.50 doctor per 1000 population deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453259">8</xref></sup> Yet evidence for this critical region is still very limited. Since the WHR 2006, no synthesis of available HRH data has been undertaken for the 22 PICTs comprising the WHO for Western Pacific Region.</p>
<p>The PICTs cover 20 000 to 30 000 islands located over a vast stretch of the South Pacific Ocean. Population sizes range from 1167 in Tokelau to 6 609 745 in PNG, with wide variations in social and economic conditions, health infrastructure, and health workforce training throughout the region. Despite the uniqueness of each nation or territory, the region shares a number of distinct and broadly common characteristics: small populations dispersed over large distances, occupying small land areas and vulnerable to environmental threats and natural disasters. Moreover, they share a lack of resources and a geographical isolation that is the basis of many of the challenges they face in health workforce education, training, and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453259">9</xref></sup> Like many other parts of the world, the region has recently experienced a major shift in disease burden, with noncommunicable diseases overtaking communicable diseases as a critical health and development issue; rates of chronic disease in PICTs are now among the highest in the world and the leading cause of morbidity and death in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453259">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453259">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The well-known link between health workforce density, service delivery, and population health outcomes has been clearly demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453259">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512453259">13</xref></sup> The impact is reflected in health system performance indicators, including measures of maternal and child health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512453259">14</xref></sup> It is not then surprising that some of the highest under-5 and maternal mortality rates are found in PICTs, where ratios of health workers to population are especially low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539512453259">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539512453259">2</xref>). Of particular note, the migration of health workers, both regionally and internationally, imposes a significant burden on the health sectors of countries in the Pacific Island region. It is in this context that we frame the present review of the current state of HRH in the 22 PICTs.</p>

<title>Current State of Human Resources for Health</title>
<p>In the WHR 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453259">4</xref></sup> PNG was the only country of the 22 PICTs to be listed as one of the 57 countries facing critical shortage of HRH. Recent data from the Western Pacific country health information profiles 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512453259">15</xref></sup> show changes in the health workforce density in these countries compared with the data presented in the WHR 2006 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539512453259">Table 3</xref>). Among the PICTs, although the average density of doctors, nurses, and midwives has increased to 4.87 per 1000 population (from 3 per 1000 population in 2006), the number of countries with critical shortages has also increased to 3. In PNG, health workforce density remains critically low at 0.52 per 1000 population; meanwhile, Samoa and Vanuatu have also acquired HRH crisis status with health workforce densities of 1.21 and 1.73 per 1000 population, respectively. The Solomon Islands are also worth mentioning here, as the territory has a health workforce density of 2.32 per 1000 population, at the borderline of the critical shortage cutoff. On the other hand, there are PICTs such as Tokelau and Niue with densities as high as 13.61 and 12.67 per 1000 population, respectively.</p>

<title>Migration of Human Resources for Health From the Pacific Islands</title>
<sec id="section6-1010539512453259">
<title>Migration Patterns</title>
<p>The capacity of a health system to deliver services to a population depends critically on the availability of a skilled health workforce. Loss of significant numbers of health workers not only hampers progress toward the Millennium Development Goals but also affects service provision, quality of care, and distribution of the health workforce. In broad terms, it contributes to the poor performance of health systems in the region. Although health workforce availability in the countries that retain a close political relationship with the United States (US-affiliated Pacific Islands) is better than in other PICTs, partially because of better salaries and working conditions, migration of skilled health workers is considered to be the major cause of health workforce shortages in the PICTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three types of migration of health workers can be observed in the Pacific Region according to Diallo’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512453259">24</xref></sup> classification on migration: internal, international, and the “cross-industry” migration of workers leaving the health sector to work in the nonhealth sector. The first type, internal migration, is the movement of health workers within a country, from district to district, or between rural and urban areas. In the Pacific Region, this type of migration has grown significantly as more people move from outer and isolated rural areas to more metropolitan coastal regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> Disparities in the urban–rural distribution of health workforce have increased, as the nation’s general population has concentrated in more urban areas, such as Tongatapu in Tonga, Upolu in Samoa, South Tarawa in Kiribati, and Efate in Vanuatu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>International migration is the second type of movement, in which health workers temporarily or permanently settle abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512453259">24</xref></sup> Many health workers from PICTs migrate to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> Overseas recruitment of health workers from resource-poor countries, including the PICTs, can fill the vacancies in these countries, which have a constant need to expand their health workforce. These destination countries share similar immigration policies, in which acquisition of permanent skilled migrants is among the major objectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> Apart from international migration to these five major destinations, migration within the PICTs region also heavily affects the Pacific Islands. In particular, Fiji is a major migration destination for health workers in the PICTs. It has the most advanced health care system in the region, which frequently attracts temporary migrant health workers from other PICTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> The Fiji School of Medicine has provided specialist training for doctors since the late 1990s, but loss of graduates to overseas migration and to the local private sector has exacerbated the shortage of health workers in Fiji nevertheless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third type of migration, “cross-industry” migration, has a similar impact on health service delivery as do other types of migration. Health workers leaving their positions for more attractive positions in nonhealth sectors contributes to the loss of skilled health workers from the health sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512453259">24</xref></sup> This loss can come at a high cost to island states and health systems through the long training duration, high training costs, and resulting reduction of service quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> The remittances from the migrants may not offset the loss because they do not return to the health sector. Indeed, a study on the remittances of migrant Tongan and Samoan nurses from Australia showed that remittances are mostly used in consumption objectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512453259">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Migration is usually not a one-way process. Beyond the three types of migration described above, influx of health workers, such as through the return migration of health workers and immigration of expatriate health workers, has also occurred in the Pacific region. Tonga is a country that has approximately the same amount of its population living overseas and in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> A qualitative study on return migration to a village in Tonga suggested that overseas training with bonding to return and the commitment to contribute to their home country may prompt workers to apply their skills locally on returning to the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512453259">26</xref></sup> Expatriate health workers also migrate into the PICTs. Expatriate doctors in Fiji were from Myanmar, Hungary, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Nigeria, whereas expatriate doctors and nurses in Palau came from more diverse countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> Such health workers were under contracts of various durations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453259">23</xref></sup> However, the influx of health workers in the PICTs is of rather limited magnitude compared with international health workforce migration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539512453259">
<title>Reasons for Migration</title>
<p>Migration is a personal decision shaped by changing personal circumstances and by the social and economic context in which decisions are made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539512453259">27</xref></sup> Understanding the reasons for migration can shed light on potential solutions as the PICTs seek to retain their health workers.</p>
<p>An empirical study done by Brown and Connell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup> has shown that income and nonincome factors influenced the decision regarding present or future migration of 251 doctors and nurses from Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. This study showed that income was the major reason for international migration among both doctors and nurses. Tongan nurses earn relatively less than do other Tongans, either abroad or at home. In Tonga, the differential between mean incomes of nurses and the national mean per capita income was greatest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup> This becomes a push factor for Tongan nurses to migrate, making them more likely to do so than those from Fiji or Samoa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>One nonincome factor affecting migration from the PICTs to Australia and New Zealand found in the same study is related to the residence of kin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup> Both doctors and nurses are more likely to migrate overseas or return home when they have families abroad or in their home country. Other reasons for migration include dissatisfaction with evident career structures, lack of promotion opportunities, and lack of access to modern technology and training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup> Low professional satisfaction in aspects of professional growth, working conditions, and recognition and value for professional roles are also key reasons for specialists in Fiji to leave the public sector and to migrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539512453259">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539512453259">
<title>Retention Issues</title>
<p>Because of the serious problems stemming from loss of health workers due to migration, retention of health workers in the PICTs has become a crucial area of focus for the region. PICTs facing health workforce shortages need to identify the major cause of the shortage and the incentives and retention strategies to encourage health workers to remain in the local health sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539512453259">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although financial incentives are major pulling factors from destination countries, providing financial incentives is not enough to motivate health workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539512453259">31</xref></sup> Provision of career development support represents one of a few powerful incentives for health workers to remain in the country. A qualitative study collected data from 120 specialist trainees in the Fiji School of Medicine from 1997 to 2004. Of 120 trainees, 66 of the graduates were Fijian. Among Fijian graduates, 48.5% of trainees remain in the public sector in Fiji, indicating that local or regional postgraduate training may help to increase retention of doctors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539512453259">32</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1010539512453259">
<title>The Situation of Migration</title>
<p>New Zealand and Australia are the most important destinations for emigrated specialized health workers from the Pacific Islands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539512453259">33</xref></sup> These two countries attract inordinate numbers of health workers from the economically disadvantaged and smaller nations and thus further weaken their health systems. A strong historical tie exists among the PICTs, New Zealand, and Australia, partly because of physical proximity as well as financial links in the form of Overseas Development Assistance and bilateral assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539512453259">34</xref></sup> Such assistance is far too meager to compensate for the professional loss from especially smaller islands in which the limited specialized health workforce is the backbone of an already weakened health system.</p>
<p>The census-based data analyzed in 2008 showed that 652 doctors and 3,467 nurses born in the PICTs were working in New Zealand and Australia in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> Such numbers are higher or almost equal to the number of health workers who have remained to work in these small islands. The majority of these specialized health workers were from Fiji, a country with a doctor-to-patient ratio of 0.38, a ratio that falls well below the international standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> According to census data, a total of 361 doctors and 1828 nurses in Australia and New Zealand were Fiji born. These numbers are higher than the 339 doctors and 1682 nurses who were working in Fiji in the same year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> The existing HRH gap in Fiji would have been narrowed if at least some of these migrants remained to work within the island.</p>
<p>After Fiji, PNG contributes the second highest number of emigrated skilled professional health workers in New Zealand and Australia. Census data reveal that 160 doctors and 441 PNG-born nurses were working in New Zealand and Australia in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> According to the 2006 WHO report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> the number of doctors that emigrated to New Zealand and Australia is almost half of the doctors reported to be working in PNG. Importantly, PNG has the worst doctor-to-patient and nurse-to-patient ratios in the region and was declared an HRH crisis country in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453259">4</xref></sup> It has a density of 0.05 per 1000 population for doctors and 0.53 per 1000 population for nurses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> and the widest gap in terms of both nurses and doctors compared with the minimum required number of health workers.</p>
<p>Samoa also has low doctor and nurse densities, yet the Samoan health workers in New Zealand and Australia rank third in population among other Pacific Islanders. Whereas in Samoa there were only 120 physicians and 346 nurses in 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> 42 Samoan-born doctors and 461 Samoan-born nurses were working in Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> Such migration drove the health worker densities lower than the internationally acceptable levels and thus created a negative balance and a gap in health service delivery.</p>
<p>In the census data on specialized health workers who emigrated to Australia and New Zealand, Tongan doctors constituted 26 whereas nurses numbered 421.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> Tonga has only 35 doctors and 322 nurses working in its health system, giving rise to a doctor density of only 0.34 and a nurse density of 3.16 per 1000 population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> In simple terms, more Tongan nurses were working in Australia and New Zealand relative to those available in Tonga itself. Such a trend was also common in other PICTs such as the Cook Islands, where there are only 14 doctors and 49 nurses in the health system. This is equivalent to doctor and nurse densities of 0.78 and 2.72 per 1000 population, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> Yet 14 doctors and 77 nurses born in the Cook Islands were working in Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> Migration of these specialized health workers could have been a factor that contributed to the gap in the health workforce of the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>Other Pacific Island–born doctors and nurses working in Australia and New Zealand were from Niue, a country that had only 4 doctors and 12 nurses by the year 2006, whereas 7 Niue-born doctors and 47 Niue-born nurses were found in New Zealand and Australia in the same year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512453259">35</xref></sup> Although, because of its small population size, the country was not regarded as a crisis country in the WHR 2006, such a trend left unchecked may collapse the entire health system of the Island. Kiribati had 20 doctors by 2006 and had also exported 6 to both countries; it also had 370 nurses working in the country whereas 18 were working in Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453259">28</xref></sup> Kiribati has a doctor density of 0.2, which is lower than the minimum recommended density by international standards.</p>
<p>Shortages of specialized health workers in the PICTs may be at least partially explained by migration. There were as many doctors and nurses working in just 2 developed countries (ie, Australia and New Zealand) as there were practicing in the Islands themselves. Such a trend is still not static; instead, many more health workers are still migrating, thus creating even a wider gap. If left unaddressed, it may lead to an HRH crisis in most of the small PICTs, where even the departure of a single physician or nurse may lead to the closure of a health facility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1010539512453259">
<title>Human Resources for Health After the Political Declaration in Samoa</title>
<p>The Pacific Code of Practice for Recruitment of Health Workers in the Pacific Region was developed in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539512453259">33</xref></sup> This move was in response to the WHR 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453259">4</xref></sup> which called for government, development partners, and the WHO to step into the crisis in order to address critical HRH challenges: international health workers migration; national health workforce strategic planning, management, and support; scaling up of health workers production; and building partnerships and alliances in supporting national plans. The code was also created because of concern over the emigration of specialized health workers from the PICTs, further weakening their health systems. Therefore, in addressing the health resources problem in the region, health ministers formulated the Samoa Commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539512453259">37</xref></sup> to manage migration, encourage health workers’ return, scale up health worker production, and retain these health workers within their respective countries. The Samoa Commitment ultimately gave rise to the Pacific Code of Practice for Recruitment of Health Personnel from the Pacific region. Along with the code of practice, the process of developing a regional HRH strategy for 2006-2015 was set into motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512453259">38</xref></sup> Both strategic plans and the declaration aimed to improve the health workforce situation in the Pacific Island region.</p>
<p>Despite the Samoa Commitment that led to the Pacific Code of Practice and a regional HRH strategy for 2006-2015, which has been in action for years now, the PICTs have continued to bleed their scarce specialized health workers to the wealthier nations. In this sense, the Code and thus its regional strategy have not been successful in stemming the brain drain catastrophe in the health sector.</p>
<p>Compared with the time before the Samoa Commitment, the Pacific Code of Practice, and the HRH strategy for 2006-2015, doctor and nurse densities in some islands continue to fall even to this date. This has created a further negative drift in demand and in the real availability of health workers. PICTs that reported lower density of nurses post–Samoa Commitment included the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Vanuatu. A lower density of doctors was recorded in Fiji, Micronesia, Palau, Vanuatu, and PNG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in the wake of the Code of Practice, many PICTs have observed increases in health workforce densities. An increase in the density of doctors was recorded in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Solomon, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Similarly, the density of nurses also increased in Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia, Samoa, Niue, Tonga, and Tuvalu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512453259">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against such a backdrop, political determination within the countries themselves, as well as regional planning and strategies, may help forge a way to address the HRH crisis and have a common goal in achieving better health worker densities. Such a plan, if well designed and implemented across islands and wealthier recipient countries, may make it possible to halt the deterioration of the health workforce in the PICTs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At present, PNG, Samoa, and Vanuatu are facing critical HRH crises. Some PICTs have increased their overall densities of doctors, nurses, and midwives; however, the number of countries in the region facing critical shortages has increased from 2006. Migration of skilled health personnel from the region is a major factor contributing to this situation. To ameliorate the deficit, support from destination countries to strengthen HRH in PICTs would make migration a win-win situation. In addition, the Pacific Island region must devote more resources to strengthening this key health system building block. To this end, efforts should focus on training new personnel and on retaining them with financial and nonfinancial incentives. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health can provide a platform for knowledge exchange and enhance the research capacity in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1010539512453259">39</xref></sup> Regional political commitment will play an important role to sustain and enhance these efforts toward universal access to skilled health workers in the PICTs.</p>
