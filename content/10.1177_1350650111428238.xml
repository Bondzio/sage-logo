<abstract>
<p>Degradation of the hydroturbine components due to slurry erosion is a serious issue, especially for the hydropower plants situated on the rivers originating from Himalayas in India. In the current investigation, slurry erosion performance of two stainless steels (CA6NM and CF8M), which are commonly used in hydroturbine power plants, has been studied. A high-speed erosion test apparatus was used for the studies. Slurry collected from an actual hydropower plant was used as the abrasive media in the test apparatus. The effect of slurry concentration (ppm), average particle size of slurry particles and rotational speed on the slurry erosion behaviour was investigated under different experimental conditions. The analysis of eroded samples was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stylus profilometry. SEM images showed signatures of formation of lips, ploughing, crater and microcutting on eroded surface of steels.</p>

<p>CF8M and CA6NM stainless steels (ASTM A743-grade) are iron–chromium–nickel–molybdenum alloys that are hardenable by heat treatment.

In most of the studies, simple rectangular shape specimens fitted at a particular angle at a time have been simulated in the laboratory using jet or pot-type tester. Little information is available in the open literature on the cylindrical shape specimen of these hydroturbine materials when exposed to slurry erosion conditions in a high-speed slurry erosion tester. The condition of erosion in this test rig is expected to be very similar to those prevailing in actual hydroturbines.</p>
<p>The evaluation of slurry erosion behaviour of materials under actual service conditions is often a difficult task, due to interactive effects of different parameters such as slurry concentration, velocity and properties of abrasive medium on wear rate. Accelerated erosion testing of materials can be performed by increasing load, velocity and other operational parameters in a laboratory test rig, where real contact conditions can be simulated. The aim of this study is to investigate the slurry erosion behaviour of two commonly used hydroturbine stainless steels (CF8M and CA6NM) under the hydroaccelerated conditions using a high-speed erosion test rig and slurry actually collected from one of the hydropower plants situated in the Himalayan region.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-1350650111428238"><title>Slurry erosion testing</title>
<p>A high-speed erosion test rig (DUCOM TR401) was used to study the slurry erosion behaviour of steel specimens. The test rig consists of various components such as slurry abrasion chamber, slurry tank, rotor and controller, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111428238">Figure 2</xref>. The slurry abrasion chamber encloses the test specimen and slurry. Slurry tank is a cylindrical stainless steel vessel, in which the slurry is prepared to the required concentration. Three inlet and three outlet pipes are provided between slurry abrasion chamber and slurry tank for re-circulation of slurry. The rotation of rotor is such that slurry from slurry tank flows from top chamber towards the downward direction and used slurry leaves from bottom chamber to enter the slurry tank, thus ensuring continuous re-circulation of slurry. This high-speed erosion test rig is capable of creating accelerated erosion of standard test specimens with water-containing abrasive particles of controlled size and composition (slurry). One of the advantages of this rig is that, 12 specimens may be tested at a time. This ensures zero tolerance to the change of experimental conditions during the comparison of slurry erosion testing of different specimens under similar experimental conditions. The effect of average particle size, concentration (ppm) and velocity has been studied by several researchers and showed that these are significant factors, which can affect the erosion phenomenon. In order to study this, slurry collected from an actual hydroelectric power plant, namely Nathpa Jhakri, India, was dried and sieved into different size ranges. After mixing them in various proportions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650111428238">Table 2</xref>), two different slurry concentrations having average particle sizes 100 and 300 µm were prepared. The morphology of slurry has been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6610LV). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111428238">Figure 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111428238">b</xref>) shows irregular and sharp-edged slurry particles with average particle sizes 100 and 300 µm, respectively. Tests were carried under different concentrations (10,000 and 30,000 ppm), erodent average particle size (100 and 300 µm) and rotation speed (2250 and 4500 rpm) to study the erosion performance of D-gun sprayed coating and substrate steel.

<p>A typical erosion test cycle began with the mounting of cylindrical specimens to the rotor assembly in slurry chamber. Care was taken to prevent over-tightening of clamping screws, which could induce compressive stresses in the specimens. After completing the slurry erosion testing cycle of 1 h, specimens were removed from the rotor assembly, gently brushed and cleaned with acetone in order to remove attached sand particles if any. The specimens were weighed before and after each slurry erosion cycle. The loss in mass of each specimen was recorded with the help of precision microbalance having an accuracy of 0.1 mg. As erosion is a surface phenomenon, so the peripheral surface area of each specimen was calculated by measuring the external diameter and length with the help of digital micrometer having an accuracy of 0.01 mm. Specific mass loss was calculated using the following relation
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1350650111428238"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111428238-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The slurry erosion process was repeated for six cycles for each of the samples.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of the chosen parameters, slurry erosion tests have been planned using Taguchi methodology, explained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650111428238">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350650111428238">4</xref>.

<sec id="sec10-1350650111428238"><title>Slurry-erosion testing</title>
<p>The cumulative specific mass loss rate curves of the CA6NM and CF8M steel specimens for a total duration of 6 h of slurry erosion testing are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111428238">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111428238">6</xref>. It can be seen that the overall specific mass loss rates of the CA6NM and CF8M steels are remarkably different. It has been observed that under all the investigated experimental conditions, specific mass loss was higher for CA6NM in comparison with CF8M steel. The maximum specific mass loss rate at the end of 6 h of slurry erosion testing for CA6NM and CF8M steel are 108.9 g/m<sup>2</sup> (18.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> h) and 222.8 g/m<sup>2</sup> (37.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> h), respectively. Evidently, CA6NM steel is found to have better slurry erosion resistance in comparison with that for the CF8M steel. This can be attributed to relatively higher hardness of CA6NM steel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1350650111428238">Table 5</xref>). Moreover, for all the CA6NM steel cases, the rate of specific mass loss (g/m<sup>2</sup> h) was initially higher, which generally decreased during later hours of testing. As the specific mass loss is affected to a large extent by the shape of slurry particles, changes in the slope of mass loss curves were also evident. Original slurry particles due to lot of microcutting edges have the ability to remove more material than the used slurry, which have only rounded edges, thus minimizing wear during later time of testing. Enhanced wear rate during initial hours of exposure could also have been partly due to rapid erosion of the microhills (surface roughness) present on the surfaces. This may be regarded as the transient state of erosion. However, once the surfaces are smooth, the erosion may achieve what we call steady state of erosion. During steady state, the rate of erosion is found to be constant. On the other hand, the erosion rate for the CF8M steel has not achieved steady state during the given period of exposure. It is also observed that with the increase in value of any of the investigated parameters (accelerated condition), there is increase in specific mass loss rate in both the steels.

<sec id="sec11-1350650111428238"><title>Effect of slurry concentration</title>
<p>The effect of slurry concentration on the slurry erosion rate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428238">Figure 7(a)</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428238">Figure 7(a)</xref> depicts that slurry concentration significantly contributes to the erosion. This may be due to the change in interaction areas or interaction time of slurry particles with the specimen during the change of concentration. Slurry erosion rate increases by 118% of CA6NM steel and 94% of CF8M steel with the increase in the concentration from 10,000 to 30,000 ppm. The results follow the expected trend quoted in the literature. The figure shows that CA6NM steel offers two times the slurry erosion resistance in comparison with CF8M steel.

<sec id="sec12-1350650111428238"><title>Effect of average particle size</title>
<p>The effect of average particle size is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428238">Figure 7(b)</xref>. One can observe that particle size contributes to specific mass loss. When the particle size was increased from 100 to 300 µm, the specific mass loss was higher. It can be seen from the figure that this effect is comparatively lesser dominating in the CF8M steel. The trends show that the overall specific mass loss rate of CA6NM steel was lower by a factor of 2 compared to CF8M steel after testing for 6 h. The effect of average particle size is more pronounced in the CA6NM steel. This may be due to more roughness of CA6NM steel. Gupta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111428238">19</xref></sup> also observed similar trends during the slurry erosion testing on brass and mild steel in the pot tester.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1350650111428238"><title>Effect of rotational speed</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428238">Figure 7(c)</xref> shows the effect of increasing the rotational speed on the specific mass loss of CF8M and CA6NM steels. With the increase in rotational speed, an increase in the slope of the specific mass loss lines can be seen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428238">Figure 7(c)</xref> also shows that specific mass loss rate of CA6NM steel was lower by a factor of 2 in comparison with the CF8M steel after testing for 6 h. The increase in the specific mass loss with increase in rotational speed may be due to interaction of specimen with more slurry particles for the same time. Moreover interaction force between the specimen and the particles may also be larger due to the larger colliding speed.

where <italic>K</italic> is a constant dependent on the properties of the erodent and target material and <italic>n</italic> the velocity exponent.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1350650111428238"><title>Percentage contribution of each parameter</title>
<p>The percentage contribution of each parameter to the slurry erosion rate of CA6NM and CF8M steels is also analysed. After analysis of variance calculations, for CA6NM steel: the most significant parameter found to be concentration which accounted for 70.66% of the total, followed by rotation speed (22.69%), while average particle size of slurry contributed only 6.65%. On the other hand, in case of CF8M steel, concentration contributed 74.27%, average particle size contributed 25% and rotation speed contributed negligibly. Thus, the most effective parameter found is the slurry concentration. Due to high concentration of silt during rainy season, generally the hydropower plant has to be shut down. It should be noted that these percentage contributions of each parameter to the specific mass loss rate are only valid within the experimental parameter setting level ranges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650111428238">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1350650111428238"><title>Material removal mechanism</title>
<p>In this investigation, cylindrical specimens were rotated in the chamber of high-speed slurry erosion test rig having non-corrosive slurry. This may cause erosion (effect of slurry flow) and abrasion damage (effect of slurry particles) to the specimen surfaces simultaneously or in quick succession. It may be assumed that during the rotation of the specimen, the interaction angle with slurry flow ranges from −90° to +90°, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111428238">Figure 8</xref>. As reported in literature, the angle of incidence of the particles substantially influences the wear of materials and can change the wear mechanism.
<fig id="fig8-1350650111428238" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Cylindrical specimen rotating in slurry chamber with different orientations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111428238-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In high-speed erosion test rig, some of the slurry particles hit against the curved surface of specimen with certain angle along the flow. Hitting force can be divided into two components.
<list id="list1-1350650111428238" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Tangential component which is parallel to the surface of specimen has a cutting effect at the surface.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The perpendicular component can make the material to fail by fatigue or under plastic deformation.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Therefore, it can be thought that slurry erosion of the specimens is simultaneously occurring by cutting abrasion and deforming abrasion.</p>
<p>However, the predominance of either of the mentioned modes of material loss would depend on material-related and slurry-flow factors. The material-related factors are chemical composition (constituents, grain size etc.), surface condition, ductility, brittleness, hardness, toughness, etc. and slurry-flow factors are concentration, average size, velocity, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650111428238">20</xref></sup> Wang and Hutchings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650111428238">21</xref></sup> reported that the mechanism of erosion is different for different sizes and shapes of abrasive particles.</p>
<p>To investigate the material removal mechanism, all the eroded specimens were examined under scanning electron microscope. The SEM features of eroded surfaces of both CA6NM and CF8M steels under different experimental conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111428238">Figures 9</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1350650111428238">12</xref>.

It is observed that the surface of each eroded sample is relatively smooth. These observations are also in agreement with the profilometry data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1350650111428238">Table 5</xref>).

<p>Due to (1) the large difference between hardness of slurry particles and specimen surface and (2) depending upon the position and size of slurry particles, lips (plastic deformation), microcutting, and craters (angularity of erodent supports the crater formation), would be easily created on the specimen surface, while flow of slurry helps in the removal of material from crater.</p>
<p>The SEM features of CF8M and CA6NM steels show microcutting, narrow craters or deep surface cavities and ploughing along with lip formation that are created by irregular-sharp edged slurry particles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111428238">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1350650111428238">12</xref> show the formation of numbers of craters in CF8M and CA6NM steel specimens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650111428238">Figure 10</xref> shows the formation of larger numbers of lips in CF8M and CA6NM steel specimens. There is also increase in microhardness of surface of eroded surface of CF8M steel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1350650111428238">Table 5</xref>). Thus, the mass loss may be due to shear cutting of the surface material, as well as, due to strain hardening and embrittlement of target material. Harsha and Bhaskar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650111428238">22</xref></sup> also observed similar features during solid particle erosion of ferrous and non-ferrous materials. Shivamurthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650111428238">23</xref></sup> studied the slurry erosive wear behaviour of 13Cr–4Ni steel using slurry jet erosion test rig and reported that microcutting and deep crater formation are the two main material removal mechanisms. Das et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650111428238">24</xref></sup> carried low stress abrasion studies on a hypereutectoid steel (specimens of different hardness) using a rubber wheel abrasion test apparatus and crushed silica sand under various loads and wheel speeds and reported the micropitting and microcutting dominant mechanisms for material removal from the specimens.</p>
<p>Thus, the various steps involved during slurry erosion process of CF8M and CA6NM steels may be summarized as below:
<list id="list2-1350650111428238" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>plastic deformation and strain hardening;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>formation of lips and ploughing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>shearing of platelet and formation of crater;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>microcutting.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These steps signify composite ductile and brittle modes of material removal mechanisms, although the ductile mode is more dominant. The dominance of ductile mode is predicted from the evidence of large number of lips formed on the surfaces during slurry erosion, as seen by SEM analysis.</p></sec></sec>
