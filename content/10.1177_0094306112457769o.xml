<p>Kaaryn S. Gustafson, following extensive interviews with welfare recipients in northern California, has written an interesting book about how these people (mostly women) understand and follow (or violate) the rules of the game. Her thesis is that welfare policies, rather than ensuring the well-being of families, are intended to deter welfare use, to guard against misuse, and to punish welfare cheating. “Policing the poor and protecting taxpayer dollars from fraud and abuse have taken priority over providing security to economically vulnerable parents and children” (p. 1). The thrust of most government welfare reforms has been aimed at excluding poor people from welfare who have engaged in illicit activities while receiving public benefits. The policies have become more punitive, and boundaries between the welfare system and the criminal justice system have blurred.</p>
<p>Many of the interviewees in this book described the application, renewal, and orientation processes for welfare assistance to be so overloaded with written forms that there was no way they could absorb all of the information. Getting a question answered might require a bus ride and a full day’s wait in a welfare waiting room (p. 110). The system may seem arbitrary and even nonsensical from the perspective of the recipients. As other researchers have found, welfare recipients find it impossible to make ends meet on welfare. Meager benefits are too little to sustain a family; there are large gaps between their welfare checks and their basic expenses. The amount of aid a family received in a given month might be frightfully out of line with their actual needs that month.</p>
<p>The author shows that welfare recipients generally spend most if not all of their welfare grants on their housing costs. If they received food stamps, the benefits were often not enough to provide food for the entire month. They routinely struggled to find money for day-to-day needs such as clothing, shoes, laundry detergent, household cleaning products, and feminine hygiene products. Given their precarious economic situation, some welfare recipients have to break the rules to make ends meet. Since they were not given enough to live on, cheating (usually failing to report additional income) became part of the system. Many had only a fuzzy understanding of the rules, and did not know whom to ask to have them clarified. They knew little about the consequences of breaking the rules. The rules were out of sync with their everyday needs and their unstable lives. Economic need, not greed, fueled their cheating. “The system makes you cheat,” said Annette (p. 169).</p>
<p>Multiple barriers—including low skills and education, disabilities, caretaking responsibilities, domestic violence, inadequate transportation, and housing insecurity—stood in the way of finding gainful employment. There was little evidence that welfare changes in 1996 succeeded in their promise to “make work pay” or that there were substantial incentives for welfare recipients to take employment. Jobs that welfare recipients took generally provided pay too low to raise them out of poverty. Jobs tended to lack stable hours, health care coverage, sick leave, or vacation time. During the first five years of welfare reform, the child poverty rate declined slightly and then rose again.</p>
<p>Employment is not necessarily a way out of poverty, or even a way off welfare. Most of the welfare recipients who took jobs and subsequently left welfare earned too little to bring economic stability to their households. A University of Wisconsin study found that those who worked in the first years after exiting welfare earned about seven dollars an hour. Poverty rates were more than 50 percent in the early years after leaving. For many welfare recipients, the transition from welfare to work simply meant making the transition from a consistent source of inadequate income to an inconsistent source of inadequate income.</p>
<p>Gustafson’s analysis of the welfare reform’s impact is consistent with that of other observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306112457769">Collins and Mayer 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457769">Holloway et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306112457769">Lein and Schexnayder 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306112457769">Schram 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306112457769">Ybarra 2011</xref>). The book also shows that the costs of policing and prosecuting welfare fraud are high. In most cases, states spend several million dollars investigating fraud, but the overpayments discovered, only a fraction of which are collected, are much less than the costs. If the welfare recipient is convicted and sent to jail, government costs soar dramatically.</p>
<p>Contrary to the myth of the “welfare queen,” the women described here hardly demonstrated the qualities for which welfare recipients are often criticized: laziness and greed. Most of them worked hard, often at multiple jobs, put the essential needs of their children first, and generally lived lives without luxuries. Most of the interviewees aligned themselves with mainstream morality. What set them apart from the mainstream was that they were poor.</p>
<p>In many cases, these women took on the responsibility of other family members, though doing so put quite a burden on them both personally and financially. The stories of women trying heroically to manage in difficult situations, too detailed to be included in this review, are a real strength of this book.</p>
<p>I have one criticism of Chapter Two. Gustafson seems to think that social scientists, especially sociologists, were instrumental in focusing attention on a deviant culture of the poor, stressing welfare dependence. “Public benefits became the problem, not the cure, when it came to poverty,” she wrote. She names William Julius Wilson in this connection. I am unaware of anything in Wilson’s writings that could be so interpreted. And the vast majority of sociologists such as Mark Robert Rank, Leonard Beeghley, Herbert Gans, and Cynthia Duncan saw <italic>poverty</italic>, not welfare, as the problem.</p>
<p>The methodology seems sound: her lengthy interviews yielded rich and valuable information. Her limited language ability (English only) was a small drawback, a point she recognizes. The book is a readable account of welfare mothers (and a few fathers), emphasizing how these people understand and often violate the rules they are supposed to follow. It would be useful in a course on welfare or perhaps as supplementary reading in a course on poverty.</p>
