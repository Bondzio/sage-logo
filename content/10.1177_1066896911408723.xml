<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Wagner-Meissner corpuscles (WMCs) are Schwannian-derived specialized nerve endings typically found in the dermal papillae of glabrous skin (ie, hairless skin found on the plantar and palmar surfaces), where they function as mechanoreceptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911408723">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911408723">2</xref></sup> Previous reports in the literature have used a multitude of terms (tactile corpuscle-like bodies, tactoid bodies, Wagner-Meissner bodies, pseudo-Meissner corpuscles, and Meissneroid corpuscles) to describe morphologically identical structures found outside this normal histological realm. WMCs have been recognized as a minor component in some benign neural neoplasms, including neurofibromas, schwannomas, and cellular nevi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911408723">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911408723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911408723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911408723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911408723"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911408723">8</xref></sup> Lesions composed predominantly of WMCs have also been infrequently described in several locations, including the vulva, cheek, periaortic tissue, finger, and lower extremity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911408723">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911408723">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911408723">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911408723"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911408723">11</xref></sup> It is important to note that although WMCs are incidentally identified in a variety of tissues in histological sections and occasionally in the above-mentioned neoplasms, they are not seen normally in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p>
<p>We report 2 patients with colonic polyps composed entirely of S100-positive spindle cells with differentiation toward WMC. This unique morphology was initially a cause of diagnostic confusion. Awareness of this entity may prevent mischaracterization with other types of unusual colon polyps. Additionally, in our experience, we believe that these lesions, in isolation, should not raise clinical concern for a syndromic association, which may otherwise be elicited given their neural origin and distinct morphology.</p>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<p>The first patient was a 69-year-old man who initially presented with blood per rectum. Colonoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion within the cecum at 75 cm and another within the sigmoid at 25 cm. The remaining colon was endoscopically unremarkable. The second patient was a 53-year-old man who presented for routine screening colonoscopy and was found to have a polyp within the sigmoid colon. The remaining colon was endoscopically unremarkable.</p>
<p>The pathology in both cases was identical. Histological sections revealed multiple foci of discrete eosinophilic aggregates within the lamina propia composed of oval to round cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911408723">Figure 1</xref>). Each cell had a single, eccentrically located tapered nucleus and abundant eosinophilic, lamellated, fibrillar cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911408723">Figure 2</xref>). Ganglion cells were not present on multiple-level sections. There was no significant mitotic activity, atypia, or pleomorphism. All sections from the polyp in each patient revealed multiple such aggregates that were separated by normal-appearing crypts and lamina propria. There was no apparent neural proliferation in the background, and these WMC-like structures were distinct from the stroma. The remaining colonic mucosa was unremarkable.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for S100 was strongly positive within the cytoplasm of the cell aggregates, confirming Schwannian/neural origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911408723">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, scattered uniform bland spindle cells within the lamina propria stained positively for S100. A Congo-red histochemical stain for amyloid and a CD68 immunostain, intended to highlight histiocytic differentiation, were negative.</p>

<p>The separate cecal polyp seen in the first patient was found to be a tubular adenoma. Prior colonoscopies from this patient had revealed hyperplastic polyps within the ascending and descending colon and a hypertrophic lymphoid nodule within the transverse colon but no other neural lesions or unusual polyps. Both patients had no history suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)/Von Recklinghausen’s disease, or any other systemic disorder. On follow-up (first patient, 18 months; second patient, 8 years) no other similar lesions have been detected; there is no evidence of recurrence, and the patients remain asymptomatic. The second patient has since been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia and Barrett’s esophagus by upper endoscopy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>WMCs have been recognized as a minor component in some benign neural neoplasms occurring in the soft tissues or dermis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911408723">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911408723">4</xref></sup> In the 1950s, Hill described the first case of a tumor composed entirely of WMCs arising in the lateral finger of a 15-year-old girl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911408723">9</xref></sup> This tumor was given the name Wagner-Meissner neurilemmoma in 1986 by Kaiserling and Geerts, after they reported 2 additional cases of these apparently benign tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911408723">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neural proliferations composed predominantly of Schwann cells, with or without accompanying ganglion cells, occur in the colonic mucosa and present as mucosal polyps, most commonly detected during screening colonoscopy. There is no uniformly recognized terminology used to describe these lesions, but most pathologists recognize them as benign and generally clinically inconsequential in isolation. Often, these lesions are reported as mucosal neuromas. Recently, Gibson and Hornick,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911408723">12</xref></sup> reviewed 26 such colonic polyps. All cases were distinct from ganglioneuromas and neurofibromas, were solitary, and were not associated with NF1 and MEN2B syndromes. The study group referred to these lesions as “mucosal Schwann cell hamartomas.” Whether these entities represent true hamartomas or benign neoplasms is debatable, and currently, even the concept of hamartoma itself is questionable. However, while the issues with terminology remain unresolved, it is important to differentiate these “mucosal Schwann cell hamartomas” from GI schwannomas, neurofibromas, and ganglioneuromas because “mucosal Schwann cell hamartomas” are not associated with any hereditary conditions.</p>
<p>It is interesting that in the GI tract, although neural plexuses are abundant and neural proliferations are not uncommon, WMCs do not occur in normal mucosa and represent an extremely rare component of neural tumors. This may be related to the functional differences of the GI tract compared with skin and soft tissues. Two recent case reports have described the aberrant presence of WMCs within colonic and gastric mucosa incidentally detected in specimens resected for GI adenocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911408723">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911408723">13</xref></sup> In these cases, the lesions were not grossly identifiable. Histologically, rather than forming a polypoid or mass-like growth, the WMC proliferations were more diffusely spread through the lamina propria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911408723">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911408723">13</xref></sup> Ultrastructural examination revealed cells with peripherally located nuclei and delicate, roughly parallel cytoplasmic processes in both cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911408723">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911408723">13</xref></sup> In one case, surface caveolae were noted as being a prominent feature on the cell processes, and areas of separation between the cell processes were filled with amorphous material, collagen fibrils, incomplete external lamina, and occasional small axons and unmyelinated nerves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911408723">13</xref></sup> In these reports, the possibility was raised that WMC proliferation could be driven by the presence of adjacent tumor. The lack of any associated/concurrent neoplasia in our cases suggests a different process. Our cases are also unique in that the WMC lesions were identifiable by the endoscopist as a discrete polyp, and they were focal, rather than being grossly unrecognizable, and spread diffusely within the lamina propria.</p>
<p>Although their nature remains unclear, possible etiologies for these lesions would include a reactive change, hamartoma/developmental aberration, or a benign neoplasm. Presentation in this age group generally argues against a developmental aberration. Additionally, there was no evidence of a concurrent neoplastic or inflammatory process in our cases to explain a reactive etiology. The most likely explanation, which we favor, is that these lesions represent a morphological subset of the “mucosal Schwann cell hamartomas” described by Gibson and Hornick,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911408723">12</xref></sup> and as such represent benign neural proliferations without associated syndromic implications.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary data, it appears that these lesions are generally incidental, and thus far, there is no evidence of progression, recurrence, or additional associated lesions. There does not seem to be any association with either MEN or NF syndromes or any other systemic disorder. The main significance of recognizing these lesions lies in differentiation from other mimics. The histological differential diagnosis includes nodular amyloid deposition or granulomas. The morphology of WMC, however, is distinct, and closer inspection of the lesion and familiarity with this morphological variant within the GI tract leads to appropriate categorization. In cases where the diagnosis is in question, S100 positivity, coupled with negative staining for amyloid and histiocyte markers, can easily differentiate these lesions from their mimics.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we report a previously undescribed type of neural proliferation within the colon. Awareness of this entity may be helpful in practice because the morphology is unusual and may mimic that of a histiocytic proliferation or amyloid deposition. Perhaps more important, awareness may prevent confusion with other neural polyps that have significant syndromic associations.</p>
