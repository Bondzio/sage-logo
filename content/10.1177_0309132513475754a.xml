<p>We live in an era of disaggregation. Or so says historian Daniel Rodgers in <italic>Age of Fracture</italic> (2011), his Bancroft prize-winning history of social thought in the United States during the last 30 years. Prior to the early 1970s, Rodgers argues that economic and social ideas were dominated by a sense of the common good, collective institutions, and solidarity. During the last quarter of the 20th century, these old certainties began to crumble. In their wake came a more splintered view of social life. Economic thought became more tuned to ‘rational actors’ and the market, while across the social sciences and humanities scholars now spoke of fluid identities and fractured selves. Though his book focuses on the United States, his arguments about the evolution of social thought over this period find echoes elsewhere.</p>
<p>I could not help but think of Rodgers’ book while reading <italic>GeoHumanities </italic>and <italic>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds</italic>. Both volumes exhibit the diversity of writing at the intersection of geography and humanities. While individually illuminating, collectively it is difficult to know what to make of them. They exhibit a wide range of subjects, methods, and writing styles. Douglas Richardson and the other co-editors of <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> see these volumes ‘as an exercise in becoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132513475754a">Richardson et al., 2011</xref>: 4). After reading them, I am not quite sure what ‘geohumanities’ means or if the term constitutes a divergence from humanistic approaches in geography over the past few decades. The books are fragmented – much, I suppose, like the era they seek to represent and Rodgers examines.</p>
<p>Neither book provides a definition of the humanities, though some contributors do make a few gestures toward doing so. For Stephen Daniels and the other editors of <italic>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds</italic>, the humanities and its approaches are found in philosophy, art, literature, and history (and, of course, geography) and areas of practice such as music, creative writing, and art exhibition. In his short piece opening the volume, the late Denis Cosgrove says the humanities are an approach to knowledge ‘characterised by hermeneutic and interpretive methods’ and with a goal of knowing thyself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132513475754a">Cosgrove, 2011</xref>: xxii). Despite the many differences among its various disciplinary practitioners, Cosgrove believes the humanities emphasize ‘perception, imagination, and interpretation’ and are ‘skeptical of universal claims of “humanity”’(p. xxiv).</p>
<p>Earlier collections on geography and the humanities made more pointed statements on what the humanities could contribute to the discipline. Take <italic>Humanistic Geography: Prospects and Problems</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132513475754a">Ley and Samuels, 1978</xref>), an edited collection that would surely count as one of the most influential volumes in geography over the past four decades. The editors sought to introduce elements of humanistic inquiry into a discipline that was dominated by scientific and positivistic perspectives. Since then, humanistic approaches have flowed into the discipline, partly because Ley and Samuels’ volume opened the breach, and because of its persistence in fields such as historical geography. Despite their references to history, <italic>GeoHumanities </italic>and <italic>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds</italic> do not dwell much on the history of humanistic approaches in geography. They do not mention more recent volumes that also address geography and the humanities, such as <italic>Textures of Place: Exploring Humanist Geographies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132513475754a">Adams et al., 2001</xref>). They miss an opportunity to discuss how connections between geography and the humanities – and the growth of humanistic approaches <italic>within</italic> geography – have changed since the publication of these volumes.</p>
<p>Most of the chapters emerged from the Association of American Geographers’ 2007 Geography and the Humanities Symposium at the University of Virginia. They seem principally designed to showcase work within geography using approaches from the humanities and by non-geographers employing geographical ideas. The chapters are quite short and, consequently, seem like serial précis rather than fully developed essays. This is not to say they are shallow – on the contrary, they left me wanting more. But because of this I would be more likely to track down a longer article or book by the author on the subject rather than assign these books to undergraduate or graduate students. Also, despite the emphasis on representation, many of the chapters in <italic>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds</italic> lack images, though this is not the case with <italic>GeoHumanities</italic>.</p>
<p>With their focus on representation and texts, most of these chapters would not have seemed out of place in similar sorts of previous edited collections on geography and the humanities. What do stand out are the many chapters devoted to ‘geohistories’ – work that relies on historical geographic information systems. Their inclusion here shows a remarkable sea change in the views of humanities scholars toward GIS. When I was a PhD student in the late 1990s, critical geography scholars would have found such technologies anathema to their scholarship. GIS was not quite considered a tool of the devil, but close. The chapters devoted to historical GIS in <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> illustrate how this powerful tool is being employed by geographers and historians to utilize historical data in new ways.</p>
<p>While these books showcase some of the more interesting work by scholars doing research at the intersection of the humanities and geography, they also note how such approaches face challenges within our universities and even within our field. Administrators question the relevance of humanistic geography and its seeming lack of practical applications. Undergraduates often share this view of the discipline as a whole. Those that come to my office are keenly interested in how ‘marketable’ their geography degrees will be once they graduate. Given the dreadful job situation and the current high unemployment and underemployment of university graduates (in the United States at least) this is a reasonable concern. My institution comes with a price tag of over US$50,000 a year. Many students are covering these costs by taking on burdensome student loans that they will be repaying well into middle age.</p>
<p>Humanities approaches in geography are clearly struggling, at least in North America. Judging from job ads for university positions, few departments are explicitly seeking geographers with perspectives from the humanities. In the United States, it is common for departments to have no geographer doing this sort of work whatsoever. Historical geography is one of the primary subfields where humanities approaches have flourished over the past half-century, but North American departments, except for a handful of exceptions, no longer advertise positions in the field. These are stiff challenges for those of us who value these sorts of approaches.</p>
<p>We can ameliorate some of these problems by reaching out to wider publics beyond the academy. More than other areas of geography, humanities-oriented geographers, especially in historical geography, see writing books as absolutely essential to their scholarship. Books, unlike journal articles, have no pre-defined audience. Very few books, even if they are for an academic audience, can appeal solely to readers in a particular subfield. Also, since academic publishers can no longer rely on university libraries to buy most of the books they publish, they need their books to sell to other academics and even those outside universities. Collectively, these encourage – even force – geographers writing books to do so in a way that speaks to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Geographers working in the humanities might also benefit from considering the literary dimensions of our scholarship as much as evidence, theories, and arguments. If we only write for ourselves, then these issues might not matter much. Indeed, I rarely hear other faculty or graduate students discussing the literary dimensions of their work. But geographers working in the humanities need to think about this more if we want to reach other audiences and also consider altering our graduate training.</p>
<p>These issues were the focus of an excellent session at a recent meeting of the American Society for Environmental History. One of the panelists, historian William Cronon, spoke passionately about the need for environmental historians (and I would say all of us doing research in the humanities) to think more carefully about who wants to read our books. Why should readers care? Why will the reader want to turn the page? Most surprisingly, he asked: how do you give pleasure or joy as a writer? Most of us – and I would include myself – rarely ask this question. Pleasure can mean many things. It can entail an insight hard won or a fresh perspective on a familiar topic conveyed through a provocative argument and compelling narrative.</p>
<p>Other historians have delved even deeper into this issue. Stephen Pyne has written an entire book on academic writing in the social sciences and humanities as literary non-fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132513475754a">Pyne, 2009a</xref>). He provides a set of tools and standards to incorporate the approaches of creative non-fiction into our writing. ‘We read books, we write books, we promote and tenure people on the basis of books…’ Pyne says. ‘But we don’t teach our graduate students how to write books’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132513475754a">Pyne, 2009b</xref>). The environmental historian Aaron Sachs urges historians to use more creative methods and reach wider audiences through their writing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132513475754a">Sachs, 2010</xref>). To aid in this endeavor, he co-founded a group at Cornell University called Historians as Writers where students and faculty discuss writing strategies and read their work in progress in ‘history slams’ – rather like the poetry slams at cafes in Brooklyn, New York, or San Francisco. Such endeavors should serve as inspiration and model for similar efforts in geography.</p>
<p>Though Pyne and Sachs are historians, their critiques and suggestions are applicable to those of us in geography working in the humanities tradition. We could better answer critiques against humanistic approaches in the discipline if we produced more books with a purchase outside the academy. Some might say this would entail dumbing-down our ideas in the hope of popularizing our work. On the contrary, there is no reason why this must be the case. In my allied field of environmental history, Richard White, Nancy Langston, and Mark Fiege have published recent books that have received effusive praise from both academics and in the popular press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132513475754a">Fiege, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132513475754a">Langston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132513475754a">White, 2011</xref>). In our own discipline, witness the one-man publishing phenomenon that is David Harvey. Not only is Harvey’s work still widely read and cited by geographers, but his books circulate among non-geographers too, aided in no small part by his superb website that showcases his writings and lectures.</p>
<p>
<italic>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds </italic>and <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> show that there is still a vibrant current of humanities approaches in the discipline and how people outside our field are engaging with our ideas. Yet these essays are written mostly by academics for other academics. The next step is to write a volume that takes these vibrant conversations and presents them in such a way that brings other publics into the conversation.</p>
