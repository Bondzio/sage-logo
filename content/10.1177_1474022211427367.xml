<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the digital humanities can be seen as a humanities project in a time of significant change in the academy. The background is a number of scholarly, educational and technical challenges, the multiple epistemic traditions linked to the digital humanities, the potential reach of the field across and outside the humanities, and the ‘digital’ as a boundary object. In the article, four case studies are used to exemplify the digital humanities as a humanities project, and it is suggested that the field can be seen as a trading zone and meeting place rather than a strained ‘big tent’. In this way, the digital humanities can accept scholarly and technological challenges in relation to the digital as well as being an important place for thinking about, experimenting with and rethinking the humanities.</p>

<p>T<sc>he digital humanities can be seen</sc> as a twenty-first-century humanities project driven by frustration, dissatisfaction, epistemic tension, everyday practice, technological vision, disciplinary challenges, institutional traction, hope, ideals and strong visions. This article explores the role of the digital humanities in relation to the humanities at large in a time of significant change in the academy.</p>
<p>The digital humanities are by no means a well-defined or clearly fenced-off field. On the contrary, they are characterized by ongoing negotiation, different epistemic traditions coming together, and radically different visions. There is also a great deal of common ground, naturally, as well as common interest and shared traction in terms of external interest, an expanded number of programs and initiatives, increased funding, and a comparatively high degree of visibility. At the same time, higher education is in a precarious situation in countries such as the USA and England and, according to many, threatened not only by lack of funding, but by lack of flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1474022211427367">Taylor, 2010</xref>), adaptation of corporate culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022211427367">Nussbaum, 2010</xref>) and an increased need to justify the humanities and arts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211427367">Fish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474022211427367">Parker, 2008</xref>). There is also a growing sense that interdisciplinary work is critical, but not supported by existing university structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022211427367"><italic>Nature</italic>, 2007</xref>), and related to a growing appreciation at least in the sciences that science is not ‘pure’ anymore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427367">Galison, 2010</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>Looking at the humanities more specifically, there is a recurring discourse of crises (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211427367">Bivens-Tatum (2010)</xref> for historical examples) – something that interrelates with the digital humanities in different ways. On the one hand, the current actual and presumed canalization of resources and interest in the digital humanities can be seen as a threat taking away resources and visibility from other parts of the humanities. Examples of leverage for the field include the creation of the National Endowment Office of Digital Humanities, major grants from large foundations such as the Mellon Foundation, a series of articles in <italic>The New York Times</italic> and a multitude of new or planned university-based initiatives with support from the university and institutional levels. These are resources that presumably could be spent in other ways, even though higher education does not necessarily have to be seen as a zero sum game. Alternatively, the digital humanities can be seen as a necessary humanities project, engaged with the future of the humanities as large. This latter view is not unproblematic from a field-internal point of view (not all members of the field agree with this being the ‘job’ of the digital humanities), nor from an outside point of view (what gives the digital humanities the right to represent and ‘envision’ the humanities?). One pertinent question is what, if anything, makes the digital humanities a legitimate place for thinking about and rethinking the humanities?</p>
<p>In any case, we need to acknowledge that the digital humanities are not one, coherent entity, and that there are tensions and epistemic traditions in play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2009</xref>). For instance, there is a sense that the tradition of digital humanities does not privilege theoretical work integral to other parts of the humanities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211427367">Liu, 2011</xref>) and that the field is anchored in certain disciplines such as English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211427367">Kirschenbaum, 2010</xref>) rather than others. It would seem that there are considerable power and possibilities to be gained from bridge building, and truly inclusive and coordinated efforts.</p>
<p>This article consists of three parts. The first part discusses the digital humanities as a humanities project on the basis of four examples. The second part looks at what makes digital humanities a potential humanities project. The third part suggests that construing the digital humanities as a ‘trading zone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211427367">Galison, 1997</xref>) and meeting place can be instrumental in facilitating the digital humanities as a humanities project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211427367"><title>Outset: Four examples</title>
<p>Let us start with four statements or descriptions about the digital humanities to illustrate different conceptualizations of the digital humanities as a project.</p>
<p>Firstly, a significant funding agency organization, the US National Endowment of the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities, presents this overview of the area:
<disp-quote>
<p>As in the sciences, digital technology has changed the way scholars perform their work. It allows new questions to be raised and has radically changed the ways in which materials can be searched, mined, displayed, taught, and analyzed. Technology has also had an enormous impact on how scholarly materials are preserved and accessed, which brings with it many challenging issues related to sustainability, copyright, and authenticity. (NEH, n.d.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that technology here is given considerable agency. There is no clear indication of an integrated and iterative process between technology and scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211427367">Drucker, 2009</xref>). Technology has significantly (‘radically’) changed the way scholars do their work, and it has had a large (‘enormous’) impact on how we manage scholarly materials. There is a promise of substantial impact, although it should be noted that this example is moderate in comparison to many other presentations of the digital humanities. The above presentation largely draws on the notion of technology as a tool, although the presumed ability of the tool to allow novel (‘new’) questions points to a sensibility to tools being integrated into scholarly research and interpretative processes. It is not uncommon for the discourse of digital humanities to draw on science as a model, which is also evident in the initial framing in the above quote (‘As in the sciences …’). The same pattern can be seen in discussions of research infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1474022211427367">Unsworth et al., 2006</xref>) and when collaborative, interdisciplinary research challenges are framed in terms of ‘big humanities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211427367">Davidson, 2008</xref>: 714; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1474022211427367">Weber, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While the NEH description suggests change, even radical change, it could be argued that the scope of that change is largely intrinsic to the field and not dramatic on an extrinsic or structural level. True, increased accessibility to scholarly material (and cultural heritage) affects other societal sectors, and some of the research carried out with new tools will influence and possibly change the intellectual landscape, but we are not necessarily talking about reconfiguring the humanities or the academy, and we are not clearly seeing a major movement or agenda with pronounced scholarly and intellectual direction, institutional traction and transformational sentiment.</p>
<p>The second example comes from a University of California at Los Angeles White Paper associated with the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Digital Humanities is an umbrella term for a wide array of practices for creating, applying, and interpreting new digital and information technologies. These practices are not limited to conventional humanities departments, but affect every humanistic field at the university, including history, anthropology, arts and architecture, information studies, film and media studies, archaeology, geography, and the social sciences. At the same time, Digital Humanities is a natural outgrowth and expansion of the traditional scope of the Humanities, not a replacement or rejection of humanistic inquiry. In fact, the role of the humanist is critical at this historic moment, as our cultural legacy migrates to digital formats and our relation to knowledge, cultural material, technology, and society is radically re-conceptualized. Already within the broad field of Digital Humanities, we are seeing a flowering of interdisciplinary, collaborative, and technologically-sophisticated research and pedagogy that is producing new modes of knowledge formation, reaching new audiences for digital scholarship, and setting new intellectual agendas and priorities for the twenty-first century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474022211427367">Presner and Johanson, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as in the first example, there is a strong sense of ongoing change expressed, here signaled by expressions such as ‘flowering’, ‘historic moment’ and ‘society is radically reconceptualized’, and further accentuated by three instances of ‘new’ in the final sentence. The presentation is grounded in the traditional humanities (not clearly suggesting an overhaul of the humanities), while at the same time suggesting a fairly radical development of the humanities. In comparing the two texts, it is clear that technology plays a much more instrumental role in the short NEH text. True, in the UCLA example, the field is described as a set of practices for ‘creating, applying and interpreting’ digital technologies and there is a reference to digital cultural heritage, but beyond this there is a much stronger sense of extrinsic structural change and impact. The critical role of the (digital) humanist at this point in time is emphasized, and the digital humanities are linked to emerging modes of knowledge production, as well as collaborative and interdisciplinary practice. The sense of the digital humanities as an ambitious humanities project comes across clearly through the description of the field as ‘setting new intellectual agendas and priorities for the twenty-first century’. It is also quite clear that this is not about the digital humanities as a separate discipline, but about the humanities as a whole.</p>
<p>Moving from the funding agency and institutional level to the individual level, the third example demonstrates epistemic tension and some of the path-finding work done by junior scholars. Whitney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474022211427367">Trettien (2010)</xref> tells us the story of not finding a place in digital humanities for her PhD thesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>So what was I doing? My born-digital thesis was not a scholarly resource: I wasn’t and never intended to present or curate a collection of digital artifacts for others to browse. My work was critical and individualistic, conscious of its methodology and historical moment. It strove for self-awareness … On the one hand, the Digital Humanities community – the community formed around institutions and labs and grant cycles and funding structures – has set itself up as a production house, a place where the infrastructural work of digitization, marking-up texts, and producing tools to facilitate research gets done … On the other hand, though, is the promise of a more radical, and radically individual, break with university structures: Parry’s social media-savvy digital humanist. This is the twitter-blogger who follows her passions across interdisciplinary boundaries, the Facebooker who makes the personal the political and in doing so humanizes the humanities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trettien illustrates the ongoing negotiation within the digital humanities community, broadly conceived, between different epistemic traditions and outsets. The distinction between the ‘production house’ model and a model based on the ‘promise of a more radical, and radically individual, break with university structures’ is tangible and directly linked to different framings of the digital humanities. The latter model would seem more clearly associated with a transformative sentiment and a sense of digital humanities as a large-scale humanities project. In practice, however, the line between different models and traditions is fuzzy and increasingly permeable. Trettien’s account is interesting because it demonstrates individual junior scholar interest in the envisioning work of digital humanities and a distinct sense of digital humanities as a humanities project. Junior scholars often feature in discussions of the digital humanities as agents of change as well as a group for which change is required, and as a kind of visionary canalization. As I have shown elsewhere, this kind of discourse tends to assign roles to junior scholars (Svensson, forthcoming). For instance, junior scholars coming to the digital humanities through disciplinary anchored research and a predominant interest in the digital as an object of inquiry (such as Trettien), can sometimes be interpreted as coming to the field through an interest in technology as a tool: thus being ‘read’ according to a particular epistemic tradition (humanities computing; see Svensson, forthcoming). These tensions, whether problematic to the development of the field or not, are useful to the understanding the contemporary landscape of the digital humanities.</p>
<p>The fourth and final example is taken from a panel on ‘The History and Future of the Digital Humanities’ at the Modern Language Association convention in Los Angeles, 7 January 2011. This panel received substantial attention partly because it made different positions on the digital humanities quite clear, in some ways similar to Trettien’s account above, and there was some fairly drastic language used. Stephen Ramsay addressed the current expansion of the field, the idea of big-tent digital humanities, and what core epistemic committees are relevant. The following excerpt is taken from Ramsey’s online version of his short position paper:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Digital Humanities’ sounds for all the world like a revolutionary attitude – digital humanities, as opposed to old-school analogue humanities. As such, it has most recently tended to welcome anyone and anything exemplifying a certain wired fervor. Nowadays, the term can mean anything from media studies to electronic art, from data mining to edutech, from scholarly editing to anarchic blogging, while inviting code junkies, digital artists, standards wonks, transhumanists, game theorists, free culture advocates, archivists, librarians, and edupunks under its capacious canvas … Do you have to know how to code? I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities and I say ‘yes’ … But if you are not making anything, you are not – in my less-than-three-minute opinion – a digital humanist. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474022211427367">Ramsay, 2011a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We can see how Ramsay both posits an external view on the digital humanities as a ‘revolutionary attitude’, supposedly not supported by himself, and uses the slightly charged construction ‘wired fervor’ (as well as ‘edupunks’ and ‘transhumanists’) to describe many of the newcomers to digital humanities. This may also be seen as a critique of ‘digital’ as a denominator, which comes with a sensibility of ‘wired’. Interestingly, the word ‘digital’ can either be seen as an explanation for the popularity of digital humanities (as a media scholar suggested to me) or as a problem, since digital is indeed part of everything, and why would there be a digital humanities when other digital-specific fields have disappeared (as was suggested to me at an information school discussion)? Unsurprisingly Ramsay’s statement resulted in a strong reaction, and he elaborated his position in a subsequent blog entry:
<disp-quote>
<p>Building is, for us, a new kind of hermeneutic – one that is quite a bit more radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry and applying them to digital objects. Media studies, game studies, critical code studies, and various other disciplines have brought wonderful new things to humanistic study, but I will say (at my peril) that none of these represent as radical a shift as the move from reading to making. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474022211427367">Ramsay, 2011b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In specifying ‘making’ as an epistemic commitment and prerequisite for the digital humanities and excluding areas such as media studies, Ramsay is suggesting a particular privileged sense of making. The shift postulated – moving ‘from reading to making’ – is fairly dramatic. What about reading as part of making and ‘new’ literacies? What about writing? The ‘for us’ functions as an inclusive device – presumably addressing the traditional digital humanities community while simultaneously excluding others. In a comment relevant to Ramsay’s blog entry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211427367">Liu (2011)</xref> argues that we need to ‘recognize the multiplicity of builder roles (including the importance of interpreters, critics, and theorists in the enterprise, many of them the same people as the coders, etc.)’. He continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>Frankly, I think we are selling out the whole idea of collaboration so important to the digital humanities (and to many other areas of today’s digital, networked knowledge production) if we go back to an ‘individual essentialism’ according to which ‘one’ is measured as in/out of the club of builders. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211427367">Liu, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Proposing that the digital humanities may not be all-inclusive, as Ramsay does, is obviously not problematic in itself, but at a time when the field is getting traction partly because of the sense of the digital humanities as a different kind of project, the strong reaction is unsurprising. This is a clear example of disciplinary tension, and at the panel, Alan Liu’s position statement illustrates a very different stance:
<disp-quote>
<p>How the digital humanities advance, channel, or resist the great postindustrial, neoliberal, corporatist, and globalist flows of information-cum-capital, for instance, is a question rarely heard in the digital humanities associations, conferences, journals, and projects with which I am familiar. Not even the clichéd forms of such issues – e.g., ‘the digital divide,’ ‘privacy,’ ‘copyright,’ and so on – get much play … To my digital humanities colleagues in this room, let me say that, while we have the tools and the data, we will not even be in the same league as Moretti, Casanova, and others unless we can move seamlessly between text analysis and cultural analysis … But joining the mainstream, I think, should not be the limit of our ambitions in the digital humanities. Truly to contribute, I believe, the digital humanities will need to show that it can also take a leadership role. The obvious leadership role at present is service for the cause of the humanities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211427367">Liu, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The contrast between Liu’s and Ramsay’s positions cannot be any clearer. Liu sees the digital humanities as a potentially transformative humanities project, as exemplified by the mission statement ‘to assist in advocacy for the humanities’ for the 4Humanities initiative (which Liu helped initiate). The digital humanities are seen as a platform for advancing and leading the humanities as well as a place for bringing together text analysis and cultural analysis, which is obviously quite different from the more restrictive view presented by Ramsey. Liu also points to the relative weakness of traditional digital humanities research in terms of scholarly impact (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022211427367">Juola, 2008</xref>: 83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474022211427367">Rockwell, 2003</xref>: 210). These tensions and ‘cracks’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211427367">Klein, 1993</xref>), while sometimes leading to a polarized discussion, are important to understanding the digital humanities as an endeavor and humanities project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022211427367"><title>What makes the digital humanities a potential humanities project?</title>
<p>It could be argued that, when Alan Liu links the digital humanities to the cause of the humanities, he employs the digital humanities as a platform for engaging with the future of the humanities. This section is concerned with where this reach and visionary capacity of the digital humanities comes from, and it is hoped that this will help in understanding the digital humanities as a potential humanities project.</p>
<p>One important factor is that, at least potentially, the digital humanities seem to operate across the humanities. One explanation for this is that there are many possible interaction points between the various humanities disciplines and the digital humanities. Information technology clearly provides powerful tools for the humanities, and the ‘digital’ proves to be an integral part of our culture. These are actualities that affect all the humanities disciplines on a fundamental level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2009</xref>). Traditionally, digital humanities centers and initiatives have also been institutionalized differently than regular departments, which probably helps explain this ‘free’ or in-between position.</p>
<p>The digital humanities also seem to represent the humanities in different contexts. There are several reasons for this. The current ‘buzz’ and interest in the digital humanities is certainly one factor, but, more deeply, the intermediate position of the digital humanities makes the field a useful one-stop manifestation of the humanities. In terms of funding agencies and institutional work, the digital humanities can sometimes function as a part of the humanities that is ‘easier’ to understand or target from a humanities-external point of view. The discourse on humanities research infrastructure is a good example of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2011</xref>). Importantly, new funding agency schemes, such as the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment of the Humanities in the US, can serve an important function in reaching across the humanities and speaking both to the broader funding agency ecology as well as to the humanities at large.</p>
<p>There is a strong link between visionary discourse and technology, historically and contemporarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474022211427367">Streeter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1474022211427367">Turner, 2006</xref>), and the digital humanities clearly have a strong investment in technology, technological infrastructure, and the digital more generally. An obvious example would be visions that draw directly on existing or future technological innovation. These are, for example, common in the discourse of cyberinfrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2011</xref>) and traditional humanities computing.</p>
<p>Importantly, there seems to be a sense that doing digital humanities work requires pushing on established traditions and structures. A relevant example is a one-week online (and soon to be print) book project called <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211427367"><italic>Hacking the Academy</italic> (2010)</xref>, introduced thus: ‘today serious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy as they have existed for decades, even centuries, aren’t becoming obsolete. Every aspect of scholarly infrastructure is being questioned, and even more importantly, being hacked.’ This is probably one of the principal reasons why people interested in thinking about and reconfiguring the humanities are attracted to the field. The tension between the digital humanities and the academic establishment is multifaceted and involves institutional hurdles to doing interdisciplinary and collaborative work, need for space and technological infrastructure, tenure systems not adapted to digital production and publications, and the need for non-faculty experts and corresponding career paths. Based on these and other factors, there is a strong sense that the university and the humanities need to change to accommodate this type of work, and all this feeds into a vision of transformed humanities.</p>
<p>On a more general level, there is a strong visionary and transformative sentiment that goes beyond the intermediate-level issues discussed above. This is where we find intense, sweeping statements, exemplified by David Perry when he says, ‘I don’t want a digital facelift for the humanities, I want the digital to completely change what it means to be a humanities scholar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022211427367">Perry, 2010</xref>). This discourse seems grounded in the issues discussed above (coming from the practical work of the field), but also more generally in discontent with the current situation for the humanities, the academe, and, to some extent, society at large.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this sentiment. As we have seen, there is a strong sense that the humanities are in a precarious situation in terms of funding and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211427367">Donoghue, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022211427367">Nussbaum, 2010</xref>), and that higher education as a whole is facing a series of major challenges. The current financially dire times in countries such as the United States and United Kingdom are part of this scenario. We see frustration and discontent expressed by both junior and senior faculty. Younger faculty and graduate students are concerned about the seeming lack of possibilities for the future, there is a sense that the humanities have an inward-looking sentiment, and structural resistance to new ideas.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the digital humanities can be a platform or means for rethinking the humanities and higher education, and a way of canalizing transformative sentiment and disciplinary interest in the ‘digital’ that arguably makes the digital humanities into a humanities project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022211427367"><title>The digital humanities as a trading zone and meeting place</title>
<p>As we have seen, there is an ongoing and fairly intense discussion of the territory of the digital humanities. A recent key metaphor for this discussion has been the idea of ‘big tent’ digital humanities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474022211427367">Trettien, 2010</xref>), which was the theme of the 2011 Digital Humanities Conference at Stanford University. While a Google search for ‘small tent digital humanities’ (carried out on 5 March 2011) does not render any results, it seems clear that the alternative, whether historical or present, is a smaller tent model. The size factor relates both to the disciplines or areas involved and the geographical dispersion of the field:
<disp-quote>
<p>With the Big Tent theme in mind, we especially invite submissions from Latin American scholars, scholars in the digital arts and music, in spatial history, and in the public humanities. (Call for Proposals, 2011 Stanford Digital Humanities Conference)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we see both these variables in play, and interestingly, Latin America is singled out, as well as some specific areas such as digital arts and music, but not, for instance, explicitly (new) media studies. There seems to be a growing connection between the public humanities and the digital humanities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474022211427367">Svensson, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1474022211427367">Woodward, 2009</xref>), but not one normally emphasized in the tradition of digital humanities that the annual conference represents (largely humanities computing). Presumably there must also be other variables in play that relate to the size of digital humanities, relating to factors such as the inclusion of practice-oriented work as well as theory-oriented work, gender, etc. And, despite the inclusive theme of the Stanford conference, it seems clear that the call itself – although more open than previous ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2010</xref>) – can be seen as excluding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474022211427367">Reid (2011)</xref> discusses this from a rhetorician’s perspective: ‘In other words, no mention of the significant digital technologies and practices that are transforming human experience on a global scale. No, instead, we’re going to talk about writing software to analyze hundreds of out of print literary texts that no one can even name’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211427367">Cayless (2011)</xref> notes that ‘from reading my (possibly) representative sample of DH proposals, I’d say the main theme of the conference will not be “Big Tent Digital Humanities” but “data integration”’. Both these comments, regardless of how the actual conference was implemented (Cayless’s entry is, incidentally, called ‘DH tea leaves’), illustrate some of the tension and range involved. One pertinent question is how big the tent can be. The etymological origin of ‘tent’ is Latin <italic>tentus</italic> ‘stretched’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474022211427367">Trettien (2010)</xref> asks us how much the big digital humanities tent can be stretched, when she says that ‘I'm not sure Digital Humanities, even a big-tent Digital Humanities, has room for all these digital humanists’. Thus even a large tent has boundaries.</p>
<p>A tent is a spatially delimited space and, whether small or big, there is a fairly distinct demarcation. Of course, a tent can be more or less permeable, but the discussion of digital humanities tents mainly seems to focus on the size of the tent; in other words, a way of describing a larger territory and a more inclusive stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1474022211427367">Warwick, 2011</xref>). This is a sensible and probably necessary direction of change. One interesting question, however, is whether a more inclusive notion and a larger tent also translate into more far-reaching structural change. They probably do to some extent, as the bringing together of different epistemic traditions will necessarily lead to change, but it may also be argued that the metaphor and the associated discussion do not necessarily highlight these more radical aspects or, for that matter, a different basic stance. Arguably, big tent digital humanities (as articulated by the conference call above) are still grounded in a particular epistemic tradition. Hence big size comes with a certain epistemic flavor.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1474022211427367"><title>Trading zones</title>
<p>In analyzing the collaboration between physicists of different paradigms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211427367">Galison (1997)</xref> developed the concept of trading zones as a way of understanding how scientists can communicate and collaborate even if they come from different paradigms in the Kuhnian sense and even if there is incommensurability between experimentalists and theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427367">Galison, 2010</xref>: 27). His research importantly explores the tension between local practices and a global language of science. The concept of trading zones applies more broadly to interdisciplinary work, and demonstrates the possibility of maintaining disciplinary depth and focus (expertise) as well as meaningfully engaging in intersectional work. Galison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427367">2010</xref>: 36) talks about the ‘thinness of interpretation’ in trade rather than the ‘thickness of consensus’. Trading zones are about brokering cultural exchange, and, while they operate on an institutional level, they can never be successful without cultural performance and individual enactments. Indeed, individual enactment and engagement are critical to well-functioning meeting places. On a critical note, we should be aware that the concept of trading zones comes from work on science (not the humanities), that it is obviously based on trading as a structuring metaphor (which may be questioned in relation to the academy), and that it consequently has a functional focus.</p>
<p>In the following, I argue that the digital humanities can be seen as a trading zone and meeting place, and that this construal is compatible with the sense of the digital humanities as a humanities project. I see ‘trading zone’ and ‘meeting place’ as partially overlapping concepts, where the latter is more general and less instrumental. A related notion is that of contact zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474022211427367">Pratt, 1991</xref>). It is more focused on specific situations than on the work of meeting places or trading zones, and accentuates the often asymmetrical relations of power in ‘social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474022211427367">Pratt, 1991</xref>: 34). Another relevant concept, closer to an open and dynamic meeting place than to trading zone, is ‘temporary autonomous zones’ as used to describe the strategy of creating temporary spaces that elude formal structures of control, and that are created on the boundary lines of established regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211427367">Bey, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211427367">Collins et al. (2010)</xref> discuss trading zones in relation to interactional expertise, and suggest a link between this type of expertise and the ability to productively engage in cross-disciplinary work. They present a model based on two dimensions: the extent to which power is used to enforce trade and the extent to which trade leads to a homogenous new culture. Furthermore, they propose an evolution of trading zones, where one starting point can be when a university ‘encourages’ faculty from different disciplines to collaborate around formulating a new initiative or proposal. In the case of digital humanities, there is currently a fair amount of such encouragement. Under this reading, there is some degree of coercion in such situations, which would presumably also be the case when a funding agency launches a new program for an area such as the digital humanities. If a group decides to work together, the trading zone would become more collaborative and voluntary, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211427367">Collins et al. (2010)</xref> propose that this may lead to a fractioned trading zone with shared boundary objects or interactional expertise emerging from deeper interest in the others’ work. Further evolution under this model might include the trading zone and cultures becoming more homogenous, leading to an interlanguage trading zone, which may eventually turn into a new disciplinary formation and loss of the actual trading zone.</p>
<p>It is here suggested that the digital humanities can be seen as a fractioned (not homogeneous), collaborative (not coerced) trading zone with a continuous development of interlanguage, and that the digital humanities as a ‘meeting place’ afford individual expression, non-instrumental connections, unexpected coalitions, and synergetic power. The ‘digital’ in a broad sense and in various manifestations constitutes a shared boundary object. The field is grounded in local practice – where much of the negotiation occurs – as well as in a more overarching sense of field and global project. Local practice can partly be carried out through critical engagement in a technologically and humanistically rich environment. Critical making is a relevant framework here, and aims to connect ‘“critical thinking”, often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically-based, internal and cognitively individualistic’ and ‘“making”, typically understood as material, tacit, embodied, external and community-oriented’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474022211427367">Ratto and Hockema, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1474022211427367"><title>The liminal position of the digital humanities</title>
<p>The digital humanities have often been institutionalized as centers, initiatives or institutes. Part of the struggle of humanities computing and traditional digital humanities has been to manage this ‘in-between’ or liminal position, which has often made it difficult (at least in the past) to employ faculty, gain institutional credibility, and achieve a respectable level of scholarly status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1474022211427367">University of Virginia, 1999</xref>). The digital humanities have often been more practice-based than theoretically oriented, and in this regard also there can be a sense of differentness or even stigmatization. Many humanities computing centers have been closed or restructured over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211427367">Flanders and Unsworth, 2002</xref>), a fate not too uncommon in relation to academic enterprises that are seen as service units, and, at least from a historical point of view, there is thus considerable risk associated with being a humanities computing or digital humanities center.</p>
<p>At the same time, this position has allowed the digital humanities to work outside established structures and to gain leverage from being different and not competing directly (or as obviously) with other departments and disciplines. It is arguably easier to have a catalyst and intermediary role and to work with a range of disciplines if you exist somewhat outside the traditional structures. This is not to suggest that the traditional digital humanities have been positioned ‘in between’ in all respects. One key question in any case is whether the digital humanities prefer this liminal position, or whether we are seeing a push towards a more independent role and a more disciplinary, departmental structure. Importantly, the recent influx of other scholars and communities into the digital humanities has infused a higher degree of visionary discourse, interest in rethinking the humanities or the academy on a large scale and, arguably, public engagement and activism. This kind of work is likely to benefit from an in-between position. Indeed it may depend on it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1474022211427367"><title>Beyond the tent</title>
<p>The digital humanities as a trading zone and meeting place would seem congruent with a view of the interrelation between the humanities and digital as rich and multiplex. If the digital humanities are about engaging with technology as tool, object of inquiry, medium of expression, activist venue and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474022211427367">Svensson, 2010</xref>), and if we see these modes as intrinsically interconnected, we presumably need to see the field as a place where these perspectives and epistemic traditions come together. In terms of structural integrity and sustainability, it may be more advantageous to construe the digital humanities as a meeting place, innovation hub and trading zone than a distinct discipline. This would clearly give the field reach across the humanities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474022211427367">Ratto and Ree (2010)</xref> argue that the digital media are not a sector, and a similar argument can be made for ‘the digital’ not being a discipline. The digital cuts across and, by seeing the digital humanities as a trading zone and meeting place, we can take this seriously.</p>
<p>In looking at the field as a meeting place, certain qualities are emphasized that are present in almost all varieties of the digital humanities: e.g. the relative openness to working with other disciplines and areas, and having a facilitating or intermediary function. However, it would seem that digital humanities as a meeting place and trading zone presumes profound openness to a number of different epistemic traditions, and a facilitating role that is not strictly instrumental or service minded, but richly multiplex and dynamic.</p>
<p>There are several rationales for framing the field as a meeting place and trading zone. First, it may be argued that a multiple mode engagement with the digital across the humanities benefits from or may even require the digital humanities to be a meeting place. This is also a way of expanding the territory and reach of the field considerably without ‘raising tents’. Importantly, a trading zone implies respecting (but not necessarily adopting) other epistemic traditions and a shared interest in boundary objects. Furthermore, there may be considerable potential gains across the territory that do not currently seem to be fully exploited; for instance increased use of digital research tools and rigorous data management in media studies or a stronger theoretical anchoring of some more tool-based work. Opening up the digital humanities in this way would make it easier to incorporate the various traditions and newcomers.</p>
<p>Secondly, the coming together of disciplines and competencies could be said to be necessary for tackling the scholarly, technical and structural questions associated with the digital humanities (and the humanities). What does it mean to be human in a digital age? Can media be thought of in terms of architectural representation? How do we build robust metadata schemes for cultural heritage materials and humanities research? How can the trajectory from the ‘democratic’ representation through multiple screens in the 1950s be related to the current growth of multiple-screen contexts? What is our audible past? What kind of interpretative power can a temporal-geographical system with ‘facetted browsing’ access to cultural heritage possibly give? How is the digital recruited for collaborative fan fiction? What is the future of academic publishing? How can students, faculty and the public benefit from different types of multimodal representation to represent and explore key issues in e.g. history, philosophy or comparative literature? What is twenty-first-century textual scholarship? How can we profoundly explore the interrelation between media, place and technology? Most of these issues require concerted efforts, collaboration inside and outside the humanities, access to infrastructure and a combination of scholarly and technological expertise. We do not necessarily have to use the term ‘big humanities’ to describe such efforts, but there are clearly some parallels with the notion of big science.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can be argued that the humanities need an intersectional place or laboratory for thinking about, rethinking and innovating itself. Here the digital humanities can offer a platform, and we can see how this is already happening. As explored earlier, there is resistance to this conception of the field, and there is a point to being articulate about the digital humanities being such a platform (not necessarily the only one). This can arguably not be achieved from the position of the digital humanities being a traditional department or discipline. Such a distinct role will speak to Schools of Humanities or the equivalent, but also to university and external leadership, and in either case it would be framed and receive support as a humanities project.</p>
<p>The digital humanities as a humanities project – reaching across the humanities and outside – can also be seen as a powerful way of canalizing resources. Even in the imaginary, almost technology-free humanities division, there will be dispersed resources in terms of staff, technology and faculty assignments. Some of these can be part of a truly humanities (or more) wide initiative. Maybe more importantly, a large enough reach and ‘mass’ make it easier to argue for infrastructure in terms of space, people and technology. It is noticeable that relatively few digital humanities (and humanities) environments have ‘strong’ spaces and obviously innovative technology setups. If we see knowledge production as spatially and materially situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474022211427367">Livingstone, 2003</xref>), the digital humanities as a humanities project would seem to be an opportunity to make a case for acquiring and designing space (both physical or digital). This is something that speaks to many humanities scholars and students (HASS Committee on the Humanities Library, 2001, retrieved on 7 December 2010), and which can be instrumental in making the meeting place or trading zone come to life. There is potential for synergy and unexpected connections coming from such a development. Also, if we believe that situated and embodied practice is important, humanities laboratories provide one place for such work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474022211427367">Ratto, 2009</xref>, and the notion of ‘critical making’).</p>
<p>Finally, universities and institutions of higher education often lack intersectional meeting places and trading zones. This is clearly a niche that largely has not been filled in many institutions of higher education, and where there is opportunity and increasing need. The digital has the intersectional power required and the humanities the awareness and potential legitimacy to be that place. So rather than disregarding ‘the digital’, interpreting it as purely technical or seeing it as an uncomfortable denomination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474022211427367">Mattern, 2011</xref>), it can arguably be used as a means of making the humanities a catalyst for interchange, development and envisioning the future of the academy. Needless to say, this is a function and direction that is likely to be attractive to university leadership and management.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1474022211427367" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, it has been suggested that the digital humanities can be seen as a humanities project, and that there are advantages to framing the field as a trading zone and meeting place rather than a strained ‘big tent’. The background is the scholarly, educational and technical challenges, the multiple epistemic traditions linked to the digital humanities, the potential reach of the field across and outside the humanities, and the ‘digital’ as a ‘boundary object’. Furthermore, there is arguably a need for an outreaching humanities laboratory – a place for thinking about, experimenting with and rethinking the humanities – and an intermediary player in the university system with a substantial level of integrity. In other words, there is a niche to be filled. Concerted efforts in this direction could lead to a new wave of digital humanities, a revitalization of the humanities, and indeed, an academy changed for the better.</p>
