<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early surgical interventions are required for neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions because of severe early-onset symptoms and difficulty in differentiating cystic biliary atresia (BA) from choledochal cysts (CDC). Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has been increasingly adopted in pediatric practices to achieve advanced goal of minimal invasive surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612446355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612446355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612446355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612446355">4</xref></sup> Our initial practices showed that single-incision laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy (SILH) was safe and effective in treatment of CDCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612446355">5</xref></sup> Yet whether it can be safely performed in neonates with congenital biliary malformations is still unclear. In this study, we report our first 10 successful SILH in neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions and assess its safety and efficiency.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ten neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions (CDC/BA = 6/4; female/male = 7/3) who underwent SILH between May 2011 and September 2011 were reviewed. The mean operative age was 24.4 ± 3.7 days (range = 18-28 days). The average weight of the patients was 4.3 ± 0. 9 kg (range = 3.0-5.1 kg). Prenatal ultrasonographic studies detected the cysts at hepatic hilum in 7 patients at the gestation age of 19-37 weeks. Intraoperative cholangiograms confirmed that 5 of the 7 patients had CDC and the remaining 2 had type I and II BA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612446355">6</xref></sup> Two asymptomatic neonates with CDC were referred to our department because the pre- and postnatal ultrasonographic studies detected increase in size of the hilar cysts. The remaining 4 neonates with CDC and 4 neonates with BA presented prolonged jaundice after birth. The procedures were conducted by the same surgical team. Ethics approval from the ethics committee of Capital Institute of Pediatrics was obtained. Written informed consents were obtained from the parents of the patients prior to the study.</p>
<p>The patient was placed in anti-Trendelenberg position. The operating surgeon stood at the foot end of the table, and the assistant surgeon stood on the patient’s left side holding the camera. A vertical umbilical skin incision was made. An extra-long 5-mm 30° laparoscope (26046BA, Karl Storz GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was placed through the camera port, which was located at the midline fascial incision. Two 3-mm conventional, straight laparoscopic instruments were inserted through working ports that were placed lateral to the camera port at the ends of the umbilical incision, which was stretched transversely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612446355">Figure 1</xref>). Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum was created at a pressure of 6 to 8 mm Hg.</p>

<p>With laparoscopic guidance, intraoperative cholangiograms were performed through a 20G angiocatheter puncturing the gallbladder. Two to 3 retraction sutures were placed through the abdominal wall and gallbladder fundus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612446355">Figure 1</xref>), common hepatic duct in CDC or fibrous tissue of hepatic hilum in BA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612446355">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612446355">2b</xref>), and midportion of anterior wall of cystic dilatation (for patients with larger cysts).</p>

</fig>
<p>The distal cyst in CDC and blind cystic ends of the bile ducts in BA were dissected out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612446355">Figure 2a</xref>) and then incised across the most distal part. In all BA patients, significant and continuous bile drainages were observed. The bile was aspirated, and the distal wall of the cyst was resected. Distal common bile ducts in all CDC neonates were stenotic. Hence, the stumps of the distal ducts were not ligated as they were friable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612446355">7</xref></sup> The proximal cyst was dissected to the hepatic hilum. The proximal common hepatic duct with diameters &gt;1.0 cm in patients with CDC and 0.5-1.0 cm in correctable BA patients were reserved for anastomosis. The intrahepatic ducts were routinely investigated by telescope in CDC neonates. The stenoses were located and incised. The sludges were completely removed by normal saline irrigation.</p>
<p>The gallbladder was then dissected from the gallbladder fossa subserosally by a 3-mm hook electrocautery. The suture through the gallbladder serosa was used to retract liver in the hepaticojejunostomy.</p>
<p>An individualized jejunal Roux loop length was tailored according to the distance between the umbilicus and the hepatic hilum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612446355">8</xref></sup> Jejunojejunal anastomosis was carried out extracorporeally through the enlarged umbilical wound. The mesenteric defects were closed extracorporeally. After carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum reestablished, the telescope and working instruments were reinserted through initial umbilical incision and 2 incisions lateral to umbilical incision, respectively. The Roux loop was carried to the hilum through the retrocolic route. In the current series, the diameters of proximal common hepatic ducts in all BA patients were 0.5 to 1.0 cm (ie, correctable BA), which were adequately large for end-to-side anastomosis. According to the diameter of anastomotic stoma, one double-armed 6/0 PDS (PDS*II, Z148, Ethicon Inc, Sommerville, NJ) was divided into two 10- to 15-cm short segments with 1-needle (Taper RB-2, 1/2 Circle, 13 mm, Ethalloy, Ethicon Inc) at each end. Hepaticojejunostomy was started at 6 o’clock position, that is, midpoint of the posterior wall (the knot of 2 trimmed short arms was placed at 6 o’clock position) and proceeded to 9 and 3 o’clock positions separately, using continuous suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612446355">Figure 2B</xref>). The sutures were tightened from 9 and 3 o’clock positions simultaneously after completing the posterior wall anastomosis. The anterior wall anastomosis was performed using continuous suture along the 3–12–9 o’clock direction using the same PDS suture. The sutures were knotted at 9-o’clock position. The diameter of the anastomosis was &gt;1.0 cm in CDC neonates and 0.5 to 1.0 cm in patients with correctable BA. Subhepatic drainage tubes were placed only in patients with BA.</p>
<p>According to the postoperative intervention protocol in our department, patients with patients were routinely given antibiotics, ursodeoxycholic acid, and compound glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizin, glycine, and cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate improve liver function) and patients with CDCs who had liver malfunctions were given regular compound glycyrrhizin till the laboratory results normalized after medicine cessation.</p>
<p>Patients were followed up at our clinic at postoperative 1, 2, 3, and 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. Laboratory tests, ultrasonographic and upper gastrointestinal studies were conducted.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All patients successfully underwent SILH without conversions. The mean diameter and length of the cysts were 3.4 ± 1.4 cm (range = 1.0-5.5 cm) and 4.0 ± 1.6 cm (range = 1.5-6.2 cm), respectively. All CDC neonates combined with intrahepatic duct dilatations. Four of them (66.7%) had additional sludge formations. Pathological results showed that all patients had grade II to IV hepatic fibrosis. The mean operative time was 2.1 ± 0.6 hours (range = 1.7-3.7 hours). No blood transfusion was required. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.8 ± 1.7 days (range = 5-11 days). The average duration of full diet resumption was 2.4 ± 0.5 days (range = 2-3 days). The mean drainage duration in CDC neonates was 3.2 ± 0.7 days (range = 2-4 days).</p>
<p>In our historic open-control groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612446355">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612446355">10</xref></sup> the operative times were 3.0 ± 0.7 hours in CDC neonates (n = 15) and 3.4 ± 0.5 hours in correctable BA patients (n = 7), and the postoperative hospital stay were 10.5 ± 2.9 days in CDC neonates and 6.8 ± 1.3 days in correctable BA patients. The resumption of full diet in CDC neonates was 5.1 ± 1.6 days and duration of drainage was 5.4 ± 2.7 days.</p>
<p>None of patients required additional analgesics postoperatively. Until now, the patients have been followed up for 4 to 8 months. The median follow-up duration was 6.0 months. All patients recovered uneventfully. They regularly took medical treatments during the follow-up periods. Jaundice gradually declined after postoperative day 3 in CDC and type I BA patients, and after day 6 in type II BA patients. The total and direct bilirubins returned to normal levels at 1 month postoperation in CDC and type I BA patients and at 3 months postoperation in type II BA patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612446355">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612446355">2</xref>). Liver functions significantly improved in all patients. Alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase normalized within 3 months in CDC patients whereas alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase normalized within 3 months in correctable BA patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612446355">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612446355">2</xref>). γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase in the 2 type I BA patients normalized at 6 months follow-up (18.4 U/L and 8.7 U/L). So far, no mortality or morbidity of cholangitis, bile leak, anastomotic stenosis, Roux loop obstruction, wound infection, or wound hernia were observed. Postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast studies showed that no intrahepatic reflux occurred in either CDC or correctable BA patients. The cosmetic outcomes were considered to be better than the conventional 4-port laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612446355">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Single-incision laparoscopy is gaining wide acceptance in pediatric surgeries as it minimizes surgical trauma. It has been employed in appendectomies, cholecystectomies, pyloromyotomies, enterolysis, ovarian cystectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, Nissen fundoplications, and endorectal pull-through procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612446355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612446355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612446355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612446355">4</xref></sup> To date, its feasibility and safety in treatment of neonates with congenital biliary malformations remain uncertain. In the current study, we report our experience of SILH by conventional straight laparoscopic instruments for neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions, and evaluate its safety and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrated that in experienced hands, SILH with conventional straight instruments was feasible and safe for neonates. With technical improvement, the average operative time of open procedures at our center has been significantly shortened to 2 hours for neonates with extrahepatic cystic lesions. The operative time in SILH was shorter than that of the open procedures of our historic controls and comparable to that in the recent records. The postoperative recovery of SILH was similar to or faster than that of the open surgeries. So far, no intraoperative and postoperative complications in SILH were encountered, which was significantly less than the morbidities in historic open groups. The postoperative pain was minimal. There was no requirement of additional analgesics. Cosmetic outcomes were superior to open and conventional 4-port laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy and achieved “virtually scarless wound.” Parents were satisfied with the operative management by SILH and were particularly enthusiastic in regard to the cosmetic effects of single-incision approach.</p>
<p>Our results showed that most neonatal biliary cystic lesions were detected prenatally and majority of them presented with persistent jaundice immediately after birth. All CDC neonates were combined with intrahepatic duct dilatations. Nearly 70% of CDC neonates associated with sludge formations, which aggravated distal obstructions and potentially induced spontaneous perforations. Both CDC and correctable BA patients showed moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis. Hence, early surgical interventions are strongly advocated for neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions, even for those asymptomatic CDC neonates. Proper surgical strategy can effectively prevent the development of progressive hepatic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612446355">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to conventional concept, SILH is seemingly easier to be performed in neonates than older children. It may be attributed to their immature abdominal muscles and fascia, which allows more freedom of instrument movements. Additionally, the relatively small operating fields in neonatal patients may facilitate SILH with straight instruments.</p>
<p>The wall of the common hepatic duct in neonates is thin and fragile. Gentle manipulation, application of 2- to 3-mm working instruments, and utilization of 6/0 PDS suture in the anastomosis are helpful to minimize the intra- and postoperative complications. In addition, the instruments are inserted in the same directions as that of the scope. This is beneficial for posterior wall dissection. With accumulation of experience and proficiency in both hepatobiliary surgery and advanced laparoscopic surgery, the single-incision laparoscopic hepaticojejunal anastomosis can be achieved as in the conventional 4-port laparoscopic procedure.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the current study suffers from small size and relatively short follow-up period. We will accordingly report the long-term follow-up results of these patients in a larger cohort and compare its long-term efficacy with conventional laparoscopic and open hepatojejunostomies in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, SILH is feasible, safe, and effective for neonates with extrahepatic biliary cystic lesions, when carried out by experienced surgeons. It provides a new approach for neonatal hepatobiliary surgery.</p>
