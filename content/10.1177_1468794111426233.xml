<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past two decades significant developments have occurred in the archiving of qualitative data in the UK. The establishment in 1994 of Qualidata, the first generic archive for qualitative data resources and now part of the UK Data Archive, fuelled a growing interest in the re-use of qualitative data resources. This led to further investment in the creation of such resources by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) whose strategic priority was to explore and promote research and the use of new types of data arising from digitization. The Timescapes initiative (2007–12) is part of this growth. It was funded to promote and scale up Qualitative Longitudinal (QL) research by creating a specialist resource of QL data for sharing and re-use. The wider historical development of Qualitative and QL archiving in the UK has been traced elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111426233">Bishop and Neale, 2010, 2011</xref>). In this article we document the development of the Timescapes Archive as a specialist infrastructure for QL research, focusing on the strategic and practical dimensions of its growth, including data documentation, informed consent, anonoymization and data access controls. In the process we explore the importance of effective communication and negotiation in the development of stakeholder collaborations between researchers and archivists. We highlight the importance of taking the needs of both primary and secondary researchers into account in the development of strategies for archiving and data sharing. The Timescapes Archive operates at the intersection of primary and secondary research, acting as a bespoke repository for the data of primary researchers and facilitating their ongoing analysis, while bringing related datasets together for enhanced analysis by both primary and secondary users.</p>

<title>The Timescapes resource</title>
<p>The Timescapes Archive is a digital, multi-media resource of QL data. The broad definition of QL enquiry – research conducted through or in relation to time – allows for the inclusion of retrospectively gathered life history data, as well as data that is prospectively gathered to track lives as they unfold. The resource is a satellite of the UK Data Archive, developed as part of an institutional repository (LUDOS) at the University of Leeds, and conforming to international archiving standards (Open Archival Information System). It was designed and developed in collaboration with the UK Data Archive and the Making the Long View project (see this issue). In order to fashion a resource and service that was in tune with the analytical needs of researchers, our projects teams were consulted on technical design, data discovery and data access functions and the templates and protocols for deposit and re-use. Technical development of the resource is ongoing, with provision to migrate to an open source software platform in future years.</p>
<p>The archive was developed over a three-year period and opened to users in mid-2010. To date, the resource contains data from eight core Timescapes projects that span the life course. These projects have produced a series of interlinked datasets that track individuals and family groups over time, exploring the dynamics of personal relationships and identities as they unfold. Heritage data from earlier phases of the projects form a valuable core within the Archive holdings and extend the historical timeline of data held in the resource. Bringing these datasets into a common frame enhances the potential for analysis. There is scope, for example, to explore the dynamic intersection of home and schooling, family and employment, kinship and friendship, formal and informal care, and biography and history, drawing on comparable data from across the projects. We have built refined browse and search tools into the facility to enable the linking and analysis of thematically comparable data and to aid temporal analysis of biographical, generational or historical data. Data files can be searched for thematic content, using conceptual and descriptive keyword searching at case level. Such refined search and retrieval can facilitate a more complex and nuanced discovery of temporal data than is usually the case in generic data facilities.</p>
<p>To date, data from approximately 22O participants in the core projects has been deposited in the archive: a total of 1467 data files, including transcripts, visual and audio data, drawings, timelines, diaries and field notes. Eighty five percent of participants in the core projects have given consent for archiving. A further 10 per cent have given consent for archiving with restricted access or embargoes in place, while in 5 per cent of cases consent has been refused or has yet to be secured. Ingest of data from these projects will continue into 2012 and the holdings will be further boosted in 2012 with datasets from affiliated QL projects. Our experience matches the wider picture: archiving for posterity and wider use by bone fide researchers is generally viewed positively by research participants and their consent readily obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111426233">Kuula, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468794111426233">
<title>The scope of the archive</title>
<p>From its inception, the archive was designed to collate and exploit QL datasets from a broad range of substantive projects. This was an important strategy since, at the time of funding in 2007, relatively few QL datasets were available for re-use through the UK Data Archive, and there was a discernible gap between the growing ethos of re-use and the actual practices of qualitative researchers. As well as the ongoing ingest of data from the core empirical projects, there is an active initiative to ingest data from a range of separately funded QL projects and studentships that are affiliated to Timescapes. The inclusion of such data will significantly boost the archive holdings, enrich the interdisciplinary scope of the resource and create the potential for new forms of analysis and knowledge production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468794111426233">
<title>Strategic development</title>
<p>While building a specialist QL data resource and facilitating its re-use for both research and teaching was our core objective, the mechanisms for achieving this in the funders’ specification were left open. New strategies were needed to encourage archiving for re-use, enhance the status of these data, and develop the technical infrastructure needed for resource discovery and thematic searching. Timescapes took an innovative approach to these tasks, taking into account the distinctive nature of QL data, the richness and variety of QL contextual documentation, and the complex processes through which researchers generate, analyse and share such data.</p>
<p>It was our view that forms of archiving based on collaboration with researchers would be needed to build a QL resource etc. The reasons for this relate to the nature of QL research – and to qualitative research more broadly. Because qualitative researchers usually generate data in the field themselves and, in the process, build up relationships with their participants, they have a uniquely personal affinity with and ‘feel’ for the data and the context within which they were generated. In the context of data gathered prospectively through intensive fieldwork conducted over the long term, this personal engagement with the data becomes all the more significant. Second, qualitative research often involves the generation of sensitive and revealing data that are contextually rich, difficult to anonymize, and therefore run a higher risk of disclosing identities. In a longitudinal context, this risk is greatly heightened and particular care is therefore needed to preserve confidentiality. Third, QL projects are often the product of individual or small team scholarship that can last over many years, sometimes decades. The originating teams control and have exclusive access to the population samples that make up a study, and determine how and when they are followed up over time. Such projects may have a provisional feel; they are never quite finished, both in terms of the potential for further data generation, and the endless possibilities for complex primary analysis and ‘reworking’ data to produce new insights.</p>
<p>Of equal significance, QL data is gathered by researchers to address particular research questions; they are engaged in primary analysis and endeavouring to contribute new knowledge. This is in contrast to large-scale longitudinal enquiry, where data is gathered solely for secondary use. The push to archive for the common good may therefore be compromised by the pull to retain data – at least while analysis is ongoing – for the good of the originating team. This was a particular challenge in Timescapes, where the creation of the data resource in a relatively short time frame was a requirement of our funding, and yet where the teams were engaged in the elongated timeframes of QL enquiry. Whatever the ethos surrounding qualitative data re-use, these issues have important implications for the timing and nature of archiving, the resources needed by primary teams for data preparation tasks, and more broadly, for ways of working across the primary/secondary research interface.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468794111426233">
<title>The stakeholder model of archiving</title>
<p>Arising from these considerations we devised a <bold>stakeholder model of archiving</bold> that encourages data deposit and sharing while a prospective QL study is ongoing. In this model, archiving becomes an integral part of the research process, built in at the design stage, rather than an administrative task that is ‘tacked on’ to the end of a project. Data can be generated and organized for archiving as part of primary use, including consent for archiving, and prepared according to international standards. Such requirements for data deposit are now being formalized through the new requirement for data management plans for ESRC funded projects. But a collaborative model has advantages. Researchers are in the best position to provide rich and descriptive metadata (data about data) that provides important context and is aligned to the requirements of temporal analysis. Depositors are encouraged to re-use the data they have generated and link these to other related data as their research progresses, thereby combining primary and secondary analysis to raise new questions and produce new insights. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have a further stake in how the data in the archive is used and by whom. The archive builds in secure levels of access for data that are highly sensitive or un-anonymized; their use depends on permission from the originating team. In this way, the archive encourages the sharing of data that might otherwise remain unshared and opens up the potential for a consultative process between primary and secondary users. Thus, as well as the more usual indirect sharing of data via the archive, Timescapes enables a collaborative and personalized mode of data sharing which is one of the main ways that researchers choose to share their data in practice. In these ways, the Timescapes archive has developed more flexible and bespoke options for data sharing than are usually found in generic archives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468794111426233">
<title>Implementing the stakeholder model</title>
<p>There were a number of considerations to take into account in implementing the stakeholder approach. The challenge was to develop ways for researchers and archivists to think about and relate to data that would straddle the worlds of archiving and research. One very basic challenge required finding a common language to <italic>communicate</italic> effectively. A second challenge – finding common solutions in the face of competing needs – required researchers and archivists to <italic>negotiate.</italic> These processes were aided within the Timescapes team because membership of the archiving and researcher groups with their complementary roles were somewhat fluid, with some researchers being very active in archiving and some of the archive team engaging in substantive research. Several examples, grounded in the specifics of the Timescapes project work, illustrate these strategies.</p>
<sec id="section7-1468794111426233">
<title>I say ‘metadata’; you say ‘context’</title>
<p>One of the first requirements of integrating archiving with research was the need to address the archival obligation to document data early in the design phase of the research. There is growing recognition that managing data, including creating data documentation, early in the research process facilitates data sharing. Broadly speaking, researchers and archivists agreed on the value of data documentation and the need to collect it. There was also shared understanding that documentation included items such as: project descriptions, methodologies, interview documents, field notes giving insights about participants, substantive themes, and the conditions under which data were generated, data descriptions, conditions of consent, confidentiality, and so on. Beyond this general level of agreement, important differences arose, and differences in terminology had to be addressed and resolved.</p>
<p>Within the broad category of documentation, archivists distinguish a subset, called metadata, or data about data: ‘Metadata are a subset of core data documentation, which provides standardized structured information . . . typically used for resource discovery . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426233">UK Data Archive, 2010a</xref>). Examples of metadata include data creator’s name, date of data creation, and keywords that describe the data. Timescapes had to confront a specific challenge here: although some structured metadata existed, we were seeking to develop a more comprehensive set of metadata particularly adapted for QL research. Most social science data archives follow a standard called the Data Documentation Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111426233">DDI, 2010</xref>). Within the DDI general categories exist such as study title and creator, but some of the specific fields most useful for QL data, such as life course and temporal terms are not included. The difficulty arose in that archivists were, in a sense, asking researchers to collect metadata while the precise list of what to collect had not yet been specified. Early conversations between archivists and researchers used general definitions, preferring to err on the side of inclusiveness rather than omit key information. One early project meeting defined metadata as ‘fieldwork/research materials, historical/cultural/locality source materials to fully contextualize the research’. This was not an archival definition of metadata, but it was inclusive, with the added benefit of being comprehensible to the researchers.</p>
<p>Over the course of repeated conversations, the word ‘context’ became a bridging term. When researchers asked archivists to be more specific about metadata, the archivists asked for anything that would ‘contextualize’ the data, a term that had meaning within each domain, though it meant relying at this stage on a quite general definition of ‘context’. For qualitative researchers, context is linked with a relational understanding of data, that is, the impossibility of separating ‘data’ from ‘context’. Context, qualitatively speaking, is more than a static set of variables that surround persons, actions or situations but a fluid constellation of contingent factors, the salience of which emerge through everyday interaction and interpretive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111426233">Holstein and Gubrium, 2004</xref>). Data can only be said to be comprehensible within their context, ranging from interpreting an interview extract by situating it within the larger narrative to which it belongs, or analysing a turning point in the course of a life only by seeing it as part of the full biography in which it occurred and in relation to other biographical accounts. The archival sense is usually more narrow and technically defined, referring to the variety of documentation that might accompany data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111426233">UK Data Archive, 2010b</xref>). However, the flexibility of meanings permitted all groups to concur on next steps.</p>
<p>There was agreement to collect detailed metadata, and agreement that researchers were the custodians of richly detailed descriptive metadata. The specific problems were: what to collect and in what formats? Alongside detailed notes about fieldwork encounters, we settled on three categories of descriptive metadata. First, identifying information was to be documented on the interview transcription cover pages, showing the name of the project, depositor, interviewer, date of the interview and information on the interviewee and setting. This page was modelled on guidelines provided by the British Library Sound Archive Oral History Section and a transcription template from the UK Data Archive.</p>
<p>Second, we collectively defined a list of keywords that could be used to identify the thematic content of each data file. This list comprised 20 conceptual and descriptive terms, such as Childhood, Youth, Adulthood, Past and Future, that could be assigned to all interviews. The list was not exhaustive; researchers could also assign their own keywords to indicate specific thematic content of a data file. But the list provided a controlled vocabulary of basic terms to aid thematic searching and retrieval of data across the dataset. Third, we defined a structured set of what we called ‘base data’. These include socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, e.g. date of birth, living arrangement, employment (or employment of parents), income, and so on. These items were collected in part to allow comparative work to be undertaken with quantitative longitudinal studies such as the British Household Panel Survey and its successor, Understanding Society. With agreement on these three categories of metadata, the archiving team could develop the schema required to ingest the data into the archive and to enable QL-specific resource discovery of the archived materials.</p>
<p>Our differences were not ‘just’ linguistic ones; different languages reflected substantive underlying debates about the relationships among data, context, and documentation. Within archival practice, data, documentation and context are distinct and separable. Indeed the concept of long-term preservation states that documentation enables data to be retained in a way that renders it ‘independently understandable’, defined as:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>A characteristic of information that has sufficient documentation to allow the information to be understood and used by the Designated Community without having to resort to special resources not widely available, including named individuals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111426233">OAIS, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Data are different from their documentation, and documentation should render data understandable without the need for additional context or information from individuals such as the data creators.</p>
<p>This archival view, which highlights the stand-alone nature of data, stands in contrast to the relational, contextual and embedded view of data held by researchers as described above. Some have argued that these views are fundamentally opposed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111426233">Mauthner and Perry (2009)</xref>, for example, claim that archiving presupposes a foundationalist epistemology. In practice, however, the issues did not seem to lend themselves to such simple, binary oppositions. Most Timescapes researchers self-identify as working within epistemological frameworks of constructionism, with data and context of a piece. Yet all agreed to contribute data to an archive, not without some reservations, but clearly without subscribing to a foundationalist stance. This cannot be seen as cognitive dissonance, but rather, a layered, situated appreciation for the complexities of the archiving project and a growing interest in exploring and contributing to the mediation of knowledge in the archive.</p>
<p>Timescapes researchers shared the view that there is unique and ‘uncapturable’ information constructed during direct contacts with participants. However, appreciating the uniqueness of these encounters did not devalue the process of richly documenting how the original data were gathered and under what conditions. The researchers recognized two realities. First, they wanted to capture and record comprehensive documentation because they had the most detailed knowledge of the field and wanted later users to benefit from their knowledge. Second, no matter how thorough their efforts, everyone also knew documentation of this context would always be partial. This did not represent settling for a ‘half-done’ job but rather it demonstrated an ability to move flexibly between subjective and objective relationships with data. Team discussions also showed that we understood that future researchers would, regardless of our work, re-contextualize the data, perhaps using materials we had provided, but also bringing their own critical and reflexive views to bear on the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426233">Bishop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111426233">Moore, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426233">Hadfield (2010)</xref> provides a sensitive accounting of this nuanced way of proceeding within the Motherhood projects. The team placed great emphasis on detailed and rich description of the research encounter, settings, interviewees, and also the feelings and responses of the researchers. After team discussion, it was deemed that these raw notes were too revealing to deposit in the archive. Also, the anonymization that would have been necessary in some cases removed significant contextual information from the data. The team decided, therefore, to create ‘parallel’ reflexive field notes that were written from a self-aware stance and with the expectation that they would be archived. Also, notes were added to transcripts alerting future readers to the loss of significant information from anonymization. With the mediating influence of the archive, researchers were encouraged to pro-actively build the probability of QL data re-use into their primary research practices and data management, thereby allowing for an expansion of the analytic lens to encompass secondary use. Allowing for broad understandings of context – both technical and epistemological – to enrich the metadata was crucial to this process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1468794111426233">
<title>Negotiating standards and flexibility</title>
<p>‘The primary objective of all archives is to select, preserve and make available for use documents or information which have permanent or continuing value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794111426233">UK Data Archive, 2010c</xref>). To achieve this objective, archives must satisfy requirements of extensive and complex legal and regulatory frameworks. For data archives, these include copyright laws, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111426233">Data Protection Act 1998</xref>, and other national and international directives.</p>
<p>Researchers, too, operate in their own complex environments, made up of university administrations, professional bodies, ethical guidelines, funders’ conditions, research cultures and so on. For empirical researchers, a central objective is the welfare of research participants and ensuring that they come to no harm from engaging with research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426233">Hadfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794111426233">Spicker, 2007</xref>). This duty of care was important to the Timescapes team, particularly around issues of confidentiality, the ethical representation of accounts and interpretations, whether consent for archiving was informed where the specifics of re-use were unknowable, and whether secondary use would render participants vulnerable to exploitation or their views being misrepresented. The duty of care extends to the researchers themselves, with concern, for example, over whether the sharing of data may expose them to unfair criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426233">Neale and Bishop, 2010, 2011</xref>). In addition to a primary emphasis on care, most researchers subscribed to an ethical stance that emphasizes the particularities of any ethical question, and typically calls for negotiation in resolving ethical questions, rather than relying on the application of general rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426233">Mauthner and Edwards, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Separating out these central objectives above should not be taken to mean that either archivists or researchers were insensitive to the concerns of the other group. The archivists were familiar with research practices and their ethical needs; the researchers were committed to the protection and long-term preservation of the valuable data they were collecting. However, the distinctive priorities of the two groups shaped how key practices evolved during the project. Only through extensive negotiation could the objectives of both groups be reconciled. Examples are discussed across the three strategies used to make data shareable: gaining informed consent for archiving, altering data to protect identities (e.g. anonymization) and regulating access to data through a system of access controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1468794111426233">
<title>Informed consent</title>
<p>Informed consent is an ethical requirement for most research. Timescapes researchers and archivists shared strong commitments to the ethical use of data, but their primary roles shaped the particulars of how these commitments were perceived and acted upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111426233">Bishop, 2009</xref>). The Timescapes archivists sought to implement consent procedures early so that the data collected would be sharable. The archivists started with the model consent form developed at the UK Data Archive which reflected legal requirements of data archiving: the preference for written consent, the timing of when consent should be sought, and some provisions of the consent form itself.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Act regulates how data are handled, specifically personal or sensitive data. According to the Data Protection Act, personal information is about a living individual that identifies that individual. Sensitive data are information such as racial or ethnic origin, religion, medical information, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111426233">Data Protection Act, 1998</xref>). If research data to be archived contain personal or sensitive data about informants, consent is needed from each informant for such data to be processed, ideally in writing. Formally, this applies only to personal data. Therefore, if a person cannot be identified – because identifiers have been removed or if the data have been fully anonymized – then the Data Protection Act no longer applies. For much qualitative data, it can be difficult to assure absolute anonymization, and thus the safest (legal) stance from an archive’s perspective is to have written consent in place.</p>
<p>Archives also tend to recommend that consent for all purposes (research, publication and archiving) be gained as early as possible. While not a legal requirement, this advice emerges from seeing many cases where such consent was not obtained, and for reasons such as inadequate funds or loss of contact with participants, consent for archiving was subsequently impossible to obtain, rendering potentially valuable data unshareable.</p>
<p>Another factor for archives to consider is that of copyright. The UK Data Archive recommends that researchers ask their participants to transfer copyright to the researcher. This protects the researchers by enabling them to legally authorise the UK Data Archive to make copies of digital materials for purposes of digital preservation. The net effect of these requirements is that the UK Data Archive recommends a written consent form, that consent be sought early in the research, and the form explicitly asks participants to transfer copyright to researchers.</p>
<p>While Timescapes researchers shared a commitment to the ethics of consent, they had concerns about the first version of the consent form. For example, some potential participants came from very poor households, and had had repeated and negative experiences with bureaucratic forms and legal documents. Researchers were also justifiably worried that the language of the form was intimidating and that a less formal, verbal approach would work better. Furthermore, researchers made a case for separating consent for participation in the research from consent for archiving. They wanted to gain optimal levels of participation (and some projects had extremely challenging recruiting profiles to fulfil) and build rapport with participants before discussing archiving. In the latter stages of research, they argued, participants would have a much clearer understanding of the data they had produced, and would be more able to grant authentic informed consent. The longitudinal method meant there would be repeat contacts with participants and numerous opportunities to seek consent later in the process.</p>
<p>The process of producing a consent form acceptable to all the projects took a great deal of time, including drafting the form, holding consultations with representatives from each of the seven projects, incorporating their feedback into the form and keeping the wording of the Timescapes form aligned with changes and updates in UK Data Archive policies. The effort yielded a standardized consent form that covers areas of consent for participation, research outputs and data sharing and archiving. The outcome has been positive: all the teams agreed to use the form and the main changes were to customize the form, while retaining its main meanings. For example, customized language was needed to adapt the form to certain groups, such as young people. The main deviations were that rather than written consent, some projects gained verbal consent and recorded and transcribed the consent agreement, while others deferred asking for consent for archiving until later waves of fieldwork were conducted. Finally, there was good collaboration in producing information sheets that accompanied consent forms. The archivists drafted these scripts to help researchers explain the idea of a data archive to participants. This boilerplate text explained issues such as how digital data is shared (making clear that this does not occur publicly on the web); the ways data can be re-used; reasons for needing copyright; and so on. Researchers then customized this text into their own project-specific information sheets.</p>

<sec id="section10-1468794111426233">
<title>Anonymization of data</title>
<p>A similar procedure for collaboration was followed around producing guidelines for anonymizing data. This is seen as the key mechanism for protecting the identity of research participants. Again, draft guidelines were available from the UK Data Archive and from the Making the Long View archiving project. Exchanges took place between archivists and researchers, but the challenges in this case were greater in a number of ways. First, the initial guidelines proposed proved to be too complex and even when simpler ones were produced, not all projects were aware of the changes and some confusion ensued over which version was in effect. More fundamentally, there are widely varying views on appropriate levels of anonymization, from none, to light touch, to comprehensive. The oral historians within Timescapes, for example, prioritize the authenticity of historical accounts, which militates against anonymization, whereas the tendency within sociology has traditionally been to comprehensively anonymize to protect the identities of these they study. It was nearly impossible to specify in the abstract what should be used. Archivists and researchers attempted to work toward the best solution for each project. Very possibly, more project-specific support from the archivists would have helped at this phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1468794111426233">
<title>Access controls</title>
<p>In the end, the challenges of anonymization were, in a sense, partially addressed by the establishment of a system of levels of access to the data. This is an alternative route to meeting the requirements of ethical protection, one which controls or limits access to the archived data. This was seen as a viable option for researchers who were concerned about sensitive data or dangers of ‘over-anonymizing’. Across the team we negotiated four levels of access to Timescapes data: public access, registered access, approved access and embargoed. For the first level, metadata and selected screened data are publicly available and enable browsers to sample data sources and gain a feel for what the archive contains. The second level, registered use, is the primary form of access to the archive, reserved for bone fide researchers from authorized academic, policy related or public institutions. Registered users sign a licence agreeing to strict terms and conditions. The third level, approved use, enables registered users to gain access to specific data that are sensitive or difficult to anonymize. They are required to submit a further application, which is screened and considered for approval by the originating team of researchers who deposited the data. Finally, some data are embargoed for varying periods of time. The ability to grant or deny access by individual users to individual files (such as interviews) was reassuring to the researchers. This was vital in enabling some of the most sensitive data to be deposited, data that in likelihood would not have been deposited at all without these flexible controls. The process of bringing the originating team into communication with potential secondary users is also likely to be potentially productive for both.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1468794111426233">
<title>Communication and negotiation – necessary elements in the stakeholder model</title>
<p>As the examples above show, communication and negotiation underpinned the stakeholder model of archiving used to build the Timescapes resource. It may seem obvious that communication would be important in a stakeholder model. Yet it is surprising how often it is neglected. It is easier to presume shared meanings than to probe: do we all mean the same thing here? And not focusing on differences can be useful for a time – the multiple definitions on context, for example – yet eventually meanings had to be clarified. Similarly, negotiation would seem obvious, and it is, but too often only in the abstract. When it comes to allocating project resources to the travel and meetings needed for the processes, this is more challenging. Timescapes made good efforts in these directions, yet everyone believes that even more was needed.</p>
<p>Perhaps what is most salient about the stakeholder model is that it was a deliberate choice; that alternative paths could have been taken. One possibility could have been to impose a far more structured, hierarchical, directive scheme. That is, the archiving team could have attempted, for example, to mandate the use of a standardized consent form, anonymization procedures, and so on, without consultation or negotiation. Certainly much time would have been saved. However, despite any shortcomings of the stakeholder approach, the Timescapes team continues to believe that this alternative would have been much less acceptable, and thus less effective. Imposing this kind of control would have been counter-productive in an initiative designed to respect and encourage a grounded and flexible approach to fieldwork and data generation across our network of projects. Even if it were possible, it is antithetical to the collegial culture of research and of this research team and indeed to most academic enterprises. Finally, it would not have been a proper foundation for the kinds of collaborative work Timescapes intended and, indeed, has fostered.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Timescapes Archive has developed as a unique resource for sharing QL data. The number of affiliated projects linked to the archive has steadily increased, offering the potential for growth. The embedding of archiving in a methodologically driven programme has enabled us to offer both methods and archiving support for QL researchers, through which the possibilities for combining primary and secondary analysis have emerged. These multiple functions are part of the appeal for QL researchers. The resource is a repository for huge volumes of QL data as they are being generated, designed to aid ongoing primary analysis as well as facilitating secondary use across comparable datasets. The archive has acted as a broker between specialist QL research communities and generic national facilities, forming a valuable bridge between research and archiving, and between primary and secondary research, enabling these to be seen as iterative and reciprocal processes.</p>
<p>Building the Timescapes Archive as a collaborative enterprise with researchers and the UK Data Archive has been time consuming, but the new flexible templates and protocols are now in place for future use, and with potential for wider application. The time dedicated to discussion about archiving and re-use has also been valuable and helped to move debates beyond the impasse of recent years. We have highlighted the importance of raising the status of datasets as research ‘outputs’ in their own right, deserving recognition in Government assessments of research excellence, and their kite marking (e.g. through the allocation of Digital Object Identifiers similar to the assigning of book and journal numbers). In these ways, the impetus to archive will increase, the quality of QL data is likely to improve, as will the responsiveness of the archive to researchers’ needs. We have also highlighted the central role played by researchers in the sustained task of generating and preparing QL datasets and metadata for archiving. Such work is too often rendered invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426233">Hadfield, 2010</xref>), pointing to the need for adequate resources to be built into project design and budgets for these processes. Good data management that embodies archiving as an integral part of the research process is likely to be more cost effective and streamlined than the process of retrospective data preparation and archiving. It will also facilitate the complex analysis of QL data over time. The ESRC Data Policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111426233">2010</xref>) calls for more formal data management procedures, and Timescapes has demonstrated that such policies can be implemented in a consultative manner. Overall, the processes involved in a stakeholder model of archiving reveal that this is not simply a matter of bringing researchers to the archive but of bringing archiving more effectively into the realm of research. In this way, specialist data infrastructures can be developed and harnessed more effectively to help address some of the grand challenges of social research.</p>
