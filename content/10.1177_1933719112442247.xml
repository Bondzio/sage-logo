<abstract>
<p>Prostaglandins are key components of the parturition cascade; however, the mechanisms that regulate prostaglandin concentrations in the uterus during pregnancy are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the intrauterine expression of the chief prostaglandin-inactivating enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), during gestation and labor in the guinea pig, an animal model in which the endocrine control of pregnancy and parturition is analogous to that of women. PGDH messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance decreased significantly in the visceral yolk sac membrane (VYS, the anatomical equivalent of the human chorion laeve) and the amnion throughout the last third of pregnancy. PGDH protein was robustly expressed in the VYS epithelium and mesoderm, correlated strongly with <italic>PGDH</italic> mRNA levels and exhibited a nadir at term prior to labor onset. PGDH protein was not detected in the amnion. PGDH mRNA and protein levels in the placenta and myoendometrium were variable throughout late gestation. In the placenta, PGDH protein was concentrated in the parietal yolk sac membrane (PYS) lining the placental surface and in placental blood vessels. We observed strong expression of PGDH protein in the endometrial epithelium with comparably little expression in the myometrium. These data indicate that metabolic inactivation of prostaglandins in the pregnant guinea pig uterus takes place in the VYS, PYS, and endometrium. Decreased PGDH expression in the fetal membranes may contribute to the increase in intrauterine prostaglandin concentrations at term, stimulating the onset of labor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostaglandins are potent uterotonins that facilitate parturition via stimulation of myometrial contractions, cervical softening, and fetal membrane rupture. Intrauterine prostaglandin levels increase significantly at late gestation and/or during labor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112442247">1</xref>

</sup> The concentration of biologically active prostaglandins in the pregnant uterus is controlled by the activity of prostaglandin synthetic and inactivating pathways in the gestational tissues (myometrium, endometrium/decidua, placenta and fetal membranes). The committing step of prostaglandin biosynthesis is catalyzed by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS also known as PGHS or COX), which has 2 isoforms, PTGS-1 and -2. The initial inactivating step of prostaglandin metabolism is catalyzed by type 1 NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH also known as HPGD). The mechanisms that regulate the expression and activities of these enzymes in the gestational tissues are largely unknown. While labor can be induced pharmacologically by the administration of prostaglandins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112442247">6</xref>
</sup> and can be interrupted by the administration of PTGS inhibitors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112442247">7</xref>
</sup> tocolytic therapies that utilize prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112442247">7</xref>
</sup> Investigation of the mechanisms that regulate prostaglandin synthesis and inactivation in the pregnant uterus may therefore lead to the development of more effective strategies to combat preterm labor and reduce adverse neonatal outcomes.</p>
<p>In order to identify new approaches to manage preterm labor and prevent preterm birth, interventional studies are needed that are not possible in women. The aim of our studies is to define key mechanisms that control gestational length and trigger labor in an animal model that is highly relevant to humans. These mechanisms may reveal targets for therapeutic interventions for maintaining uterine quiescence and delaying birth until a time that minimizes adverse neonatal outcomes. The endocrine control of pregnancy and parturition in the guinea pig is remarkably similar to that seen in women, making the guinea pig an exceptional animal model in which to study the hormonal regulation of parturition with relevance to women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112442247">8</xref>
</sup> In contrast to nearly all nonprimate mammals, parturition in women and guinea pigs is not triggered by a decrease in circulating progesterone levels,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112442247">9</xref>

</sup> and delivery cannot be delayed beyond term by the administration of exogenous progestins.<sup>

</sup> A functional progesterone withdrawal is thought to occur in these species at the level of the target tissue, the myometrium. We have previously shown that functional progesterone withdrawal in women and guinea pigs around the time of labor may be mediated by changes in myometrial progesterone receptor (PR) expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112442247">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112442247">20</xref>
</sup> We and others have also reported that intrauterine prostaglandin synthesis in the pregnant guinea pig occurs predominantly in the amnion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112442247">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112442247"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112442247">23</xref>
</sup> and that the capacity for prostaglandin synthesis increases with advancing gestation via an increase in PTGS expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112442247">21</xref>
</sup> Expression and activity of PTGS likewise increase in the human amnion at term labor,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112442247">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112442247">24</xref>
</sup> further illustrating the similarities in the hormonal regulation of pregnancy between women and guinea pigs and the usefulness of the guinea pig as an experimental model. We have now extended our studies to examine the expression and localization of PGDH, the key prostaglandin metabolic enzyme, in guinea pig gestational tissues.</p>
<p>In women, PGDH activity and expression are low and often undetectable in the amnion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112442247">25</xref>

</sup> The chorion laeve, which is interposed between the amnion and the endometrium, possesses high prostaglandin-inactivating ability,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112442247">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112442247">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112442247">29</xref>
</sup> and it is unclear whether prostaglandins secreted from the amnion can traverse the chorion and access the myometrium in sufficient amounts to function as uterotonins. In vitro experiments indicate that a fraction of prostaglandins can cross the chorion laeve without undergoing inactivation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112442247">30</xref>

</sup> while myometrial PGDH activity and protein levels decreased in laboring compared to nonlaboring women,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112442247">35</xref>
</sup> potentially allowing for decreased prostaglandin inactivation around the time of labor onset. The human placenta has a substantial capacity for prostaglandin inactivation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>
</sup> and placental <italic>PGDH</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) has been reported to increase with gestational age,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112442247">37</xref>

</sup> It is likely that prostaglandins synthesized by the placenta play a more important role in modulating placental blood flow than in stimulating labor onset.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112442247">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112442247">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Relatively little is known about prostaglandin metabolism in guinea pig gestational tissues. Prostaglandin-inactivating activity has been demonstrated in the guinea pig fetal membranes, placenta, and myometrium at term,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>
</sup> with the highest activity level in the visceral yolk sac (VYS) membrane.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112442247">40</xref>
</sup> In the guinea pig embryo, the wall of the blastocyst regresses completely following implantation and the highly vascularized VYS arises from the fetal endoderm, expanding to encase the developing fetus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112442247">41</xref>
</sup> The final anatomical location of the VYS is equivalent to that of the human chorion, being interposed between the amnion and the uterine wall. The VYS consists of a single epithelial layer with underlying mesoderm and is contiguous with the parietal yolk sac (PYS) membrane that lines the surface of the placenta. Owing to its high prostaglandin metabolic activity, the VYS appears to function in an analogous manner to the human chorion by providing a barrier that prevents amnion-derived prostaglandins from reaching the myometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112442247">40</xref>
</sup> Activity of PGDH in the guinea pig amnion at term is extremely low,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112442247">40</xref>
</sup> and prostaglandin inactivation by the guinea pig placenta has been shown to decrease significantly from day 50 of gestation until delivery on approximately day 68.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112442247">42</xref>
</sup> There are no data about the dynamics of PGDH activity or expression in the guinea pig VYS, myometrium, or amnion with advancing gestation or labor. In this study, we addressed this gap in knowledge by determining the ontogeny of PGDH mRNA and protein expression in the guinea pig gestational tissues throughout late pregnancy and during labor and by immunolocalizing PGDH protein in these tissues to identify the cells where the enzyme is primarily expressed.</p>

<title>Animals and Tissue Collection</title>
<p>Time-mated outbred guinea pigs were obtained from the University of Newcastle Animal Services Unit. The length of gestation in this guinea pig colony ranges from 63 to 71 days, with an average length of 67 days. Intrauterine tissues (amnion, VYS, placenta, and myo-endometrium) were collected from pregnant dams at 6 stages of late gestation, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112442247">Table 1</xref>. These groups were based on criteria originally described by Glasier and Hobkirk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112442247">43</xref>
</sup> A portion of each tissue was placed into 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) with the remaining tissue snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Separation of the pubic symphysis, which is required for parturition in the guinea pig, was assessed by palpation and began approximately 7 days prior to delivery (range: 6-9 days before delivery). The attachment of the VYS membranes to the endometrium was determined during tissue collection to distinguish between stages B and C. The entire uterus (myo-endometrium) was collected at a distance from the cervix to ensure that cervical tissue did not contaminate the sample. There were between 1 and 6 pups in each pregnancy and fetal membranes and placentae were collected separately from each pup; therefore, each pregnancy yielded 1 uterine sample and up to 6 individual amnion, VYS, and placenta samples. In order to collect tissues from guinea pigs during active labor, animals at term were monitored remotely using an infrared camera to minimize disturbance to the dams, and tissues were collected following the delivery of at least 1 pup. All studies were approved by the University of Newcastle Animal Care and Ethics Committee and were carried out in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.</p>

<title>RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Frozen tissues were pulverized under liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted from guinea pig tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extracts were treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) and purified using RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen). Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the integrity of RNA samples. RNA was quantified by UV spectrometry and reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Superscript II First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse Transcription–polymerase chain reaction ([RT-PCR] Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System with SYBR Green fluorescence detection (Applied Biosystems, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia) in order to measure the abundance of <italic>PGDH</italic> mRNA relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase <italic>(GAPDH)</italic> mRNA abundance. Relative mRNA abundance was determined using the ΔC<sc>t</sc> calculation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719112442247">45</xref>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Whole tissue protein extracts were prepared from frozen, pulverized guinea pig and human tissue samples by homogenization in 10 volumes of RIPA buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/L NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10 000<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 minutes and the supernatants were collected and assayed for total protein content using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). Protein extracts were incubated with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen) at 70°C for 10 minutes before separation on 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen; 40 μg total protein/lane). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and nonspecific binding was blocked using 5% skim milk powder in tris-buffered saline ([TBS] 20 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween-20. The membranes were incubated with PGDH antibody (catalog number 160615, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan; used at 2 ng/μL, diluted in blocking buffer) overnight at 4°C, then washed, and incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Cell Signaling, Danvers, Massachusetts; 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes were washed and incubated with chemiluminescent reagent (GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, Australia). The resulting protein bands were detected using the LAS-3000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Co, Tokyo, Japan) and analysed using Fujifilm MultiGauge v 2.3 software (Fuji Photo Film Co). The membranes were dried and re-wet in methanol to remove bound antibodies, then re-probed with GAPDH antibody (catalog number sc-32233, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California; 10 pg/μL, diluted in blocking buffer) followed by anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling; 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer) and chemiluminescent detection. The PGDH protein data were normalized to GAPDH expression in each sample and were also normalized to a control sample of laboring VYS extract that was included on every immunoblot.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and mounted on glass microscope slides. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanols. Antigen retrieval was carried out by incubation in trypsin solution (0.05% [w/v] trypsin and 0.1% [w/v] CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) at 37°C for 20 minutes. The slides were then washed in Tween-TBS (TTBS), incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 5 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, washed and incubated with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 30 minutes at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Sections were then incubated with anti-PGDH antibody (Cayman Chemical, catalog number 160615, 8 ng/μL) at room temperature for 60 minutes. Tissue sections incubated with PGDH antibody that had been pre-absorbed with its corresponding immunizing peptide served as negative controls. The sections were washed in TTBS and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (pig anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse IgG cocktail; Dako, Campbellfield, Victoria, Australia) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Sections were washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Dako) at room temperature for 15 minutes, then washed, and exposed to 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) peroxidase substrate for 1 minute. The sections were counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated in graded ethanols, cleared in xylene, mounted with coverslips, and examined by light microscopy.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The distribution of data was assessed using the Skewness and Kurtosis test for normality (Stata v 11.0 software; StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and data were transformed to achieve normal distribution where required using square root, logarithmic, or zero-skewness logarithmic transformations. Gestational stage-dependent differences in mRNA or protein levels were assessed by multilevel, mixed effects linear regression with gestational stage as the fixed-effect variable and individual pregnancies as a random-effect variable (Stata). This hierarchical analysis accounts for the multiple amnion, VYS, and placenta tissues that are derived from each individual guinea pig pregnancy. Tukey multiple comparison test was used to resolve significant differences between gestational stages. Both PGDH mRNA and protein levels in the myo-endometrium were assessed by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison test, as there was a single myoendometrial tissue for each dam. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the relationship between mRNA and protein levels in individual tissue samples (Stata). <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prostaglandins are crucial paracrine mediators of parturition in mammalian species. Biologically active prostaglandin concentrations are determined in part by the activity of the catabolic pathway, of which the initial and rate-limiting step is catalyzed by PGDH. PGDH has previously been detected in guinea pig VYS, placenta, and myometrium at late gestation, with little or no activity present in the amnion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112442247">42</xref>
</sup> There have been no studies of intrauterine PGDH expression in the guinea pig, and in this study we addressed this issue by determining PGDH mRNA and protein expression, as well as protein localization, throughout the last third of gestation and during active labor.</p>
<p>The highest relative abundance of <italic>PGDH</italic> mRNA and protein was found in the VYS, followed by the placenta, myo-endometrium, and then amnion, which follows the previously reported pattern of PGDH activity in these tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>
</sup> The guinea pig VYS and the human chorion therefore perform the homologous function of controlling the transfer of biologically active prostaglandins from the fetal membranes to the myometrium. PGDH expression in the VYS decreased significantly before labor onset at term, the time when we have previously reported that PTGS-1 expression peaks in the amnion,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112442247">21</xref>
</sup> which we speculate causes decreased metabolism of membrane-derived prostaglandins and allows for increased transfer of prostaglandins to the myometrium. This change in the balance of prostaglandin synthesis and inactivation in the fetal membranes at term may be a crucial component of the process of labor onset. It will be crucial in future studies to measure PGDH enzyme activity in the guinea pig gestational tissues and to determine changes in intrauterine prostaglandin concentrations with advancing gestation. VYS <italic>PGDH</italic> mRNA levels increased significantly following labor onset and were accompanied by a smaller, nonsignificant increase in VYS PGDH protein levels. Increased PGDH activity has also been reported in the human chorion following labor onset at term.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112442247">32</xref>
</sup> The reason for this increase in PGDH expression and/or activity during labor is unclear, however we speculate that this increase is a consequence of labor and is not related to labor onset, and that decreased prostaglandin metabolism prior to the onset of labor, rather than following labor onset, is necessary for the increased intrauterine prostaglandin concentrations that stimulate membrane rupture, cervical softening, and myometrial contractility. There was no significant change in PGDH expression in the other gestational tissues following labor onset compared to PGDH levels at term (stage E). Administration of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) into the amniotic cavity of a single guinea pig fetus on day 43 of pregnancy is sufficient to induce labor onset,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719112442247">49</xref>
</sup> indicating that sufficient concentrations of intact prostaglandin can traverse the VYS and endometrium to bring about labor. The capability of intra-amniotic PGE<sub>2</sub> to induce parturition at different gestational stages or dosages in the guinea pig has not been examined, and it would be interesting in future studies to determine whether the ability of intra-amniotic prostaglandins to cross the fetal membranes and endometrium unmetabolized varies with gestational age. The low levels of PGDH expression that we observed in the amnion agree with previous findings of low or undetectable PGDH activity in guinea pig amnion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112442247">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112442247">40</xref>
</sup> and are analogous to the findings in women.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112442247"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112442247">27</xref>
</sup> There was a significant decrease in amniotic <italic>PGDH</italic> mRNA with advancing gestation, which may lead to a small increase in prostaglandin output from the amnion, however we were unable to detect PGDH protein in amnion tissue.</p>
<p>Moussard et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112442247">42</xref>
</sup> have reported that prostaglandin inactivation by guinea pig placental homogenates decreases significantly between day 50 of pregnancy and delivery. Our data suggest that the mechanisms that bring about this decrease in placental PGDH activity operate downstream of transcriptional or translational regulation, as placental PGDH mRNA and protein abundances did not change substantially during late gestation. Prostaglandin catabolism in the guinea pig placenta appears to be largely concentrated in the PYS membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112442247">Figure 4C</xref>), which lines the placental surface and is in direct contact with the endometrium. We have previously reported that PTGS-1 and -2 expression is also concentrated in the PYS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112442247">21</xref>
</sup> The functions of prostaglandins synthesized by this membrane are unknown, however strong PGDH expression in the PYS likely provides an important barrier to the transfer of bioactive prostaglandins from the PYS to the myometrium. Expression of PGDH in placental blood vessels may be important in regulating the concentrations of active prostaglandins that function to modulate placental vascular tone. PGDH expression in the uterus is heavily concentrated in the endometrial epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112442247">Figure 4E</xref>), and we found very little evidence of PGDH protein expression in the myometrium. PGDH expression in the endometrium is therefore likely to be crucially important in regulating the availability to the myometrium of biologically active prostaglandins derived from the endometrium, VYS, amnion, and placenta.</p>
<p>The mechanisms that regulate PGDH expression in vivo are largely unknown. PGDH expression in the VYS appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level, with protein expression correlated very strongly with mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112442247">Figure 3</xref>). Based on these data, it is reasonable that studies of the regulation of PGDH expression in the VYS should focus on PGDH gene transcription, which appears to determine the levels of both the mRNA and the protein. There appears to be posttranscriptional regulation in the placenta and the myo-endometrium; however, as there was no correlation between PGDH mRNA and protein levels in these tissues, and in the myo-endometrium PGDH protein levels changed significantly with advancing gestation without corresponding changes in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112442247">Figure 2B</xref>). PGDH activity is increased by progestins and decreased by glucocorticoids in primary cultures of human chorion and placental trophoblast cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112442247">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1933719112442247">51</xref>
</sup> and human <italic>PGDH</italic> promoter activity has been reported to increase in response to progesterone in a PR-dependent fashion in cultured myometrial cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1933719112442247">52</xref>
</sup> Additionally, pharmacological progesterone withdrawal has been shown to decrease PGDH activity in the guinea pig uterus and VYS at day 50 of pregnancy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112442247">40</xref>
</sup> indicating that progesterone maintains PGDH activity in the gestational tissues in order to reduce prostaglandin concentrations and maintain uterine quiescence. Progesterone withdrawal may therefore stimulate the late gestation decrease in PGDH expression in the guinea pig fetal membranes that we have found in this study. It would be of great interest to explore the mechanisms that downregulate PGDH expression in the fetal membranes at term prior to labor onset.</p>
<p>Prostaglandins are significant targets for therapeutic interventions that aim to prevent or arrest labor and avoid preterm birth. Understanding the regulation of intrauterine prostaglandin synthesis and inactivation during pregnancy may allow for the development of more effective strategies for the prevention of preterm birth. In this study, we have shown that the principle sites of intrauterine prostaglandin catabolism in the guinea pig are analogous to those in women. Together with the significant increase in amnion PTGS-1 expression at late gestation that we have reported previously,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112442247">21</xref>
</sup> we speculate that decreased PGDH expression in the fetal membranes at term contributes to elevated intrauterine prostaglandin concentrations and increased transfer of biologically active prostaglandins to the myometrium in order to stimulate labor onset. The present investigation provides further evidence that the guinea pig is a useful model to improve our understanding of the role of intrauterine prostaglandins in pregnancy and parturition with relevance to humans.</p>
