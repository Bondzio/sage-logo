<abstract>
<p>Subculture research on alternative sports has focused on the seemingly inevitable commodification and media co-option of these activities and their internal status hierarchies. In this article, I examine the neglected issue of how participants define the informal “rules” of a self-governed sport. Specifically, I am interested in intragroup conflict among long-time traditional rock climbers over the legitimacy of practices that reduce risk. I spent sixteen months conducting participant observation in multiple locations in the rock climbing world, collected seventeen in-depth interviews, and consulted a wide range of secondary material. Drawing on social worlds theory to analyze the sociohistorical sources of competing ideologies, the participants’ claimsmaking activities, and their strategic actions to maintain and challenge informal rules, I provide a more nuanced and complex picture of social change in alternative sports. I also demonstrate the value of the social worlds perspective for understanding the interactive construction of social worlds and participants in constant flux.</p>

<p>Georg Simmel observed in 1895 that making mountains accessible to the masses comes at the cost of adventure:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Alpine journeys had a pedagogic value in that they were a pleasure that could only be had by a self-reliance that was both external and internal to oneself. Now there is the lure of the ease of an open road, and the concentration and convergence of the masses—colourful but therefore as a whole colourless—suggesting to us an average sensibility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241611426429">Simmel 1997</xref>, 219)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Simmel criticized the romantic ideal “which saw difficult routes, prehistoric food and hard beds” as essential to an authentic experience of alpine travel. He ultimately concluded that “the advantages of this socialistic wholesale opening up of the Alps” outweighed the pleasures of self-reliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241611426429">Simmel 1997</xref>, 219), but the tension between accessibility and exclusivity has been a theme in mountaineering and rock climbing throughout their histories.</p>
<p>This tension has persisted in the United States for more than fifty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611426429">Chouinard 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>), as exemplified in an ongoing dispute rock climbers have dubbed the “Bolt Wars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241611426429">Snider 2007</xref>). In effect, the Bolt Wars are a battle for control of cliffs, most of which climbers do not own. Bolts are a type of safety equipment that climbers permanently place in holes drilled into the rock so that they can clip their safety rope into an eye or ring on the end of the bolt to hold them in the event of a fall. The Bolt Wars comprise ideological disagreements over where, how, and when bolts should be placed, replaced, or removed and whether bolts should be used at all on cliffs. This article examines the conflict over <italic>retro-bolting</italic>, the practice of adding bolts to established climbing routes in order to reduce risk.</p>
<p>The dilution of risk in rock climbing conforms to a pattern common in so-called alternative sports,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891241611426429">1</xref></sup> also known as “extreme sports,” “adventure sports,” and “lifestyle sports.” These sports, such as windsurfing, snowboarding, and skydiving, generally share a highly masculine ethos that values some combination of risk-taking, prowess, individualism, hedonism, and creativity, and typically they are self-governed, self-organized, and anticompetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611426429">Breivik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241611426429">Rinehart and Sydnor 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241611426429">Wheaton 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611426429">Hargreaves and McDonald (2004</xref>, xi) pronounced that “the emergence and rapidly growing popularity of ‘lifestyle sports’ has been one of the most significant developments in [sports sociology] in recent years.” Phenomena of interest include the seemingly inevitable commercialization, media co-option, and commodification of alternative sports, discourses of authenticity and status, and how these sports and their participants’ lifestyles might be indicative of postmodern trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611426429">Beal and Weidman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611426429">Beal and Wilson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611426429">Booth 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611426429">Breivik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611426429">Heywood 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241611426429">Humphreys 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241611426429">Rinehart and Sydnor 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0891241611426429">Thorpe 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241611426429">Wheaton 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241611426429">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891241611426429">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891241611426429">Wheaton and Beal 2003</xref>). Alternative sports are productive sites to examine not only because of their rise in popularity, but also because of their rapid loss of distinctiveness as “alternatives” to the dominant sport culture.</p>
<p>This study concerns the alternative sport of traditional rock climbing, one of few older alternative sports that remain self-governed and uninstitutionalized, despite its increased popularity, commercialization, and practices that reduce risk. Focusing on intragroup conflict among long-time traditional climbers, I examine the sources of conflict that contributed to the Bolt Wars, the claims and rhetoric of these climbers regarding the legitimacy of retro-bolting, and their actions to protect the fundamental ethos of a sport that lacks any institutional authority. While sociologists most often approach sports as subcultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611426429">Crosset and Beal 1997</xref>), I draw on social worlds theory to provide a different perspective on social change within alternative sports.</p>
<sec id="section1-0891241611426429">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>A central theme in the research is how participants express their individualism in alternative sports while they simultaneously contribute to these sports’ commodification. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241611426429">Thornton’s (1995)</xref> work on “subcultural capital,” ethnographers have explored how participants create internal status hierarchies in a symbiotic relationship with mass and niche media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611426429">Beal and Wilson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891241611426429">Wheaton and Beal 2003</xref>). These and other studies have focused on identifying the core values of the sport that participants adopt to construct and claim authentic subcultural identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611426429">Beal and Weidman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611426429">Booth 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241611426429">Humphreys 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241611426429">Wheaton 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241611426429">2004</xref>). A similar theme is the institutionalization or incorporation of alternative sports into the dominant sport culture. While these sports offer “expressive escape” from rational society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611426429">Heywood 1994</xref>, 181), they are not impervious to rationalizing processes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611426429">Booth 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611426429">Breivik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611426429">Donnelly 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611426429">Heywood 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611426429">Humphreys 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2002</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611426429">Lewis 2004</xref>). For example, climbers have developed informal “rules” or <italic>ethics</italic> “to protect [traditional climbing] from the encroachments of rationalized society,” but efforts to impose these ethics on others can contravene the very freedom that they are trying to protect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2002</xref>, 156).</p>
<p>Researchers have been less attentive to other phenomena common to alternative sports. A prevalent trend in older alternative sports is the development of new styles, practices, and hybrid sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611426429">Breivik 2010</xref>, 263). These developments have triggered endless debates about their authenticity and significance. For example, in snowboarding, freeriders, freestylers, and alpine snowboarders each has denigrated the style of the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611426429">Humphreys 1996</xref>), and surfers have debated the legitimacy of different surfing styles and practices since the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611426429">Booth 1995</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor (2010</xref>, 270), however, no sport has had an issue that matches “climbers’ fixation with bolts.” Unlike sports in which a third party allocates space for practice and performance, alternative sports often must compete with other groups to use the same spatial resources. Surfers and windsurfers vie for access to the waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611426429">Booth 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611426429">Humphreys 1996</xref>), snowboarders and skiers must share the slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611426429">Edensor and Richards 2007</xref>), and skateboarders “appropriate” public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611426429">Borden 2001</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611426429">Edensor and Richards (2007)</xref>, however, research in this area is largely limited to quantitative studies that seek to measure recreation conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611426429">Carothers, Vaske, and Donnelly 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241611426429">Vittersø et al. 2004</xref>). Even fewer studies have explored conflict within a single sport for the same resource, one that exists in the Bolt Wars.</p>
<p>In this study, I examine social phenomena other than those associated with consumption, the media, and youth participants; namely, how older, long-time participants contest and defend the practice of retro-bolting, an issue that also concerns how participants control access to and use of the cliffs. These participants offer a unique perspective by virtue of having witnessed or participated in controversial changes in the sport over several decades. Many studies have identified and described the numerous types of status groups within a particular sport, but few have focused on the participants within a single status group. Contrary to implicit assumptions that older, high-status participants resent newcomers for intruding upon their once exclusive sport, in this article, I demonstrate that the views of this subgroup are not uniformly elitist or resistant to change.</p>
<p>A significant limitation of the alternative sports literature is that it tends to consist primarily of empirical descriptions of a sport’s culture, core values, and subgroups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241611426429">Robinson (2008</xref>, 107) argued that a more complex understanding of different subgroups can be achieved only by analyzing “interactions <italic>between</italic> different subgroups . . . as well as relationships within them.” Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611426429">Donnelly (2006</xref>, 220) faulted commentators for focusing on “what constitutes authenticity within a subculture, without (explicitly) recognizing the many ways in which discourses of authenticity are used strategically by self-identified core members to identify and marginalize other participants.” I examine these interactions and strategic discourses, as they are a key empirical focus of social worlds theory. In addition, while some research assumes participants with status define authenticity for the sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611426429">Donnelly 2006</xref>), this article investigates the influence of other participants and how participants use their power in specific situations, “for power is only enacted in situations, and situations vary while contingencies abound” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611426429">Clarke 1991</xref>, 145).</p>
<p>Alternative sports sociologists often make “unacknowledged” assumptions about “the history of subcultures that are drawn from a number of theoretical traditions,” particularly the University of Birmingham Centre of Contemporary Cultural Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611426429">Donnelly 2006</xref>, 219). The tradition associated with the Centre has suffered widespread criticism for its overemphasis on resistance, working class youth, and style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241611426429">Haenfler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241611426429">Muggleton 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241611426429">Thornton 1995</xref>). Postsubculture theorists proposed abandoning the subculture in favor of the neo-tribe and other concepts more consistent with postmodern collectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241611426429">Bennett 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2002</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891241611426429">Wheaton 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611426429">Crosset and Beal (1997)</xref> suggested that sports sociologists consider the social worlds perspective as an alternative to subculture theory. This article follows their suggestion and approaches rock climbing as a “social world,” a broader and more encompassing concept than the subculture.</p>
<p>A social world is “a set of common or joint activities or concerns bound together by a network of communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611426429">Kling and Gerson 1978</xref>, 21). Social worlds are a “spatially transcendent form of social organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241611426429">Unruh 1980</xref>, 275) whose boundaries are determined not by formal membership or territory, but by the “limits of effective communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241611426429">Shibutani 1955</xref>, 566). In contemporary society, communication networks are extensive, and accordingly, innumerable social worlds exist, distinguished by at least one primary activity or concern, such as fishing, rare book collecting, education, basketball, or opera. The key foci of social worlds theory are social action and processes of social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611426429">Clarke 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611426429">Strauss 1978</xref>). Rooted in Chicago interactionism, social worlds theory “is a conflict theory; the generic social process is assumed to be intergroup [or intragroup] conflict, unless and until the data show otherwise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611426429">Clarke 1991</xref>, 129). Three major processes characterize social worlds: intersections with other social worlds, segmentation into subworlds, and authenticity and legitimation, “which include thorny issues pertaining to value, status, loyalty, commitment, and other such matters capable of arousing deep passion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611426429">Strauss 1993</xref>, 226).</p>
<p>The social worlds literature lacks sustained and in-depth analysis of sports and leisure social worlds, focusing instead on occupational social worlds, including those concerned with science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241611426429">Fujimura 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611426429">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241611426429">Star and Griesemer 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611426429">Strauss 1993</xref>), medicine and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611426429">Broadhead and Margolis 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611426429">Clarke 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0891241611426429">Tovey and Adams 2001</xref>), and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241611426429">Clarke and Montini 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611426429">Kling and Gerson 1978</xref>). In this article, I argue that sports sociology can benefit from taking a social worlds perspective.</p>
<p>An advantage of social worlds theory in the study of sports is that it is unimpeded by a legacy of subcultural associations with youth, deviance, and resistance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Social world analysis invites researchers to discover subworlds within social worlds. . . . Subworld analysis focuses on a sphere of communication around a social object. This view frees the researcher from looking for signs of cultural resistance in every sporting practice without theoretically isolating sport from the broader social-historical context. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611426429">Crosset and Beal 1997</xref>, 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, fluidity, heterogeneity, participation in multiple social worlds, and change are attributes embedded in the epistemological assumptions of social worlds theory, attributes that traditional conceptualizations of subcultures lack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241611426429">Muggleton 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241611426429">Thornton 1995</xref>) and which postsubculture theory seeks to address. Social worlds theory contributes to the sociology of sport an explicit framework to study the processual characteristics of sports and the interactions of participants that produce the conditions for these processes to occur. Conceptualizing traditional subcultures as social worlds or subworlds can reveal a more nuanced and complex picture of these and other forms of social organization and open up new avenues of research.</p>
<p>After providing background to the Bolt Wars, I discuss the processes of social change characteristic of social worlds and specific to rock climbing, including intersections and segmentations, changes in the participants’ commitment to the sport, the participants’ claimsmaking activities, and the dynamics of power within the sport.</p>

<title>The Bolt Wars: Ethics, Style, and Retro-bolting</title>
<p>Traditional climbing in the United States is a subworld of the social world of rock climbing. Traditional climbing is self-governed or “anarchic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611426429">Donnelly 1993</xref>, 127); it has no rulebooks, no national governing body that sets policy, and no organized competitions. Traditional climbers have socially constructed an evolving moral code of “ethics” and “style,” to which compliance is voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>). This code serves as a means to judge the ability, courage, and character of other climbers. Traditional climbers espouse two basic ethical precepts: to refrain from harming the rock and to “leav[e] a route unchanged so others may enjoy the creation of those who made the first ascent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241611426429">Robbins 1971</xref>, 61; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611426429">Cox and Fulsaas 2003</xref>, 235). The <italic>first ascent</italic>, completing a new route up a cliff, ranks as one of the most prestigious achievements in rock climbing. <italic>Style</italic> refers to the manner in which a climber ascends a route. Each style presents a different degree of difficulty and is a matter of personal “taste” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>, 130).</p>
<p>Traditional climbers in the United States have argued over the meaning and content of ethics and style nearly since the sport began almost a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>). One of the most controversial and enduring disagreements concerns how climbers use bolts on cliffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor 2010</xref>). Bolts are one form of <italic>protection</italic>, the term climbers use for safety equipment designed to prevent injury in case of a fall. Climbers leave bolts permanently for other climbers to use and they are difficult to remove. Traditional climbers minimize their use of bolts and generally use only removable protection, which the <italic>leader</italic>, the first climber in the customary two-person team, inserts temporarily into cracks in the rock until the second climber ascends and removes them. Removable protection is less reliable than bolts and requires skill and experience to place; accordingly, traditional climbing entails a higher degree of risk than climbing exclusively with bolts.</p>
<p>Retro-bolting has been the subject of debate since the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611426429">Chouinard 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>). It violates the two fundamental ethics of traditional climbing by unnecessarily damaging the rock and changing the original character of the route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611426429">Cox and Fulsaas 2003</xref>, 303). It also reduces risk and uncertainty, elements many climbers believe are essential to traditional climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891241611426429">Williams and Donnelly 1985</xref>). Those who oppose retro-bolting (the “defenders of tradition” or “defenders”) have surreptitiously removed bolts, or <italic>chopped</italic> them (rendering bolts unusable). This dispute has triggered physical violence between climbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611426429">Mellor 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor 2010</xref>) and has earned the hyperbolic moniker <italic>Bolt Wars</italic>, an example of the masculine climbing argot that pervades climbing discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611426429">Taylor 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Sociohistorical Sources of Conflict</title>
<p>Rock climbing began initially as a means to train for mountaineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>). Similarly, many present-day alternative sports are specializations or hybrids of older sports. The development of different styles and practices in alternative sports often reflects philosophies or experiential preferences that conflict with those of the older sport. In rock climbing, new styles and ideologies arose from technological improvements in climbing gear and intersecting subworlds. Nearly every significant development in equipment led to vigorous debates on whether the equipment removed self-reliance and challenge from traditional climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611426429">Hamilton 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor 2010</xref>). For example, when an American climber introduced the camming device in 1974, a device that is easier to place in the rock and is more reliable, some climbers declared that they were tantamount to “cheating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>). Others, however, embraced these opportunities to advance the standards of the sport. Surfers similarly have debated the legitimacy of new technology; a current debate is whether using jet skis to access big waves is “cheating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611426429">Booth 2003</xref>, 330). Climbers’ ideological differences over the effects of technology led to the <italic>segmentation</italic> of the rock climbing social world into subworlds of different forms of climbing. Segmentation is the inevitable and “pervasive tendency for worlds to develop specialized concerns and interests within the larger community of common activities, which act to differentiate some members of the world from others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611426429">Kling and Gerson 1978</xref>, 26).</p>
<p>Intersections between social worlds also may lead to segmentation if “members of the invaded [social world do] not recognize the new activity, object or area as legitimate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241611426429">Strauss 1984</xref>, 126). This was the reaction of many American climbers when French climbing styles arrived in the United States, producing one of the most divisive controversies in climbing history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611426429">Mellor 2001</xref>). The prevalent style in the United States prior to the late 1970s was to improvise an ascent from the ground up, not knowing whether the route could be protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611426429">Achey, Chelton, and Godfrey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>). This style involved uncertainty and risk, and as a result, many climbers created routes that are <italic>bold</italic> (the term climbers favor to describe high risk), a quality traditional climbers valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611426429">Mellor 2001</xref>, 36). French climbers, however, valued gymnastic athleticism rather than risk and practiced a different form of climbing called <italic>sport climbing</italic>. Sport climbers exclusively use bolts for protection because their goal is to climb the most difficult routes possible with relative safety. Instead of leading from the ground up, sport climbers rehearse a route prior to attempting to lead it and then lower from the top on a rope (<italic>rappelling</italic>) to place bolts (<italic>rap-bolting</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>). Using these practices, visiting French climbers demonstrated that they could lead at a level far superior to Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611426429">Achey, Chelton, and Godfrey 2002</xref>). In the spirit of competition, many American climbers adopted these methods. By the early 1980s, the new subworld of sport climbing emerged in the United States, but not without fierce objections from climbers who perceived traditional climbing as a purer form requiring “not just physical performance, not just <italic>technical</italic> qualities, but <italic>moral</italic> qualities, qualities of <italic>character</italic> as well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611426429">Heywood 1994</xref>, 185; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241611426429">Devall 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sport climbing has become enormously popular in the United States, with climbers developing dozens of sport climbing areas, including indoor artificial climbing walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611426429">Mellor 2001</xref>). The security of bolts made leading less risky and enabled climbers to lead routes that are more difficult. Bolting also opened up vast areas of cliffs where no other protection could be placed. In discussing this phenomenon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611426429">Lewis (2004</xref>, 73) wrote, “Technology is seen as to be both an <italic>enabling</italic> and democratizing force as it provides ‘mass’ access to otherwise exclusive areas; yet, it also emerges as a <italic>disabling</italic> and subduing force” of nature.</p>
<p>Sport climbing followed the pattern of other alternative sports in that it quickly became institutionalized, as exemplified by its inclusion in ESPN’s X-Games and the World Cup. Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611426429">Taylor 2010</xref>, 233) cited competitions such as these as evidence of the commodification of traditional climbing, but this argument conflates the two sports. Traditional climbing is unique because for nearly a century traditional climbers in the United States have rejected organized competitions and maintained control of their sport (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611426429">Donnelly 1993</xref>, 127), accomplishments few alternative sports can claim.</p>

<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>My background as a recreational rock climber informed my decision to conduct this research, which is confined to the United States. I draw on nine years of climbing experience in most forms of the sport. My insider status provided considerable advantages, such as easy access to climbers and field sites, understanding the nuances of climbers’ talk, and a good rapport with participants. I also was an outsider, however. The interviewees were considerably more experienced, generally well known within the climbing world, mostly male, and older than I was. In practice, however, my position was situational and moved on a continuum, depending on the subject and interviewee and the character of my relationship with each participant as it developed during the interview.</p>
<p>I spent sixteen months during 2007 and 2008 as a participant-observer of rock climbers in numerous climbing areas throughout the East, West, and Midwest and conducted interviews during this time and throughout 2009. I climbed, camped, and socialized with many climbers, visited climbing stores, attended two climbing slide shows, accompanied one interviewee in his search for new routes, and established a first ascent with another. I began fieldwork at a site in the West, because I knew from prior visits that it would be a fruitful area for participant observation. Climbers camped in close quarters, and many trusted their lives to each other based on a brief exchange about their climbing experience, greatly intensifying the bonds among individuals who share the same interests. I also observed conflict between climbers and park rangers over climbers’ behavior, such as violations of campground rules. An ongoing issue concerned the illegal use of motorized drills to place bolts. When I returned home to the East, I volunteered to take meeting minutes for a nonprofit organization composed of climbers that owned a cliff. I was interested in this group because their cliff had a history of climbers installing and removing bolts without the organization’s permission. I discovered, however, that neither the theme of community bonding nor conflict with land managers was practical to pursue in the East. Eastern sites, most of which are state owned, lack campgrounds or other centralized areas where climbers could regularly congregate, and state park managers generally let climbers manage themselves.</p>
<p>I continued to take minutes for the organization, but changed my focus to bolting issues among climbers. I had heard for years about climbers in the East who chopped bolts, resulting in personal feuds and vandalism. During my research, I found that this behavior has been an issue for decades in many areas around the country. As my collection and analysis of data progressed, I came to see the relevance of the social worlds perspective to this conflict.</p>
<sec id="section5-0891241611426429">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>While social worlds and subworlds generally lack distinct boundaries, they nevertheless contain specific sites where their activities take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611426429">Strauss 1978</xref>). Accordingly, I sought to examine a network of climbing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611426429">Clarke 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611426429">Nadai and Maeder 2005</xref>) and chose four field sites, conducting interviews in each of these locations. Two field sites were located in the East, one in the Midwest, and one in the West. This strategy also guarded against selecting an idiosyncratic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241611426429">Fine 2003</xref>). Based on my climbing knowledge and a review of guidebooks (climbing books that contain descriptions and topographic maps of routes, the names of first ascensionists, and historical information about the local areas) and other historical climbing data, I chose sites with long histories of climbers fighting over ethics and style. Government agencies managed three of the areas; climbers owned and managed the fourth. Nearly all interviewees had long resided near one of the sites, and I gained access to these climbers through the snowball sampling technique.</p>
<p>At the western site, I climbed and camped with climbers continuously for thirty days. When in other climbing areas that required significant travel to reach and during the summer, I spent an average of six hours per day in the field, from four to seven days per week. At sites closer to home and during the spring and fall, I was in the field an average of four hours per day, from one to three days per week, generally on weekends. For one year I took monthly meeting minutes for the climbing organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891241611426429">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>I conducted seventeen in-depth, semistructured, recorded interviews, two by telephone, generally between one and two hours long, and four follow-up interviews with self-identified traditional climbers. I use pseudonyms for all climbers’ names, and I do not identify the names of field sites or Web sites. I obtained institutional review board approval and was open and clear about my research interests with all interviewees. Using purposive sampling, I chose traditional climbers who had established first ascents and who had been climbing at least thirty years. I used these criteria because many long-time climbers derived their status from climbing bold first ascents, which are most often the target of retro-bolting. In addition, individuals who began climbing in the late 1960s and early 1970s likely would have been socialized into an ethic called <italic>clean climbing</italic>, which eschewed bolts and other permanent protection that caused damage to the rock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>). I wanted to explore their involvement in the debates and their opinions as they evolved over time and throughout the Bolt Wars.</p>
<p>The climbers’ ages ranged from forty-seven to eighty-eight, and their years climbing ranged from thirty to fifty, with one exception. Nine were elite climbers, in that they climbed at the highest levels of the sport during their peak years. Four were accomplished (in terms of first ascents and standing), and the remainder were advanced climbers. All were white, able-bodied, and middle-class. Three interviewees were women. Two of the women had been guides and one has climbed for only twenty-two years. I included the latter climber and several interviewees who had only a few or no first ascents because they had been (and most continue to be) politically involved in the debates. Nine of the male climbers were guides. The two oldest climbers, one male and the other female, no longer climb. Two of the interviewees had well over five hundred first ascents, three had approximately two hundred, three had between fifty and one hundred, and the remainder had fewer than fifty. Several continue to make first ascents.</p>
<p>I reviewed posts regularly on two active Web climbing forums, one directed at climbers in the West and the other at climbers in the East. These data provided a contemporary context to the debates and examples of rhetorical styles and helped inform my interview questions. I examined secondary data consisting of climbing histories, autobiographies, climbing magazines and journals, published interviews, and guidebooks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0891241611426429">
<title>Coding and Analysis</title>
<p>Although I used grounded theory as a guideline, the purpose of which is to let theory emerge from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241611426429">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>), I nevertheless created a comprehensive start list of all aspects of rock climbing prior to fieldwork or formulating a research question. My concern was that because of my experience in rock climbing, I might have preconceived ideas of what constituted data worthy of observation. The start list sensitized me to aspects of rock climbing that I might otherwise have ignored in the field. I imported the interviews and field notes into the qualitative software package, NVivo 7. Because of my familiarity with the subject, I compared data using focused coding rather than line-by-line coding. I also used in vivo codes, such as “adventure and risk,” for some categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611426429">Strauss 1987</xref>). As I reframed my research focus from community bonding to intergroup conflict to intragroup conflict, I developed codes with multiple meanings, which proved fruitful. I discovered that the term “adventure” had two overlapping meanings depending on context. When describing what they liked about traditional climbing, many identified “adventure.” In this context, they suggested it meant challenge and exploration, but when <italic>defining</italic> traditional climbing, “adventure” implied potentially serious consequences. This distinction later became important to understanding how their ethos of adventure and risk could simultaneously unify and divide participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0891241611426429">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Like some researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2001</xref>), I had difficulty locating and gaining access to women climbers who fit the sampling parameters of this study. Few women climbed during the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611426429">Waterman and Waterman 1993</xref>), and fewer still made first ascents. Moreover, climbers rarely have implicated women in bolting or bolt-removal incidents, and women have not participated in the debates in climbing media as frequently as male climbers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>). Although additional female participants may have produced a qualitatively different discourse, the empirical focus of this study was the social processes of intragroup conflict rather than its gendered nature.</p>
<p>As part of the reflexive process of this research, however, gender did emerge as an issue. I realized that in earlier drafts, I had privileged the narrative of the male defenders of tradition, whose discourse was more closely aligned with traditional masculine values of risk taking, prowess, and self-reliance. This led me to ask why, as a woman, I promoted this masculine discourse. I concluded that while I highly valued self-reliance and independence, it was not for the masculine status associated with these qualities but for the freedom and self-determination they offered. I gained as much satisfaction from learning technical skills to climb safely and self-sufficiently as I did from the movement of climbing. Other ethnographers found that women climbers in their studies also valued self-sufficiency and independence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241611426429">Dilley and Scraton 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2001</xref>). These skills are particularly important to me because when I was a teenager, the age of most participants when they began climbing, my opportunities to acquire skills of self-reliance were limited and implicitly discouraged. With this self-knowledge, I again immersed myself in the data, but from a more neutral stance. Exercising reflexivity, making the research process transparent, triangulating data, and obtaining six member reviews of prior drafts enhanced the validity of this study.</p>

<sec id="section9-0891241611426429">
<title>Identities in Transition, Social Worlds in Motion</title>
<p>One purpose of using a sample of long-time climbers was to gain insight into how their perspectives and commitments changed over time and how this might affect the debates and, ultimately, their subworld. “Social worlds are not static entities; shared perspectives are continually being reconstituted. . . . When life conditions change, social relationships may also change, and these worlds may disappear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241611426429">Shibutani 1955</xref>, 567). Few of the interviewees believed that they maintained the same orientation to the climbing world as they did when they were younger (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241611426429">Robinson 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Many interviewees recalled that in their early years climbing was a “lifestyle.” Eric gave up college so he could climb full-time but quit climbing for a long period when a close friend died in a climbing accident. Karen and Jack never had careers or full-time vocations. Instead, they “kind of bummed and climbed [their] way around the country.” After many years of impressive accomplishments, however, Karen and Jack “burned out” and switched to a new sport. Families also affected participants’ level of commitment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241611426429">Robinson 2008</xref>). When Dale started a family, he took fewer risks in his choice of routes and places to climb.</p>
<p>Conflicting obligations, loyalties, or preferences that arose from participation in multiple social worlds led some interviewees to modify their stance on bolting. Although he used to climb from the ground up, Mike said, “I felt a little pressure as a guide to put some [sport] routes up because clients [expect] that, ya know? But I always felt it’s a big thing about environmental impact, too. It’s like, do we really need another bolted . . . climb? We’ve got sixty of them on this cliff.” Corey, also a guide, admitted that he had become a “little tainted” on the issue of retro-bolting, because adding bolted anchors to routes made guiding easier.</p>
<p>Other participants withdrew from the debates because they were exasperated or lost interest. Mike complained that “there isn’t much of a climbing community” anymore in his area, because “a lot of the middle-aged climbers who were sort of mature enough to get involved and have an opinion have all gotten too old and have left climbing.” Tina has been committed to maintaining ethics in her climbing area, but said, “I’m sick of it all. I really am. I’ve been speaking up for a long time, and it’s kind of like somebody else needs to step up to the plate.” Robert modified his stance in later years:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I argued for the traditional style from a very adamant and somewhat moralistic kind of viewpoint about what’s right and the benefits of the tradition in terms of the challenge it preserves, all that shit. Eventually, slowly but surely over the years, I stepped away and realized, you know what? It doesn’t matter a whit what traditionalists think or sportsters think. I mean, you get a little perspective and what really matters is <italic>we’re tearing apart our climbing community!</italic> [raising his voice]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As individual actors shape their own lives, they shape their subworld, contributing to the fluidity so characteristic of social worlds. In their early years, these participants were fully committed to climbing, but they recounted life transitions such as starting families, new careers, and other avocations that affected their commitment to the sport. Over the years, some gained a new perspective on bolting issues while others withdrew from the debates altogether. These life changes suggest how traditional climbers socialized into similar climbing ethics later expressed divergent opinions on retro-bolting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0891241611426429">
<title>Processes of Authenticity and Legitimation: Boundaries, Ideology, and Power</title>
<p>The prior sections illustrate the interplay of historical context, social world processes, and the dynamics and contingencies of participant involvement in social worlds. An integral feature of this social matrix is the collective discourse and actions of participants in challenging, negotiating, and seeking social legitimation for new technologies, activities, or ideologies that arise in the context of intersecting and segmenting social worlds. Even after sport climbing emerged as a new climbing form that posed few risks, some climbers continued to argue that risky traditional climbing routes should be retro-bolted. The establishment of sport climbing, however, required the parties to modify their discourse on the value of adventure and risk. In the process, they produced new rhetorical ideologies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0891241611426429">
<title>Constructing Collective Social Identities with Adventure and Risk</title>
<p>In the course of their interviews, participants often defined traditional climbing by contrasting it with sport climbing. They drew distinct boundaries between the two using “narratives [that] have classically placed risk at the center of the plot” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>, 13). Although most also enjoyed sport climbing, they nevertheless thought that adventure and risk were attributes that made traditional climbing more authentic. Even participants who generally did not place a high value on boldness had valorized adventure and risk when comparing the two forms of climbing. Corey, a self-described “liberal modernist” who has added bolts to routes, said, “You need to preserve the adventure in [traditional] climbing. You can’t just go out and bolt everything. . . . You can’t take the adventure and risk outta climbing ’cause it’s inherent in climbing.” Annie added, “I think sport climbing has a different mentality. . . . It is easier in that the whole danger part isn’t as great. It doesn’t require as much thought.” This discourse is illustrative of social categorization, in which group members “pursue evaluatively positive distinctiveness for their own group relative to relevant other groups, because this furnishes positive social identity and positive self-esteem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241611426429">Hogg 2001</xref>, 62).</p>
<p>The long-time participants also separated themselves from “modern” climbers by invoking their collective memory of the eras in which they began climbing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891241611426429">Widdicombe and Wooffitt 1990</xref>). Nearly all interviewees emphasized the meager and rudimentary equipment they used when they climbed in the “old days.” During a slide show, a well-known traditional climber described one of his climbing trips in the 1970s. In my field notes, I wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A car drops them off in the middle of the desert. They waited three days to get a ride into the park. From camp, it took four trips hauling their gear to the base [of the cliff]. They knew nothing about the route. The climber said, “I had no expectation of climbing, I just wanted an <italic>adventure</italic>.” [The climbers completed the first ascent.] The climber continues, “We went down in a white out. It was a real <italic>adventure</italic>.” The climber returned in 2000, and said that in the 1970s, “it would take three days to get to the base. Today there’s hourly bus service. I love [the place], but I need the <italic>adventure</italic> from the old days.” (italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Using intergroup comparisons to draw symbolic boundaries between sport and traditional climbing and the past and present, these traditional climbers constructed a positive collective social identity based on their shared values of adventure and risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0891241611426429">
<title>Constructing Morality with Adventure and Risk</title>
<p>The collective identity of the participants fragmented, however, when the subject turned to retro-bolting. The glorification of risk that enabled the construction of a collective identity became a point of contention in the internal debates on retro-bolting. The participants disagreed on the degree of risk necessary to maintain the authenticity of traditional climbing in a time markedly different from that of thirty or more years ago. Without the opportunity to pit “us” against “them,” the participants engaged in ideological rhetoric for “defense and attack,” in which they used “ordinarily unquestioned canons of truth, morality, beauty, usefulness, and propriety” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891241611426429">Strauss 1982</xref>, 176). The rhetoric of adventure and risk no longer constituted social categorization; rather, it became a means to deploy and justify contested ideologies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611426429">Ghaziani and Fine 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A common refrain among the defenders of tradition was that retro-bolts “dumb down” the route to the bolter’s acceptable level of risk (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611426429">Donnelly 2003</xref>). Luke, who holds a no-exception ethic against retro-bolting, explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Adding bolts to climbs is basically dragging the climbs down to your level. It’s like socialization of the crags; everybody wants to be able to climb every route. Well, unfortunately that’s not the way humans are made. Some people are better at it than others. Now if I can risk my ass to go lead a route that may be poorly protected . . . and somebody else can’t meet that standard, then . . . they shouldn’t suddenly drag it down to their standards and insult the risk I put into it. It doesn’t matter whether [they] damage the rock, insult the first ascent party, insult the whole climbing tradition of the area, insult the whole climbing community in the area, they don’t care. There are people like that. They’re immoral.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Harry has refused to get involved in climbing politics, yet in his interview he said, “I think people [who retro-bolt] are just lazy and want to be safe. And climbing is a fun thing to do. It’s an adventure but not if you’re afraid of breaking a leg. So people are taking the easy way out when they retro-bolt.” Similarly, two interviewees called retro-bolters “cowards.” Ivan also attacked the character of his opponents: “If you [retro-bolters] kinda keep trying to change the rules to fit your needs, people will realize that you’re just a selfish person and I, I don’t think we look at our own sport with enough passion and enough integrity and honesty.”</p>
<p>Those who believed retro-bolting was appropriate to reduce risk drew on a competing morality of egalitarianism and charged the defenders with “elitism.” They argued that dangerous routes should be made safer “so people will actually enjoy” them. They thought it was foolish to take extreme risks. Mike said sarcastically, “I’d rather have people out there enjoying the route and not getting killed.” Corey expressed concern for beginners, believing “that you have to give beginners their due, you have to give them a place to go—there should, there should be well-protected beginner routes available. There just should be.” As further justification, Bill and Corey claimed “hardcore” risk “was out of fashion” and “outmoded.” Some participants had retro-bolted their own routes to make the routes more popular. Others justified retro-bolting as “community service” for newer and less experienced climbers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611426429">Mellor 2001</xref>, 36). Only Harry expressed political indifference, stating that retro-bolting was not “important enough to get excited about.”</p>
<p>The strategy of drawing boundaries between the two sports that facilitated a collective social identity shifted in the internal debates to ideological rhetoric that implicated the defenders’ self-identities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611426429">Becker (1982</xref>, 306) observed that new conventions requiring skills some participants lack threaten their standing within the social world. The converse is also true. Retro-bolted routes, as the new convention, require less skill and therefore threaten the standing of bolder climbers. Adding bolts to risky routes increases access to less skilled leaders, thereby hurting the “reputation” of the route and the first ascensionist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611426429">Chouinard 1961</xref>; Hamilton 1970, 290).</p>

<title>Challenging and Enforcing Ethics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611426429">Becker (1982</xref>, 305) also argued that conventions possess an aesthetic and moral dimension. As the preceding discussion shows, an attack on convention is an attack on the moral beliefs of its followers and, ultimately, the status hierarchy of the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611426429">Becker 1982</xref>, 305-6). Yet the success of the rhetorical strategies of long-time participants in defending ethics or gaining acceptance of retro-bolting depends in large part on their status in the established hierarchy.</p>
<p>As a standard of achievement, first ascents are a major source of status in traditional climbing. They also are a peculiar source of power, because tradition accords first ascensionists a symbolic ownership interest in rock they do not own. A striking example of this is the convention that any climber seeking to retro-bolt a route should obtain <italic>permission</italic> from the first ascensionist. All the participants except two believed unquestionably in this convention, and Lincoln was the most fervent:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[When I do] a first ascent . . . I feel like I <italic>own</italic> the route, I have to feel that way. . . . I created it and I found a way up it. I felt like man, I <italic>risked my life</italic> to do that route, that’s mine, and I have the right to name it, and I have the right to squash anybody who wants to alter it, if I care. And of course I care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even participants with few or no first ascents agreed that climbers should seek permission, because, as Annie said, it is a “matter of respect.” Convention also entitles first ascensionists to name their routes and receive credit for them in guidebooks.</p>
<p>Climbers’ aesthetic appreciation of routes also contributes to the first ascensionist’s sense of ownership. Aesthetic qualities include visual topography, the movement the route affords, and the condition of the rock. Guidebooks recommend routes that are “aesthetic” and “beautiful” and describe less desirable routes as “awkward” and “contrived.” In separate interviews, Dale and Lincoln, who reside in different states, used nearly identical metaphors to argue against retro-bolting on aesthetic grounds:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dale:</speaker>
<p>I think that the route should remain in the condition that the first ascensionists did it. It’s like a painting, you know? You don’t change the color of a Van Gogh painting. That’s what it is and, yes, it took a huge amount of nerve and skill and acceptance of risk to do it that way.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lincoln:</speaker>
<p>Why retro-bolt something that’s already been done? You should respect [the route] for what it is, just like a work of art. It’d be nice to add a few brush strokes to a Van Gogh, but then it’s not a Van Gogh anymore.</p>
</speech>
<p>The elite male defenders in this study possessed considerable status within their communities, which made some vulnerable to claims that they abused their power. Several years ago, climbers had repeatedly installed and removed retro-bolts in the climbing community where Corey lived. In response, the community held a meeting to vote on whether they should ban retro-bolting on local cliffs, hoping that a community decision on the practice would prevent future incidents. Corey, however, claimed the meeting was a sham:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [the older, elite climbers] basically shoved [their view against retro-bolting] down the throat of the climbing community. . . . It [wasn’t] because we all signed off on it, it was like, “This is the way we believe it to be and you may not agree with it, but tough shit because we’re telling you that if you’re doing things other than this, we’re going to chop your bolts.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Corey, other climbers at this community meeting felt pressured to vote against retro-bolting because they did not want to disagree publicly with the older, elite defenders. Corey also believed that younger climbers in his community removed bolts to “be like” these climbers, so he had pleaded with the defenders to “control the people who . . . worship you.” Similarly, Bill accused the defenders in his community of “telling everybody what to do; they’re just doing it behind the scenes. . . . If you do something they don’t like, they’ll simply go out and chop [your bolts].”</p>
<p>Climbers exert influence through other social media, such as climbing magazines and Web forums (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>). A potentially persuasive medium is the guidebook. With geographically based variations in styles, guidebooks play an important role in “acculturate[ing] outsiders to local mores” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611426429">Taylor 2006</xref>, 196). Guidebooks also are a means to further authors’ own agendas on ethics or to promote or discredit the climbing styles of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611426429">Taylor 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241611426429">Nichols 1995</xref>, 23–25, 387).</p>
<p>Status is only one form of power, and in anarchic sports like traditional climbing, even peripheral participants can affect the balance of power. While government regulation is an ongoing concern and anathema to the ethos of traditional climbing, on occasion climbers have resorted to enlisting the government to stop the “ethics police” from removing bolts. Several years ago, a participant was frustrated with one such vigilante and reported him to the government. Although the result was that the individual stopped removing bolts, some climbers nevertheless were outraged, believing that the climbing community should manage these issues. In recalling this incident, Ivan decried:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ivan:</speaker>
<p>What they [the individuals who contacted the authorities] did was absolutely the most asinine act I have ever seen against the climber, climbers, and the climbing culture in America. Absolutely the most asinine—not thought out, stupid, dangerous, everything about it was wrong. It’s wrong for our future, it’s wrong for the culture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bogardus:</speaker>
<p>So would you say that it needs to be resolved within the climbing community in some kind of democratic process?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ivan:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, unfortunately I think that’s the way it has to be. I think what I’d really like to see is vigilante ethics. . . . In England, you place a piton, you chip a hold, or you place a bolt, you get the shit beat outta you.</p>
</speech>
<p>“Vigilante ethics” (removing bolts or policing climbers) is perhaps the most notorious and provocative display of power, even though, as some participants observed, installing bolts in the first place damages the rock and incites others to remove them. Climbers typically remove bolts anonymously, but disclosing the identity of the actor can serve strategic purposes. In response to bolts appearing on one of Ivan’s famously bold routes, which was located in a site where he was not a member of the local community, Ivan said, “I think I should leave [it up to] the climbing community to take them out, so that a much stronger voice is policing the climb.” By contrast, two climbers in that climbing community said that they preferred Ivan to remove the bolts; they thought Ivan’s action would send a stronger message to their community and therefore reduce the likelihood of rebolting (field notes).</p>
<p>Removing and replacing bolts repeatedly has damaged the rock and resulted in violence and vandalism, but it also has been a powerful incentive for local climbers to address bolting issues collectively. The climbing communities in each of the field sites have held meetings or established climbing coalitions in attempts to prevent further damage and retaliation in response to bolting incidents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611426429">Perkins 2005</xref>). No matter what the political balance among traditional climbers, however, if they generally agree that individual freedom in rock climbing is paramount, then it follows that anyone can install bolts and anyone can remove them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611426429">Robbins 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Alternative sports research has focused on consumption practices and the role of the media in subculture formation and the construction of participant identities. These sports and their participants’ identities, however, are not constructed in isolation from other social phenomena. Older alternative sports have long histories whose legacies interact with contemporary processes in complex ways. This research contributes to our understanding of how participants in a self-governed sport struggle to maintain informal rules emblematic of values that have become less meaningful to other participants over time.</p>
<p>The social worlds perspective is a valuable tool for understanding the interactive construction of social worlds and participants in constant flux. In the rock climbing social world, technological improvements in equipment were a driving force in both the evolution and fragmentation of rock climbing. Climbers invented or improved equipment to enable them to climb difficult routes with greater security. These advances and the intermingling of formerly independent rock climbing cultures brought to the fore ideological differences over the value of risk that ultimately led to the segmentation of rock climbing into subworlds of traditional climbing and sport climbing. During this period of change, climbers adjusted their commitments to climbing in response to life events and transitions, contributing to social world processes even as they were affected by them.</p>
<p>This study expands on the literature on alternative sports cultures and internal status hierarchies to include research on how participants actually use their status and power in specific situations. While participants with status wield influence within their communities and climbing media, vigilantes who remove retro-bolts and climbers who enlist outside authorities to stop these vigilantes act as powerful catalysts for collective action. This research also adds to the literature on discourses of authenticity to include analyses of the interactional strategies participants use to justify their claims. Rhetorical strategies are particularly important in sports that lack a governing institution or codified rules (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611426429">Fuller 2003</xref>, 25). The participants’ rhetoric in this study revealed complex group dynamics that sustained both unity and conflict. The ideology of adventure and risk that participants used to establish a collective social identity also engendered conflict within their world. The retro-bolting debates exposed competing ideologies concerning access to and the use of natural resources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611426429">Ghaziani and Fine 2008</xref>). The ethic against retro-bolting has the “effect of limiting access to [lead] the most prestigious routes to a relatively small elite” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611426429">Hamilton 1979</xref>, 296), creating a dilemma of the sort Simmel described in weighing the cost of opening up the Alps to the masses or preserving resources and opportunities for the elite to exercise self-reliance. Whether a morality of egalitarianism or self-reliance and environmental protection, climbers’ efforts to impose their morality on others threaten to destroy traditional climbing as a sanctuary of self-realization and escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611426429">Kiewa 2002</xref>). Perhaps nowhere else but in the Bolt Wars is the paradox of a self-governed sport more evident: freedom requires restraint.</p>
