<abstract>
<p>Commentators differ on the location of the altar mentioned in Deut. 16.21 and do not substantiate their conclusions with evidence. Is the altar mentioned a local altar or the central altar of the temple/tabernacle? This article argues for local altars, with three lines of evidence. First, the altar law of Deut. 16.21 is compared with Exod. 20.24 to determine if the altar law of Deuteronomy borrows the language of the altar law of Exodus, as claimed by S.R. Driver. Second, the use of the <italic>lamed</italic> of advantage in Deut. 16.21 is analyzed to determine its function in the law. Third, clues for the location of the altar are sought for in the immediate context of Deut. 16.18–17.13.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In seeking to fit Deut. 16.21–22 into its immediate context, some scholars argue that Deut. 16.21 is pre-Deuteronomic. They claim the altar law in v. 21 borrows the language of the altar law in Exod. 20.24 and allows for more than one sanctioned altar. S.R. Driver concludes that if the commandment had in mind the central altar, and had been written by the deuteronomistic author, ‘it would have probably contained some express reference to “the place which Jehovah should choose”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213475398">1</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that most who hold to this interpretation do not explore in detail how the altar law in Deut. 16.21 ‘presupposes’ the language of Exod. 20.24;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213475398">2</xref></sup> rather, the relationship between the two passages is only briefly mentioned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213475398">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, some scholars do locate the altar in the central sanctuary but do not offer any explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213475398">4</xref></sup> Still others simply highlight the prohibition against placing an Asherah next to the ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הדהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ and do not attempt to locate the altar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213475398">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, I will seek to determine whether the command in Deut. 16.21 refers to worship at the central altar of the tabernacle/temple or at local altars in the land of Israel. At least three problems are raised by the lack of explanation by scholars regarding the location of the altar(s) in Deut. 16.21. First, when Deut. 16.21 is compared with Exod. 20.24, it is not immediately evident as to how the author of Deuteronomy borrowed the language of the altar law in Exod. 20.24. If Deut. 16.21 does refer to local altars, one may be required to point to other evidence. Second, the language of Deut. 16.21 does not easily point to the altar of the central sanctuary. To conclude that the verse refers to the central altar certainly makes better sense of Deuteronomy's emphasis on centralization, however the of advantage seems to indicate altars made outside the central sanctuary. Third, leaving the question of the location of the altar(s) unanswered comes across as avoiding the issue entirely. Either conclusion (central altar or local altars) presents issues that must be addressed; to leave the question unanswered does not treat the text fairly.</p>

<title>2. Deuteronomy 16.21 and Exodus 20.24</title>
<p>As noted above, there are some scholars who argue that Deut. 16.21 was an older law redacted by the deuteronomistic author(s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213475398">6</xref></sup> This section will seek to determine if Deut. 16.21 borrows the language of Exod. 20.24. If so, then Deut. 16.21 would clearly refer to multiple altars; if not, evidence must be sought elsewhere for the location of the altar(s).</p>
<sec id="sec3-0309089213475398">
<title>a. Exodus 20.24</title>
<p>The context of the altar law of Exod. 20.24 is the giving of the Ten Commandments at Mt Sinai (Exod. 20.1–17). In his response to the fear of the people, the L<sc>ord</sc> gave the altar law. The L<sc>ord</sc> reminds the Israelites that they had heard and had witnessed him speaking to them from the heavens (20.22). For this reason, the Israelites are commanded not to make idols for themselves (20.23). Because of what the Israelites witnessed on Mt Sinai, they are permitted to make only two kinds of altars: an altar of earth (v. 24), or an altar of uncut stones (v. 25). Lastly, the L<sc>ord</sc> commands the Israelites not to ascend steps to the L<sc>ord's</sc> altar (v. 26).</p>
<p>The natural interpretation for this passage (Exod. 20.24) is as an altar law allowing for a multiplicity of altars, for the Hebrew reads: ‭ימש־חא‬ ‭ריכזא‬ ‭רשא‬ ‭םזקמה־לבב‬ (‘in every place which I shall cause my name to be mentioned’). Gesenius argues that the article on ‭םזקמ‬ is a ‘dogmatic correction’ to avoid the reading ‭םזקמ־לבב‬ (‘in every place’). He argues that the prepositional phrase should be read ‘in the place’, which is more in line with Deuteronomy's emphasis on centralization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213475398">7</xref></sup> William Propp makes the observation that the article in ‭םזקמה־לבב‬ ‘would more naturally be translated as “throughout the entire land” or collectively “in all places”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213475398">8</xref></sup> In support for the translation ‘in every place’, Propp rightly points to two other passages in which the context demands this particular translation: Gen. 20.13 and Deut. 11.24.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213475398">9</xref></sup> In light of this translation, Exod. 20.24 indicates that there would be more than one altar at which the LORD would be worshipped; however, the following relative clause does restrict the places at which the Israelites were permitted to build an altar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213475398">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Israelites could not build an altar for worship at any place they desired; rather, the LORD commanded that the altar could only be built ‭ימש־חא‬ ‭ריכזא‬ ‭רשא‬ (‘wherever I cause my name to be remembered’). The causative Hiphil of the verbal stem “‭רכז‬ occurs in contexts of mentioning a person or causing a person to be remembered (Gen. 40.14, 1 Sam. 4.18). causing one's sins to be remembered (Gen. 41.9; 1 Kgs 17.18), or calling upon God in worship (1 Chron. 16.4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213475398">11</xref></sup> The distinction between mentioning a person or causing a person to be remembered, and so on, is a fine line in many occurrences. Some contexts may allow for either translation. In particular, Exod. 20.24 may be understood as God causing his people to worship him, or causing the Israelites to remember him in his deeds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213475398">12</xref></sup> This relative clause emphasizes that God will allow the Israelites to build an altar to him in any place that he makes himself known to his people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213475398">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The context surrounding Exod. 20.24 provides an example of the appropriate time in which an altar could be built. On Mt Sinai the LORD revealed himself to his people; therefore, in response Moses builds an altar to the LORD in front of Mt Sinai (Exod. 24.1–5). The Old Testament provides other examples that illustrate the appropriate situations for building an altar to the LORD. In Deuteronomy, the Israelites were commanded to build an altar on Mt Ebal upon entering the land (Deut. 27.1–7). This particular altar was not built in response to an appearance of the LORD, but rather the altar was built to call upon the LORD (Deut. 17.7–8). The Israelites were commanded to write the words of God's law on stones and to pronounce the blessing and curses on Mt Gerazim and Mt Ebal respectively (Deut. 11.29; 27.11–14). The LORD instructed his people to build the altar on Mt Ebal according to the guidelines set out in Exod. 20.24–25. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309089213475398">Table 1</xref> lists other instances in the Old Testament in which local altars were built.</p>

<p>Although the examples given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309089213475398">Table 1</xref> do not utilize the Hiphil form of “‭רכז‬, these passages do provide examples of the approved situations in which an altar could be built. These events have certain features that indicate approved situations. First, those individuals who built altars were those to whom the LORD directly appeared (Judg. 6.25–27; 13.2–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213475398">14</xref></sup> On these special occasions the LORD made himself known to certain individuals to call or set apart an individual to lead Israel. Second, the congregation of Israel built local altars so that they could call upon the LORD. In these examples, this was done under the guidance of the leader(s) of Israel. Therefore, the times and occasions on which altars were built, and those who were permitted to build altars, were limited in scope.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the altar law of Exod. 20.24 does not specifically have in mind the altar of the tabernacle. Though the LORD made himself known at the tabernacle, and the prohibitions found in Exod. 20.22–26 could be applied to the altar of the tabernacle, the author of Exodus has in mind the local altar. Martin Noth writes, ‘They do not mean sanctuaries in places with fixed settlements, but altars erected in free land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213475398">15</xref></sup> When the altar of the tabernacle is in view, different instructions are given for its construction (Exod 27.1–8; 38.1–7). The LORD instructed the Israelites to construct the altar of the tabernacle out of acacia wood and with specific dimensions (Exod 27.1). The altar of the tabernacle was also to include features such as carrying poles (v. 6), horns (v. 2), utensils for removing ash (v. 3), and a covering of bronze (v. 2). On the other hand, the Israelites were to make the altar of Exod. 20.24 out of or uncut stones (v. 25). The detailed specifications for the altar of the tabernacle set it apart from the local altar.</p>

<title>b. Deuteronomy 16.21 and Its Relationship to Exodus 20.24</title>
<p>The discussion above established the context of the altar law as found in Exod. 20.24. Because some scholars argue that Deut. 16.21 is pre-Deuteronomic, borrowing the language of Exod. 20.24, I will compare both verses and their immediate contexts, and I will seek to determine to what extent Deut. 16.21 shares the language of Exod. 20.24. If Exod. 20.24 is formulaic, Deut. 16.21 could be an echo of this formulaic altar law, permitting multiple altars. If Exod. 20.24 is not formulaic, other lines of evidence must be sought to determine the location(s) of the altar(s) in Deut. 16.21.</p>
<p>Both commands are fronted by prohibitions against making or setting up idolatrous items in the worship of the LORD. Exodus 20.24–25 prohibits making idols of gold and silver; Deut. 16.21 prohibits planting an Asherah next to the altar. It is possible that the author of Deuteronomy intentionally placed the prohibitions against the Asherah before the mention of the altar in order to bring Exod. 20.24 to the listener's mind. On the other hand, the prohibitions found in Deut. 16.21–22 bring to mind the commands given in Deut. 12.1–5 and not necessarily the passage in Exodus. One could argue that Deut. 16.21 is simply expanding upon the commands given previously in ch. 12.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213475398">16</xref></sup> Deuteronomy 12.1–5 does not put aside the command against placing idols of gold or silver next to an altar, but it does address the new situation the Israelites will find themselves in once they cross the Jordan River. As the Israelites conquer the land, they will find the high places of the Canaanites along with its Asherah and pillars. The law regarding gold and silver idols could easily be applied in Deut. 12.1–5 and 16.21–22, but the prohibition against the Asherah and pillars meets the more pressing and urgent need.</p>
<table-wrap id="table2-0309089213475398" position="float">
<label>Table 2</label>
<graphic alternate-form-of="table2-0309089213475398" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089213475398-table2.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>It should be noted that Deut. 16.21–22 specifically prohibits the Asherah from being planted ‭ךיהלחא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ ‭לצא‬ (‘beside the altar of the LORD your God’). Exodus 20.24–25 makes no mention of placing idols near the altar, though this is a valid application of the prohibition against making idols (Exod. 20.23). The command against idols in Exod. 20.23 should be understood as the most immediate point of application of v. 22: because Israel had heard the LORD speak to them from heaven, they are not to make idols.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213475398">17</xref></sup> The altar law in vv. 24–26 is the second point of application: the Israelites were permitted only to make a certain kind of altar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213475398">18</xref></sup> Whereas Deut. 16.21 has in view the placement of foreign objects next to the ‭ךיהלחא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬, the focus of Exod. 20.24 is the types of altars permitted by the LORD.</p>
<p>The altars in the Exodus and the Deuteronomy passages are each described as the LORD's altars. In Exod. 20.22–26, this description is not found until the prohibition against ascending the altar (v. 26). In this verse, the first common singular suffix is attached to the noun—‭יִהְבְּזִמ‬ (‘my altar’). In Deut. 16.21, the qualification is written in the prohibition itself—‭ךיהלחא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ ‭לצא‬ (‘the altar of the LORD your God’). I will address at length this particular designation below, but its use does raise the question: Is the ‭ךיהלחא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ ‭לצא‬ different from the altar in Exod. 20.24?</p>
<p>Driver draws the connection between the two altar laws with the relative clause ‭ךל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬ (‘which you shall make for yourself’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213475398">19</xref></sup> Exodus 20.24 reads: ‭יל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬ ‭חבזמ‬ (‘an altar of earth you shall make to me’). Both verses use the verb ‭השע‬ for the preparation of the altar. This verb occurs throughout the Old Testament and does not appear to be used in any formulaic manner when used in conjunction with ‭חבזמ‬. ‭חבזמ‬ frequently occurs with the verb ‭הנב‬, and occasionally occurs with the verb ‭םוק‬. These verbs are used interchangeably throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the verb ‭השע‬, in Exod. 20.24, was not formulaic. Wiener writes, ‘The linguistic usage in connection with the construction of altars of whatever type seems to have been elastic, so that no stress can be laid on it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213475398">20</xref></sup> Moreover, the verb ‭השע‬ is used in the construction of the altar of the tabernacle (Exod. 27.1; 2 Chron. 1.5), the altar of incense (Exod. 30.1), and the altar of the temple in Ezekiel's vision (Ezek. 43.18). The language used for the preparation of altars given in Exod. 20.24 is not limited only to local altars. It is possible, then, that Deut. 16.21 does refer to a central altar in the tabernacle/temple.</p>
<p>While the possibility remains that Deut. 16.21 refers to local altars, any decision as to the location of the altar in this verse should not be determined by Exod. 20.24. I will now turn to other factors that help inform the interpretation of ‭ךל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬ ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec5-0309089213475398">
<title>3. Deuteronomy 16.21 and the ל of Advantage</title>
<p>The ל in the relative clause ‭ךל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬ does play a role in determining the location of the altar(s) in Deut. 16.21. If, as I will argue below, the ל is functioning as a ל of advantage, the verse is better understood as referring to local altars. According to those who argue for the central altar in Deut. 16.21, it is difficult to know why the Israelites would build <italic>for themselves</italic> the altar of the LORD in his sanctuary. This is difficult for two reasons. First, although Moses indicates to the Israelites in Deuteronomy 12 that the worship of God would be conducted in one place, the Israelites were given no reason to think that worship would not be conducted in the tabernacle. If the Israelites understood that the tabernacle would be in the LORD's chosen place, there would be no need for them to build an altar of the LORD <italic>for themselves</italic> since the altar of the tabernacle had already been constructed. Second, Deuteronomy 12–26 does not indicate that the chosen place would be a temple.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213475398">21</xref></sup> If the author has no future temple in mind, it would be difficult to understand why there would be a need for the Israelites to build an altar <italic>for themselves</italic>. On the other hand, the altar(s) of Deut. 16.21 could easily refer to the local altars permitted in Exod. 20.24.</p>
<p>I could find no comment that has been made in regards to how the ל is functioning in Deut. 16.21 aside from a brief mention in a dissertation by Thomas Ranck. Ranck concludes that 16.21 does not have in view a central altar, but any number of local altars ‘since the individual is allowed to establish an altar to Yahweh’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213475398">22</xref></sup> In this section I will determine the use of the ל in Deut. 16.21 and how it influences the location of the altar(s).</p>
<sec id="sec6-0309089213475398">
<title>a. The ל of Advantage</title>
<p>The ל of advantage ‘expresses <italic>for</italic> whom, <italic>to</italic> whose <italic>advantage</italic> (or <italic>disadvantage)</italic> something is done’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213475398">23</xref></sup> For example, in Num. 11.16 the LORD commands Moses, ‭לארשי‬ ‭ינקזמ‬ ‭שיא‬ ‭םיעבש‬ ‭יל־הפםא‬ (‘gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel’). The gathering of the elders was <italic>for</italic> the LORD, for his purposes. Also, in Num. 22.6 Balak implores Balaam, saying, ‭הזה‬ ‭םעה־תא‬ ‭יל־הרא‬ (‘curse for me this people’). The cursing of Israel was for Balak's political advantage and personal safety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213475398">24</xref></sup></p>
<p><bold>(1) The ל of advantage with ‭השע‬</bold>. In Deut. 16.21, the altar is one which Israel would make for her own advantage (‭ךל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬), for use outside the central sanctuary. In contexts in which the ל of advantage follows ‭השע‬, the benefit for the person(s) who makes the object(s) is evident. For example, in Exod. 32.8 the LORD tells Moses ‭הכםמ‬ ‭לגע‬ ‭םהל‬ ‭ושע‬ (‘they [the Israelites] have made for themselves a molten calf’). The context of the passage (32.1–10) makes clear that the people made the golden calf in order to worship it. In 2 Chron. 28.22–27, the author relates in v. 24 that ‭תוחכזמ‬ ‭ול‬ ‭שעיו‬ (‘he [King Ahaz] made for himself altars’). Again, the context makes clear that Ahaz built these altars so that he might follow after other gods; the king even went so far as to shut the doors of the temple when he built his altars. Ahaz built the altars for his advantage. Though the examples listed above illustrate altars or idols made for prohibited worship practices, the personal interest in which the items were made should be highlighted.</p>
<p>The Israelites did make for themselves items that were not prohibited. In Num. 10.2 the L<sc>ord</sc> commands Moses to ‭ךל‬ ‭השע‬ (‘make for yourself’) silver trumpets to gather the congregation of Israel. In Num. 15.38, the L<sc>ord</sc> commands Israel to ‭מהל‬ ‭ושע‬ (‘make for themselves’) silver tassels as a reminder to obey all of the L<sc>ord's</sc> commandments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213475398">25</xref></sup> Other examples of the ל of advantage following ‭השע‬ include the bronze serpent (Num. 21.8), and flint knives used for circumcision (Josh. 5.2, 3).</p>
<p><bold>(2) The ל of advantage and Deuteronomy 16.21</bold>. The personal advantage of the Israelites in the examples listed above is made evident by the use of the ל. The personal advantage is made clearer when one notes the lack of the ל of advantage in relation to items made for the tabernacle/temple. For the most part, the Israelites are not commanded to make for their personal benefit an item of the tabernacle/temple.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213475398">26</xref></sup> If the altar of Deut. 16.21 is that of the central sanctuary, there is no reason why the Israelites would build it <italic>for themselves</italic>. If the author(s) had in mind the central altar, one would expect the relative clause to be omitted. It would be easier to conclude that the altars ‭ךל־השעת‬ ‭רשא‬ are local altars similar to those the LORD permitted in Exod. 20.24.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0309089213475398">
<title>b. An Implication of the Conclusion</title>
<p>One implication of the conclusion given above must be briefly expounded. The conclusion of the previous section was that the language of Deut. 16.21 does not inherently drive one to assume borrowed language from Exod. 20.24; on the other hand, the ל of advantage does suggest that an altar other than the central altar is in view. One may ask whether this means that any Israelite could build an altar at any time. The answer would have to be ‘No’ based on the context of the Pentateuch as a whole. For reasons given above, the hearers of the prohibition of Deut. 16.21 would not have had the central altar in mind. If they were not thinking of the central altar, it would seem logical that they first recalled the law that provided guidelines for local altars, Exod. 20.24. It is possible that the Israelites understood that two altar laws existed side-by-side: Exod. 20.24 regarding the local altar; Exod. 27.1–8 and 38.1–7 regarding the altar of the tabernacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213475398">27</xref></sup> The ‭ךיהלחא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ which they would make for themselves would have to conform to the guidelines of Exod. 20.22–26. And as the examples of this law given above indicate, only specific people and occasions called for a local altar to be built.</p>
<p>The prohibition of Deut. 16.21 should be understood as forbidding the Asherah, or a pillar, to be set up next to the local altar. The Israelites, according to Deut. 12.1–5, were commanded to destroy all items of Canaanite worship. In the event that the LORD revealed himself to his people in the new land and they subsequently built an altar to the LORD, they were forbidden to use these Canaanite items. In the following section I will argue that the context surrounding Deut. 16.21 (16.18–17.13) provides further support for local altars.</p>

<title>4. The Context of Deuteronomy 16.21–17.1</title>
<p>The placement of Deut. 16.21–17.1 in the general flow of chs. 16 and 17 has caused problems for many scholars in determining how these three prohibitions fit into the context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213475398">28</xref></sup> Some scholars argue that these passages are misplaced and seek to relocate them in other parts of Deuteronomy 12–26.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213475398">29</xref></sup> Still others hold that these laws do not follow logical lines of thought; rather, they often move from one topic to another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213475398">30</xref></sup> In determining the location(s) of the altar mentioned in Deut. 16.21, I will first seek to fit 16.21–17.1 into its immediate context. If these verses are a part of the surrounding passages (16.18–17.13), the context may further strengthen the conclusion given above regarding the location of the altar.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0309089213475398">
<title>a. The Immediate Context</title>
<p>Many scholars recognize that a new section of laws, which begins with Deut. 16.18–17.13 and extends to 18.22, concerns the administration of the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213475398">31</xref></sup> Within this section on administration, 16.18–17.13 are considered the most problematic due to the variation of topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213475398">32</xref></sup> The author begins with the topic of appointing judges in the new land (16.18–20). The focus then shifts to three laws regarding the cult (16.21–17.1) and laws regarding the apostate (17.2–7). The laws regarding the judges resume in 17.8–13; in this section, difficult cases are relegated to the ‘Levitical priest and the judge who is in office in those days’ (17.9, ESV). Due to the variation of subjects in 16.18–17.13, it is difficult to place 16.21–17.1 in its immediate context.</p>
<p><bold>(1) The appointment of ‭םיטפש‬ and ‭םירטש‬</bold>. In the laws concerning the appointment of judges and officers (16.18–20), the terms used are ‭םיטפש‬ and ‭םירטש‬, respectively. These terms are used for those who are involved in judging cases involving all areas of the life of the people, including religious matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213475398">33</xref></sup> Robert Culver makes the observation that modern readers should not view the act of judging cases in ancient Israel in the light of modern government. Culver says the English word normally used to translate ‭טפש‬ (‘to judge’) ‘in modern English, means to exercise only the judicial functions of government’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213475398">34</xref></sup> Rather, the ‭םיטפש‬ in ancient Israel were leaders who executed laws and judged cases in civil and religious matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213475398">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Exodus 18, Moses appointed ‭םיטפש‬ from all the tribes of Israel (v. 25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213475398">36</xref></sup> Jethro counsels Moses to appoint men as ‭םיטפש‬ in order that they might ‘judge the people at all times…any small matter they shall decide for themselves’ (Exod. 18.22, ESV). There is no indication in this passage that these judges were relegated only to a certain type of dispute (i.e. a civil lawsuit versus a religious dispute); rather, these judges were to hear all cases. In Num. 25.1–9, Moses commanded the ‭םיטפש‬ to execute judgment against those ‘who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor’ (v. 5). Numbers 25 offers one of only a couple of examples of the ‭םיטפש‬ judging a religious matter. The other example is found in our passage, Deut. 16.18–17.13. If this passage is a unit, as I will argue below, then 16.21–17.8 provides other matters in which the ‭םיטפש‬ would judge.</p>
<p><bold>(2) Deuteronomy 17.2–7</bold>. Setting aside Deut. 16.21–17.1 for a moment, a link does exist between 17.2–7 and the larger passage of 16.18–17.13. The link is made with regard to the ‭םיטפש‬ and the place in which they would decide their cases. The LORD instructs the Israelites in 17.2–7 on how to judge a man or woman who has gone after other gods (vv. 2–3). Those who found out the apostate were to investigate the matter thoroughly in order to validate the accusation (v. 4). If the accusation was true, the man or woman was to be brought ‭ךירעש־לא‬ (‘to your gates’, v. 5).</p>
<p>The Israelites were to bring their cases to the town gates, for it was at the gates where disputes and cases were judged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213475398">37</xref></sup> Judges are found at the gates in Ruth 4.1–11 to hear Boaz's case when he redeemed Naomi and Ruth. The LORD commands mothers and fathers to bring their rebellious sons to the elders at the city gate (Deut. 21.19). The man who unintentionally kills another is instructed to flee to a city of refuge and report the incident to the elders at the gate (Josh. 20.4). In Amos 5.10, the LORD chastises Israel for they ‘hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks the truth’ (ESV). Furthermore, if ‭תכיר‬ ‭ירבד‬ ‭‭ךירעשב‬ (‘matters of dispute in your gates’) were too difficult, the judges were instructed to bring the cases to the judge or priest at the central place (Deut. 17.8).</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 17.2–7 is not an isolated law oddly placed between the law of judges (16.18–20; 17.8–13), but it is linked to the two by the phrase ‭‭ךירעש‬ (‘your gates’) in 17.5 and 17.8. The law of the apostate serves as a specific example of the cases that judges and officers would decide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213475398">38</xref></sup> Legal disputes were decided by judges who sat in the gates of the towns; Deut. 17.2–7 provides an example of the type of case tried by the ‭םיטפש‬ and ‭םירטש‬. If such a case was too difficult, it was to be brought ‘to the place that the LORD your God will choose’ (Deut. 17.8 ESV).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213475398">39</xref></sup></p>
<p><bold>(3) Deuteronomy 16.21–17.1</bold>. If Deut. 17.2–7 is part of the larger passage of 16.18–17.13, then how does 16.21–17.1 fit into the flow of the passage? The shift of focus from the administration of judges back to cultic prohibitions causes one to question whether these three prohibitions are out of place in this context. A connection between 16.21–17.1 and the remainder of the passage can be made through the three phrases that describe the LORD's hatred for idol worship. As the author transitions from 16.21–17.1 to 17.2–13, he unequivocally marks three actions that the LORD detests: two are found in 16.21–17.1, and a third is found in 17.2–13. First, in 16.22, he states that erecting a ‭הבעמ‬ (‘pillar’) is an action that ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭אנש‬ (‘the LORD your God hates’). Second, in 17.1, the Israelites are prohibited from sacrificing a blemished ox or sheep for ‭תכעות‬ ‭אוה‬ ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הזהי‬ mm (‘it is an abomination to the LORD your God’). Third, in 17.4, the worship of other gods, the sun, the moon and the ‘heavenly hosts’ are described as ‭תאזה‬ ‭הבעותה‬ (‘this abhorrent thing’). Because statements of God's disdain are made with such frequency and in such close proximity, it would be difficult to isolate 16.21–17.1 from its immediate context.</p>
<p>In regards to the internal unity of 16.21–17.1, one may ask if different altars are in view in 16.22 and 17.1. In 16.22, the Israelites are prohibited from setting up a ‭הבצמ‬ (‘sacred pillar’); however, the prohibition does not state that it should not be placed by ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬, as is stated in v. 21. It could be argued, though, that the local altar is still in view in v. 22. As Driver observes, the ‭הבצמ‬ is often mentioned as being set up alongside the Asherah in the Old Testament (1 Kgs 14.23; 2 Kgs 17.10; 18.4; 23.14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213475398">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prohibition against blemished sacrifice should not necessarily be limited to the central altar, as well. Israel had been commanded not to offer blemished sacrifices: Deut. 15.19–23 forbade blemished firstlings as offerings; Lev. 22.17–25 also forbade blemished burnt offerings. These two passages refer to sacrifices made at the central altar. However, the animals listed in Deut. 17.1 could easily be used in sacrifices made at the local altar. Deuteronomy 17.1 lists two animals to be sacrificed, ‭הש‬ (‘sheep’) and ‭רוש‬ (‘ox’), of which the general terms for these animals are found in Exod. 20.24 (‭ואצ‬ and ‭רקב‬, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213475398">41</xref></sup> It is possible, then, that all of Deut. 16.21–17.1 has in view the local altar.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0309089213475398">
<title>b. ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ in Deuteronomy 16.21</title>
<p>In comparing Exod. 20.24 and Deut. 16.21, the observation was made that only Deut. 16.21 qualified the altar as being ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הזהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ (‘the altar of the L<sc>ord</sc> your God’). It was determined that both passages refer to local altars, but the designation of the altar as the L<sc>ord's</sc> in Deut. 16.21 opens the possibility of a specific local altar. In the section below, I will analyze the use of the designation ‭ךיהלא‬ ‭הזהי‬ with the noun ‭חבזמ‬ in order to determine whether a specific altar is in view.</p>
<p><bold>(1) ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ in the Hebrew Bible</bold>. The construct phrase ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ occurs 23 times in the Hebrew Bible. There are an additional ten occurrences that add a pronominal suffix to ‭חבזמ‬, indicating that the altar belongs to ‭הוהי‬. In addition, Deut. 16.21 further qualifies ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ with ‭מיהלא‬. Below, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309089213475398">Table 3</xref> lists the occurrences of ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬; phrases with ‭מיהלא‬ and the second masculine/first common plural suffix are marked with ‘‭ךיהלא‬’.</p>

<p>Setting aside for a moment the reference in Deut. 16.21, all but two passages refer to the altar in the tabernacle or temple. These two occurrences do stand out for they refer to altars located outside the tabernacle/temple, one of which is found in Deuteronomy. In Deut. 27.6, the altar of stone built by the Israelites on Mt Ebal was designated a ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ The description of the altar on Mt Ebal is consistent with the commands given in Exod. 20.22–26. The second occurrence is found in 1 Kgs 18.30. This altar was located on Mt Carmel, the place where Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal. The altar on Carmel must have been important at one time because the author of 1 Kings informs the reader that this particular altar was ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬. No reasons are given for questioning whether or not the altar on Mt Carmel adhered to the commands of Exod. 20.22–26 as well.</p>
<p>While the majority of the occurrences of ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ are a reference to the central altar, Deut. 27.6 and 1 Kgs 18.30 indicate that this was a valid designation of the local altar. It will be shown below how this conclusion fits into the larger context of Deuteronomy 12–26.</p>
<p><bold>(2) The larger context of Deuteronomy 12–26</bold>. The laws and instructions recorded in Deuteronomy 12–26 were given in preparation of Israel entering and possessing the Promised Land. Chapter 12 begins with instructions to tear down the Canaanite places of worship (Deut. 12.2–3). The Israelites were commanded not to worship God in every place, which was the Canaanite practice. Rather, they were to worship God in the place he chose (Deut. 12.5). The LORD told Israel that he would choose this place once Israel obtained peace from all of her enemies, and it would be then that Israel would bring her sacrifices to the central sanctuary (Deut. 12.10–11). Deuteronomy 12 places the legal section of Deuteronomy in a context different from that which Israel had known. The laws of Deuteronomy 12–26 were set in the context of dwelling in the land as opposed to wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>In the laws on worship in chs. 12–26, the setting of worship is primarily at the place the LORD would choose. In Deut. 12.20–28, those Israelites who lived too far from the chosen places are permitted to kill an animal and eat meat. Despite this allowance, they are still required to bring their sacrifices and their ‘holy things’ to the place the LORD would choose (v. 26). It is only in the place chosen by the LORD that they were to offer their sacrifices on the ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ (v. 27). Upon entering the land, the Israelites are commanded to bring their first fruits offering to the place the LORD chose so that the priest might place it before the ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ (26.4). According to 14.22–23, the Israelites were commanded to bring the first fruits of their harvest to the chosen place. The three festivals held each year were to take place at the place the LORD would choose (16.2, 5, 11, and 15). Although the ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ is not mentioned in 16.1–17, it is the only logical place for the Passover sacrifice to be offered.</p>
<p>The Israelites were also commanded to bring to the chosen place those judicial cases that were too difficult for the ‭םיטפש‬ of the local towns (17.8–10). As shown above, these disputes included religious cases. The ‭חבזמ‬ and the chosen place of God are closely tied together in Deuteronomy 12–26. In light of the context of Deuteronomy 12–26, it seems difficult to place the ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ found in 16.21 anywhere other than the central sanctuary. However, two features give credence to a change of focus from the central altar to the local altar.</p>
<p>First, the appointment of judges was located ‭ךירעש־לככ‬ (‘in all of your gates’). Deuteronomy 16.18 sets the context of the following set of laws in the local towns; it is in this context that the laws regarding the altar are placed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213475398">42</xref></sup> It is not too difficult to assume that the LORD could reveal himself to his people in settings outside the tabernacle, and in the passages listed above this was certainly the case (cf. Judg. 6.24–27; 2 Sam. 24.18–25).</p>
<p>The local context is continued in 17.2–7. In this passage, the Israelites are given instructions on judging an apostate who was found ‭ךירעש‬ ‭דחאב‬ (‘in one of your gates’, 17.2). The guilty person was to be tried before the judges at ‭ךירעש‬, and if they were found guilty, they were to be put to death (v. 7). The chosen place is not mentioned until 17.8, 10. If any dispute was too difficult for the judges in the local town, the case was to be brought before the priest or judge in the chosen place (vv. 8, 9). It is only in this last passage, 17.8–13, that the context shifts from the local town back to the chosen place.</p>
<p>Second, Deut. 16.18 employs the ל of advantage. The Israelites are commanded to appoint judges <italic>for themselves</italic>. The similar use of the ל in vv. 18 and 21, along with the local setting, marks the change of focus from the nation as a whole to the peoples in their local towns. Based on the context of 16.18–17.13, then, it is not difficult to understand ‭הוהי‬ ‭חבזמ‬ as a local altar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213475398">43</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0309089213475398">
<title>c. The Purpose of 16.21–17.1</title>
<p>Most likely, Deut. 16.21–17.1 serves as a transition between the command to appoint judges (Deut. 16.18–20) and the law of the apostate (Deut. 17.2–7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089213475398">44</xref></sup> McConville notes that these prohibitions in 16.21–17.1 ‘make a suitable introduction to 17.2–8, where the preeminent “crime” is the worship of other gods’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089213475398">45</xref></sup> Before the author provides a specific example of the administration of justice, he reiterates three prohibitions as reminders of how Israel was to worship the LORD. In the first two prohibitions (16.21, 22), the author offers a reminder of and expands upon the instructions given in Deut. 12.1–14.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089213475398">46</xref></sup> In these instructions, Israel was commanded not to worship God in the manner of the Canaanites. The third prohibition (17.1) reminds the Israelites to offer unblemished sacrifices (Deut 15.19–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089213475398">47</xref></sup> The repetition of ‭הבעות‬ (‘abomination’) in 17.1 and 17.4 ties the two passages together, with 17.2–7 serving as a specific example of the three general laws of 16.21–17.1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089213475398">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study I sought to determine whether Deut. 16.21 referred to local altars or the altar of the central sanctuary. I undertook a brief study of Exod. 20.24 for the reason that most scholars point to this particular passage to argue for local altars in Deut. 16.21. I concluded that the language of Exod. 20.24 did not set itself apart as a formulaic altar law on which other altar laws were based. I noted that the verb ‭השע‬, often used to indicate the construction of local altars, was also used for the construction of the bronze altar and the incense altar of the tabernacle. It was argued that the possibility existed that Israel held side-by-side two altar laws: one law for the local altar (Exod. 20.22–26), and a second for the altar of the tabernacle (Exod. 27.1–8). Deuteronomy 16.21 does not borrow the language of Exod. 20.24, but the possibility remained for local altars in Deut. 16.21.</p>
<p>I then argued that the ל preposition in Deut. 16.21 functions as a ל of advantage. The ל of advantage distinguishes the altar of Deut. 16.21 from the central altar. The Israelites are never told to make <italic>for themselves</italic> the central altar; the altar in Deut. 16.21 is better understood as a local altar.</p>
<p>Lastly, I looked to the immediate context of Deut. 16.21, namely 16.18–17.13. Once I validated the place of 16.21–17.1 in the larger passage of 16.18–17.13, I argued that the setting of the entire passage is the local towns of Israel. The first feature that indicates the local setting is ‭ךירעש‬. Israel was commanded to appoint judges in their towns (‭ךירעש‬, ‘your gates’) (16.18–20), and the author provided the Israelites with an example case that would be decided in their towns (17.2–7). Also, the judges were first to try the apostate at ‭ךירעש‬; if the case was too difficult, the judges were instructed to bring the case to the central sanctuary. The second feature is the shared use of the ל of advantage in 16.18 and 16.21. In 16.18, the ל of advantage shifts the focus from the nation as a whole to the peoples in their local towns. Likewise, 16.21 maintains the focus on the people in their local towns, away from the central sanctuary.</p>
