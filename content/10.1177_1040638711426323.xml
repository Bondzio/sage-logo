<abstract>
<p><italic>Seneca Valley virus</italic> (SVV), a member of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, was implicated in a suspicious vesicular disease discovered in pigs from Canada in 2007. Because any outbreak of vesicular disease in pigs is assumed to be foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) until confirmed otherwise, a test for diagnosing the presence of SVV would be a very useful tool. To develop the diagnostic tests for SVV infection, 5 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced from mice immunized with binary ethylenimine (BEI)-inactivated SVV. Using a dot blot assay, the reactivity of the mAbs was confirmed to be specific for SVV, not reacting with any of the other vesicular disease viruses tested. The mAbs demonstrated reactivity with SVV antigen in infected cells by an immunohistochemistry assay. An SVV-specific competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) was developed using BEI-inactivated SVV antigen and a mAb for serodiagnosis. The cELISA results were compared to the indirect isotype (immunoglobulin [Ig]M and IgG) ELISA and the virus neutralization test. All SVV experimentally inoculated pigs exhibited a positive SVV-specific antibody response at 6 days postinoculation, and the sera remained positive until the end of the experiment on day 57 (&gt;40% inhibition) using the cELISA. The cELISA reflected the profile of the indirect ELISA for both IgM and IgG. This panel of SVV-specific mAbs is valuable for the identification of SVV antigen and the serological detection of SVV-specific antibodies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Seneca valley virus</italic> (SVV) is a member of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638711426323">7</xref></sup> The biological and serological properties of 7 SVV isolates obtained from pigs throughout the United States over a period of 14 years have been reported (Knowles NJ, Hallenbeck PL: 2005, A new picornavirus is most closely related to cardioviruses. <italic>In</italic>: EUROPIC 2005: 13th meeting of the European Study Group on the Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses, Lunteren, The Netherlands, May 23–29). Serological surveys have revealed the presence of antibodies capable of neutralizing SVV in pigs, cattle, and mice, but not in human beings (Knowles NJ, Hales LM, Jones BH: 2006, Epidemiology of Seneca Valley virus: identification and characterization of isolates from pigs in the United States. <italic>In</italic>: Northern Lights EUROPIC 2006: 14th meeting of the European Study Group on the Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. Abstract G2. Inari, Finland, November 26–December 1). Such information, combined with the fact that SVV has been isolated from pigs, suggests that this species is a natural host for SVV, although there is no clear association of the virus with disease in pigs (Knowles NJ, et al.: 2006, Epidemiology of Seneca Valley virus). <italic>Seneca valley virus</italic> has been implicated in a suspicious vesicular disease discovered in pigs imported to the United States from Canada in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711426323">10</xref></sup> Of the 187 pigs, 15 had significant lesions and were identified as SVV positive through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711426323">10</xref></sup> Since the lesions are clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious and devastating disease caused by the <italic>Foot-and-mouth disease virus</italic> (FMDV), any outbreak of vesicular disease in pigs should be diagnosed in order to rule out the possibility of a FMDV infection. An assay that could easily identify SVV in suspect cases would be a helpful tool. Methods currently being used for SVV detection include reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Knowles NJ: 2005, A pan-picornavirus RT-PCR: identification of novel picornavirus species. <italic>In</italic>: EUROPIC 2005: XIIIth Meeting of the European Study Group on the Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses, Lunteren, The Netherlands, May 23–29) and virus serum neutralizing antibody detection. However, the development of sensitive, specific, and rapid immunoassays for the detection of SVV infection would facilitate the differentiation from other vesicular disease virus infections, such as FMDV.</p>
<p>The level of specific antibodies in serum is a useful parameter for the identification of viral infections. Serum antibody assays are important in the determination of the immune status of animals or of a population in epidemiological studies. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) is widely used to test for serum antibodies. The assay measures the competition for a specific antigen between antibodies present in the clinical samples with a well-characterized monoclonal antibody (mAb). Numerous cELISAs have been developed for serological diagnosis of important viral infections in swine, including the detection of antibodies against <italic>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</italic> (PRRSV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638711426323">6</xref></sup> Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638711426323">3</xref></sup> and FMDV nonstructural proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711426323">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, SVV-specific mAbs were produced, and a cELISA was developed for serodiagnosis. The results obtained from the sera of experimentally inoculated pigs were compared to the indirect capture immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG ELISAs. The mAbs produced in the current study could be useful for SVV antigen identification, the serological detection of SVV antibodies, and to enhance the differentiation of the diagnosis of SVV infections from other vesicular diseases.</p>

<title>Preparation of viruses</title>
<p>The laboratory stock of SVV obtained from National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL; Ames, Iowa) was plaque purified. To select the best cell line for SVV antigen production, swine testis (ST), swine kidney (SK-RST), and human lung cancer cell monolayers (NCI-H1299<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638711426323">a</xref></sup>) were evaluated. Briefly, these cells were infected with SVV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 PFU/cell, and the yield of infectious progeny virions was determined by a plaque assay. The NCI-H1299 cell line was selected and grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638711426323">b</xref></sup> supplemented with 4.5 g/l D-glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µg/ml gentamycin, and 2% (v/v) non-irradiated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The infected cells were harvested when complete cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. The viral supernatant was clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and the viral particles were pelleted by means of high-speed ultracentrifugation. The viral pellets were then resuspended in a small volume of a buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and the titer of the live virus was determined by a standard plaque assay. For SVV inactivation, the clarified viral supernatant was first incubated with 10 mM binary ethylenimine (BEI) for 24 hr at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10% sodium thiosulphate. The SVV was purified on a cesium chloride gradient. The virus band was harvested and dialyzed, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638711426323">14</xref></sup> The virus concentration was determined spectrophotometrically as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711426323">11</xref></sup> Aliquots of the virus were stored at −70°C until required.</p>

<title><italic>Seneca Valley virus</italic>–specific immunoglobulins M and G antibody response</title>
<p>Since the immune response depends upon the dose of the immunogen administered, 2 groups of pigs from special pathogen-free facility were experimentally inoculated with differing amounts of SVV particles. Sera were collected at different dpi. All virus-inoculated pigs did not show any clinical signs of the disease, even though group 2 was inoculated with a greater amount of viral particles. The SVV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies produced by the pigs in response to virus inoculation were measured using the in-house developed indirect ELISAs, where purified SVV was used as the antigen. Initially, a commercial normal pig serum<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1040638711426323">p</xref></sup> was used as the negative serum in the ELISA. However, this serum exhibited a very high OD for SVV specific IgG (H+L chain), and relatively high OD for SVV specific IgM. Instead, the serum collected from the experimental pigs at 0 dpi was used as the negative serum.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638711426323">Figure 2</xref> displays the humoral response profiles for the 4 pigs inoculated with SVV. The isotype-specific ELISA showed differences in the serum production of IgM and IgG. The SVV-specific IgM was positive for 3 of the 4 pigs at 5 dpi. The pigs all showed a positive response at 6 dpi and maintained peak levels until 14 dpi, at which point the IgM levels declined to undetectable levels by 21 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638711426323">Fig. 2a</xref>). The early onset of the IgM antibody formation, as shown, is in agreement with previous data concerning the course of an immune response following the administration of model antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711426323">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>The IgG titers developed later and demonstrated a strong positive response after 21 dpi, except for pig 8, which established high IgG titer after 29 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638711426323">Fig. 2b</xref>). The small peaks detected from 5 to 14 dpi are most likely due to cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody, goat anti-swine IgG antibody. It recognizes both the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin, resulting in nonspecific binding of IgM light chains. The IgG titers remained strong throughout the entire period of the experiment. Pigs 6 and 7 developed a better immune response (IgM and IgG) than pigs 5 and 8. This suggested that the inoculation dosage might not closely relate to the immune response.</p>

<title>Development of competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for <italic>Seneca Valley virus</italic>–specific antibody detection</title>
<p>With the intention of developing a sensitive cELISA for SVV antibody detection, the 5 mAbs were examined for their ability to compete with a polyclonal anti-serum from a pig experimentally inoculated with SVV. Four of the 5 mAbs demonstrated various abilities to compete with the polyclonal anti-SVV serum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638711426323">Table 1</xref>). Monoclonal antibody F61SVV-9 was subsequently selected as a competitor mAb for the cELISA since it demonstrated the strongest competition capability compared to the other 3 mAbs. The SVV antigen concentrations and the mAb dilutions were then optimized to obtain a maximal range in OD values between positive and negative sera.</p>
<p>A total of 219 negative sera were tested using the cELISA. The frequency distribution of the percent inhibition generated from these sera showed a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638711426323">Fig. 3</xref>). The mean percentage of inhibition regarding the negative sera was −0.73%. The negative cut-off value was set at &lt;40% by adding 3 standard deviations (SD = 10.2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638711426323">9</xref></sup> All 219 tested negative samples were identified as negative using the cELISA, giving an estimated diagnostic specificity of 100%.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Seneca Valley virus</italic> was linked to a suspicious vesicular disease in pigs in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711426323">10</xref></sup> Since the SVV associated lesions were clinically indistinguishable from those caused by FMDV, the rapid and early detection of this or similar infections is essential. In the current study, SVV-specific mAbs were produced and their diagnostic applications were evaluated.</p>
<p>The results from the selection of the best cell line for SVV antigen production indicate that H1299 cells support the production of high titer SVV. In contrast, ST and SK-RST cells produced a low titer of the virus, suggesting they were not susceptible to SVV. This is in agreement with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711426323">11</xref></sup> demonstrating the sensitivity of tumor cell lines, such as small-cell lung cancer, to SVV.</p>
<p>The pigs inoculated with live SVV did not show any clinical signs of disease, even though 2 groups of pigs were inoculated with different amounts of virus particles. A similar finding was previously reported; showing that pigs infected with 2 SVV isolates failed to exhibit any specific disease (Knowles NJ, et al.: 2006, Epidemiology of Seneca Valley virus). It is possible that the lesions were caused by multifactorial swine infections since 15 pigs had significant lesions associated with the presence of SVV by PCR in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711426323">10</xref></sup> An association of the SVV with disease in pigs is, as of yet, uncertain.</p>
<p>Although SVV may not be a devastating disease, assays to determine the presence of SVV infection are necessary because of its similarity to vesicular foreign animal diseases. Using a dot blot assay, 5 mAbs produced from the current study were shown to react specifically with SVV, without cross-reactivity to other vesicular disease viruses. All 5 mAbs reacted against the SVV viral antigen in infected cells, exhibiting low background in an immunohistochemical assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638711426323">Fig. 1</xref>). Direct antigen detection of vesicular lesions, using the immunohistochemical assay, can effectively eliminate or confirm the possibility of a SVV infection. The rapid identification of the SVV antigen can be accomplished using such mAbs. At present, there is insufficient testing of tissues collected from SVV infected animals for validating the use of the mAbs in immunohistochemical assays. Further testing is required.</p>
<p>The presence of specific antibodies would suggest that the animals have been exposed to SVV. Serological surveys confirmed the presence of specific SVV antibodies in pigs, cattle and wild mice, though not in human beings (Knowles NJ, et al.: 2006, Epidemiology of Seneca Valley virus). Indirect IgM and IgG ELISAs are commonly used serological techniques for the diagnosis of viral infections. In the current study, although the experimentally inoculated pigs did not show any clinical signs of disease, all pigs had an elevated, specific antibody response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638711426323">Fig. 2</xref>). Two pigs (nos. 6 and 7) from each group had a better immunoresponse than the other pigs suggesting that the inoculation dose might not directly relate to the immune response. It has been demonstrated that once the immune response reaches a broad plateau level, the close relationship between the administered dose of the immunogen and the immune response ceases to exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638711426323">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the indirect IgM and IgG ELISAs have been gradually replaced by cELISAs. An indirect ELISA is impractical because high cross-reactivity makes a definite diagnosis difficult; in addition the secondary conjugated antibody is dependent upon the animal species tested. A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638711426323">12</xref></sup> demonstrated a high nonspecific binding activity of IgM against Aujeszky’s disease. Elsewhere, similar problems with nonspecific binding due to IgM in immunoassays against FMDV have been repeatedly reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711426323">1</xref></sup> A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638711426323">2</xref></sup> evaluated an isotype-specific ELISA for SVD antibody detection on field sera, and found that, even with a monoclonal anti-IgM, a small proportion of samples demonstrated nonspecific binding. In contrast, cELISAs are easy to perform and can be scaled up to accommodate the screening of large numbers of sera. Also, cELISAs are suitable for the detection of antibodies from different species, without the need for special reagents.</p>
<p>To develop a rapid and sensitive cELISA for SVV serodiagnosis, the 5 mAbs were examined for their ability to compete with polyclonal antibodies from SVV-inoculated pigs against the SVV antigen. The mAb F61SVV-9 was selected because it demonstrated the strongest competition with monospecific polyclonal sera against SVV, but not with sera from animals infected with other vesicular disease viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1040638711426323">Fig. 4</xref>). The calculated diagnostic specificities based on 219 negative sera are 97% for IgM and 100% for IgG ELISA and the cELISA, respectively. Similarly, a 2009 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638711426323">13</xref></sup> demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificities of the cELISA were higher than a commercially available indirect ELISA for antibody detection against Avian influenza virus. The 7 positive sera by IgM ELISA were demonstrated to be negative when tested by a VNT. Nonspecific binding is possibly the reason for the false-positive reactions.</p>
<p>The cELISA results had a high concordance with the indirect IgM, IgG ELISAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638711426323">Fig. 2</xref>), and the VNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1040638711426323">Fig. 5a</xref>). The early rise of IgM and the late development of IgG are in agreement with the general models of immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638711426323">5</xref></sup> A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638711426323">2</xref></sup> reported that the cELISA for SVD preferentially detected the IgM isotype over IgG when it was applied to the titration of sequential sera following experimental infection. In contrast, the SVV cELISA developed in the current study was able to serodiagnose both the early and late stages of the immune responses induced by SVV inoculation.</p>
<p>In summary, the development of SVV-specific mAbs and their potential applications in regards to diagnosis were reported. The 5 SVV-specific mAbs can be used for the rapid identification of SVV viruses by the immunohistochemical assay. The cELISA methodology, using a developed mAb, offers a promising approach for a rapid and convenient serodiagnosis, which could be used as an alternative to the VNT for screening possible SVV infections. Because epidemiological analyses revealed that SVV might have been recently introduced into pigs in the United States, the development of the cELISA will be the top choice for the study and surveillance program of the epidemiology of SVV. These mAbs have a great diagnostic potential for the identification of clinically unclear vesicular lesions, and efficiently differentiate possible SVV infections from other vesicular disease virus infections.</p>
