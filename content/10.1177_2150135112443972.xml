<p>In recent years, surgery that establishes a dual coronary artery system has become the mainstay of management of patients who present with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). However, various opinions exist regarding the optimal approach to management of significant mitral valve regurgitation, which is often present in association with significant left ventricular dysfunction.  </p>
<p>In several contemporary series, repair of ALCAPA is reportedly associated with operative mortality which ranges between 0% and 15% depending on the characteristics of the patient population and the utilization of mechanical circulatory support in the perioperative period. Consensus appears to exist regarding the influence that severity of left ventricular dysfunction, age at the time of presentation, and magnitude of coexisting mitral regurgitation have on hospital survival. In addition, there appears to be agreement about the notion that the establishment of a dual coronary system commonly results in improved left ventricular dysfunction among survivors. However, improvement in the degree of mitral regurgitation appears to be less predictable and may be slower, requiring a longer period of time to become apparent. A report by Ben Ali and associates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112443972">1</xref>
</sup> described the late results of surgical management of children with ALCAPA, consisting of immediate surgery as soon as the diagnosis was established, with direct aortic reimplantation of the anomalous artery whenever technically feasible. Of 62 patients, only 3 (5%) had concomitant mitral valve surgery. In that series, poor left ventricular ejection fraction was an incremental risk factor for early mortality; severity of mitral regurgitation was not. The severity of mitral regurgitation decreased or remained stable in most surviving patients and therefore reoperation for mitral valve repair was seldom necessary. It should be noted that although it is appropriate in some cases to repair the mitral valve at the time that the dual coronary system is established, there is a significant challenge to achieve effective repair due to technical demands and small patient size. In addition, concomitant mitral valve repair will commonly result in increased myocardial ischemic times which may complicate postoperative left ventricular dysfunction.</p>
<p>In their study, published in this issue of <italic>World Journal of Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery</italic> , Georgiev and associates investigated the potential for recovery of left ventricular and mitral valve function after establishment of a dual coronary circulation without concomitant mitral valve repair in patients with ALCAPA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112443972">2</xref>
</sup> They observed that early deaths occurred in younger patients with greater degrees of ventricular dilatation and mitral regurgitation as well as decreased left ventricular shortening fraction. Not surprisingly, some of these patients were unable to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass or had persistent low cardiac output in the postoperative period. The early mortality rate in the cohort was slightly higher than in some other recent reports, but case numbers are not sufficiently large to suggest statistically significant differences between mortality rates in various reports. Of note, mechanical circulatory support was not utilized after surgery in this series. The availability of new devices that are optimally suited for pediatric circulatory support is an important addition to the management of patients with ALCAPA and severely compromised ventricular function, potentially providing a bridge to recovery or transplantation; perhaps even allowing for the additional ischemic time that it takes to intervene on the mitral valve if deemed necessary. It should also be noted that for patients with severe ventricular dysfunction, alternative approaches which avoid prolonged myocardial ischemia may be considered, including the use of a direct left subclavian artery to coronary artery anastomosis. In 2007, Lange and associates reported long-term results in a group of 56 patients who had undergone repair of ALCAPA from 1977 to 2002. In 25 patients, the initial repair was by subclavian artery anastomosis. Authors suggested that this may still be considered an option for selected patients.<sup>

</sup> </p>
<p>Georgiev and associates’ observation that mitral valve regurgitation and ventricular dysfunction improved in the vast majority of survivors concurs with the existing literature. Current literature has also demonstrated that the availability of extracorporeal circulatory support in the perioperative period and careful monitoring of the degree of mitral regurgitation after ventricular remodeling has occurred would offer the best opportunities to optimize the outcome in this challenging group of patients.</p>
