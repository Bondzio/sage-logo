<abstract>
<p>The article explores how the concept of authenticity is deployed in contemporary Switzerland to delimit not only the representational boundaries of the Muslim (foreign) ‘other’, but also of the dominant cultural self. The authors analyse the act of constituting the authentic other in relation to the stability, comfort and safeness of the dialogically constituted authentic self, as illustrated in a Swiss advertising campaign in summer 2009. To investigate how those power relations unfold in the Ali Kebab advertising campaign, the article draws on a framework of visual analysis that studies the field of significations carried by specific images in relation to the particular context in which they are deployed, then facilitates their recontextualisation within wider social discourses. This sheds light on how the categories of authenticity displayed by the Ali Kebab adverts draw on a deep and powerful colonial imaginary that goes well beyond the borders of Switzerland.</p>

<p>In an era marked by the events of September 11th in the USA, western public discourses have been particularly preoccupied with trying to define, regulate and represent Muslims. The media, political campaigns and even advertising campaigns have participated in this process by producing and displaying in the public sphere images often casting this Muslim ‘other’ in terms of a ‘good’ and ‘bad’ dichotomy. The objectives of this article are twofold. First, drawing on the discourse of Orientalism, it explores how the concept of authenticity can invite us to analyse these modes of representation as a dialogical process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549413476010">Bhabha, 1983</xref>). That is, not only in terms of representation of the foreign (or the Muslim other), but also in terms of representation of the self. Second, by way of illustrating our argument, through the analysis of a Swiss advertisement campaign – the Ali Kebab campaign – it provides an analytical framework that facilitates the inscription of a specific iconography within a wider European or western field of significations and power relations with respect to Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p>Over summer 2009, a series of intriguing posters surfaced throughout Swiss cities, in all linguistic areas of the country, announcing that ‘Ali Kebap’, referring to a probable new Turkish restaurant selling döner kebabs, was ‘new in town’. No address was mentioned on the posters, so the first question that came to the mind of the attentive observer was: who is this Ali character? Who is this hefty looking and smiling chap, wearing his red fez and wielding a very long knife? His sudden appearance in public and media spaces created a buzz in the Swiss media: what was this advertisement about? Who was behind it? It soon turned out that Ali was part of a teaser campaign for the Swiss market leader of out-of-home advertising. This teaser campaign was built around Ali’s success in the kebab business, and his transformation from the owner of a single fast-food business to the owner of a chain of restaurants, hotels and, even an airline company. For us, the figure of Ali, who was chosen specifically for ‘his authenticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>), resonates beyond this imagined entrepreneur and his link to a successful advertisement campaign. We understand it as a window into a broader reflection on the notion of authenticity and the dialogical constitution of the self and the other.</p>
<p>We explore how this notion is mobilised to depict and ultimately ensnare Turks and/or Muslims into a specific imaginary of foreigness, despite the fact that they might formally be members of a polity:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549413476010">1</xref></sup> an imaginary that is not limited to the advertising campaign itself, but taps into a colonial and orientalist repertoire. In fact, it is our contention that this process is as much about delimiting the (phantasmagorical) boundaries of the authentic self than the authentic other, as it participates in the (re)production of a safe and stable Swiss political imagination, avoiding the challenge of (re)negotiating the terms of the self. One should note here that we are in agreement with other scholars who have posited that colonialism has had a profound impact on Switzerland, despite the fact that it has not been a formal colonial power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549413476010">Purtschert, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549413476010">Purtschert et al., 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549413476010">2</xref></sup> In this sense, our empirical object of analysis resonates in many ways with the colonial heritage that continues to haunt European imagination.</p>
<p>The article begins by discussing how authenticity can be a category fostering the impossibility for the other to recast or imagine themselves outside this phantasmagorical representation of the foreign. It then moves to a contextualisation of the Ali Kebab campaign in light of the presence and increased visibility of Muslims in Switzerland and Europe. Thereafter, it analyses the campaign, linking its content first to specific social practices, and second relating it to a larger imaginary that articulates itself around the constitution of authenticity as a form of categorisation of the ‘true’ self and the ‘true’ other. The article concludes with a reflection on how this categorisation represents a form of safety for the political imaginary of the dominant group.</p>

<title>Authenticity as modes of representation</title>
<p>In this article we understand authenticity as a dialogical process that identifies and delimits the ‘true’ boundaries of the other – the foreign or Muslim other in our case – but also of the self, the dominant culture. Thus authenticity refers to a form of categorisation by which the dominant culture not only constructs and constitutes the essential other, but participates as well in the constitution and construction of its own identity. In this specific instance, the notion of authenticity is best understood as a component of the discourse of Orientalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549413476010">Said, 1979</xref>): a discourse whose functions include assigning essentialist characteristics to the ‘oriental’ other, making them identifiable and delimiting their representational boundaries, as well as in this process delimiting the boundaries of what the ‘western’ subject is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549413476010">Yeğenoğlu, 1998</xref>). The fact that this discourse has the authority to produce an ‘authentic’ truth about the other is important, as it underlines the power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549413476010">Foucault, 2001[1982]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549413476010">Said, 1979</xref>) between the one that produces it, and the one that is the object of this production:<disp-quote>
<p>The Orient was Orientalized … because it <italic>could be</italic> – that is, submitted to being – <italic>made</italic> Oriental. There is little consent to be found, for example, in the fact that Flaubert’s encounter with an Egyptian courtesan produced a widely influential model of the Oriental woman; she never spoke of herself, she never represented her emotions, presence or history. <italic>He</italic> spoke for and represented <italic>her.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549413476010">Said, 1979</xref>: 6; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to shed light on this power play, it is useful to think in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549413476010">Homi Bhabha’s (1983)</xref> understanding of modes of representation as constituting and delimiting the relations between a dominant social group and alterity (a variety of contextually different social group).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549413476010">3</xref></sup> Modes of representation delimit the social, cultural or racial hierarchies within a polity and, for Bhabha, are set as central to the articulation of colonial discourses, as they are constructed on the ‘concept of “fixity” in the ideological construction of otherness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549413476010">1983</xref>: 18). Here, ‘fixity’ refers not only to the unchanging character of the other, but also to the continuing necessity to assign and ascribe difference to the other (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549413476010">Connolly, 2002[1991]</xref>). For Bhabha, this ambivalence of fixity is both immanent and ever in need of reaffirmation:<disp-quote>
<p>[It] ensures repeatability [of the colonial stereotype] in changing historical and discursive conjunctures; informs its strategies of individuation and marginalisation; produces that effect of probabilistic truth and predictability which, for the [mode of representation], must always be in <italic>excess</italic> of what can be empirically proved or logically construed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549413476010">1983</xref>: 18, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The category of authenticity embodies this ambiguity, as dominant groups are constantly ascribing traits and reaffirming the boundaries of the other and as a result of the self. This has political consequences for dominated or oppressed social groups’ ability to speak with different and authorised voices in the public sphere. Indeed, authenticity becomes an expectation from the dominant social group in regard to ‘othered’ social groups, as the latter are repeatedly confined to their authentic dispositions by the former. If a member of a dominated social group does not fulfil the expectations of authenticity, they will not be taken as a genuine representative voice of this social group, and (mis)placed as a non-legitimate and non-representative voice. We contend that authenticity is what constitutes, in representational terms, the authoritative voice of the other from the perspective of the dominant social group, even if this voice is neither necessarily legitimate (via forms of political participation) nor representative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367549413476010">4</xref></sup> In sum, for representational effect, the category of authenticity has to identify and (de)limit whose voice is authorised to speak on behalf of the group; and to silence, by denying their authenticity, alternative voices that might alter the comfort of dominant representations, and by extension the safety and security of dominant identities. As such, safety and security are intrinsically linked to the delineation of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549413476010">Connolly, 2002[1991]</xref>).</p>
<p>Before analysing the specifics of the Ali Kebab campaign, the next section provides a short discussion of the transformations in the demographic makeup as well as political and sociological positions of Muslims in Switzerland and Europe more generally.</p>

<title>Contextualising the need to portray, represent and ‘authenticate’ Swiss and European Muslims</title>
<p>As of 2010, based on a survey on a representative sample of the residents in Switzerland, Muslims represented about 293,360 residents, about 4.5 percent of the overall population. The vast majority originally came from the former Yugoslavia (essentially from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia) and from Turkey. Out of these residents about 31 percent were Swiss citizens, slightly more than 91,000 residents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549413476010">Gianni 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549413476010">Office Fédéral de la Statistique 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367549413476010">5</xref></sup> Yet, even if they represent a very heterogeneous group with different levels of religiosity and religious practices, political and moral values, cultural habits and socio-demographic profiles, usually they have been portrayed, as it is common in many western settings, as a fairly homogeneous group by non-Muslim Swiss citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549413476010">Behloul, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549413476010">Helbling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549413476010">Mayer, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367549413476010">6</xref></sup> Moreover, not unlike the rest of Europe, the demands of devout Swiss Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549413476010">Gianni, 2005</xref>), and as a result attempts to define and portray them in the Swiss public and media spaces, have increased in recent years. This can be explained partly by the fact that the identity of many European Muslims has shifted from being workers in transit in the 1960s and 1970s to permanent residents or citizens in the 1980s and 1990s. Indeed, the presence of Islam on European soil became important in the early 1960s due to the need for unskilled labourers in a postwar era. At that time Islam was:<disp-quote>
<p>incarnated … by the anonymous and silent mass of unskilled labourers working in industry and tertiary sector. Largely on the fringes of society, living in groups in their own, separate social spaces, their primary goal was to earn as much money as possible and then return home. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549413476010">Cesari, 2004</xref>: 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the oil crisis of 1974 marked the end of the need for unskilled workers and the beginning of new family reunification policies, which changed the demographic make-up of Muslim migrants from a male-dominated population to one consisting of nuclear and extended families settling in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549413476010">Cesari, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549413476010">Modood et al., 2006</xref>). This shift is important, as it indicates a change in the relations between Muslims and Europeans: ‘It was no longer possible to think of oneself as a worker in transit: the signs of permanency were numerous and irreversible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549413476010">Cesari, 2004</xref>: 13). It is from that point onwards that Muslims began to make demands related to their faith, including requests for prayer rooms, the constructions of mosques and so on. These requests have evolved with time and have led to vivid debates which are still ongoing, related to the recognition, institutionalisation and representation of Islam in Europe.</p>
<p>For Europeans this shift in the status of Muslims and of Islam in Europe, including their demands for greater recognition, has been difficult to accept and subject to different levels of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549413476010">Cesari, 2004</xref>). In fact, it partly explains why religion replaced ethnicity, referred to in the 1980s and early 1990s as the principal marker of identification of the ‘foreign’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549413476010">Knippenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549413476010">Yukleyen, 2010</xref>). Even though many Muslims are now second- and even third-generation citizens, their ‘Muslimness’ is mobilised to mark them as the exotic, essentialised and inherently different other. This othering process reached a new peak after the events of September 11th, frequently articulating itself around the figures of a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ Muslim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549413476010">Mamdani, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549413476010">Mahmood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549413476010">Razack, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549413476010">Silvestri, 2007</xref>). In other words, the ability to identify who and what is included in the categories ‘Muslim’ and ‘Islam’, and to ascribe them particular authentic characteristics, is the product of a specific power play which participates in delimiting the authentic boundaries of the dominant culture. This interplay between the authenticity of the other (i.e. the foreign) and the authenticity of the dominant group (i.e. the self) is at the heart of our analysis of the Ali Kebab campaign, to which we now turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367549413476010">
<title>The Ali Kebab campaign: between denotation and connotation</title>
<p>The Ali Kebab campaign was launched in summer 2009. The jolly face of Ali, his red fez, long knife and kebab were widely showcased throughout Switzerland, and became familiar even in remote Swiss villages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367549413476010">Figure 1</xref>, poster 1). This campaign immediately created a media buzz, as until 17 August no one knew who was behind it (although some guessed fairly quickly that it was probably a teaser campaign). On that day, a second poster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367549413476010">Figure 1</xref>, poster 2) appeared, where Ali posed next to two of his employees over the slogan: ‘25 x in Town’ – his business had expanded. At the bottom of the poster one could finally see who was behind the campaign: the Swiss out-of-home advertisement company APG, and read the following slogan: ‘APG posters make you successful.’ This second poster was followed by two others, where Ali had become even more successful, as he was now the proud owner of a hotel and subsequently an airline company (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367549413476010">Figure 1</xref>, posters 3 and 4).</p>

</fig>
<p>The immediate message conveyed by these posters was about how (small) companies could become rapidly prosperous via this type of media advertisement: ‘Ali, un personnage fictif, symbolise les entreprises qui connaissent un succès durable grâce au média de l’affiche’[Ali, a fictive character, symbolises companies which become successful on the long run because of poster advertisement] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549413476010">SWR, 2009</xref>). Yet, beyond this first reading, we argue that this visual campaign articulates the categories of authenticity of the foreign and of the self in specific ways. To determine these ways we turn to an analytical framework which focuses on how it is represented, rather than what is represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549413476010">Chandler, 2007</xref>). Doing so invites us to move from visual semiotics to social discourse by distinguishing between two complementary dimensions of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 1993</xref>). On one level, we pay attention to the generic structure of the campaign, that is to the ‘structure <italic>of</italic> the text’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 1993</xref>: 203, emphasis in original), to the ‘sequence of linguistic (and/or other semiotic) activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>: 12) that is presented in the campaign. In other words, we identify different visual and textual signifiers not only to reconstruct the ‘syntagmatic structure of discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 1993</xref>: 194), but also to relate the latter to certain social practices <italic>qua</italic> discourse. These social practices enable us to identify how social actors are represented via the campaign. On another level, because we consider it important to understand how these visual and textual productions are linked to a larger field of significations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549413476010">Chandler, 2007</xref>), we pay attention to the field structure of the Ali Kebab campaign, to ‘a structure <italic>used</italic> in the text’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 1993</xref>: 203; emphasis in original):<disp-quote>
<p>It is assumed … that texts make reference to an experiential world outside themselves and their immediate context, and that this ultimately means ‘reference to a social practice other than that constituted, in part, by the text itself’. In other words, the field of structure of a text or set of texts is a <italic>recontextualization</italic> … of the structure of a social practice, or set of interrelated practices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen 1993</xref>: 204, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to show the interplay between these two dimensions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367549413476010">Figure 2</xref>) we mobilise basic categories of semiotics, inspired by Barthian semiotics, that have been used to analyse visual materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>). To illustrate how the ‘syntagmatic structure of discourse’ is articulated in the campaign, we identify the <italic>denotations</italic> present in the advertisement (i.e. what or/and who is being portrayed), and show how they relate to <italic>connotations</italic> (i.e. to the ideas and values conveyed by those representations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>). While there is a formal distinction between denotation and connotation, both are significantly linked, since denotation can be divided into two analytic categories: <italic>denotative signifiers</italic> and <italic>denotative signified</italic>. The latter can be associated with something akin to connotations, as denotative signified also refers to ideas or values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>). At the level of generic structure, this interplay between denotative signifiers and denotative signified highlights the sequence of semiotic activities both synchronically and diachronically present in the advertising campaign. We highlight how two social practices, one explicit (economic success and entrepreneurship) and the other implicit (integration) emerge from this interplay. This analysis of the generic structure of the campaign leads us to an analysis of its field structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>As mentioned previously, to reconstruct the field structure of the Ali Kebab campaign, our analysis centres on its recontextualisation within the social discourses of authenticity of the foreign and of the self. The denotative signified that we identify at the level of the generic structure in the advertising campaign serves, again in light of Barthian semiotics, to identify the larger connotations that emerge from it. According to Barthes, what is signified via connotations is a ‘fragment of ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549413476010">1985</xref>: 78). Yet Barthian semiotics is only useful in the effort of recontextualisation to the extent that significations are then replaced in an intertextuality or a <italic>longue durée</italic>, which Barthian semiotics primarily lacks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549413476010">van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>). For example, recontextualising the advertising campaign beyond its sole generic structure allows us to analyse the intertext between Ali’s adverts and colonial tropes, such as the one conveyed by the French Y’a bon Banania advert popular since the mid-1910s. In addition, we are able, through parallels between the Ali adverts and the Swiss People’s Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei, SVP; for the pictures see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549413476010">Kein Minarett 2009</xref>) anti-minaret campaign, which took place around the same time, to inscribe the Ali Kebab campaign within wider European social discourses on Muslims articulated along dichotomic terms. By delineating such a system of semiotic associations – that is, by pointing out how the Ali Kebab campaign can be related to a larger post-colonial imaginary – we show how figures of the foreign are differentially constructed in the Swiss public sphere, and how they contribute to (de)limiting the representational boundaries of an authenticity of the foreign and the self.</p>

<sec id="section5-1367549413476010">
<title>Generic structure of the campaign: Ali Kebab, or the story of successful integration</title>
<p>In all the different posters the figure of Ali remains almost the same – he is smiling widely and identifiable through his red fez. The only thing that changes is that the sequence of posters showcase symbols of his growing economic comfort: in the second poster he has traded his apron and t-shirt for a tie and a shirt; in the third one, one sees that he has had a gold tooth put in, and in the last one he is wearing a big shiny watch and ring. Moreover, although the posters market different products, all of them follow the same storyline where Ali remains a <italic>petit</italic>, even if successful and seemingly foreign entrepreneur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367549413476010">7</xref></sup> In other words, when the denotative signifiers present in all the posters (e.g. fez, ring, gold tooth and so on) are put together, they tell us something about the denotative signified present in those images: the social practices conveyed by the campaign. Indeed, Ali is depicted as having reached a certain economic success, which means that he has been able to integrate himself in his host country. Yet, this success remains conditioned on his ability to be identified through signs that indicate his foreignness and/or Turkishness.</p>
<p>More precisely, his success is limited to an economic one, where he is ensnared in his niche, where he and his products are identified easily as ‘foreign’. The category of foreignness is articulated fairly clearly through the use of denotative signifiers such as the fez, the kebab and other signs are repeated in all posters. For example, Ali’s hotel in poster 3 has the shape of the rotating spit on which the kebab meat is cooked, and clothes are hanging out of the hotel windows – something that would be rather uncommon in Swiss hotels. Moreover, the hotel is apparently located in a semi-residential urban area next to a building covered with graffiti. The impression is that Ali’s hotel is more of a motel, thus clearly conveying the socio-economic boundaries of his success. Finally, the symbol of the kebab comes back in poster 4, where Ali is in the pilot’s seat, holding a kebab stick triumphantly outside his window. Yet, even at the height of his economic success, Ali is still represented with a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, a symbol of someone who has not totally abandoned manual work. Ali is not your typical CEO.</p>
<p>The subtext present in all those posters indicates something about the terms of successful integration in the Swiss polity, where success is achievable if one is able to remain identifiable as a different but non-threatening other. As such, Ali is able to accumulate capital precisely because he taps into his cultural difference. Discussing the German case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413476010">Caglar (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549413476010">Pecoud (2001)</xref> go through the dilemmas that such a situation can pose to the foreign other, and how they choose to represent themselves. They point out that the image of the exotic Turk was reappropriated by döner kebab shop owners in Berlin until the 1990s to market their business, where they referred to a western construction of the Orient to promote a specific product as an authentic culinary experience. This was done despite the fact that döner kebabs, as sold in Western Europe, were not really found in such a form in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413476010">Caglar, 1995</xref>). In so doing, kebab shop owners, like the figure of Ali, were able to acquire rapid economic success through self-employment, but this restrained their ability to acquire symbolic (i.e. cultural) capital as they built their success on their exoticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413476010">Caglar, 1995</xref>). Therefore, this process limited substantially their range of possibilities to choose how to articulate their identity publically.</p>
<p>Interestingly, beyond the visuals of the advertisement, the rationale given by the advertising agency to explain the choice of Ali provides us with further details on this understanding of integration conveyed by the interaction of denotative signifiers and signified in the campaign. We learn that Ali – Hasan being his real name – is a 46-year-old Palestinian who was cast because of his ‘typical features’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>) by the Swiss communication agency, Publicis, and that the campaign was outsourced to APG to conceive and design it. According to the agency, Hasan was chosen for his ‘authenticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>). A local newspaper reported:<disp-quote>
<p>Given his lack of profile as an agency model, it is really possible to tell a story of a self-made man … The fact that Hasan studied machinery engineering and CNC-grinding and does not know a thing about döner kebabs is not important. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>; authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eventually, this image of authenticity was even reappropriated by Hasan himself:<disp-quote>
<p>They all call him Ali and it is all right with Hasan. Ali has become a little bit of Hasan, and Hasan can identify himself with Ali. He sees in him a symbol of integration, an example for the cohabitation of cultures in Switzerland. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>; authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once again, in this discourse, embracing one’s authenticity seems to be understood as key to ‘successful’ integration in Swiss society, or at least to peaceful ‘cohabitation of cultures’. In fact, Hasan represents the example of the foreigner who has been able to reproduce and market his authenticity to gain economic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413476010">Brusa, 2009</xref>). In doing so, he reproduces and perpetuates the dichotomy between the authentic other and the dominant culture.</p>
<p>In sum, although the images of authenticity conveyed in the Ali Kebab campaign can seem harmless and even a positive sign of integration, they participate in othering the Muslim difference in two ways. First, by projecting the image of what is meant by successful economic integration, Turks are invited to reappropriate this image to be able to acquire economic capital quickly. Yet, in so doing it also limits substantially their possibility of acquiring symbolic capital, as they remain enclosed in the category of the authentic other, symbolised by a series of denotative signifiers that make reference to their foreignness, exoticism and circumscribed economic success. This othering fails to recognise the entire spectrum of differences offered to a subject to represent and reimagine their identity, whether in terms of class, gender, political orientation, religious belonging and so on. Second, this process of categorisation allows the foreign other to be located, defined and regulated. This is why the fact that Ali is portrayed with his ‘ethnic’ characteristics – through symbols such as the fez and the kebab – is not considered problematic, as it makes him distinguishable. It is a way of locating and defining him as different. His success depends on his difference and his ability not to blur categories. Therefore, one could argue that Ali’s identity remains entirely controlled by the dominant culture, inasmuch as he is subjected to its projection of what the good exotic other should be. In other words, Ali is the dominant culture’s object.</p>

<title>Field structure of the campaign: tapping into a colonial repertoire</title>
<p>The Ali Kebab campaign unravels an interesting facet of the relationship between Switzerland and foreignness. Indeed, while the Swiss public was intrigued by the campaign in itself, it triggered little self-reflection on whether it could create uneasiness among individuals of Turkish descent or of Muslim faith, or perhaps project discriminatory traits or at least stereotypes on that population. Whereas this type of campaign would likely have triggered debate in North American societies, where there is a greater tradition of awareness of cultural discrimination,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367549413476010">8</xref></sup> the Swiss public space remained very quiet about it. This is representative of a longer tradition of unreflexiveness over images of the foreign other: images that have existed in Swiss culture long before some of those foreigners were physically present, and which have participated in strengthening the rather weak national identity of the multicultural polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413476010">Bendix, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367549413476010">9</xref></sup> It is precisely because these images have been entrenched in Swiss memory and have perpetuated themselves throughout time that they have been considered by many to be harmless: ‘they have in fact become signifiers no longer invoking the signified image’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413476010">Bendix, 1993</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the few reflexive comments on this campaign were found mainly on a few French and Swiss blogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549413476010">Anonymous, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549413476010">Opoix, 2009</xref>), such as a Swiss feminist blog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549413476010">Martin, 2009</xref>), where people noticed a strange and almost disturbing similarity between the Ali Kebab campaign and the Y’a Bon Banania advertisement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1367549413476010">10</xref></sup> The Y’a Bon advertisement for a cocoa-based drink – which showcased a Senegalese infantryman in the service of the French colonial empire drinking cocoa – was very popular in France throughout the 20th century, but began to be criticised in the 1970s for its colonial connotations. Indeed, it was argued that the advert reinforced colonial stereotypes of the nice and smiling, but ‘stupid’ and ‘childlike’ African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549413476010">Berliner, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1367549413476010">11</xref></sup> Observers stressed that Ali displayed a similar wide smile and jolly face, a red fez and that the same yellow background was used in both adverts – denotative signifiers that draw on this precise colonial imaginary. In fact, one can inscribe the figure of Ali easily within a wider field of connotations related to the ‘oriental’ other who, in this specific case, corresponds to the ‘good’, ‘non-threatening’ and ‘inferior’ colonial subjects that stays within the space that has been assigned to them by the dominant culture. In a sense, the Ali advert draws on an imaginary that not only confirms the superiority of the self vis-à-vis the other,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1367549413476010">12</xref></sup> but also (de)limits the self’s ability to tap into other repertoires that would offer a wider spectrum of possibilities to reimagine and represent its own identity.</p>
<p>Remembrance of these colonial tropes and resonance with social discourses beyond the Swiss context are even stronger when one places the Ali Kebab campaign within the larger visual landscape that dominated the Swiss public sphere over summer 2009. The campaign was launched around the same time as the political campaign by the far-Right Swiss political party SVP on the referendum to ban minarets. This latter campaign also showcased images of the foreign, yet this time these were negative images of the foreign symbolised by a woman wearing a <italic>niqab</italic> (a veil covering the entire body of the wearer, except for her eyes), standing in the forefront of a Swiss flag pierced by missile-like minarets. The denotative signifiers of this campaign make reference to a social discourse, where the foreigner is constructed as a threat to Switzerland symbolic capital as a country defending freedom and women’s rights. The fact that a woman is used as the key figure to represent this reality is far from being trivial. This image inscribes itself in a larger context of significations that recalls the centrality of ‘the woman question’ in the encounter between the West and the Muslim world, where ‘unveiling’ has come to be associated with modernity and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549413476010">Najmabadi, 2006</xref>). The veil became a central focus of attention for colonial and modernists’ projects, as its removal symbolised their ability to penetrate the intimate life of women, understood as the carriers of traditions, and to transform Muslim culture from within – ensuring the dominance and superiority of one moral project over the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549413476010">Ahmed, 1992</xref>). This colonial legacy is conveyed in the posters of the political campaign, as they make allusion to the need to save, transform and control Muslim women – in this case, through bans on minarets, perceived as a direct symbol of political Islam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549413476010">Kein Minarett, 2009</xref>) – from a patriarchal, archaic and anti-democratic moral project.</p>
<p>Because the process of authenticity works in a dialogical manner, the comfortable and safe position in which it sets the other echoes the ways in which a similar stability and safety is reached for the identity of the self (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549413476010">Guillaume, 2011</xref>). This safety stems precisely from powerful production and delimitation of the reassuring boundaries of the other, whether the other is a friendly face or a threatening shadow. Accordingly, Ali’s social integration echoes the constitution of an image of Switzerland as a harbour of tolerance of difference, as a place where anyone can be integrated and succeed economically, as long as they do ‘their’ job and stay in ‘their’ place. Not unlike the situations depicted in the 1979 Swiss comedy film <italic>Die Schweizer Macher</italic> (<italic>The Swissmakers</italic>, 1979), in which a series of stereotypical characters – an Italian worker with unionist activities, a German psychiatrist and a Yugoslav dancer – are trying to obtain Swiss citizenship and face the almost daily scrutiny of police inspectors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1367549413476010">13</xref></sup> the figure of Ali tells us something about the role played by political economy in the construction and representation of the Swiss authentic self. Indeed, despite Ali’s apparent economic success, Ali remains a member of a ‘popular’ class without the symbolic capital that would enable him to move up socially and integrate in the Swiss <italic>political</italic> community: a capital that is based strongly on natural ties with this political community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549413476010">Studer, 2001</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413476010">Caglar, 1995</xref> for a similar argument about Turks in Germany). Thus, such capital is culturally attached to the natural members of the Swiss political community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549413476010">Wessendorf, 2008</xref>): members who do not have to limit themselves to deploying their capabilities in niche economies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the other is a figure of the security and safety of a position which does not have to rely on the self’s own contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549413476010">Connolly, 2002[1991]</xref>). Here, defining difference as an other becomes more than a temptation, as ‘it typically moves below the threshold of conscious reflection and because every attempt to come to terms with it encounters stubborn obstacles built into the logic of identity and the structural imperatives of social organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549413476010">Connolly, 2002[1991]</xref>: 9). Accordingly, the political economy represented in the Ali Kebab adverts depicts an imaginary where foreign figures are facing the impossibility to represent authentic, i.e. credible, political actors, and thus cannot be considered to be ‘genuine’ Swiss voices. The parallel between the Ali Kebab campaign and the SVP one confirms this <italic>necessity</italic> (and not the mere temptation) of locating difference in the other when constructing and [re]producing the boundaries of the Swiss authentic self. The campaign makes reference to the historical role given to gender in the articulation of Swiss nationality and citizenship, where gender has been understood as a ‘symbolic boundary between a [masculine] nationality that [is] stable and permanent, thus grounded in loyalty, and one that [is] inherently unstable [i.e. a feminine one]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549413476010">Studer, 2001</xref>: 647). While Ali cannot speak of or by himself, as he does not possess the type of capital to belong to the political community, the veiled woman in the SVP poster has to be spoken for: she represents Muslims’ potential lack of loyalty and instability to the stable and permanent fixtures of the Swiss political community. This reference to stability, permanency and democracy is reiterated through the images of the Swiss flag (on the poster) and Mount Cervin (on the logo), both threatened from within by Islam (Mount Cervin is literally pierced from within by a minaret).</p>
<p>Finally, while these two adverts make reference to different repertoires in their reproduction of the Swiss self, both locate the foreign other (e.g. Ali and the veiled woman) on a different temporality than the self, which finds its roots in colonialism where foreign populations were denied coevalness of time, and therefore are marked by a constant need for progress to reach an undefined status of modernity (a status that has been reached by the self) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549413476010">Fabian, 1983</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1367549413476010">14</xref></sup> This contrast allows the imaginary of the self to be inscribed in a modern and tangible particular conception of time that is unattainable by the other. Put differently, what this suggests is not only the exclusive strand of the political imaginary of Switzerland, but its inability to go beyond a discourse about authentic selves that ends up ensnaring both the dominant political community and social groups deemed external to it, in a political situatedness that denies any possibility for coevalness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our view, the analysis of the Ali Kebab campaign is relevant in two respects. First, this article shows how using a visual framework of analysis can be useful to explore an image both in its generic structure and to recontextualise it within a wider field of signification. This seems important, as it unravels how an image which, at first glance, might be understood as being particular to a specific context, resonates with wider social discourses. In our case, this approach helped us shed light on how the categories of authenticity of the foreign and the self are articulated, and to draw on a deep and powerful colonial imaginary that goes beyond the borders of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Second, we explored how a campaign such as Ali Kebab can serve as a window to think in more general terms about the concept of authenticity. Grounding our reading of this notion in the discourse of Orientalism allowed us to understand it as a dialogical process. As such, our analysis was guided by a need to explore how the authenticity given to the foreign [Muslim] other was a factor in closing off or opening up the other’s ability to participate politically in a polity. Thinking of authenticity in these terms discloses the power dynamics around which this concept is grounded. Even if advertising campaigns such as Ali Kebab appear to be harmless, they participate in a process where the dominant culture is constantly involved in the action of defining, delimiting and ultimately speaking for an ‘authentic’ other. This not only tells us something about the possibilities available to the other to represent themselves, but also how those are interlinked with the stability, safety and comfort of the ‘authentic’ self.</p>
<p>Unravelling this power dynamic opens the door to a whole set of new conundrums with respect to individuals who wish to escape this ensnarement in the ‘authentic’ category. An option that seems to have become increasingly popular across European states, even in traditionally multicultural ones, is to invite individuals to assimilate: that is, to detach themselves from their culturally positioned identity in order to become identical to the equally phantasmagorical authentic self. This route is well summarised by the chief of police in <italic>Die Schweizer Macher</italic>: ‘We believe that assimilation has been achieved when a foreigner resident here is indistinguishable from the rest of us’ (authors’ translation). However, so doing not only reproduces the category of authenticity as self, but comforts it in its position of superiority.</p>
<p>An alternative route would be to try to articulate one’s position beyond both categories, yet the possibilities to do so successfully seem to be limited. Not surprisingly, individuals who have tried to embark on that path have often been subjected to active scrutiny aiming at pushing them back into safe authentic categories. The case of Ilhem Moussaid – a young woman member of the new anti-capitalist French party (Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste, NPA) who identified herself as being a ‘secularist, feminist and anti-capitalist’ (Moussaid, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549413476010">Alemagna, 2010</xref>) and who presented herself at the 2010 regional election with her headscarf – is a case in point. Accordingly, her decision to run as a candidate became the prime subject of conversation, debate and criticism among French journalists, intellectuals, politicians and even members of her own political party. While members of the Socialist Party argued that a candidate wearing a headscarf would not be accepted on their list, as expressions of religious belief belonged to the private realm, members of the French Right considered that the young girl had been instrumentalised by her own party, lacking the wisdom and autonomy to be an independent subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367549413476010">Zappi, 2010</xref>). In such a cacophony, in a strangely similar way to Said’s description of Flaubert’s encounter with the Egyptian courtesan, Ilhem’s voice was almost inaudible. In fact, when reference was made to her speech, it was as proof of her illogical subjectivity and irrationality. Her headscarf was sufficient, from the outset, for the dominant group to ‘represent her emotions, presence or history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549413476010">Said, 1979</xref>: 6), to delimit her identity and push her back into a well-defined category of authenticity. While these reactions are a direct product of the interrelation between the stability of the authentic other and the safety of the authentic self, in our opinion they also point to a need to study further the problem of instability and danger created for the dominant culture by the ‘inauthentic’ self present within the authentic other – if only to evaluate better the thinness of the dominant culture’s imaginary.</p>

<p>Even though Muslims in Switzerland, as well as in other countries, do not represent a homogenous social group, various survey and analysis have shown that Swiss citizens do not differentiate between Muslims (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549413476010">Helbling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549413476010">Mayer, 2011</xref>). In fact, scholars have noted a shift in how European states, policymakers, the media and other actors have identified immigrants. While they were identified in the 1980s and 1990s in terms of their ethnicity, this changed in the late 1990s, where the main marker of identity became the religion of their country of origin (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549413476010">Allievi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549413476010">Knippenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549413476010">Lépinard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549413476010">Yukleyen, 2010</xref>). This shift was accentuated after 9/11: ‘The Rushdie affair and the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 functioned as catalysts. Moroccan, Turks and other immigrants were “discovered” as Muslims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549413476010">Knippenberg, 2005</xref>: 103). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549413476010">Mayer (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549413476010">Behloul (2009)</xref> observe, this was also the case in Switzerland, where immigrants have been increasingly identified through their religion. For these reasons we connect forms of representation that are obviously linked to the Turks to more general forms linked to Muslims and Islam.</p>

With their anthropological and naturalist undertakings, they helped constitute a referent to which the country and its population came to understand themselves in comparison to the colonised other: ‘In both private and public spaces, the picture of the dark continent served as a foil against which the Swiss could measure the evolution of their own society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549413476010">Harries, 2007</xref>: 4).</p>

<p>Authenticity is not only an ascribed category from ‘outside’ of the social group, but also can become a self-ascribed category from ‘within’ the non-dominant social group. Some specific voices within a social group might take on the lead to define socially and politically how authentic a member of this group is in order to (de)legitimise their voice, not only within the social group but also outside of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549413476010">Salvatore, 2004</xref>). To offer an example in line with our case, contemporary hegemonic Islamist discourses have delimited what an authentic Islamist discourse is supposed to be by rejecting forms of critical approaches to Islam, which have been identified as ‘western’ thoughts; whereas ‘true’ Islam has been constructed as non-western or even anti-western (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549413476010">Mandaville, 2004[2001]</xref>).</p>

<p>It is relevant to stress that unlike other European countries, such as France or the UK, where claims have focused on issues of political representation or economic and social discrimination, Swiss Muslim community leaders usually have circumscribed their requests for civil liberties in relation to the ability of community members to practise Islamic faith, or to claims of public recognition for their associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549413476010">Gianni, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that for APG, the campaign did not showcase signs of foreigness or racism. Indeed, according to their Head of Marketing and Acquisition, Beat Holenstein: ‘Kebab sellers are now part of our [i.e. Swiss] culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549413476010">SWR, 2009</xref>; authors’ translation). Yet, as one can see from our analysis, the kebab seller is still set in a register of foreigness that indicates a certain conception of what is authentic in being a kebab seller. For example, an <italic>armailli</italic> – a typical Swiss alpine shepherd – would not have been considered authentic enough to be a kebab seller.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413476010">Bendix (1993)</xref> stresses that in the USA, due to the civil rights movement, a majority of the population are aware of the possible negative stereotypes carried by cultural, racial and ethnic designations. However, this is not the case in many European countries, including Switzerland, which have a weak tradition of social activism on those issues. She explains how these images of the foreign might even be more entrenched in the Swiss context than in other European settings, due in part to Switzerland’s multicultural character, which needs to find elements to strengthen its sense of national cohesion.</p>

<p>Bendix highlights that: ‘“To be jealous like a Turk”, “smoke like a Turk” or “be clever like a Turk” are among common proverbial phrases that have established themselves in Swiss dialect since the first reports about the Ottoman conquerors in the twelfth and thirteenth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413476010">1993</xref>: 15).</p>

<p>Banania is a drink that was created in the early 1900s, and was known for being made of two colonial products (bananas and chocolate). In 1915, the symbol of Banania became a Senegalese infantryman. Although his features changed over time, he remained the icon, until today, of the brand, recognisable by his unchangeable red fez and wide smile (for a picture see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L’ami_Y’a_bon">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L’ami_Y’a_bon</ext-link>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that critics have argued that the expression ‘Y’a Bon’ made reference to Africans’ inability to speak French correctly (they spoke ‘le petit nègre’, a pidgin version of French considered to be highly simplified).</p>
