<abstract>
<p>This research investigated peer acceptance of children with language and communication impairments attending a language resource base attached to a mainstream school. Compared to other children in their mainstream peer groups, peer acceptance was poor. Peer rejection was more common for children with profiles consistent with an autistic spectrum disorder than for children with specific language impairment, and peer acceptance was significantly associated with social communication abilities. Children with clearer speech and more mature syntax also had more positive peer relationships. Language and communication appeared to be more important for peer acceptance than classroom behaviour. Changing children’s principal placements from the language resource base to the mainstream classes had some beneficial effect; peer rejection was reduced and most children were more tolerated.</p>

<title>1 Background</title>
<p>Successful integration of children with disabilities into mainstream classes depends on peer acceptance and on positive interactions between the children and their classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659011419234">Lewis, 1995</xref>). Children with poor peer relationships are more likely to develop behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659011419234">Criss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659011419234">Deater-Deckard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659011419234">Hay et al., 2004</xref>). Children with language and communication difficulties may be more vulnerable to peer rejection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659011419234">Gertner et al., 1994</xref>), and more likely to experience victimization or bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659011419234">Luciano and Savage, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659011419234">Savage, 2005</xref>). However, this may not apply to every child with specific language impairment (SLI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419234">Fujiki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659011419234">Savage, 2005</xref>). Consequences of poor peer interaction can be lower self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659011419234">Jerome et al., 2002</xref>) and social withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419234">Coster et al., 1999</xref>). Longer term, early language difficulties are associated with poor quality friendships and social difficulties in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659011419234">Botting and Conti-Ramsden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659011419234">Durkin and Conti-Ramsden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265659011419234">Snowling et al., 2006</xref>). These often continue into adult life, with an increased risk of mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659011419234">Clegg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265659011419234">Whitehouse et al., 2009</xref>). Fostering peer relationships in primary school could be one way to support the social and emotional development of children with language and communication impairments.</p>
<p>Language difficulties feature in many developmental conditions but around 6% of all children have specific language impairments (SLI) that are not attributable to other neurological or psychiatric diagnoses, low IQ, or to hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659011419234">Law et al., 1998</xref>). Historically, in the UK, such children received no specialized education but, by the time of their survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2000)</xref> estimated that 20% – probably those with the most severe impairments – were being educated in residential schools or in a growing number of specialized language units attached to mainstream schools. The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659011419234">Department of Education and Skills, 2001</xref>) gave local education authorities the responsibility to meet the speech and language therapy needs of children with SLI as well as to provide appropriate education. One way this has been achieved has been to provide language resource bases (LRBs) attached to mainstream schools, staffed by specialist teachers, with a paediatric speech and language therapist (SLT) visiting for at least part of each week. Although LRB places were intended for children meeting diagnostic criteria for SLI, increasingly LRBs contain some children with more severe and complex difficulties, including children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) who may have more diverse social and educational needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659011419234">Archibald and Gathercole, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this education model, there is scope for children’s social experiences to vary. The LRB may provide the registration base and principal placement that children leave to join a mainstream class for specific activities. Alternatively, the mainstream classroom may provide the principal placement from which children are withdrawn for specialist literacy teaching and one-to-one and group speech and language therapy. These variations provide different school experiences for the children with language and communication difficulties, but they may also afford differing perceptions of them by other children. For example, mainstream classmates might have more positive perceptions of children present at registration and for other activities than of children registered in the LRB who join for selected activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0265659011419234">
<title>2 Outline of study</title>
<p>The present study investigated peer acceptance of children in one mainstream primary school in the context of reorganizing the placement arrangements for older children in the LRB (aged from 7 years). The change was motivated by staff concerns that these children had few friends in their mainstream classes, and with the hope that friendship opportunities amongst the children would be increased. Prior to the reorganization, the LRB provided children’s principal placements and each child joined a mainstream class appropriate for chronological age for some activities, including physical education, art, music and drama. After the reorganization, mainstream classes became the children’s registration bases and focus for activities from which they were withdrawn for therapy and small group teaching. The children received the same level of SLT support before and after the reorganization. Peer ratings were gathered across the whole school at the beginning of this process (Time 1), and peer acceptance of children with language and communication impairments was compared to that of other children in the school. Time 1 measures provided a baseline against which to evaluate the effects of the new arrangements at Time 2, once they had become established.</p>
<p>Peer acceptance can be studied using sociometric methods. Children either nominate peers or complete forced choice procedures to rate every child in their peer group in terms of whether they like to play or work with them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011419234">Frederickson and Furnham, 1998</xref>). A formula is applied to the results to decide which children could be described as popular or accepted and which children could be described as rejected or neglected. Rejected children are those with whom the others definitely have no wish to associate. Neglected, or tolerated, children are not popular but other children have no strong negative feelings towards them. In this study, the Like to Play measure (LITOP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011419234">Frederickson and Furnham, 1998</xref>) was used to assess peer preferences of all the children in the school. Like to Work (LITOW) was not assessed because opportunities to work with children from the LRB were constrained by the extent of shared classroom activities. Opportunities increased after the registration changes, making it difficult to make a meaningful comparison of LITOW between Times 1 and 2. The LITOP was administered across the whole school shortly after the reorganization of placements for children from the LRB in Years 3 to 6 (ages 7–11). Peer acceptance of children from the LRB was compared to peer acceptance of all other children.</p>
<p>The study provided the opportunity to investigate whether particular difficulties had a disproportionate effect on peer acceptance, and whether the changed placement arrangements benefited children with some difficulties more than others. Most children registered with the LRB had received a diagnosis of SLI, but some children had difficulties closer to ASD. Pragmatic language impairment, which has a marked effect on children’s social communicative competence, can be considered as a separate diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659011419234">Bishop, 2000</xref>), but many children with SLI share some problems associated with this disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659011419234">Norbury et al., 2004</xref>). Pragmatic language difficulties were expected to have a more negative impact than structural language difficulties or speech problems on peer relationships. The social impairments associated with a diagnosis of ASD are also likely to have an impact on peer acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659011419234">Swaim and Morgan, 2001</xref>). Mainstream class teachers completed the Children’s Communication Checklist, version 2 (CCC2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659011419234">Bishop, 2003</xref>) for children from the LRB. The checklist describes profiles associated with diagnoses of SLI, ASD or autism and identifies children with disproportionate pragmatic language difficulties.</p>
<p>Past research has associated peer rejection with poor behaviour in typically developing children (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011419234">French and Waas, 1985</xref>) and in children with learning difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659011419234">Kistner and Gatlin, 1989</xref>). Many children with language and communication disorders display significant behaviour problems, including internalizing problems such as withdrawn behaviour, or externalizing problems such as aggression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659011419234">Carson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419234">Coster et al., 1999</xref>). It is not straightforward to determine the direction of causality within an association between problem behaviours and peer rejection. However, if children from the LRB do experience peer rejection, it would be important to consider whether this could be associated with problem behaviour before concluding that it was a direct consequence of communication difficulties. Mainstream class teachers completed a Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale – Revised Short Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659011419234">Conners, 1997</xref>) for each child from the LRB and for selected children from each class: The child who most closely matched each LRB child in patterns of peer responses; and the boys and girls in each class with the highest and lowest peer ratings. Behaviour scores for the highest and lowest peer-rated mainstream children were compared to establish whether poor behaviour was a factor in the rejection of mainstream children in the school. The behaviour ratings of the LRB children were compared to those obtained for children with matching peer relationship profiles and to the other comparison groups. Associations between peer acceptance and behaviour measures were investigated in LRB and mainstream groups.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effects of reorganizing placements, the LITOP was readministered at Time 2 when the changes had been in place for two school years for children in Years 4, 5 and 6, and for one school year for children in Year 3. Changes in peer acceptance between Times 1 and 2 were investigated.</p>

<title>II Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0265659011419234">
<title>1 Participants</title>
<p>Two hundred and forty-nine children (125 boys, 124 girls) attending a state primary school on the outskirts of Bristol, UK, took part in the research. The school serves an urban area of mixed privately owned housing and social housing (Ofsted inspection report, July 2008). At Time 1, only four (1.7%) children in the school, none of them from the LRB, received free school meals compared to a national average of 17% in English primary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659011419234">Department of Education, 2010</xref>: Table 3a). Eight classes are provided for children aged 4 to 11 years old in Reception to Year 6. At Time 1, the LRB provided two specialist classes for 18 children with speech and language impairments (12 boys, 6 girls).</p>

<sec id="section7-0265659011419234">
<title>2 Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0265659011419234">
<title>a Peer acceptance</title>
<p>The LITOP was administered, adapting procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011419234">Frederickson and Furnham (1998)</xref> so that children did not have to read the list of peers themselves. Children were interviewed individually about all the same-sex children in their class, including any attached LRB child. Boys and girls within each class were treated as separate peer groups because children in this age range tend to choose same-sex friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419234">Thorne and Luria, 1986</xref>). The LITOP requires no spoken responses and so was expected to pose less difficulty to children with speech and/or language disorders than procedures that require children to make verbal responses. The forced choice procedure requires participants to consider every child in their peer group. Children have the option to indicate when a particular child is not well known enough for them to make a decision so that results differentiate between children who are rejected and those who are unfamiliar. As a researcher named each child on the peers’ list, children responded by pointing to one of four disks displayed on a table, featuring:</p>
<list id="list2-0265659011419234" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a smiling face, for children they like;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a frowning face, for children they don’t like;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a neutral face, for children they do not mind; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a question mark: Children were asked to point to a disk featuring a question mark if they did not know a child well enough to decide.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The disks were moved around after each response to reduce the possibility of perseveration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0265659011419234">
<title>b Language and communication</title>
<p>Mainstream class teachers completed the CCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659011419234">Bishop, 2003</xref>) for each LRB child. The checklist consists of 70 statements, each describing a speech, language or social communication behaviour. Respondents indicate the frequency with which each behaviour is observed. Scores provide 10 scales measuring: Speech; syntax; semantics; coherence; inappropriate initiation of conversation; stereotyped language; use of context; nonverbal communication; social relations; and unusual interests. Scale scores contribute to a General Communication Composite (GCC) and a Social Interaction Deviance Composite (SIDC). The GCC provides an index of overall communicative competence and is used in combination with SIDC scores to identify communication profiles indicative of SLI or ASD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0265659011419234">
<title>c Classroom behaviour</title>
<p>At Time 1, mainstream class teachers completed the Teacher Rating Scale-Revised Short Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659011419234">Conners, 1997</xref>) that offers 28 statements describing problem behaviours. Teachers rate the frequency with which a child has manifested each behaviour in the previous month. Responses contribute to four subscales: cognitive problems; oppositional behaviour; hyperactivity; and an index to identify children at risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0265659011419234">
<title>3 Procedures</title>
<p>Ethical approval was provided by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol, and procedures were agreed by the Research and Development office of the North Bristol NHS Trust, which employs the second author. All parents were sent information about the study and given the opportunity to withdraw their child. No parents withheld assent. Peer ratings were obtained as part of the personal, social and health education curriculum during lessons discussing friendship. Four children were absent from school throughout the interview period at Time 1. Their names appeared in the peer group lists so, although they did not provide ratings, they did receive ratings and their results were included in the analyses. Children were interviewed outside the classroom and assured that responses would be treated in confidence. Two weeks after completing the LITOP within their mainstream peer groups, children from the LRB repeated the exercise, treating all children in the LRB as a single peer group. Mainstream class teachers completed the CCC2 and the Conners’ forms for each LRB child in their class and the children selected for comparison groups.</p>
<p>LITOP procedures were repeated towards the end of the following school year (Time 2) for children in Years 3 to 6 only. Peer groups in Years 4, 5 and 6 were essentially the same as those shared at Time 1; children had been together under the new arrangements for nearly two school years. The Year 3 class brought together children from two Year 2 classes, so some children had spent just one school year together under the new arrangements.</p>

<title>III Results</title>
<sec id="section13-0265659011419234">
<title>1 Peer acceptance</title>
<p>The LITOP responses provided and received in each category at Time 1 by each child were summed. First, the frequencies of ‘don’t know well enough’ responses received were inspected. Younger children more commonly made this decision. Twenty-seven children from Reception or Year 1 reported one or more children in their peer group to be not known well enough to decide but only 12 children across Years 2 to 6 made this claim. Given the status of the LRB children within the mainstream classes, it was anticipated that they would provide and receive a higher proportion of ‘don’t know well enough’ responses than other children. However, this was not the case; about one third of the children in both groups received at least one ‘don’t know’ response: 77/231 mainstream children and 5/18 LRB children, χ<sup>2</sup> = .24, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>
<p>Different peer group sizes (<italic>n</italic>s = 10 to 20), ‘don’t know well enough’ responses, and the absence of four children constrained the number of responses in the other three categories that each child could receive. To account for this, the potential number of responses to each child was calculated as:</p>

<p>Although peer responses were normally distributed across the LRB group, this was not the case with the mainstream group. Non-parametric statistics have therefore been reported.

<p>Following the formula described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011419234">Frederickson and Furnham (1998)</xref>, children were classified in terms of peer acceptance. If more than 50% of the responses to a child were positive, the child was classified as popular or accepted. If more than 50% of the responses were negative, the child was classified as rejected. If more than 50% were neutral, the child was classified as tolerated. Children that received no clear predominant response were described as controversial. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265659011419234">Table 2</xref> shows the number of children from each group in each peer category.

Eight children described one member of the peer group as not well known enough to them to make a decision.

<p>CCC2 forms were completed for 15 children from the LRB; forms were unavailable for three children not speaking in sentences, a pre-condition of CCC2.

<title>1 Peer acceptance of children with language and communication difficulties</title>
<p>This study investigated the peer relationships of children with language and communication difficulties in the context of reorganizing the placements of children in Years 3 to 6 of a mainstream primary school. Change was prompted by staff concerns that children in the LRB felt that they had no friends in the mainstream classrooms. Time 1 peer ratings across the school confirmed that this was rather the case for many children. Although 2/18 (11%) children from the LRB were categorized as popular, three children were rejected by most peers and the remainder were either tolerated or were categorized as controversial. This was in contrast to the picture for mainstream children where 58% were popular within their peer groups. These findings reflect previous research suggesting poor peer acceptance of children with SLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659011419234">Savage, 2005</xref>). However, in common with previous studies of children in similar settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419234">Fujiki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659011419234">Savage, 2005</xref>), there were individual differences in peer acceptance among the children, suggesting that it is not simply the fact of their belonging to the LRB that leads to peer rejection. Our research also investigated whether variation in children’s language and social communication abilities and/or behaviour difficulties was associated with individual differences in peer acceptance.</p>

<title>2 Associations between peer acceptance and language and communication abilities</title>
<p>One rationale for the development of the CCC2 had been to measure aspects of communication that are not easy to evaluate in clinical assessments. Its focus on the social use of language suggested that it should be sensitive to behaviours that could influence other children’s perception of the children from the LRB as potential friends. The significant correlation between the SIDC, an index of social communication abilities, and the proportion of negative peer ratings received suggested that this was the case. It is interesting to note that children’s rejection of their classmates corresponds to adults’ ratings of communication abilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419234">Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2004)</xref> also reported an association between the pragmatic language composite provided by the Children’s Communication Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659011419234">Bishop, 1998</xref>) and social outcomes for adolescents with SLI.</p>

<title>3 Peer acceptance and classroom behaviour</title>
<p>As in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011419234">French and Waas, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659011419234">Kistner and Gatlin, 1989</xref>), peer rejection of mainstream children was significantly associated with behaviour difficulties. The behaviour scores of children from the LRB did not differ significantly from the scores of rejected mainstream classmates or from those of mainstream children with matched levels of peer acceptance. However, unlike the results for the mainstream group, there were no significant correlations between behaviour scores and peer acceptance measures for the LRB group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659011419234">Laws et al. (1996)</xref> reported similar results in an investigation of peer acceptance of children with Down syndrome in mainstream classrooms. These children had severe teacher-rated behaviour difficulties but these did not appear to cause rejection by their classmates even though typically developing children with behaviour difficulties in the study were rejected by peers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0265659011419234">
<title>4 Changes in peer acceptance</title>
<p>To investigate whether the change in placements had been positive for eight children in Years 3 to 6, peer acceptance was re-evaluated at Time 2. As a group, the children received a significantly lower mean proportion of negative ratings than received at Time 1 but there were no other statistically significant changes. Individual differences in the picture of peer relationships suggested that these had improved for some children. Although none was categorized as popular at Times 1 or 2, four children received positive peer ratings from four to six mainstream classmates at Time 2, suggesting that these children were not friendless and lonely. However, two children – one with a CCC2 profile consistent with SLI and one with a profile consistent with ASD – were not selected for play by any mainstream classmates. On an optimistic note, all but one child received a smaller proportion of negative peer ratings at Time 2 than they had received at Time 1. Alongside increases in neutral ratings, this suggested a trend for children to become less rejected and more tolerated by their mainstream classmates, even if they could not be described as popular.</p>
<p>At Time 1, children with CCC2 profiles consistent with ASD were less accepted by peers than those with profiles consistent with SLI. However, the three children with ASD profiles studied at Time 2 received fewer negative peer ratings, and two of them received more positive ratings. Although no conclusions can be drawn from such a small sample, it would be interesting to understand the reasons for this change. Our hypothesis had been that closer integration would change the perceptions of mainstream classmates, but an alternative possibility could be that greater contact with mainstream role models could alter the social behaviours of the LRB children in ways that make them more acceptable as playmates. Unfortunately, the CCC2 was not readministered at Time 2 so it was not possible to judge whether there had been changes in children’s social communication behaviours.</p>
<p>Children’s peer relationships within the LRB were assessed at Times 1 and 2 treating boys and girls of all ages as a single peer grouping. Despite this combination, all children enjoyed positive peer relationships within the LRB and it is worth noting that these continued at Time 2 even though children were spending more time in their mainstream classes.</p>

<title>V Conclusions</title>
<p>Most children with language and communication difficulties experienced more peer rejection than mainstream classmates. Peer acceptance was associated with severity of children’s language and social communication difficulties. However, unlike the situation for mainstream children, peer acceptance was not associated with behaviour difficulties, including symptoms of ADHD, in children from the LRB.</p>
<p>The main motivation for this study had been to evaluate the effects of changing the registration arrangements for eight children in Years 3 to 6. The Time 2 study showed less overall peer rejection although there was no statistically significant increase in popularity. Individual differences were important; most children, notably two girls with communication profiles consistent with ASD, received more positive peer ratings after the reorganization, but two children (one with SLI and one with ASD) remained unselected as playmates. Further research would be necessary before conclusions could be drawn about the reasons for improvements in peer acceptance.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study was that it involved a small number of children: the older individuals in the LRB attached to just one mainstream school. It would be important to understand whether the encouraging results in reducing peer rejection would generalize to younger children, and to children in LRBs attached to schools in areas of greater deprivation. One strength of the study was that it allowed us to investigate the effect of the structural change under reasonably controlled conditions, involving the same groups of children, within the same school environment, at a time where no other intervention to improve peer acceptance was underway that could have confounded results. That said, it would be of interest to investigate whether additional whole-school interventions to increase mainstream children’s knowledge and understanding of language and communication difficulties as well as therapies to improve the social communication skills of children from the LRB could further improve peer acceptance within the school.</p>
<p>Recent, informal interviews with individual children suggest that they are happier being included in mainstream classes and have developed new friendships with mainstream peers. More formal qualitative research involving mainstream and LRB children could better inform the work of speech and language therapists and education staff in developing effective approaches to successful integration of children with speech, language and communication difficulties. For LRB children and their parents, greater social acceptance and children’s self-esteem may be of equal importance to progress with speech and language development. The challenge facing speech and language therapists and teachers is to provide the best academic and speech/language outcomes for these children, whilst giving them every opportunity to develop normal peer relationships and maintain healthy self-esteem. Providing closer membership of mainstream classes could contribute to achieving these goals.</p>
