<p>Surgical safety is a consistent hot topic in the medical literature as well as the popular press. Having recently attended both the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Annual Meeting and the American Heart Association Scientific Session, there was a consistent theme revolving around improvement in patient safety for a variety of settings. Atwul Gawande gave the opening session at the ASA and discussed his view from the surgeon’s perspective on improving patient safety. He has written multiple articles on this subject and published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, reporting on improvement in outcomes following institution of the Safety Checklist in the operating room.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253211435707">1</xref></sup> Gawande is a proponent of medical professionals, realizing that continued work to improve both individual and team skills in the medical environment is critical to improving patient safety and that this process requires lifelong learning skills. I believe that one of the key aspects of success in a safety checklist approach is formalization of communication among various team members from a wide range of medical backgrounds. Failure of consistent and open communication remains one of the main preventable causes in many patient safety scenarios. One of the goals I set forth for the <italic>Seminars in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia</italic> (<italic>SCVA</italic>) last year was to present topics in a multidisciplinary format, in an effort to introduce topic matter from a wide range of viewpoints. I believe that as we educate ourselves about our own specialty topics in combination with the key aspects of those specialties we work closely with (ICU, surgery, cardiology, etc), our ability to communicate with the larger medical team will improve, leading to reduction in communication-based errors.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this edition of <italic>SCVA</italic> presents a continuation of the topic of minimally invasive techniques in cardiac surgery. As technology advances and our ability grows to surgically treat complex lesions through smaller and smaller incisions, our reliance on the surgical team as a well-functioning unit increases. To start this series, I invited Dr Denton Cooley to author a historic perspective on the evolution of cardiac and aortic surgery—which is a great account of his personal experience and contributions over his career. There are also 3 well-written review articles focusing on the surgical and anesthetic concerns regarding minimally invasive mitral and aortic surgery. The first article discusses surgical and anesthetic management for minimally invasive mitral valve repair. Regarding aortic valve surgery, we have 2 reviews exploring this topic. One covers the surgical approach to minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, whereas the second explores the anesthetic management for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. To complete this discussion, we have a case series–based review exploring the use of aortic valve conduits as an alternative approach to managing severe aortic valve disease in the setting of concomitant aortic disease precluding standard cardiopulmonary bypass (ie, porcelain aorta). Finally, in our Educational Forum, there is an article exploring the impact of regional techniques for the brachial plexus with regard to pulmonary function in patients with severe respiratory disease.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome our newest associate editor to the <italic>SCVA</italic>, Dr Miklos Kertai. Dr Kertai is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist at Duke University Medical Center. He has been involved extensively in perioperative outcomes research focusing on perioperative and long-term cardiac risk assessment and management, genomics and perioperative cardiac risk profiling, and perioperative pharmacogenomics. Dr Kertai will be primarily responsible for the cardiac anesthesiology–based research and review articles coming through the <italic>SCVA</italic> and will add a great deal of insight into the concept of a perioperative approach to anesthesiology.</p>
