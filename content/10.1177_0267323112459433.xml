<abstract>
<p>This article studies trends in gender inequality in the domain of fiction books between 1960 and 2009 in France, Germany and the United States by analysing bestseller lists and literary award winners. It is argued that gender inequality is larger in fields or genres where more status is at stake for individual agents, as this causes an influx of men who then ‘edge’ women out of the field. The study finds evidence for this mechanism, as the presence of female authors in bestseller lists (exponent of the popular culture system) is larger than that among literary award winners (highbrow culture system) in all three countries. Cross-national differences are consistent (US smallest inequality, France largest), emphasizing the importance of field characteristics in explaining social inequalities in cultural production.</p>

<p>Becoming successful in culture and entertainment is notoriously difficult because of the ‘infinite variety’ of the supply, fast-evolving criteria and tastes among experts and consumers, and, subsequently, uncertain demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323112459433">Caves, 2000</xref>). This seems to apply both to artistic or symbolic forms of success – e.g. critical acclaim, being consecrated by critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112459433">Allen and Lincoln, 2004</xref>) – and commercial forms of success – e.g. charting in bestseller lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323112459433">Dowd, 2004</xref>). Institutional agents involved in cultural production often claim to make rational, empiricism-based or experience-based decisions, even though these are merely rhetorical strategies to manage uncertainty and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1994</xref>). What is more, lack of clear-cut rules or guidelines on how to achieve objectives also appears to facilitate biases and inequalities to enter the field. Social inequalities along lines of class, gender and ethnicity have been found throughout the fields of cultural and media production; resembling those in broader society and negatively affecting access, work conditions and success of artists within cultural fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323112459433">Hesmondhalgh, 2007</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>This article focuses on gender inequality in the field of book publishing – or, in broader terms, the literary field – and addresses three issues. First, we aim to map how gender inequality has evolved over time. In the past decades, western societies not only have become more aware of gender discrimination, but also encouraged social movements and issued policies to decrease the gap between men and women (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323112459433">Hausmann et al., 2010</xref>). The extent to which this trend is reflected in the domain of culture is, as far as we know, not often examined (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323112459433">Dowd et al., 2005</xref>). Second, we contribute to the explanation of gender inequality by differentiating between two forms of success. While commercial success as indicated by entries in bestseller lists is our central object of analysis, this will be compared to artistic success by winning literary awards. This differentiation can be traced back to the classic – albeit maybe eroding – distinction between the ‘popular culture system’ and the ‘highbrow culture system’ of cultural classification (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323112459433">DiMaggio, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323112459433">Hesmondhalgh, 2006</xref>). Cultural classification systems can be described as the norms and practices applied to interpret, classify and value cultural products in a particular society. In general, the highbrow culture classification system tends to emphasize symbolic aspects of value attribution, whereas the popular culture classification system has traditionally focused more on material success (popularity). This article argues that it is particularly the social status that such classifications generate for both the classified (e.g. artists, genres) and the classifiers (e.g. producers, media) which results in social inequalities within these systems.</p>
<p>Third, we introduce a cross-national perspective to account for as well as clarify the impact of contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267323112459433">Livingstone, 2003</xref>). Most previous research on gender inequality in the cultural industries addresses the United States or the United Kingdom. Comparing the US with France and Germany not only details gender trends beyond the Anglo-Saxon language area, but also offers the opportunity to assess the ‘universality’ – or lack thereof – of the mechanisms affecting gender inequality. Recent cross-national comparisons in cultural production have found that country differences often emanate from field characteristics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323112459433">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267323112459433">Kuipers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267323112459433">Lizardo and Skiles, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The data in our analysis are the complete corpus of authors listed in bestseller lists of (new) fiction books and the winners of the most prestigious literary awards from all three countries for the period 1960–2009. Bestseller lists signal which authors are popular and through weekly publication in the media, transmit such popularity ratings to audiences, publishers, booksellers and other institutional actors in the field of book production. Arguably, these lists do not necessarily supply sales measurements of scientific validity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267323112459433">Miller, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless the media industries increasingly rely on these lists when they decide upon product development, release schedules, marketing and promotion, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112459433">Anand and Peterson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323112459433">Caves, 2000</xref>). Conversely, literary awards are among the most prestigious vehicles of the highbrow culture system as they express artistic value, are attributed by experts and comprise discrete events which are easily communicated to audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323112459433">English, 2005</xref>). How transformations in the status of popular culture and highbrow culture systems (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459433">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>) affect the position of female authors over time has yet to be examined. Note that our analysis does not offer a strict test of causal relationships at the individual level. Due to the longitudinal and aggregated nature of our data and the difficulty of disentangling the time order of events, the analysis focuses on charting developments in the success of female authors by juxtaposing the aforementioned classification systems on a decade-by-decade basis. Thus, the main objective of the research is to provide insight into long-term trends from a macro-level perspective.</p>
<sec id="section1-0267323112459433">
<title>Gender inequality in the high culture and popular culture field</title>
<p>The systematic marginalization of women in both production and performance practices in the cultural and media industries has been demonstrated extensively in the past decades (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459433">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267323112459433">Ross and Byerly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267323112459433">Van Zoonen, 1994</xref>). This gender gap concerns, for instance, inequalities in income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1996</xref> on film), commercial success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323112459433">Dowd et al., 2005</xref> on pop music), but also artistic prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267323112459433">Showalter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267323112459433">Vos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267323112459433">Women in Publishing, 1987</xref> on fiction books). In a similar vein, the portrayal of women in cultural media products often tends to be highly traditional and stereotypical (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112459433">Bayton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323112459433">Lauzen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267323112459433">Van Zoonen, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender inequality thus seems to be present in various cultural genres and in different manifestations. Nevertheless, social inequalities within fields of cultural and creative production are often patterned via the structure as well as the status of the particular fields or domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267323112459433">Ross and Byerly, 2004</xref>). Many cultural products are collective endeavours, bringing together creative, executive, commercial and other agents in meticulous cooperations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112459433">Becker, 1982</xref>). Cultural fields are, however, also loci for power struggles, as most individual agents continuously strive to increase their own reputation in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323112459433">Bourdieu, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323112459433">Curran, 2000</xref>). By taking part in activities that generate value – whether this concerns symbolic production like writing reviews or membership of award juries, or material production like creating bestsellers – agents can influence the norms they are otherwise subjected to. If particular social groups are not being represented sufficiently in institutional settings, they lack influence, which is then likely to negatively affect their chances of success.</p>
<p>These mechanisms are nonetheless to a large degree mediated by the position or status that a particular genre has in the field, as was demonstrated by the seminal article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267323112459433">Tuchman and Fortin (1984)</xref> on gender inequality in the literary field. Charting the success of novelists in the period 1866–1917, they showed how the rise of the prestige of the novel – trading in its strong association with popular culture to highbrow culture – radically changed the position of female authors. Despite the fact that women dominated the profession of novelists up until then, men were better able to gain key positions and subsequent recognition in this initially ‘empty’ field – thereby ‘edging women out of the literary tradition’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323112459433">1</xref></sup> Male authors, for instance, more often engaged in writing non-fiction (e.g. reviews, essays), judging manuscripts for publishers and editing journals, which provided them with larger power to consecrate others. While this study concerned 19th-century England, similar processes have been found for artistic success in the mid- and late 20th-century Dutch literary field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267323112459433">Vogel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267323112459433">Vos, 2008</xref>), but also for material success in the American movie and television industry in the late 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459433">1996</xref>). Outside the creative industries, status competition and the masculine field logics this ensues, have been the topic of long-lasting debates on news organizations and journalism at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267323112459433">Ross and Byerly, 2004</xref>). In the cultural field, already upon first selection in the field – e.g. newspaper coverage of recent cultural output – male artists are more likely to be selected than female artists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267323112459433">Schmutz, 2009</xref> for music; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267323112459433">Verboord, 2011</xref> for fiction books). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267323112459433">Schmutz and Faupel (2010)</xref> point out that such differences in recognition are highly correlated with diverging legitimating strategies in the discourse of cultural mediators. While male performers in the pop music canon were predominantly legitimized in terms of a high-arts discourse, for female performers critics emphasized notions of ‘authenticity’ and ‘owing’ success to other established figures in the field.</p>
<p>Gender inequality thus seems stronger when the social status to be gained by institutional agents is perceived to be higher. Arguably this sets off a downward spiral in which genres in which women are dominant in terms of production and consumption – like for example romance fiction – have considerably lower artistic status in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267323112459433">Radway, 1984</xref>). At the same time, popular culture became significantly more legitimate in western societies from the 1950s onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459433">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>). It is increasingly recognized that popular culture plays an important role in the lives of millions – offering social commentary, alternative life perspectives and entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267323112459433">Van Zoonen, 2004</xref>). In terms of cultural classification, differences between highbrow and popular culture are becoming smaller since the association of media and cultural consumption with social exclusion is declining in current western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112459433">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267323112459433">Peterson and Kern, 1996</xref>). So while we expect gender inequality to be smaller in systems of popular culture production than in highbrow culture production, it is likely to decrease over time due to popular culture’s growing legitimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267323112459433">
<title>Cross-national differences</title>
<p>Gender inequality differs significantly across countries, due to arrangements in education and labour market participation, political empowerment and cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323112459433">Hausmann et al., 2010</xref>). This also applies to the countries studied here. Despite all being modern western nations, they rank differently on the global gender gap index 2010: Germany 13th (5th in 2006), the United States 19th (23rd in 2006) and France 46th (70th in 2006). Note that these rank differences are attributed mainly because of smaller political empowerment to women in the latter two countries. No comparative research (that we know of) exists on the representation of women in the literary fields – or even broader cultural industries – in these countries. For the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112459433">Greco et al. (2007)</xref> report a significant growth in female workers in the book publishing industry between 1982 and 2002 – up to 60% of all employment. However, this mainly concerns the clerical area; in executive positions men are still overrepresented. Census occupation data from the 2000s show that although women outnumber men as professional authors and writers (55%), they have consistently smaller median incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267323112459433">NEA, 2008</xref>: 122–123). In France, gender inequalities have been found for almost all artistic professions, including writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323112459433">Coulangeon et al., 2005</xref>). What is more, the literary field seems particularly difficult to enter for female authors because of the persistent stereotyping of the <italic>femme auteur</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267323112459433">Naudier, 2002</xref>). For the German book sector, little information is available. In the early 1970s – in the beginning of the time frame of this article – women are reported to comprise about a quarter of the population of <italic>Schriftstellers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323112459433">Fohrbeck and Wiesand, 1972</xref>: 82).</p>
<p>With little comparative and longitudinal work done previously, can we derive expectations on cross-national differentiation in gender inequality of bestseller list authors from the cultural/literary field perspective? Despite the increasing globalization of cultural production and consumption, countries still show significant differences in how their cultural fields are organized, leading to diverging symbolic and material production practices (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323112459433">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267323112459433">Lamont and Thévenot, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267323112459433">Lizardo and Skiles, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267323112459433">Weber (2000)</xref>, for instance, shows how publishers in France more often draw upon criteria of literary value in their publishing decision process, in contrast to American publishers, who emphasize commercial criteria more overtly. More generally, these two countries are often thought to be cultural counter-poles with regard to how they perceive popular culture and highbrow culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267323112459433">Lamont and Thévenot, 2000</xref>). Due to the historical importance of France in many cultural genres – among them literature – cultural consecration, as described earlier, takes a prominent position within its cultural field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323112459433">Clark, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323112459433">Lamont, 1992</xref>). Governmental policy, which for the past decades has aimed to protect highbrow French culture (<italic>l’exception culturelle</italic> in their own words), has only strengthened this tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267323112459433">Sapiro, 2009</xref>: 288ff.). The US lacks long cultural traditions, but has a history in which entrepreneurship and large-scale production are dominant – also in the cultural domain (e.g. film industry, record industry, book industry) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267323112459433">Moran, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267323112459433">Thompson, 2010</xref>). More than in most European countries, and France in particular, the logic of commerciality is firmly rooted in the US cultural field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323112459433">Clark, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323112459433">Lamont, 1992</xref>). Germany is less often considered in cross-national cultural comparisons. With France it shares a significant literary history, and a relatively strong focus on highbrow culture in, for instance, the school curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323112459433">Bevers, 2005</xref>) and elite newspaper arts coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459433">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>). At the same time, Germany lacks a geographical literary centre (like Paris in France) which confines the nationwide visibility of symbolic value attributions such as literary awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112459433">Anheier and Gerhards, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on this existing research, we expect gender inequality to be the highest in France and the lowest in the United States. In France, cultural classification places most emphasis on highbrow culture and the literary field seems to be relatively difficult to enter – matching observations that women have relatively more difficulty in attaining political empowerment in society at large. Although in the US, female authors still appear to have weaker structural positions in the book market than men, their strong representation in popular culture genres is likely to benefit them in the commercialized American literary field. Germany is expected to hold a position in the middle.</p>

<title>Bestseller lists</title>
<p>The bestseller list data we analyse come from three sources: <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> for Germany, <italic>L’Express</italic> from France and <italic>The New York Times</italic> for the United States. These are the longest running bestseller lists in mainstream media in these countries. We have collected all bestseller lists pertaining to fiction books published in the period 1965–2009 and for the US also for the years 1960–1964.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323112459433">2</xref></sup> While <italic>The New York Times</italic> has published several fiction lists over the years, we restrict ourselves to ‘hardcover fiction’, since these lists contain the books which are published most recently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323112459433">3</xref></sup> It is acknowledged that many popular fiction books have never been published in hardcover editions, which might underestimate the presence of popular fiction authors. However, as we expect American lists to show the lowest gender inequality, it actually makes the test stricter than had we chosen lists of paperback or pocket book editions. Also, it offers the opportunity to observe the consequences of an important transformation in the American publishing sector: the ‘hardcover revolution’ which increased the variety of titles published in hardcover jackets and subsequently the economic relevance of this edition type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267323112459433">Thompson, 2010</xref>: 36–40). From being solely ‘paperback writers’, authors of popular fiction could now compete on a more equivalent basis with ‘literary’ authors by also publishing in hardcover format.</p>
<p>All weekly editions of the aforementioned bestseller lists were retrieved in (electronic) archives and entered into a database.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267323112459433">4</xref></sup> In the French bestseller lists we found 3568 titles of 1837 different authors, in the German lists 1659 titles of 889 authors and in the American lists 3763 titles of 1506 authors.</p>
<p>We retrieved the sex of all authors in our database using both print and online reference works. As much as possible we tried to verify that female names indeed belonged to female persons and male names to male persons by reading biographical texts and inspecting authors’ pictures. In all countries we encountered male–female combinations for a single title which were left out of the analyses (12 in France, 7 in Germany and 14 in the US) as well as missing values due to lack of information (e.g. anonymous authors, edited volumes) (respectively 6, 9 and 7).</p>
<p>All authors listed between 1970 and 2009 were classified into genre categories, based on the oeuvre they have produced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267323112459433">5</xref></sup> For this purpose, again we rely on several reference works and online sources. We distinguish between three categories: (0) literary fiction, consisting of all authors deemed ‘literary’ according to critics’ evaluations, descriptions in reference works, etc.; (1) mainstream fiction, consisting of all authors who were not classified as either ‘literary’ or as one of the ‘popular’ genres (e.g. writers of historical sagas, humorous books, ‘potboilers’, which combine elements of both highbrow and popular genres); and (2) popular fiction, consisting of typical ‘genre’ fiction like thrillers, detectives, romance novels, science fiction and fantasy novels. In the coding process, mainstream fiction was considered the default category. Authors were attributed to the other categories if we found explicit classifications or if book descriptions signalled typical properties associated with either the ‘literary’ or the ‘popular’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0267323112459433">6</xref></sup> If authors published various types of genres during their careers, we choose the genre category present in the bestseller list. We did not find authors who entered the bestseller lists with more than one of the three distinguished categories.</p>

<title>Literary awards</title>
<p>To examine gender inequality in the domain of highbrow culture, we collected data on winners of the most important literary awards in France, Germany and the US between 1960 and 2009. Literary awards are generally considered important acts of symbolic value attribution (or cultural consecration) as they are (a) discrete forms of valorization, (b) attributed by juries often consisting of legitimate institutional experts and (c) publicly awarded to enhance the legitimacy of the consecrating act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323112459433">English, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267323112459433">Street, 2005</xref>). For each country, we selected awards with a national orientation that seemed to be the most prestigious in the field according to reference works. Due to field differences among countries, the number of awards per country varied, as did the number of winners. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0267323112459433">Appendix</xref> gives an overview of all selected awards.</p>

<title>Mapping gender inequality of bestseller list authors</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112459433">Table 1</xref> first presents the percentage of female authors in bestseller lists between 1960 and 2009. In all three countries the proportion of female authors has increased over time, though clear differences exist between countries. Overall, France has the lowest percentage of women in its bestseller lists: in the late 1960s about 17% of all titles are written by a female author and this increases to a percentage slightly over 30% in the 2000s. In the German bestseller lists the share of titles by female authors grows from 24% in the late 1960s to 40% in the 2000s. The American bestseller lists contain the most women: already in the 1960s about a quarter of all listed authors are female, and in the 2000s their share has risen to 47% of all titles. Interestingly, only in the German lists do we observe a steady growth over the decades. In the US, the percentage of women entering the lists seems to slow down in the 1970s and 1980s, before the spurt of the 1990s and 2000s sets in. Looking at the trend line of unique authors (instead of titles) shows a clearer picture: the 1980s already saw more different names of women on the list, yet they tended to chart with fewer titles. In France, the great leap forwards occurs between the 1970s and 1980s. In the latter decade, France is on a par with the other two countries. However, in the 1990s and 2000s the proportion of female writers stagnates.</p>

<p>Is there a difference in the amount of success in the lists between men and women? Examining the number of weeks that men and women stay on the chart does not reveal significant differences. Only in the US, the average number of weeks spent on the list is consistently, but not significantly, larger for men than for women since the 1970s.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323112459433">Table 2</xref> we turn to the comparison with the highbrow culture system of literary awards. Here we have complete information on the 1960s for all three countries at our disposal. At that time, the gender gap in winning awards is almost equally large in France, Germany and the US: only 16–19% of the winners are female. Note that for France this means that women were slightly more successful in the highbrow domain than in the popular (bestseller) domain. The country patterns diverge considerably in the later decades. In the French literary award system women never surpass their 1960s share: gender inequality remains amazingly large. In Germany we see strong fluctuations in the number of female award winners. The peak of 28%, however, is found in the most recent decade, suggesting that there is a positive trend. The US, again, show the smallest gender inequality, as overall 30% of the award winners are female. Still, this percentage is already achieved in the 1970s and has not altered much since.</p>

<p>These results confirm our expectations regarding cross-national differences as well as the popular–highbrow divide. Gender inequality is smallest in the US and largest in France; both for bestseller lists and award winners. This strongly suggests that field-specific properties indeed affect social inequalities in cultural production. At the same time, the gender gap is consistently smaller in the popular culture system (bestsellers) than in the highbrow culture system (literary awards). This result thus implies that (sub)fields in which more status is at stake are indeed more subject to social inequalities than those offering less status.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323112459433">Table 3</xref> we analyse the highbrow–popular divide <italic>within</italic> bestseller lists to examine whether changes in gender inequality as observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112459433">Table 1</xref> can be interpreted in terms of changing genre distributions. The table itemizes the total proportions of female and male authors in the 1970s and 2000s, as well as the difference between the two, in the genre categories of literary fiction, mainstream fiction and popular fiction. Since the presented figures are total percentages, this table also gives insight into the importance of genres across countries. Clearly, French bestseller lists contain the most in literary fiction and the least in popular fiction, while in the US this is the other way around and Germany holds a middle position.</p>

<p>This overall orientation is reflected in the explanation of gender differences. In the European countries, most of the increase of female authors can be attributed to literary fiction, whereas in the US the bulk of new female authors write popular fiction. In more detail, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323112459433">Table 3</xref> informs us that in France the growth rate of female authors amounted to 11.3%; 6.3 points of which can be attributed to literary fiction and 5.3 points to popular fiction. Similarly, the German growth rate of 8.9% can be unravelled into 5.0 points for literary fiction, 2.9 points for popular fiction and 0.9 points for mainstream fiction. In the US, where the rise in female authors was considerably larger (18.1%), literary fiction and mainstream fiction account for about 3.5 points and popular fiction for more than 11 points. Again, these results point to the importance of field characteristics in explaining social inequalities: in the fields of France and Germany, where there is a longer tradition of a highbrow culture system, the inflow from popular culture is smaller than in the US.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This article has examined trends in gender inequality in the literary fields of France, Germany and the United States between 1960 and 2009, with special attention to the highbrow–popular culture divide. Central to our analysis was the presence of female authors in one exponent of the popular culture system – weekly fiction book bestseller lists – which we compared to one exponent of the highbrow culture system – literary award attribution. Our longitudinal analysis clearly showed that over time female authors have become increasingly successful in bestseller lists, albeit they remain underrepresented in all three countries. In the US, women comprise about 45% of all listed authors in the 2000s, but in both European countries they remain under 40%. Yet these proportions are considerably smaller for literary award winners: no more than 30% of the awards are won by women in the US and Germany, while in France women comprise less than one-fifth of all winners. Gender inequality thus appears to be larger in the highbrow system than in the popular system, and this does not change over time.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, the rise of female authors in bestseller lists can be related to the growing presence of popular culture in these lists. In general, the shares of literary fiction and mainstream fiction have become smaller since the early 1970s, whereas popular genres (thrillers, science fiction/fantasy and romance books) have started to dominate the charts. In the US in particular, women seem to have benefitted most: while more female authors have entered the bestseller lists among all genres, their increase is disproportionally higher among the popular genres. Again, this finding emphasizes the intermediating role of genre: popular culture has the strongest emancipatory effect in fields where the highbrow–popular divide is the weakest. This corroborates and extends the argument that in prestigious cultural fields women are ‘edged out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459433">Bielby and Bielby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267323112459433">Tuchman and Fortin, 1984</xref>) since our analysis explicitly compared genres of different status. Nevertheless, follow-up research might examine the internal differentiation in popular fiction more closely. An explorative look at American bestseller lists, for instance, shows that relatively many female authors only achieved bestseller success after switching from writing romance fiction to writing thrillers (e.g. Tami Hoag, Lisa Jackson, Linda Howard), suggesting that status differences among genres are also relevant within the popular culture system. It would also be relevant to study the role of the book format (hardcover, paperback, pocket) therein, as many popular fiction authors first seem to build a fan basis within the paperback or pocket segment before becoming successful in the hardcover segment where new books by ‘star authors’ are first released.</p>
<p>A final important result of the article is the persistent direction of cross-national differences, emphasizing the importance of field characteristics in explaining social inequalities. Clearly, France is overall the least receptive to female authors of fiction and the US is the most. France is also the country in which, through tradition and institutional conventions, the highbrow culture system (e.g. importance of ‘literature’, literary awards) has the strongest position within the literary field. In the US, the literary field seems to rely mostly on a market logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267323112459433">Weber, 2000</xref>), which balances artistic and economic legitimacy and decreases gender inequality. These findings cannot be qualified as final, however. More in-depth analyses of how agents within literary fields (publishers, reviewers, readers) engage in processes of decision-making and how this affects social inequality seem necessary to illuminate the mechanisms hypothesized in this article. This would also shed more light on the issue of causality. Since we used aggregated data in this study, it was not possible to assess how status in the field impacts success <italic>within</italic> persons, by disentangling the time order of events.</p>
<p>Future research could also elaborate by examining other genres (e.g. popular music versus classical music) or institutions, the output of which offers more insight into how female artists are perceived and subsequently classified (e.g. reviews in the media). Both approaches should take into account the transformations that take place in the cultural industries and fields. What does it mean, for instance, that the reading of fiction books has increasingly become a leisure time activity of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323112459433">Griswold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267323112459433">Tepper, 2000</xref>)? And whereas traditionally print media have played a pivotal role in the literary field via book reviews, this may have altered due to the rise of entertainment media, peer production practices on the Internet and the more omnivorous consumption practices of consumers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267323112459433">Verboord, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important development is the increasing diversification of cultural classification practices, which has produced, among other things, women-only prizes (e.g. Orange Prize for Fiction Books in the UK), but also awards which seem to intersect the popular–highbrow divide (e.g. high-status awards in the field of popular culture, like the Mercury Music Prize in the UK). Also, within ‘highbrow’ fields, opinions of audiences seem to become more important in the attribution of awards (e.g. Grand Prix des Lectrices de Elle; Prix des Libraires). If women make up larger proportions of these audiences, this could thus have considerable influence on gender inequality within the field. In this current article it was not feasible to consider the impact of such developments, but it is recommended that follow-up studies examine this in more detail.</p>

<p>The consequences for canon formation have been mapped both by literary scholars (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267323112459433">Showalter, 2010</xref>) and social scientists (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323112459433">Corse and Westervelt, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>The bestseller list in <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> only started in October 1961; for <italic>L’Express</italic> we only have information as from January 1965.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0267323112459433">
<label>3.</label>
<p>This choice was made to have optimal comparability across countries: for Germany and France no paperback lists are available. We acknowledge that these bestseller lists do not probably represent the full spectrum of outlets (they are likely to represent mainly traditional book stores and overlook sales at other outlets like supermarkets, kiosks, etc.). Yet, we argue that this will then provide an even stronger test of the central hypothesis.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0267323112459433">
<label>4.</label>
<p>No adjustments were made for the size of the lists – which grew in the European countries from top 10s to top 20s, and in the US from top 10s to top 15s – since we are interested in all authors and titles to which audiences are exposed. In France, at some time points (1965–1975, 1988–1990) the lists were joint compilations of fiction and non-fiction. Between 1965 and 1975 we collected all data and then excluded the non-fiction books in the data analysis. For the brief period between 1988 and 1990, when a mixed top 30 was published, we extracted a fiction top 15.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0267323112459433">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Genre categories were retrieved at the author level, since most authors publish their titles within the same genre category. Also, the large number of unique titles as well as the limited availability of information on old titles made it practically impossible to analyse the title level. For the same reason, we disregarded the pre-1970 period.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0267323112459433">
<label>6.</label>
<p>More specifically, a three-fold strategy was used. First, we looked for explicit classifications by critics and journalists in bi(bli)ographies (e.g. ‘literature’, ‘thriller author’ or ‘<italic>policier</italic>’). If these classifications were not available, we looked for more implicit classifications such as winning prizes in a category matching the genre classification, being reviewed in certain newspaper rubrics or websites, or being linked to certain genres through the ‘similar products’ suggestions on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>. This would for instance distinguish a historical novel such as <italic>Wolf Hall</italic> by Hilary Mantel (which won the Booker Prize) from the historical sagas by James Michener (which critics generally considered too stereotypical for winning literary awards). A final strategy – mostly used for less-known authors from the 1970s – concerned interpretation of book descriptions together with book covers as found on the Internet. Whereas ‘literature’ is often associated with innovative use of language and more complicated themes, ‘popular fiction’ generally follows certain institutional conventions within a genre (e.g. thrillers emphasize crime and murder mysteries; romance novels emphasize romantic encounters often between women and men). Again, authors without such characteristics were classified as ‘mainstream’.</p>
