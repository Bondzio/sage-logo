<sec id="section1-0363546512467622">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>A recent one-step arthroscopic technique based on bone marrow–derived cell transplantation has achieved good results in repairing osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs), overcoming some of the drawbacks of older techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512467622">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To report the results after 4 years of a series of patients who underwent a one-step repair of osteochondral lesions of the talar dome, as well as the capability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a T2-mapping sequence to predict the clinical outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512467622">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512467622">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Forty-nine patients (age [mean ± SD], 28.08 ± 9.51 y) underwent a one-step repair of OLTs. Patients were evaluated clinically by American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores and radiographs and underwent MRI preoperatively and during postoperative follow-ups at predetermined times. In all patients, the cells were harvested from the iliac crest, concentrated, and loaded on a scaffold that was implanted arthroscopically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512467622">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The overall AOFAS score (mean ± SD) improved from 63.73 ± 14.13 preoperatively to 82.19 ± 17.04 at 48 ± 6.1 months (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005), with best results at the 24-month follow-up. A significant decrease in the clinical score was observed between 24 and 36 months postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and between 24 and 48 months (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005). The T2-mapping analysis showed regenerated tissue with T2 values of 35 to 45 milliseconds, similar to hyaline cartilage, in a mean of 78% ± 16% of the repaired lesion area. The time between the occurrence of trauma and surgery was found to negatively affect the clinical outcome at the latest follow-up; patient’s age and lesion size influenced the early clinical results but did not affect the outcome at final follow-up. The stability of clinical results over time and the percentage of tissue with values similar to hyaline cartilage evidenced by MRI T2 mapping showed a tendency to correlate at the last follow-up (<italic>r</italic> = 0.497, <italic>P</italic> = .06).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512467622">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>One-step repair of OLTs had good clinical results that were durable over time, even though there was a slight decrease in AOFAS score at the latest follow-up. The quality of the regenerated tissue detected by MRI T2 mapping directly correlated with the clinical results.</p>

<p>Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) occur frequently in young active patients and can be difficult to treat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512467622">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512467622">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512467622">30</xref></sup> Chondral tissue has poor healing abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512467622">1</xref></sup>; therefore, the damage may be irreversible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512467622">8</xref></sup> and lead to chronic symptoms and early osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512467622">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512467622">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512467622">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512467622">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical results and durability over time of the repaired tissue are believed to be strictly dependent on the quality of the regenerated cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512467622">3</xref></sup> Over time, various surgical options have been proposed to restore an adequate cartilaginous layer on the talar dome, but among them, only autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has shown the ability to regenerate hyaline cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512467622">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512467622">22</xref></sup> More recently, a one-step bone marrow–derived cell transplantation (BMDCT) technique has been proposed as an alternative capable of repairing the lesion with hyaline cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512467622">15</xref></sup> with the advantage of being a completely arthroscopic single-step technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512467622">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512467622">15</xref></sup> Histological results of the repaired area by the one-step technique have been previously provided, confirming the regeneration of articular cartilage in the remodeling phase with hyaline features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512467622">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second-look biopsy of the repaired tissue is invasive and able to evaluate just the focal area.

<p>The aim of this study was to report the clinical results at 4-year follow-up of a series of patients who underwent a one-step procedure for osteochondral repair in the ankle joint and to determine the capability of T2 mapping to predict the final outcome obtained.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512467622" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>From October 2005 to June 2007, we enrolled 49 patients (mean ± standard deviation [SD] age, 28.08 ± 9.51 y; follow-up time, 48 ± 6.1 mo; range, 36-54 mo) affected by focal osteochondral lesions of the talar dome to be treated with BMDCT using a one-step arthroscopic technique. In the same period, a total of 67 patients were treated with the same surgical technique, but only 49 patients were enrolled (73.1%) because 18 patients did not match the inclusion criteria and were not eligible for this study. Some of these patients had been evaluated in a previous study at different follow-ups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512467622">15</xref></sup> The treatment was indicated for focal osteochondral lesions of the talar dome classified as chronic type II (&gt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> in area, &lt;5 mm deep), according to the Giannini classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512467622">14</xref></sup> We excluded patients younger than 14 years or older than 50 years, patients with osteoarthritis or kissing lesions of the ankle, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Malalignments of the lower limb and the presence of joint laxity were considered relative contraindications to be corrected if present. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were ensured by independent evaluation of the patients by the authors (M.C. and F.V.).</p>
<p>Twenty-seven patients were male and 22 were female. Mean lesion size was 2.24 ± 1.23 cm<sup>2</sup>, and the depth was 3.9 ± 0.9 mm. In 22 patients, the lesion was in the right ankle and in 27 it was in the left ankle; the lesion was located medially in 39 cases and laterally in 9, and in only 1 case, it involved both the medial and the lateral aspects of the talar dome. In 36 patients, the lesion had a definite posttraumatic origin, and the time elapsed between trauma and the treatment ranged from 2 months to 18 years. Four patients had a previous ankle fracture, and 32 had a previous ankle sprain without a fracture, whereas 13 were not able to recall a specific traumatic event of the affected ankle. Seventeen patients had been treated previously by arthroscopic ankle debridement (n = 8), microfracture (n = 5), ACI (n = 2), or BMDCT (n = 2).</p>
<p>The ethical committee of our institution approved the human protocol for this investigation. All investigations were conducted in conformity with ethical principles of research, and written informed consent was provided by all the patients enrolled in this study.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512467622">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The surgical technique has previously been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512467622">15</xref></sup> Briefly, the patient was placed in the prone position after general or spinal anesthesia was induced. The bone marrow was harvested from the posterior iliac crest using a sterile technique. A total of 60 mL of bone marrow aspirate was collected and inserted into a concentrator-separator device (Smart PReP, Harvest Technologies Corp, Plymouth, Massachusetts). After a 15-minute working cycle, the aspirate was reduced in volume to obtain 6 mL of bone marrow concentrate rich in nucleated cells. During the concentration process, a standard ankle arthroscopic procedure was performed, and the lesion site was visualized and prepared until the healthy bone was reached. With a probe, we measured the lesion size in millimeters. The composite to be implanted was prepared by loading collagen powder (Spongostan Powder, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Ltd, Gargrave, United Kingdom), which becomes a malleable paste once mixed with autologous cell concentrate and platelet gel (first 23 patients), or a hyaluronic acid membrane (HYAFF-11, Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Abano Terme, Italy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512467622">7</xref></sup> with 2 mL of bone marrow concentrate and 1 mL of autologous platelet gel (platelet-rich fibrin) (remaining 26 patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512467622">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512467622">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512467622">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512467622">29</xref></sup> Using the same instrumentation previously described for arthroscopic ACI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512467622">16</xref></sup> the composite was placed onto the lesion site. Multiple sagittal ankle movements were performed under arthroscopic control to verify the stability of the implant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512467622">
<title>Patient Evaluation</title>
<p>An initial clinical and physical examination was completed on each patient. We recorded any known history of possible ankle trauma and any previous treatment. Preoperatively, 2 clinicians (F.V. and M.C.) examined the ankle for instability, malalignment, and range of motion, and patients were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512467622">19</xref></sup> A standard radiographic examination including anteroposterior and lateral weightbearing views as well as MRI of the affected ankle were taken preoperatively.</p>
<p>Patients were asked to return for re-evaluation at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after surgery. Clinical evaluation was performed in all cases at 6 months and every year after surgery for up to 36 months. Only 41 patients reached the 48-month follow-up. At each follow-up, the patient’s score was related to the maximum possible improvement, calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Standard MRI scans were taken at 12 and 24 months. At 24 months, a more detailed MRI evaluation was performed in 20 patients using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512467622">23</xref></sup> and T2-mapping sequences. Images were obtained using a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner (HDxt, General Electric, Chalfont St Giles, United Kingdom) and a dedicated phased array coil. The following sequences were used:</p>
<list id="list1-0363546512467622" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Coronal delayed-phase fast spin echo (DPFSE) high-resolution fat-saturated (repetition time [TR], 2700 ms; echo time [TE], 24 ms; field of view [FOV], 17; matrix, 416 × 416; gap spacing, 0; slice thickness, 2 mm; number of acquisitions, 2) and coronal DPFSE without fat suppression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coronal 3-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo (3D-SPGR) fat-saturated (TR, 325 ms; TE, 6 ms; flip angle, 20°; FOV, 17; matrix, 256 × 256; gap spacing, 0; slice thickness, 2 mm; number of acquisitions, 4).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sagittal DPFSE high-resolution fat-saturated (TR, 1720 ms; TE, 24 ms; FOV, 17; matrix, 416 × 416; gap spacing, 0; slice thickness, 2 mm; number of acquisitions, 2).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The 3D-SPGR sequence of one patient was not considered because of the high amount of artifacts due to small ferromagnetic particles released by the shaver during surgery.</p>
<p>The MOCART score parameters considered for cartilage evaluation were (1) degree of filling of the osteochondral defect (complete, hypertrophic, incomplete inferior or superior to 50% of the defect, exposure of subchondral bone); (2) integration to the border zone (complete, incomplete); (3) surface of the repaired tissue (intact, damaged inferior or superior to 50% of the regenerated surface); (4) structure of the repaired tissue (homogeneous or inhomogeneous); (5) signal intensity of the repaired tissue in DPFSE fat-saturated sequences (isointense, moderately hyperintense, markedly hyperintense); (6) integrity of the subchondral lamina; (7) integrity of the subchondral bone; (8) adhesion of the regenerated tissue; and (9) presence of joint effusion. Both depth (mm) and volume of the regenerated defect (mm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated with manual trace. The volume was calculated with the formula of the ellipsoid (A×B×C×4/3π).</p>
<p>For these 20 patients, the MRI acquisition protocol at 24-month follow-up was completed by coronal and sagittal T2-mapping high-resolution sequences (TR, 1000 ms; TE, 10-80 ms for study hyaline cartilage; FOV, 17; matrix, 256 × 256; gap spacing, 0; slice thickness, 2 mm; number of acquisitions, 1). The T2 mapping was a multiecho (8-echo train) and multislice (18-slice) sequence, with a total of 144 images acquired. It was necessary to use specific postprocessing T2-mapping software (with final T2 grading color maps for normal and pathological hyaline cartilage) and to identify 2 presets (preset 1 = 10-50 ms; preset 2 = 51-80 ms) before proceeding with image elaboration.</p>
<p>Only coronal MRI views were considered for T2-mapping evaluation because of their higher chromatic homogeneity due to a lower “magic angle” in the artifact’s influence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512467622">31</xref></sup> Measurement of the spatial distribution of the T2 mapping revealed areas with increased or decreased water content. These areas were measured by manual trace for single acquired slices, and the percentage of altered tissue was related to the whole regenerated defect volume.</p>
<p>The considered T2 values were (1) percentage of regenerated tissue similar to hyaline cartilage (T2 values of 35-45 ms); (2) percentage of regenerated tissue with a higher water content, which was considered to be tissue in the remodeling phase or inflammatory tissue (T2 values of &gt;45 ms); (3) percentage of regenerated fibrocartilaginous tissue (T2 values of &lt;35 ms); and (4) percentage of regenerated newly formed bone.</p>
<p>Twenty healthy volunteers were used as controls to calculate the T2 values of healthy cartilage for comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512467622">4</xref></sup> Results were analyzed by age, lesion size and depth, MOCART score, and T2-mapping evaluation of the regenerated tissue. Finally, a correlation analysis between 24-month MRI results and clinical scores (AOFAS) at the last follow-up of 48.8 ± 7 months was attempted. The imaging evaluation was performed independently by M.B. and F.V., while the clinical assessments were performed by M.C. and L.R.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512467622">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Age and clinical scores are expressed as mean ± SD, while all other parameters are expressed in terms of median values and ranges, under the hypothesis of nonnormality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to assess differences among presurgical, postsurgical, and 24-month follow-up scores. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to test hypotheses about medians of the different groups. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to assess correlations between continuous variables. For all tests, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was carried out by means of SPSS software version 14.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>Overall, the preoperative AOFAS score was 63.73 ± 14.13. Postoperatively, a progressive improvement was observed up to a maximum of 91.76 ± 7.76 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005) at 24 months, with a percentage improvement of 76.75% ± 21.15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512467622">Figure 1</xref>). Then, a decrease in the mean clinical score was reported, with a final value of 82.19 ± 17.04 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005) at 48 ± 6.1 months (in 42 patients), with a percentage improvement of 52.89% ± 45.76%.</p>

<p>Among the 36 patients (73%) playing sports (involved in soccer, basketball, skiing, and general fitness classes), the large majority (28 patients, 78%) were able to resume the previous sports level, while the remaining 8 patients (22%) resumed sports at a lower level or preferred to shift to a lower impact activity.</p>
<p>In the 20 patients who received MRI T2 mapping, the AOFAS score improved from 66.8 ± 14.5 preoperatively to 91.2 ± 8.3 at 24 months, 85.1 ± 16 at 36 months, and 83 ± 15 at 48.8 ± 7 months. The improvement from preoperative score to the final score at follow-up was statistically significant both overall and in the series of 20 patients who underwent MRI T2 mapping (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005). Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the clinical score was observed between 24 and 36 months’ follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and between 24 and 48 months’ follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005).</p>
<p>Sex, traumatic lesion, depth of the lesion, site of injury, previous surgery, type of scaffold used, and the presence of impingement were not shown to influence the clinical outcome at any of the follow-ups evaluated. Age was shown to influence the clinical outcome only at 6 months, with the best improvement in younger patients (<italic>r</italic> = −0.336, <italic>P</italic> = .018).</p>
<p>The time between the occurrence of trauma and surgery has been shown to influence the clinical outcome at the latest follow-up. A long time having elapsed has adversely affected the clinical outcome at 36 months (<italic>r</italic> = −0.318, <italic>P</italic> = .028) and 48 months (<italic>r</italic> = −0.0558, <italic>P</italic> = .025).</p>
<p>The size of the lesion had an impact on the clinical score at 12, 18, and 24 months. In detail, lesions of larger sizes were associated with a lower clinical score at 12 months’ (<italic>r</italic> = −0.293, <italic>P</italic> = .04), 18 months’ (<italic>r</italic> = −0.276, <italic>P</italic> = .05), and 24 months’ follow-up (<italic>r</italic> = −0.343, <italic>P</italic> = .016). This effect was lost at 48 months.</p>
<p>Among the 20 patients who underwent MRI T2 mapping, the percentages of repartition of the patients for each MOCART score item are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512467622">Table 1</xref>, but no influence of any parameter was found on the clinical score at 48 months’ follow-up. In 9 patients (45%), complete defect filling was observed; in 9 patients (45%), it was hypertrophic, while in 2 patients (10%), it was incomplete (less than 50% of the lesion volume). Integration to the border zone was complete in 13 patients (65%) and incomplete in 7 patients (35%). The repaired tissue surface was intact (type 3) in 8 patients (40%) and damaged (type 1, superior to 50% of the regenerated surface; or type 2, inferior to 50%) in 12 patients (60%). The reparative tissue was isointense (type 3) in 14 patients (70%) and moderately hyperintense (type 2) in 6 patients (30%). The subchondral lamina was intact in 2 patients (10%) and damaged in 18 patients (90%). The subchondral bone was intact in 7 patients (35%) and disrupted in 13 patients (65%). Joint effusion was evident in only 1 patient (5%), while 12 patients (60%) had subchondral edema.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Autologous chondrocyte implantation has shown the ability to regenerate reparative tissue with physical characteristics similar to those of healthy cartilage and is widely considered to be the gold standard in cartilage regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512467622">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, the use of a tissue-engineered biomaterial composed of autologous chondrocytes grown on a scaffold entirely made of HYAFF-11 enhanced the applicability of the technique, permitting a completely arthroscopic procedure in the knee and ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512467622">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512467622">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512467622">22</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the need for 2 surgical operations and the high costs resulting from cell expansion are major drawbacks of this technique.</p>
<p>The arthroscopic “one-step” technique used in this study had extremely satisfactory clinical and MRI results and is free from the major disadvantages of techniques previously proposed, such as the high costs and the need for multiple surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512467622">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512467622">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512467622">15</xref></sup> In the present study, we proposed to verify the stability of the clinical results over time in patients operated by the one-step technique and to confirm the hypothesis that a high percentage of hyaline cartilage results in a higher clinical score, stable over time. The absence of a control group, the use of 2 different scaffolds for bone marrow–derived cell support, and the small number of MRI T2 mapping represent limitations of this study.</p>
<p>In this study, we noticed a decrease in the clinical score obtained from 24 to 48 months in the overall series of patients. Although this decrease was somewhat disappointing, the final clinical result was still satisfactory, and the final AOFAS score was still significantly improved from the initial score.</p>
<p>The MOCART score parameters did not correlate with the final clinical results: the signal intensity and the homogeneity of the regenerated tissue in DPFSE fat-saturated sequence, the finding of persisting lamina damage, subchondral bone disruption, and the presence of subchondral edema did not affect the final clinical result in this series. While at 2 years’ follow-up, patients with an isointense signal in the repaired tissue with respect to hyaline cartilage were able to obtain a median AOFAS score of 100, in contrast with patients with moderate signal hyperintensity who obtained a mean clinical score of 89 (<italic>P</italic> = .05), at final follow-up, this significance was lost. A negative relationship, evident at 2 years between the depths of the lesion, and the integrity of the surface of the regenerated tissue (τ = −.523, <italic>P</italic> = .007), was also lost at this follow-up. These data were consistent with a previous study regarding ACI in the ankle, where at 5 years, no correlation was evident between MOCART parameters and the clinical score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512467622">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 9 patients with a defect filling rated as hypertrophic maintained a stable clinical result in 3 cases, while 6 showed a decrease with respect to clinical follow-up at 2 years, and in particular, 3 of them showed a poor result (inferior to baseline). These 3 patients gained the worst results of the series, and the hypertrophic regenerative tissue was associated with a damaged surface of the repaired tissue, nonhomogeneous signal, a moderate hyperintensity and subchondral edema, and nonintact subchondral lamina with alteration of the subchondral bone. Furthermore, lesion depth was 5 to 7 mm. Percentage of fibrocartilage in these cases ranged between 3% and 50%, while the presence of hyaline tissue ranged from 50% to 96%. None of them received a revision surgery to date.</p>
<p>The MRI T2-mapping evaluation was performed at 24 months, and the clinical results obtained at this time showed that patients with more than 80% of regenerated tissue, discriminated by T2 mapping as hyaline, showed a significantly better clinical outcome at 48 months in comparison with patients with less than 80% of hyaline cartilage (<italic>P</italic> = .007).</p>
<p>Although patients need to be followed over time up to the long term to evaluate if further deterioration of the clinical score occurs, the one-step technique was effective in regenerating tissue with hyaline features in OLTs. The presence of foci of fibrocartilage strongly affected the clinical outcome and the stability of the results over time, this correlation is not limited to just the one-step technique and has been noticed in 2 different series of comparable patients operated with the open and arthroscopic technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512467622">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512467622">13</xref></sup> This finding is suggestive that both ACI and the one-step technique result in a similar reparative tissue constituted in a large part of cartilage with hyaline features and also with the presence of small areas of fibrocartilage and of cartilage in the remodeling phase. An important consideration that emerged from this study is that the patient who has the best possibility of maintaining an excellent clinical score in the midterm is the patient with a high percentage of regenerated tissue similar to hyaline cartilage (T2 value of 35-45 ms) and a low percentage of fibrocartilage (T2 value of &lt;35 ms). The midterm outcome showed no relationship with the percentage of tissue in the remodeling phase (T2 value of &gt;45 ms). Although no correlations were evident at this follow-up with MOCART parameters, while studying the patients in detail, it is evident that patients with an unsatisfactory outcome still presented 1 or more altered MOCART parameters.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these findings show that one-step repair of OLTs had good clinical results after 4 years of follow-up, although there was some decline in the AOFAS scores between 24 and 48 months postoperatively. Nevertheless, the presence of regenerated hyaline in nature, although a necessary condition to maintain a stable and durable result over time, is not a sufficient condition. Other parameters such as the morphological characteristics of regenerated tissue are needed while predicting the outcome.</p>
