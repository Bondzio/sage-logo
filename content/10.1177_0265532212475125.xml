<body>
<p>Throughout <italic>The Cambridge Guide to Second Language Assessment</italic> there is reference to its central aim, namely to increase <italic>assessment literacy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265532212475125">Fulcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265532212475125">Popham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265532212475125">Stiggins, 2002</xref>) as a fundamental requirement for a language teacher’s ongoing professional growth and classroom effectiveness (Stoynoff &amp; Coombe, 2012). As such, <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> answers calls in the literature for language testing resources which are designed specifically with language teachers in mind, that are neither too ‘technical’ and ‘specialized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265532212475125">Taylor, 2009</xref>, p. 23) on the one hand, nor too superficial or lacking in substance, on the other. Although the editors and contributors are focused on English language teaching, teachers of languages other than English would also benefit by reading and reflecting on the topics that are covered in this edited volume.</p>
<p>Coombe (2012) introduces <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> as a ‘comprehensive overview of the field of second language assessment,’ which provides teachers of all levels with up-to-date ‘snapshots of significant issues and trends’ and which emphasizes ‘current approaches, and practices in the assessment of foreign/second language performance’ (p. 1). <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> is indeed comprehensive, consisting of 35 chapters contributed by many of the leading experts in the field of second language testing and assessment. The first of the five sections in the volume focuses on key issues (pp. 7–129). It takes up nearly a third of the book with 14 chapters that deal with all of the following topics:</p>
<list id="list1-0265532212475125" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the history of second language testing; developments in testing and assessment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fundamental testing principles (e.g. validity, reliability, factors that influence test performance, etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>test development (including test specifications);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the connection between assessment and instruction; assessment in relation to standards (i.e. No Child Left Behind (NCLB) policies in the USA; the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) in Europe); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the consequences of test use (e.g. impact, washback, ethics; the need for professional development for teachers as assessment practitioners).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Section Two addresses assessment purposes and approaches in nine chapters; Section Three is devoted to the assessment of specific skills (including reading, writing, listening, speaking, grammatical ability, and vocabulary). The final two short sections at the end of <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> address the role of technology in assessment and test administration issues (i.e. managing assessment in large language classes; marking assessments, rating scales and rubrics; accommodation in language testing).</p>
<p><italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> will be very useful as a textbook and teaching resource in courses in language testing and assessment for pre-service and/or in-service language teachers. Each chapter includes additional suggested resources (some of which are annotated) for those who wish to increase the depth of their understanding of a specific topic, issue, trend or practice, along with a list of references for work referred to by the author(s) of the chapter. There are also discussion questions at the end of each chapter which range from those directed at developing a firm understanding of the specific content covered in each chapter (e.g. ‘Why is it important for a teacher to be assessment literate?’, in Coombe, Troudi, &amp; Al-Hamly, p. 26), to those that consolidate chapter content and then extend it to personal assessment experience (e.g. ‘Look at Thompson’s (1995) factors to consider when preparing listening tests. Then apply them to a listening test you are familiar with’, in Flowerdew &amp; Miller, p. 232).</p>
<p>One omission may be the absence of a glossary of key terms for quick reference and clarification. It would be advisable to have such a reference close at hand to support language teachers’ ease of comprehension when <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> is used in courses, for professional development, or self-study.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in the coverage and emphasis of the volume. Given the importance of ongoing, interactive formative assessment in language teaching classrooms, the skills-based organization of Section Three is somewhat limited. There is little space devoted to assessment interactions between teachers and students; to the teacher’s role in discursively supporting and developing learning. Chapter 18 by Shehadeh (pp. 156–163) makes no mention of <italic>embedded</italic> assessment tasks or <italic>dynamic assessment</italic>, which integrate assessment within an instructional activity (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265532212475125">Lantolf &amp; Poehner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265532212475125">Poehner &amp; Ableeva, 2011</xref>). Further, the role of feedback in assessment is discussed only briefly in the volume. For example, in the chapter by Katz (pp. 70–72), which examines the links between assessment, instructional aims, and learning, concepts like <italic>scaffolding</italic> are mentioned in connection with feedback during a performance (see Figure 7.2, p. 70). Katz notes, ‘For feedback to be useful, teachers must also exercise skill in observing and interpreting the student talk that is elicited so as to provide appropriate scaffolding, for example, through prompts or paraphrasing or follow-up questions, that will assist learners in developing their language ability’ (p. 71). This is a most complex and critical capability and much more space might have been devoted in the volume to teachers’ formative classroom practices, to the <italic>language</italic> in language assessment practice, and the teachers’ complex role in discursive interactions with learners to support learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265532212475125">Leung &amp; Mohan, 2004</xref>). In Table 7.1 (p. 71), Katz provides an example of the relationship between learning objectives, classroom activity, and assessment tools. This table might also have explored the type of feedback that would be provided by the teacher, and how it would be structured to support learning, increase positive washback, and evaluate that washback. More practical application sections with examples, such as the one in Anderson’s chapter (pp. 187–197) on student involvement in assessment, self-assessment and peer assessment, would encourage teachers’ development of more reflective practice in their ongoing support of learning. And, although Brown ably describes assessment purposes in Chapter 15, classroom assessment (which is surely at the heart of a teacher’s assessment literacy practice) receives only a few paragraphs (mainly p. 134). There is little attention paid to diagnostic assessment or its potential in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265532212475125">Fox &amp; Hartwick, 2011</xref>), and although there is some information on alternative approaches to assessment such as the use of portfolios (e.g. Chapter 17, Coombe, Purmensky, &amp; Davidson, pp. 147–155), it is also limited in scope. Therefore, when used as a resource to increase language teachers’ assessment literacy, this volume may need to be supplemented by a resource such as <italic>Classroom-Based Language Assessment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265532212475125">Tsagari &amp; Csépes, 2011</xref>), which focuses specifically on classroom assessment as ‘interactionally mediated, as an integrated and iterative process within pedagogical routines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265532212475125">Rea-Dickins, 2011</xref>, p. 9).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265532212475125">Fulcher (2012)</xref> points out that the emergent empirically-driven definition of assessment literacy ‘integrates knowledge, skills, and principles in a procedural text that attempts to balance what will be required for both classroom [i.e. assessment for learning] and normative [i.e. assessment of learning] assessment’ (p. 126). <italic>The Cambridge Guide</italic> may have tipped the balance in favour of the normative, but it is nonetheless a most comprehensive, informative and useful language assessment resource.</p>
