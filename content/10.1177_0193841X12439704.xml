<abstract>
<p>Homelessness is a serious and growing issue. Evaluations of systemic-level changes are needed to determine progress in reducing or ending homelessness. The report card methodology is one means of systems-level assessment. Rather than solely establishing an enumeration, homelessness report cards can capture pertinent information about structural determinants of homelessness. This information can inform the development of evidence-based strategies aimed at ending (rather than managing) homelessness. To aid in the development of homelessness report card creation, a systems-level Homelessness Outcome Reporting Normative Framework (the HORN Framework) was developed. This article provides an overview of the framework and its application.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A homelessness report card is a publicly accessible synthesis of regional socioeconomic indicators that can be used to evaluate (or grade) the determinants of homelessness within a community (including structural causes of homelessness, the current status of homelessness within the region, and actions to resolve homelessness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193841X12439704">United Way of America 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193841X12439704">Teague et al. 1997</xref>). Although report cards have been heavily utilized over the years in a number of different fields (i.e., business and education), report card methodology has recently grown in popularity for the reporting of regional-level homelessness trends. Systems-level homelessness report cards have been adopted across Canada and in parts of the United States, including: Vancouver (Tenant Resource &amp; Advisory Centre (TRAC) 2007); Yellowknife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193841X12439704">Yellowknife Homelessness Coalition 2009</xref>); Toronto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193841X12439704">City of Toronto 2003</xref>); Ottawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193841X12439704">Alliance to End Homelessness 2008</xref>); Fredericton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193841X12439704">The Community Action Group on Homelessness 2008</xref>); Halifax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193841X12439704">Community Action on Homelessness 2010</xref>); St. John’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193841X12439704">St. John's Housing and Homelessness Network 2008</xref>), Ohio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193841X12439704">Homeless Service System of Franklin County 2006</xref>), and California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193841X12439704">Wolch et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss the development and application of the Homelessness Outcome Reporting Normative Framework (HORN Framework, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193841X12439704">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193841X12439704">Table 1</xref>), which was used to guide a systems-level report for the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness (GVCEH 2011). The GVCEH was formed as a society in 2008, with the goal of developing and implementing a strategic plan to end homelessness in 10 years. The GVCEH is a partnership of service providers, the business community, nonprofit organizations, the faith community, university, and government. The report card project stemmed from the GVCEH’s desire for a better understanding of the structural determinants (root causes) that contribute to homelessness (Link and Phelan 2005), along with their progress in addressing homelessness. To inform the development of this work, a literary synthesis was undertaken to yield the HORN framework—a best practice approach toward planning, implementing, executing, and evaluating homelessness report cards.</p>

<title>Determinants of Homelessness</title>
<p>Homelessness is a growing concern in communities throughout North America, with implications for the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193841X12439704">Hwang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193841X12439704">Hwang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193841X12439704">Cheung and Hwang 2004</xref>). In the United States, examination of homelessness trend data has shown that increases in rent-to-income ratios help to explain the growing numbers of homeless people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193841X12439704">Quigley and Raphael 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193841X12439704">Quigley, Raphael, and Smolensky 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193841X12439704">Sullivan, Burnam, and Koegel 2000</xref>). These authors concluded that fluctuations in the housing market were more likely explanations for growing rates of homelessness than deinstitutionalization of people with mental illness, substance use, or unemployment rates. While there is an increased prevalence of mental illness and substance use problems among homeless populations, research has shown that these patterns reflect who may become homeless in particular situations rather than root causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193841X12439704">Koegel and Burnam 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar trends in Canada have been reported, including a decrease in subsidized and affordable housing and privatization of the housing rental market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193841X12439704">Shapcott 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193841X12439704">Eggleton and Keon 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193841X12439704">Eggleton and Segal 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193841X12439704">Hulchanski et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193841X12439704">Gaetz 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12439704">Hulchanski 2001</xref>). In the 1990s, the federal government withdrew from the provision of affordable housing with the responsibility for social housing transferred to the provinces. Welfare reform and loss of the social safety net have created a set of social conditions in which homelessness has flourished. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193841X12439704">Hulchanski et al. (2009)</xref> has described these as de-housing policies and a series of homeless-making processes. In Canada, aboriginal people are overrepresented among homeless populations and this has been associated with a history of colonization that has impacted access to economic resources and adequate housing (Reading and Wien 2009).</p>
<p>Housing and income are widely known as important social conditions that shape the health of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193841X12439704">Dunn 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193841X12439704">Dunn and Hayes 2006</xref>). Dunn has described housing as the nexus through which the other determinants of health operate. Housing is a fixed cost and often consumes the largest proportion of household incomes. Among poorer households the amount spent on housing can exceed the recommended 30% of before tax income earned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193841X12439704">Luffman 2006</xref>). Food is a flexible cost that is often sacrificed in order to maintain housing. Income adequacy is necessary to afford the basic essentials for living, such as housing, food, and other resources. Influenced by political economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193841X12439704">Coburn 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193841X12439704">Coburn 2006</xref>), social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193841X12439704">Raphael 2009</xref>; Bryant et al. 2010), and critical social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193841X12439704">Farmer 2002</xref>; Farmer 1999), we proposed an overall framework that would emphasize the structural determinants of homelessness while recognizing efforts to support individual responses. We sought to locate the GVCEH report in a broader upstream view of the social conditions that contribute to homelessness and poor health outcomes rather than simply reporting on the number of people housed.</p>

<title>Development of the HORN Framework: Literature Review and Synthesis</title>
<p>As part of a graduate thesis, the first author undertook a review and synthesis of literature relevant to the development of homelessness report cards from the 1800s to the end of 2009. Articles were selected for this review using online databases and Google Scholar. A search for academic and gray literature was also conducted. Finally, relevant articles were also retrieved through peer recommendation and reference searches. Articles were included in the review if they discussed report card methodology, through providing a framework, evaluation, or review (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193841X12439704">Fuller et al. 2006</xref>) or if they involved cases of report card implementations in a specific homelessness context (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193841X12439704">Alliance to End Homelessness 2008</xref>). Articles were excluded from the review if they involved the report card’s specific implementation in an unrelated context (i.e., education).</p>
<p>To synthesize the reviewed articles into the HORN Framework, the articles’ contents were extracted and organized into user-defined, high-level categorical groupings, which were then analyzed for: recommendations, commonalities, differences, and best practices. The findings were then summarized into an all-inclusive, standardized framework for reporting homelessness that was called the Homeless Outcome Reporting Normative Framework (the HORN Framework).</p>

<sec id="section5-0193841X12439704">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>A major facilitator of organizational reporting is upfront investment in planning efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193841X12439704">Coe 2003</xref>). More upfront planning results in higher quality report cards that will meet the needs of their targeted audiences. Emphasis on planning also reduces the need to change the design of future report cards (a costly endeavor that reduces the report cards’ comparability over time). We used the results of the literature review described above as a basis for our understanding of report card quality (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193841X12439704">Table 2</xref>) and uses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193841X12439704">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>It is necessary, early on in the report card planning process, to gain commitment from the project stakeholders (i.e., organizational management, data-holding agencies, funding bodies, community groups, government, service providers, the homeless community, biomedical/social science researchers, health professionals, etc.). This task can involve a considerable investment of time and effort. In our case, this process was greatly facilitated by the presence of a coordinating body, the GVCEH, who was already committed to the production of a report.</p>

<p>Once stakeholders have committed to participating in the production of the report card, the roles and responsibilities of those individuals responsible for guiding the report card process are to be defined. The primary roles for report card project members include facilitator, technical director, and evaluator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193841X12439704">Kopczynski 2004</xref>). The facilitator coordinates the multistakeholder project and ensures that all parties involved are satisfied. The technical director designs the systems required for the collection and analysis of the data. The evaluator collects, analyzes, and reports the data. Depending on the resources available, these roles and responsibilities can be shared between individuals.</p>
<p>It is important to consider the report card’s intended audience, when planning its design. A summary of the various categories and types of report card audiences is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0193841X12439704">Table 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193841X12439704">Beaulac et al. 2004</xref>). Depending on its intended audience, a report card may take one of three forms: popular, technical/scientific, and hybrid—translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). Popular report cards require little regard for methodological rigor or scientific validity and instead focus on comprehensibility to allow the report card to reach the largest possible audience. Popular reports are normally published in highly accessible forms, such as newspapers and magazines. At the other end of the spectrum, technical/scientific reports focus on methodological rigor and scientific validity, and as a consequence, the general comprehensibility of the report suffers. Such reports are usually created for an academic audience. Translated report cards are designed to bring highly technical, academic report cards to a lay audience. The GVCEH study targeted the general public, along with academic and governmental audiences, and so a translated reporting model was selected.</p>

<p>The task of creating a report card requires a “significant investment of time, effort, and money” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>). In a review of 85 American report card projects, Fielding et al. found that the duration of the report card development ranged from 1 to 58 months, with an average of 11.6 person-months worked, at an average/median cost of $60,934/$19,000 (USD), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193841X12439704">Fielding, Sutherland, and Halfon 1999</xref>). Thus, adequate resource allocation is needed in the development of report cards. In our case, university faculty and student time, as well as GVCEH staff time, were significant contributions in this project.</p>

<title>Report Card Review</title>
<p>Understanding how other regions monitor homelessness is important for creating a homelessness report card that is comparable across regions. Therefore, it was determined that scanning previously released report cards (used in similar applications) and extracting their relevant content (indicators, design, and benchmarks) could serve as references for later development and analysis efforts. A comprehensive review of report cards on homelessness was conducted as part of this project and included the extraction of a comprehensive list of over 300 potential indicators that were reviewed for use in the later indicator selection process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193841X12439704">
<title>Organization Analysis</title>
<p>When developing an organization-/agency-based homelessness report card, it is important to fully understand the goals of the organization. This helps to structure the report card in a way that will be meaningful to the group. A report card that uses organizational outcome (long-term goal) measures of effectiveness is considered to be of the highest validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193841X12439704">Coe 2003</xref>). Sometimes, however, due to measurement complexity or time and cost limitations, it is not always possible to completely or accurately measure outcomes. In such instances, output (short-term results of organizational action), process (organizational action), and input (organizational resource) measures can be used to supplement the outcome measures or to serve as proxy measures. Output, process, and input indicators are one, two, and three steps removed from measuring organizational outcomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The production of organizational inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes can be constructed systematically through the creation of an organizational logic model. Logic models show the linkage between organizational programs and their intended outcomes through graphically depicting the relationships between organizational inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes (often divided by short-term, medium-term, and long-term outcomes). This process is defined to a great extent in the Logic Model Development Guide (W.K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193841X12439704">Kellogg Foundation 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the GVCEH project, a logic model was developed and for the GVCEH sponsors to establish agreement on the potential inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes of their organization. The resulting logic model was used to guide the ultimate focus of the report card.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193841X12439704">
<title>Community Review</title>
<p>The goal of the community review/information gap analysis stage of the HORN Framework is to generate a list of what homelessness data is/is not available for collection within the community. For this, both primary and secondary data can be used. Primary data can be generated for the report card study through counts, surveys, interviews, observations, and so on, while secondary data are data that are generated for purposes other than the report card (i.e., administrative or agency records) but can be applied to secondary use in the report card.</p>
<p>Although primary data can be tailored directly to the needs of a report card, its collection “entails significantly greater effort and cost than relying on existing agency records” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>). As report card projects are often under tight resource constraints, the costly generation of primary data is uncommon. As an alternative, relevant report card indicators (especially output measures) can be reported on through secondary analysis of agency records, with minimized associated costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>). As an added benefit, secondary analysis also reduces the study’s impact on the homeless populations and homeless serving agencies by removing the need for active primary data generation (i.e., surveys, head counts, etc.).</p>
<p>To generate a comprehensive list of readily available, secondary data on homelessness for the GVCEH report card study, a wide breadth of agencies were initially contacted in the community analysis phase. This early contact aided in determining what data could/could not feasibly be collected within the scope of the project, while helping the data-holding agencies prepare for their work ahead, by giving them an early introduction to the project.</p>

<title>Indicator Selection</title>
<p>The final set of report card indicators is drawn from the findings of the previous framework stages:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Planning: Who is the report card audience and what is the resource capacity of the project?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Report Card Review: What have other report card projects done?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Organizational Analysis: What are the goals of the reporting organization?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Community Review: What information is readily available in the community?</p>
</list-item>
</list>In addition, when making the final indicator selections, several other factors come into play, including:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Cost—How much does the data cost to collect?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Validity—Does the data measure organizational outcome/output/process/input performance?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Accuracy—Is the data consistently correct?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Manipulability—Can the data be easily manipulated by the data submitters?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Availability—Will the data be available in a timely fashion?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Comprehensibility—Will the audience understand the reported data?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Comparability—Is the indicator data reported consistently over time?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Privacy considerations must also be taken into account when deciding which indicators to select (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12439704">Hatry 2004</xref>). Homelessness is a highly sensitive topic, and thus, great care must be taken with the collection and reporting of homelessness indicators. One means of reducing the risk of any privacy issues is to solely collect data that is anonymized (where individual identifiers are removed) or aggregated (where a summary of the data of interest is provided).</p>
<p>In the case of GVCEH report, the list of 300 homelessness indicators found in the report card review stage were reviewed and distilled by an indicator selection working group. The specific indicator selection criteria were informed by the broader evaluation framework, grounded in political economy, social determinants of health and structural inequities. Potential indicators were reviewed for alignment with the overall intention to report on structural determinants of homelessness as well as individualized supports. For the GVCEH report, housing, food and income were identified as key determinants to guide indicator selection. Housing affordability, availability, and accessibility were viewed as key aspects of the overarching framework to draw attention to the structural determinants of homelessness. We included data related to changes in rental housing costs and vacancy rates from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Social assistance rates and minimum wage incomes were obtained from Provincial sources and Statistics Canada. The number of people accessing food banks and the number of households experiencing food insecurity were obtained from Food Banks Canada and Statistics Canada. This broader framework provided a context to present information on the current status of homelessness, such as the number of people using emergency shelters, the number of people housed in the past year, and the impact of supportive services.</p>
<p>To reduce study cost, only those indicators that could be readily collected from external agencies (secondary data sources found in the community review) were chosen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193841X12439704">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection for a homelessness report card project can be facilitated either through voluntary or through regulated reporting of data from those community groups that house the indicator data (agencies). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12439704">Hatry (2004)</xref> suggests that agencies need sufficient time and (potential) compensation to respond to such requests. In the GVCEH study, we primarily relied on voluntary reporting of previously collected data. Initial meetings were conducted with agencies involved in data collection. These meetings outlined the purpose of the report card, the use of their data, and how confidentiality and privacy concerns would be addressed. These initial meetings were followed by e-mail communication of a detailed data request.</p>
<p>As part of the collection process, it is important to confirm the data quality before it is collected. This involves answering the following questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12439704">Hatry 2004</xref>):<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>How was the data created?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is the data reported for the duration of the reporting period or is there missing content?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are there any problems with the data? If so, are there any solutions to get around these problems (i.e., alternative data sources)?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Collected data should be put into some form of information management tool. In the GVCEH project, we provided agencies with prepared MS Excel spreadsheets for the submission of data, and created master lists based on the multiple, individual submissions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193841X12439704">
<title>Data Validation</title>
<p>To ensure report card quality, all collected data must be validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). The five primary causes for inaccurately reported data by agencies, as listed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref> include:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Token response—the agency lacks concern over the quality of their reported data due to its separation from the report card project;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Incompetence—the agency lacks the capacity to deliver accurate data, especially if the data is not used internally by the agency;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Massive resistance—the agency refuses to comply with all or some of the data submission requests;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Deliberate distortion—the agency tries to look better or avoid the embarrassment or consequences of poor data by altering their data;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reckless disregard—the agency tries to cut costs through sloppy reporting.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Our experience revealed that overcoming limited agency capacity and resources is also a key issue in obtaining quality data. The authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>) stress that many potential causes of inaccurate data can be avoided before the data validation stage by creating an environment that promotes open communication between the report card administrators and the data submitting agencies. Report cards with accurate performance results can be beneficial to the data submission agencies, given that the report card results could be used to help them learn and improve over time as well as secure funding. Ongoing communication and follow-up with data providers was essential in ensuring validity of the data.</p>
<sec id="section12-0193841X12439704">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>“Report cards require that data on inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes be converted into useful information about organizational performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). To judge organizational performance, the performance results need to be placed in a comparative framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>). This provides perspective on the organization’s performance levels, which allows them to be statistically benchmarked. Further comparison can be made over time against performance targets, across operating units, between defined geographical areas, and with other similar organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193841X12439704">Poister 2004</xref>). In our case, this was an initial report card to inform comparisons over time for a defined geographical region in relation to performance targets set by the GVCEH, within a social determinants of health framework.</p>
<p>The process of analyzing the report card data will differ with each respective indicator measure. Generally, both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques will be used in a homelessness report card. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193841X12439704">Newcomer and Wirtz (2004)</xref> provide a guide to help statistical technique selection for performance measurement system studies. Involvement of an experienced statistician in this aspect of the process is critical to enhance report card quality. Given that administrative data is often a primary source of information, limitations of the data sources and the analysis should be included in the final write-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0193841X12439704">
<title>Stakeholder Inspection</title>
<p>After the data has been analyzed, data submission agencies and the report card project stakeholders should review the results for accuracy. Any issues found during the review need to be resolved before drafting the final report card. In the GVCEH study, data providers were given copies of their specific analysis sections for review and feedback before the final report was drafted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0193841X12439704">
<title>Report Preparation</title>
<p>For a report card to be effective, it must be designed to deliver influential and credible messages to the targeted audiences in a language that they will understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193841X12439704">Weiss and Tschirhart 1994</xref>). For report cards on homelessness, typical audiences include policy makers, funding groups, and the community at large. Each of these groups is likely to have a unique set of requirements for the report card to meet.</p>
<p>Policy makers are not usually as concerned with the technical aspects of the report card (i.e., statistical confidence, confidence intervals, etc.) as they are with its driving messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193841X12439704">Newcomer and Wirtz 2004</xref>). Funding groups aim to see accountability (the organization is doing what it said it was going to do) and vision (the organization has clear targets for the future and knows how to reach them). Public opinion is a key driver for both policy decisions and public sector funding. Report cards designed for the community at large must clearly inform the public about the issues at hand, in a language that can be easily understood, while providing sufficient evidence to back such claims.</p>
<p>Literature suggests that it can be beneficial to provide scores for the report card results, which rate or rank the performance of the organization (based on the reported indicators). In our work, however, we stressed the importance of systems learning and wanted to engage collaboratively with agencies. Thus, we did not use scoring, as this can negatively affect the reported agencies through competition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0193841X12439704">
<title>Report Approval</title>
<p>It is important to ensure that stakeholders have time to conduct a review of the final draft of the report. To help facilitate this, drafts of the reports can be provided to the stakeholders as the report is being crafted. This can help to both prevent the report from veering off track (through early and frequent guidance from the project stakeholders) and to acclimatize the stakeholders to the report findings before it is publicly released.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0193841X12439704">
<title>Dissemination and Action</title>
<p>Several strategies can be used to help a report card reach its targeted audience during its dissemination phase. First, a single driving message (a slogan or jingle) for the report card is often most effective to promote its propagation throughout the targeted audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193841X12439704">Gormley Jr. 2004</xref>). Second, when releasing the report card, it is important to allow sufficient time for the audience to act on the report. Third, if funding organizations are among the targeted audience groups, release the report card at an opportune moment in the budgetary cycle (i.e., when funding proposals are being accepted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). Fourth, several channels of dissemination (i.e., newspapers, magazines, television, the Internet, journals, etc.) are needed to make it easy for the targeted audience to attain copies of the report card. Fifth, pulling out key messages or newsworthy stories is important when submitting news summaries or using social media. For example, changes in shelter usage were highlighted in media stories in our work. Lastly, the release of the report card can be promoted by linking it to an annual conference or meeting (this tactic was used as the release venue for the GVCEH report card).</p>
<p>“Reaching customers is an intermediate goal—not an end in itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). The ultimate goal of a report card is to incite positive, functional responses from the targeted audiences (be they informed community members, appeased organizational stakeholders, encouraged funders, enlightened management, or advised policy makers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193841X12439704">Halachmi 2005</xref>). A functional response increases the social value of the organization’s outcomes, whereas a dysfunctional response decreases the value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). Dysfunctional organizational responses include teaching to the test (where the organization focuses all of its efforts on improving the report card indicators and ignores other problem areas within their organization, creating the illusion of high performance) and blaming the messenger (where the organization blames others for their own poor report card performance levels, including the report card designer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12439704">Gormley and Weimer 1999</xref>). A well-balanced report card that is designed to meet the eight report card quality criteria (presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193841X12439704">Table 2</xref>) will protect against such political dysfunctional responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0193841X12439704">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Learning from past report card development efforts aids with the planning of the next report card iterations. The evaluation stage of a report card project is a time to reflect on the report card creation process and to inspect the quality of the resulting report card. If areas of weakness are found, steps should be taken to ensure that these aspects are improved in the next report card iterations. Questions to ask during this phase can include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What were the barriers to the report card and how could they be overcome?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Could the cost, time, or agency impact of the report card be reduced?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Were the right indicators selected?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Were there any indicators missing and if so, how could they be included next time?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Homelessness is a global problem that impacts the health and well-being of entire communities. Resolving homelessness requires the development of integrated, evidence-based strategies to address the social determinants of the epidemic. The HORN Framework, created through a literature review and synthesis, fills the need for a best practice process for report card development. The HORN Framework outlines the steps required to develop a systems-level homelessness evaluation—one that attempts to capture the broad determinants of homelessness through a community engaged process. Keys to the application of the framework include stakeholder input throughout the life of the project, using a layered strategy to indicator selection (focused not only on indicator quality but report card practicality), and targeted reporting (aimed at eliciting a functional user response).</p>
<p>This framework was applied to create a report on housing and supports for the Greater Victoria region (Greater Victoria to End Homelessness 2010). With the information presented in the report card, the GVCEH was able to provide decision makers and the public with current information on regional homelessness conditions, while having an information base to plan the execution of future housing and outreach program activities. Following the 2010 GVCEH report on housing and supports, subsequent reports have continued to use the HORN Framework (Pauly et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Future research is required to evaluate the HORN Framework’s use in other regions, as well as the effectiveness of using homelessness report card data in the planning and application of housing and outreach program activities. Continued review of the current best-practice literature will be required to maintain the framework’s relevance.</p>
