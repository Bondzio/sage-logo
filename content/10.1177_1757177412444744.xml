<abstract>
<p>A model was developed by an infection control department to assist in the delivery of change and innovations in a challenging and complex organisation. It was entitled UNIFIES and was based on the experience gained on previous projects to introduce and sustain changes in practice. The methodology and application included lean systems and social marketing principles. The model takes into account the requirement for leadership, teamwork and time to participate. The use of metrics to determine progress, success, failure and lessons learnt are a keys aspect of the model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is constant change in healthcare delivery and it is often difficult to ensure that important changes and innovations are not lost as the sheer amount and speed of change overwhelms people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412444744">Toffler, 1970</xref>). The benefits of reducing infection are manifold, particularly improving patient outcomes and the optimal use of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412444744">Burke, 2003</xref>). Though improving infection control is important, the time, effort and resource required competes with other equally important improvements and changes. It is therefore advantageous to make the introduction and assimilation of change related to infection prevention and control as simple and easy as possible.</p>
<p>The introduction of innovations and change across organisations can be onerous particularly where there are multiple sites with varied and inherent cultures. The infection control department in a large, complex acute teaching hospital recognised that the introduction of change, innovations, products and concepts need not be difficult and could sometimes be a relatively simple process.</p>
<p>A critical review using Six Sigma principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412444744">Pande and Holpp, 2002</xref>) was undertaken to understand key factors that influenced success and sustained change in staff behaviours and attitudes. This process assisted in the development of an understanding of the constraints, barriers and opportunities in the organisation and led to the creation of both a decision tree and model for introducing and sustaining innovation. This article describes the model that was developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177412444744">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>Our fundamental aim was to improve the experience of patients and reduce the risk of infection across the organisation. The underlying assumption was that this would be achieved if useful innovations and improvements were rapidly adopted. In order to achieve rapid adoption we focused on:</p>
<list id="list1-1757177412444744" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Minimising effort and optimising the chance of success when introducing products</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Optimal use of available resources and a reduction in time and effort wasted</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Maximising the contributions of the existing work force and enabling interdisciplinary working</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Minimising dependence on the core infection control team</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Developing appropriate and simple outcome measures.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177412444744">
<title>Theoretical background to the development of the model</title>
<p>In their study of successful companies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412444744">Peters and Waterman (2004)</xref> summarised the requirements for success. This included a ‘bias for action’, ‘productivity through people’, hands-on management, centralised values and minimal hierarchy. This reflected many of the attributes, values and ambitions of the organisation we were working in. A number of improvement methods and tools were used in the development of the UNIFIES tool.</p>
<p>Business improvement initiatives such as total quality management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412444744">Juran 1988</xref>) and quality circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412444744">Ishikawa, 1985</xref>) introduced changes systematically to improve outcomes. The source and impetus for change frequently came from the shop floor and was facilitated by local leaders. The strategic management theorist Peter Drucker argued that people are the source of innovation and change. He suggested that the team member with the most knowledge in the task at hand should temporarily lead the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412444744">Drucker, 2009</xref>). He advocated management by objectives and monitoring progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412444744">Drucker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The aspiration to deliver a cost effective and high quality public service is an underlying theme in the NHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412444744">Department of Health, 2011</xref>). Several industries have used Lean and Six Sigma to improve performance, with considerable success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412444744">Eckes, 2001</xref>). Multinational exemplars include Toyota and Motorola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412444744">Womack et al, 2007</xref>). Subsequently other organisations have integrated these systems into their operating practice and used them to introduce change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412444744">Eldridge et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Six Sigma and Lean systems or Lean thinking use a systematised approach and operational tools to improve performance. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Six Sigma is a process which ensures that barriers and opportunities can be recognised rapidly so that momentum can be created and maintained. Six Sigma uses statistical processes to measure defects and improvements against performance. Lean systems optimise performance, maximise opportunities and reduce wastage, which adds value. The measurement of progress and improvement is integral to both approaches.</p>
<p>Social marketing has been used in health care to inform and to change attitudes or behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412444744">Evans, 2006</xref>). Though effective it takes time to change many behaviours, e.g. stopping smoking, safe sex, and vaccination, and campaigns may run for many years before behaviours change. Important aspects of the marketing process are understanding the audience or customer and developing the messages to promote the desired effect. Concepts such as identifying the target audience, using appropriate media, keeping the messages fresh and not alienating people are important. An effective marketing and communication strategy had contributed to successful outcomes in previous projects undertaken by the team.</p>
<p>Using the experience and knowledge gained within the organisation, appropriate business improvement tools and strategic management theories were combined with marketing concepts and the UNIFIES model was developed and applied.</p>

<title>The UNIFIES model</title>
<p>Introducing innovations or changes to complex organisations requires momentum, vision and robust processes. Success is linked to leadership, teamwork and time to participate. Marketing the concept and measuring performance improvement are integral to the UNIFIES model, which is summarised below and detailed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1757177412444744">Box 1</xref>:</p>

<title>Summary of UNIFIES model</title>
<p><bold>U –Understanding the vision</bold></p>
<p>Understanding the vision is about communication. To understand, the potential participants and supporters need to be clear about what is expected. This should be explained to them and explored with them. They need to understand what will happen and the benefits of the change taking place. This is not just telling but also formulating a message which summarises the issues and current state of knowledge. This should recognise that there are different stakeholders and perspectives and actively work to reach these groups. This means that barriers such as jargon should be avoided. The objective is not to seek universal agreement but to achieve awareness of the vision or objective. Clear and visible leadership is crucial and marketing methodologies may be used.</p>
<p><bold>N – Negotiation of application</bold></p>
<p>One size does not fit all and variation in the use and application of innovations and change can be beneficial. The ‘adapt’ rather than simply ‘adopt’ approach allows participants to assume ownership and control. Boundaries of the limits of adaptation should be agreed and negotiated. This will allow for innovations in application and will potentially create side shoots of innovative practice. To some extent this is about giving permission but can also be about ensuring everyone knows when to seek permission rather than just doing their own thing. Teamwork and communication is crucial to understand how much latitude is acceptable.</p>
<p><bold>I – Investment in people and time</bold></p>
<p>Investing in people and time can be difficult as there is rarely spare time and capacity in many organisations. People need time to understand what is required and to deliver the outcomes. Initially the ‘doers’ will begin the process and recruit, enable and support the other people destined to complete the work. A project should be self-sustaining as efficiency and cost savings will follow. But it will need allocated time and people dedicated to do it initially to embed it and sustain it. In preference these people should already be part of the team rather than an additional ‘project manager’ brought in.</p>
<p><bold>F – Facilitation</bold></p>
<p>The facilitation aspect of the model relates to the process of empowering, embedding, creating opportunities, recognising opportunities and guiding people through the complexities of the organisation. The facilitator should be a credible role model who is preferably conversant in change management and Lean thinking. Successful facilitation of the process requires knowledge of the organisation and an external consultant should be a last resort.</p>
<p><bold>I – Investigation</bold></p>
<p>Investigation of barriers, failures and success should be routinely examined, and tools such as root cause analysis and after action review should be undertaken. Honest and simple feedback should be given to improve performance. Findings should be written up and shared. Investigation should be proactive, targeting broken systems and incompetence, which should be identified and rectified. This need not be high level investigation but it should be the norm for practitioners to actively reflect on practice and respond to lessons learnt.</p>
<p><bold>E – Education</bold></p>
<p>The education and training elements support the competencies required to deliver the vision and complete the process. The education delivered should be short, relevant and simple. Jargon and complexities should be avoided and the feedback on education delivered should be used to modify future planned sessions.</p>
<p><bold>S – Summarise</bold></p>
<p>The summarising of progress is important to keep everyone informed, motivated, engaged and to provide evidence of work undertaken for dissemination. A routine summary should be produced detailing why, how, where things go well and don’t go well. This may be in different formats depending on the audience.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>The UNIFIES model is about effective communication and engagement. It begins by recognising that there are different stakeholders and perspectives within an organisation and actively works to reach these groups to achieve awareness. Just telling people what to do is not enough, particularly when people may be happy with what they already have and require evidence to change. Selling the vision, demonstrating clear leadership and commitment are central concepts in the model. This should be supported by robust metrics, which calculate the benefits of the changes and determine where effort is most beneficial.</p>
<p>Gaining the respect and cooperation of some clinical groups can be difficult but can be improved by listening to their views and including them in decision making. Where possible initiation and implementation should be facilitated and staff should be empowered to deliver the project or objective. This may include recognising and creating opportunities and guiding staff through the complexities of the organisation.</p>
<p>The investigation aspect of the model identifies barriers, failures and success. There are many tools, which can be used, including SWOT, after action review, cost benefit, failure mode analysis, value analysis, risk assessment and gap analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412444744">Bicheno, 2004</xref>). Broken systems and incompetence should be identified and where possible rectified. Honest and simple feedback should be given.</p>
<p>Education and training should support the competencies required to deliver the vision. This subsequently becomes embedded in training programmes although it may need adjustment to meet the needs of different groups and lessons learnt.</p>
<p>Information about the initiative should be summarised routinely and cascaded to the organisation in multiple appropriate media forms for the various target audiences. This should include some details on both positive and negative aspects of the work undertaken, to enable modifications to take place and lessons to be shared.</p>
<p>The UNIFIES model negotiates boundaries for implementation and also facilitates and empowers variable application and introduction of innovations. It is negotiable and aims to unify people in working towards beneficial change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412444744">
<title>The model in use</title>
<p>The first project, which used the model, was the evaluation and introduction of a new intravenous line dressing. A number of key barriers to implementation emerged rapidly and included:</p>
<list id="list3-1757177412444744" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Inadequate resource – the dressing was more expensive than the current dressing in use.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resistance from people and groups – some did not see the need to change.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inability to reach the right people – the people who selected and applied the dressing were not all receiving regular product information and just reordered whatever was on the shelf.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inadequate feedback from the users of the products.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One part of the organisation recognised the value of the product to their area immediately and introduced it. It had properties that they valued and they calculated that this both reduced the risk to patients and would avoid the need to use additional securing products which they had previously used. Other areas chose to trial the product or resisted the trial or change. In these areas in-depth work was done with key staff to determine if their current practice was adequate with good patient outcomes. In several instances it became clear that a change of dressing would have no benefit as these were very short term intravenous lines, e.g. in theatres, and did not warrant a more expensive product designed for long term use.</p>
<p>In areas where there was an obvious benefit compared to the previous product, more work was undertaken to introduce the new product and to engage staff in evaluation. This focused on removing the perceived barriers including:</p>
<list id="list4-1757177412444744" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Producing a cost-benefit analysis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Negotiating the price with the manufacturer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Investment in education</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changing the ordering process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysis and feedback of patient outcomes</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Education about the dressing and internal marketing of the value of using the right dressing continued throughout the project. This was incorporated into core messages cascaded throughout the organisation. Specific messages and information targeted at staff that selected and applied intravenous dressings was produced with them and disseminated. Initially outcome monitoring was based on measuring the number of new dressings used and later it was incorporated into an audit of practice.</p>
<p>A summary of progress was provided regularly and included in infection control reports to the organisation. The dressing was adopted across most of the organisation. The model was subsequently used to introduce a series of innovations including isolation prioritisation, disinfectants and cleaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177412444744">
<title>Lessons learnt</title>
<p>At an early stage in the development of the model and work to introduce the first product, the team worked with a facilitator to identify the barriers to success. Apart from common barriers of time and money the most significant barriers were specific people. Some people within the organisation appeared to block initiatives, which they did not own, while others would appear to be supportive but actually do nothing to help. Conversely, in analysing projects or opportunities that had been successful, some people stood out as important although they did not necessarily have high status or significant power.</p>
<p>The consensus in the team about who were the barriers and who were the people who helped projects succeed was high. The people who were helpful were placed on ‘the golden list of doers’ as their involvement in projects invariably meant success and if they said they would do something they generally did it. People who were identified as barriers or passive resisters were generally avoided but it was recognised that they had to be considered.</p>
<p>Using available staff rather than extra staff as agents of change meant that if there was an outbreak or a significant issue that the project could stall very quickly. This is a particular problem in infection prevention and control as the workload and pattern of work required can be unpredictable. This led to a reorganisation of the team’s workload to ensure project work could continue. A secondary list of ‘acknowledged doers’ was also developed. These were people with a track record of delivery who knew the organisation and who could be seconded for short periods and their posts back-filled or who would actively contribute when required.</p>
<p>The final lessons learnt were already widely known. Projects required clear, agreed outlines and timescales. They also required simple, realistic and pragmatic objectives. This was particularly important when many people were involved and progress was being monitored.</p>
<p>It was also important to have an end point with a final summary report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757177412444744" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Business improvements and strategic management theories were combined with marketing concepts to produce a model to successfully introduce innovations. The UNIFIES model is a tool which can be adapted and modified as required by users. It is an adaption and modification of many previous approaches to change. It is a framework of principles to guide practice and should not be applied rigidly as it should take into account the context and circumstances. Although it was initially designed as a tool for infection prevention and control innovations and change, it could also be used in other fields.</p>
