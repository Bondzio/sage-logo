<p>This book by Julius-Kei Kato deals with hybridity (in a diasporic sense) from a standpoint of theology in the context of North American Asian experiences. For him, as a Filipino-Japanese Roman Catholic theologian who has lived in Manila, Tokyo, Rome, San Francisco and Toronto, and is currently residing in London, Ontario, Canada, the issues of hybridity and diaspora are fundamentally important in his theological thinking. His subjective positions and particular experiences become the channel through which important theological subject matters, including liberation theology and postmodern theology, are communicated. </p>
<p>Beginning by mapping the conceptual frameworks, Kato introduces the postcolonial theory of hybridity, diaspora and culture, while also delineating Asian American experiences ranging from immigration history, race and diaspora identity to Asian American theologies. Such highly theoretical frameworks are followed by more ethnographical and descriptive studies of five major theologians who are central to Asian and Asian American theologies: C. S. Song, Jung Young Lee, Peter Phan, Fumitaka Matsuoka, Rita Nakashima Brock. In this section, such crucial concepts for establishing Asian American theologies as story theology, marginality, betwixt-and-between, holy insecurity, and interstitial integrity, are introduced, revisited, and critically examined. Kato thinks of these concepts as “ingredients” (233), necessary to make a healthy meal, and seeks a relevant “recipe” in order to “create a good dish” (233). </p>
<p>In this search for a recipe, one may have to draw on the resources of several partners in conversations because there is no pre-set recipe book that can fully serve the multiple and heterogeneous tastes of North Asian American hybrid diaspora Christians. These partners include the classic document Dominus Iesus (1658). By as much light being shed on Christological and ecclesiological roles as on the colonial history of Christian missions, the influence (and distortion) of the religious and cultural identities of Asian (and other non-European) Christians in Asia, North America and elsewhere, is revealed. Such seemingly opposite realities, one that proclaims Christian supremacy, while the other is disclosing and resisting against such supremacy, Kato argues, must be brought together as ingredients to make a good dish, even if such attempts reluctantly involve “interruptions to conversation” (306). After all, that is how the process of canonization worked: “like a blender into which various kinds of fruit and vegetables” were added (314). His final remark is poignant: “an Asian-American hermeneutics based on diasporic hybridity can be a potent tool for deepening our understanding of one of the most important and urgent phenomena at present—the hybridization that is occurring at all levels, particularly religious levels. It can, furthermore, aid us to make our discourses about faith and God more intelligible to an increasingly hybridized generation” (324–325).</p>
<p>This book is not without its weakness. On an editorial level there are misspellings found in authors’ names (e.g., Catherine Keller as Katherine, pp. 18 and 26) and references are also missed in the index. In terms of its format, the font size is too small to read for an extended period of time, and there are too many subtitles, which keep the reader from following the flow of the arguments. Finally, some materials seem to repeat themselves in the concluding remarks of every chapter. Given the lengthy pages with small fonts, the author could have edited the work in a more succinct manner without redundancy. With the recognition of these minor weaknesses, this book is an important addition to the scholarly field. </p>
