      <abstract>
        <p>Genesis 43.31a contains the only description of someone washing his or her face in the
          Hebrew Bible. Did the author purposefully select his words to signify a crucial junction
          in the narrative? Few examples from the biblical corpus and extra-biblical witnesses can
          be cited for comparison. Locating the narrative of Genesis 42–43 in its specific context,
          descriptions of face-washing from recovered Egyptian witnesses suggest that a foreign
          motif is the influence for the terse, yet precise, description of a Hebrew protagonist
          coping with his emotions in another part of the world.</p>

      <title>‭זינפ ץחךיז‬: A Unique Description</title>
      <p>Genesis 43.29–31 portrays a scene from the second of two meetings between Joseph and his
        brothers in Egypt. Within these verses, Joseph's inability to control his emotions after
        seeing Benjamin (43.29–30) and his strength in regaining his composure (43.31b) provide
        abundant material for commentators. Little, if any, attention is directed towards the
        description of Joseph washing his face in Gen. 43.31a: ‘Then he washed his face’ (‭זינפ
        ץחךיז‬). The absence of significant commentary on this half-verse is not staggering—what
        else should the protagonist do after a good cry? And what else can Joseph do to hide his
        emotions from his brothers? Medieval rabbis do not discuss Joseph washing his face, and the
        omission could be explained by the lack of any significant solecisms or halakha in Gen.
        43.31a. Modern commentators, for the most part, are interested in Joseph's psychological
            welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213492842">1</xref></sup> Should we,
        however, overlook this seemingly quotidian description of a person unwilling to reveal any
        emotion in front of his siblings?</p>
      <p>I propose that the unique juxtaposition of two widely attested words in the biblical
        corpus, the verb ‭ץחך‬ (‘to wash’) and its object ‭םינפ‬ (‘face’), is noteworthy. Genesis
        43.31a contains the only explicit description of anyone washing his or her face in the
        Hebrew Bible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213492842">2</xref></sup> Focusing on
        ‭ץחך‬ within the pentateuchal corpus, I shall note some of its descriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213492842">3</xref></sup> In order to prevent any
        defilement of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s earthly abode and its abandonment by the deity, P (the
        Priestly corpus) presents a multitude of scenarios that demand for a person to bathe in
            water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213492842">4</xref></sup> In contrast to
        the washing rituals described in P, J (the Yahwistic source) contains multiple accounts of a
        host inviting a sojourner to wash their feet (Gen. 18.4; 19.2; 24.32; 43.24) and the
        description of Joseph washing his face (43.31a).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213492842">5</xref></sup> The uniqueness of Gen. 43.31a is accentuated
        in the Joseph Story. In the first of the brothers’ two visits to Egypt (chs. 42–44), Joseph
        recognizes his brothers, cries in private, and rejoins them (42.24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213492842">6</xref></sup> In the brothers’ second visit, Joseph
        recognizes Benjamin and, similar to the prior meeting, he cries in seclusion. Yet unlike the
        first encounter, Joseph washes his face before rejoining his brothers. A question arises
        from this discrepancy: Why does Joseph wash his face after the <italic>second</italic> time
        he cries but not the first? In other words, why did the author write this detail on only one
        of the two occasions?</p>
      <p>Differences between the first and second meetings may offer an explanation. The sight of
        Benjamin in the second meeting might account for Gen. 43.31a, but is Benjamin that
        significant a figure for the phrase ‭ןינפ ץחךין‬ to occur at this junction of the Joseph
        Story? A more notable difference between the two accounts lies in Joseph's actions after he
        returns to his brothers. In the first meeting Joseph speaks to his brothers and confines
        Simeon (42.24b) but Joseph orders a meal in the second meeting (43.31b). Genesis 43.32b
        informs the reader that the Egyptians considered it an abomination to eat with Hebrews. In
        Lev. 22.5–6, H (the Holiness Code) requires one who contacts an unclean swarming thing or
        human being to wash his body in water before partaking in the ‭םישךק‬ meal. Put together,
        one could surmise that Joseph washes his face to purge himself of the uncleanliness caused
        by contact with his (‘foreign’) brothers before he can eat. There are, however, three
        notable problems with this proposal. First, if Joseph was to wash before a meal as required
        in Lev. 22.5–6, then we should expect him to wash his body ([‭תא‬] ‭ץחךין ןךשב‬) and not his
        face. Second, the description of food (‭םחל‬) in Gen. 43.31b can hardly be equated to H's
        ‭םישךק‬ meal. Third, the unclean person in Lev. 22.5 expands upon one afflicted with bodily
        impurities described in P (Lev. 12–15);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213492842">7</xref></sup> in contrast, Joseph's brothers display no remarkable bodily impurities.
        Joseph washing his face as a purification ritual before a meal (along the lines of Lev.
        22.5–6) is therefore suggestive but not entirely convincing. In Gen. 43.30–31, washing the
        face is more appropriate for someone who has cried, rather than for someone about to partake
        in a meal. Still, the meal itself remains a distinct feature of the second meeting and the
        placement of Gen. 43.31a within this pericope becomes apparent after a more thorough
        examination of the motif of face-washing.</p>
      <p>How are we then to understand the seemingly mundane event of Joseph washing his face when
        it is the only explicit example in the Hebrew Bible? ‭ץחךין‬ in Gen. 43.31a continues a
        chain of <italic>waw</italic>-consecutives within a narrative sequence that begins in
            43.29.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213492842">8</xref></sup> We may expand
        the sample size by considering the causal relationship between ‭ץחךין‬ and the preceding
          <italic>waw</italic>-consecutive ‭דביו‬ in 43.30b. Two other narratives in the Hebrew
        Bible juxtapose these two verbs in close proximity. In Exod. 2.5–6, Pharaoh's daughter
        washes (‭ךאיה־לע ץחךל העךפ־תב ךךתו‬) and hears the child Moses crying (‭הככ‬). The
        relationship between ‭ץחך‬ and ‭ךאיה־לצ‬ in Exod. 2.5–6, however, lacks the causality in
        Gen. 43.30b-31a where the same person washes after crying. In 2 Sam. 12.20–21, after David
        is informed that the child born to Bathsheba is dead, he rises from the ground, washes,
        anoints himself, changes his garments, worships, and eats (…‭זחתשיז‬ ‭הזהי־תיב‬ ‭אביו‬
        ‭ותלמש‬ ‭ףלחיו‬ ‭ךםיו‬ ‭ץחדיז‬ ‭ץךאהמ‬ ‭ךןך‬ ‭םקין‬ ‭לבאיו‬). David's servants are perplexed
        by his actions, noting that David fasted and wept while the child was alive (‭ךבתו‬ ‭תמי‬
        ‭יח‬ ‭רליה‬ ‭רובצב‬). This response implies that weeping occurs before washing but it is
        difficult to ascertain that David weeping over the child in 2 Sam. 12.20 is the sole impetus
        for washing in v. 21, whereas the causality between ‭הבב‬ and ‭ץחך‬ in Gen. 43.30b-31a is
        more pronounced. The examples from Exodus and 2 Samuel provide little, if any, understanding
        towards an elucidation of the act of face-washing contained in Gen. 43.31a.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213492842">9</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Extra-biblical witnesses do not provide significant insights toward interpreting ‭וינפ‬
        ‭ץחךיו‬. The attestations of <italic>šmn rḥṢ</italic> from the recovered eighth-century
        Samaria ostraca likely have no bearing on the discussion at hand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213492842">10</xref></sup> Among the Qumran manuscript evidence, the
        Temple Scroll from Cave 11 contains ‭ץחך‬ but these attestations do not describe a washing
        of the face.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213492842">11</xref></sup> Finally, I
        shall note the description of Aseneth washing her face in the Hellenistic composition
          <italic>Joseph and Aseneth</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213492842">12</xref></sup> In <italic>Jos. Asen</italic>. 14.12, Aseneth receives a commandment
        from a divine messenger to wash her face and hands in ‘living water’ (‭καì‬ ‭νίψαι‬ ‭τò‬
        ‭πρόσωπόν‬ ‭σου‬ ‭καì‬ ‭τας‬ ‭χεΐράς‬ ‭σου‬ ‭ΰδατι‬ ‭ζῶντι‬), which she fulfils in 14.15
        (‭καì‬ ‭ενίψατο‬ ‭τάς‬ ‭χεΐρας‬ ‭αùτής‬ ‭καì‬ ‭τò‬ ‭πρόσωπον‬ ‭αùτής‬ ‭ΰδατι‬
            ‭ζῶντι‬).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213492842">13</xref></sup> It is
        difficult, however, to infer that this account offers any insight into the biblical
        description of Joseph washing his face. Aseneth washing her face is performed within a
        series of actions that initiates a process of proselytization; in contrast, nowhere in the
        Joseph Story (in any source or layer) is the impression made that Joseph experiences
        conversion at any point after he washes his face in Gen. 43.31a.</p>

    <sec id="sec2-0309089213492842">
      <title>Face-Washing in Ancient Egyptian Literature</title>
      <p>The lack of biblical and extra-biblical witnesses of an Israelite explicitly washing his or
        her face prompts us to consider the Egyptian context of the Joseph Story. The Israelite
        author has gone to great lengths to demonstrate Joseph's assimilation in Egypt before the
        brothers’ arrival.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213492842">14</xref></sup> The
        multiple allusions to Egypt suggest that the Israelite narrator was familiar with the land
        and the customs of its people, but to what degree this narrator objectively portrays actual
        Egyptian practices—and how accurate his sources are—remains a scholarly debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213492842">15</xref></sup> Still, the question of whether
        or not a recovered Egyptian parallel can shed any insight into the motif of face-washing in
        Gen. 43.31a remains to be explored. Recovered reliefs from ancient Egyptian temples depict
        the ritual act of purification of pouring water over the head of an individual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213492842">16</xref></sup> Among the inscriptional
        evidence, three recovered sources from Egypt that predate the (Yahwist's) Joseph Story,
        which I date before the post-exilic period, are noteworthy for containing descriptions of
        washing the face. These sources contain <italic>iʿj ḥr</italic>, which represents the act of
            face-washing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213492842">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>(1) Three utterances from the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 <sc>bce</sc>)
        describe the washing of a pharaoh's face during his journey through the afterworld. In an
        utterance for Teti (2323-2291 <sc>bce</sc>), divine beings—male and female—wash Teti's
            face:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213492842">18</xref></sup></p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>The face of Teti has been washed by the gods, male and female: Imseti, Hapi, Duamutef,
          and Qebehsenuef (have washed) the right side of Teti, which is Horus;
          Djenderu-bark-striker, at the fore of his two papyrus columns, Nephthys, and Eyes-Forward,
          the left side of Teti, which is Seth. (PT 359 §601)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>The other two references to face-washing are found in utterances composed for Pepi II
        (2246-2152 <sc>bce</sc>):</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>You have been greeted by Sokar, Pepi Neferkare, and your face has been washed by Great
          Beard. (PT 682 §2042)</p>
        <p>They have come having gotten for you the clean waters from their father, that they may
          cleanse you, that they may cleanse you with natron, Pepi Neferkare. You shall lift the sky
          with your hand and lay down the earth with your foot. Let cool water be poured at this
          Pepi Neferkare's gateway and the face of every god will be washed. (PT 685 §§2066–67)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>These three utterances present the motif of face-washing as a ritual in the afterlife
        performed by one deity for another as a greeting during a (deified) pharaoh's ascent through
        the afterworld (in §§2066–67, it could be suggested that the gods washing themselves is
        essential for Pepi's passage). The motif of face-washing as a greeting is difficult to apply
        to Gen. 43.31a for at least three reasons: first, if washing the face signifies a greeting
        in the Joseph Story, then I would expect this act to occur during the initial encounter
        between the brothers in Genesis 42; second, there are no active deities in Genesis 42–44;
        third, in the Pyramid Texts, the act of face-washing is performed within a divine council;
        in contrast, Joseph washes his face in seclusion from others.</p>
      <p>(2) The epic commonly known as The Tale of Sinuhe (c. 1800 <sc>bce</sc>) contains a single
        attestation of <italic>iʿ ḥr</italic> in line 55 (Pap. Berlin 3022). Alan Gardiner opines
        that the literal sense of ‘washing the face’ is awkward and, through an emendation, proposes
        a metaphorical reading:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213492842">19</xref></sup></p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>54 A curber of horns is he, a weakener of hands; his enemies</p>
        <p>55 cannot marshall their ranks. Vengeful [<italic>iʿ ḥr</italic>; emend to <italic>iʿ
            ib</italic>] is he, a smasher of foreheads; none can stand</p>
        <p>56 in his neighbourhood. Long of stride is he, destroying the fugitive;</p>
        <p>57 there is no ending for any that turns his back to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213492842">20</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>If the text is to be read metaphorically, revenge is difficult to apply to Genesis 42–43.
        When Joseph recognizes his brothers, he does not harbour any thoughts of revenge against
        them. Joseph's scheme to confine Simeon in Gen. 42.24b is perhaps vengeful, but at the
        resolution of the narrative Joseph emphatically does not demonstrate a grudge against his
        brothers (Gen. 50.15–16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213492842">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>(3) In the eighth-century <sc>bce</sc> Triumph Stela of Piye (Pi'ankhy), recovered from a
        sanctuary at present day Gebel Barkal, Sudan,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213492842">22</xref></sup> line 102 contains a reference to
        face-washing. Here, Piye is directed to wash his face in the River of Nun:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>101 His majesty proceeded to the camp, which was on the west of ʿItj: His purification
          was performed. He was cleansed in</p>
        <p>102 the pool of <italic>Kebeh</italic>. He washed his face in the river of
            <italic>Noun</italic>, where Reʿ washes his face.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213492842">23</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Purification is explicitly stated as the rationale for Piye washing his face in a body of
            water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213492842">24</xref></sup> It might be
        noteworthy that Piye and Joseph are foreigners who are elevated in Egypt, but the
        similarities likely end with this point. If purification can be transposed from the
        description in line 102 of the Stela on to Gen. 43.31a, then a question remains: What is
        Joseph purifying himself from? For reasons stated above, I remain hesitant to read Gen.
        43.31a as an act of purification.</p>
      <p>In the above examples from the Pyramid Texts, Sinuhe, and the Triumph Stela, I noted
        illustrations of face-washing that may offer an explanation for ‭וינפץחדיו‬ in Gen. 43.31a.
        Three (in addition to any other possible) attestations certainly do not allow for the
        conclusion that a ritual described within this sample of Egyptian literature directly
        influenced a half-verse in Genesis. The sample size may even be reduced when accessibility
        is considered. Even if Sinuhe was in wide circulation, the lexical difficulty of the single
        reference to face-washing remains. An Israelite would likely have to see Piye's Triumph
        Stela first-hand (in Lower Nubia) and the Pyramid Texts would have been inaccessible to many
        people. These recovered witnesses, however, suggest that face-washing circulated among a
        variety of contexts and projected a variety of images over an extended period of time in
        Egypt. The Israelite author who placed the Joseph Story in its Egyptian context partially
        relied on this particular literary motif to strengthen his presentation of an Egyptianized
        Joseph and contrast Joseph with his Hebrew brothers.</p>

      <title>An Israelite Use of a Foreign Motif</title>
      <p>In the Joseph Story, there are many allusions to Egypt and reports of its cultic practices.
        I suggest that the terse, yet unique, detail of face-washing in Gen. 43.31a is properly
        accounted for by the Egyptian background of the Joseph Story. Joseph washing his face
        maintains the fabrication that he is an Egyptian official. This Israelite author juxtaposes
        Joseph performing this local act in v. 31a with the report in vv. 31b-32 that the Egyptians
        considered eating with Hebrews an abomination. To heighten the fiction of Joseph as an
        Egyptian high official, the Israelite author writes ‭וינפץחדיו‬ in the second—and not the
        first—encounter between the brothers.</p>
      <p>But this description raises another question: With <italic>what</italic> does Joseph wash
        his face? We should expect that Joseph washes his face with water. As suggested in the
        multiple descriptions of a host bringing out water for his guests (J) or in ritual bathing
        (P; H), water is important for washing in Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213492842">25</xref></sup> Water, however, is not mentioned in Gen.
            43.31a.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213492842">26</xref></sup> The
        intentional omission of water in Gen. 43.31a is suggested by the recovered Egyptian
        witnesses. Washing in water is common to Egypt and Israel but the above Egyptian witnesses
        suggest that washing in water in Egypt conveys a ritualistic and mystifying power that is
        observed within the Egyptian cult. In contrast, in the Yahwistic cult, water retains its
        capacity as a sacred and ritualistic disinfectant but is mostly stripped of significant
        occult powers.</p>
      <p>Whereas the Israelite author reports Egyptian realia to present an authentic story of
        Joseph and his brothers in Egypt, Gen. 43.31a betrays this author's cultic sensibilities.
        For this author, Joseph's fidelity to Y<sc>hwh</sc> must not be ambiguous and Joseph,
        despite his assimilation as an Egyptian, cannot be portrayed as washing his face with water
        in Egypt due to its local cultic significance. In whatever manner an Israelite author may
        have understood or had access to Egyptian ritual customs, I stress an important point: any
        source (or compositional layer) of the Joseph Story should not be expected to reproduce
        actual Egyptian customs because the Israelite author, especially a devotee of Y<sc>hwh</sc>,
        was not interested in accurately portraying such customs when they conflicted with his own
        cultic (specifically, Yahwistic) ideologies and practices. In this article, I suggest that
        the rare and laconic description of face-washing in Gen. 43.31a was determined by the
        Egyptian location of the Joseph Story. An Israelite author delicately alludes to a foreign
        motif in his presentation of a credible narrative set in another part of the world.</p>

        <p>‭ץחך‬ is not to be confused with other verbs for washing, especially ‭ףטש‬ or ‭סככ‬ (for
          a full discussion, see <italic>ThWAT</italic>, VII, pp. 482–90). The distinction between
          these verbs is clear in P, with the strongest example contained in Lev. 15.11: anyone
          touched by one with a genital discharge (‭בו‬) without thoroughly rinsing (‭ףטש‬) his
          hands with water, laundering (‭סככ‬) his clothes, and bathing (‭ץחך‬) in water remains
          unclean until the evening. Additionally, any wooden vessel touched by the ‭בו‬ is to be
          rinsed (‭ףטש‬) in water (v. 12; in the administration of the ‭תאטח‬ in P, a bronze vessel
          used to boil the sacrifice is also rinsed [‭ףטש‬; Lev. 6.21 <sc>et</sc> 28]). The lexical
          distinction between washing (‭ץחך‬) oneself in water and washing (‭סככ‬) their own article
          of clothing is explicit elsewhere in Priestly legislation: concerning a scale-diseased
          person at the time of purification (Lev. 14.8, 9); concerning one who contacted (abnormal
          or normal) genital discharges (15.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, 27); after
          priests release the scapegoat (16.26) and discard the remains of the ‭תאטח‬ offering
          (16.28) when atonement is made for the Tabernacle; after the preparation of a bovine
          victim for a mixture used for purification purposes (Num. 19.7, 8); and for the clean
          person (‭ךהטה‬) who attends to anyone in contact or in close proximity to a corpse or
          grave (19.19). In H, bathing oneself in water and washing their clothes is required after
          the consumption of a carcass (Lev. 17.15–16).</p>

        <p>In addition to the legislation cited above: Aaron and his sons are required to wash their
          hands and feet before entering the Tent of Meeting (Exod. 29.4; 30.18–21; 40.12, 30–32);
          upon their consecration as priests, Aaron and his sons are washed (Lev. 8.6); on the Day
          of Purgation, Aaron is instructed to bathe before and after he performs his high priestly
          duties (16.4, 24). Specifically within the Priestly corpus, the description of washing in
          water belongs in legal language (<italic>Gesetzessprache</italic>) but is absent, and thus
          implied, in non-legal texts (cf. Exod. 29.17; Lev. 9.14). See Karl <italic>Elliger,
            Leviticus</italic> (HAT, 4; Tübingen: Mohr, 1966), pp. 187–88 n. 53. In H, one who
          contacts a swarming object (‭ץךש‬) or an unclean human must wash in water before partaking
          in the ‭םישךק‬ meal (Lev. 22.5–6). I shall discuss the relevance of this H legislation to
          Gen. 43.31a below.</p>

        <p>Although not as extensive as the Priestly corpus, J also distinguishes between ‭ץחך‬ and

          article of dress: ‘garment’ (‭שוכל‬; Gen. 49.11) and ‘clothes’ (‭הלמש‬; Exod. 19.10,

        <p>Classically, the visits in Gen. 42–43 are doublets of the same visit. See Julius
          Wellhausen, <italic>Die Composition des Hexateuchs und die historichen Bücher</italic>
          (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1899), pp. 55–58. This source-critical solution to Gen. 42–43,
          however, presents serious difficulties concerning narrative continuity in the classical
          documents, J and E. In the present study I employ the source-critical assignment of the
          two visits to Egypt (Gen. 42.1–45.28) to J offered by Baruch Schwartz in his ‘J and E in
          the Joseph Saga’ (unpublished paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society of
          Biblical Literature, New Orleans, November 2009). Schwartz argues for an unprecedented
          source-critical solution to identifying J and E in Gen. 37–50. For other literary
          reconstructions that maintain the unity of Gen. 42–44, see Donald B. Redford, <italic>A
            Study of the Biblical Story of Joseph (Genesis 37–50</italic>) (VTSup, 20; Leiden: E.J.

          (WMANT, 57; Neukirchen–Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1984), pp. 231–34. In principle, I
          agree that Gen. 42–44 is not a doublet but rather a unified narrative that reports two
          consecutive visits of Joseph's brothers to Egypt.</p>

          author ‘was not so well acquainted with Egypt’, see <italic>Redford, Biblical Story of

        <p>Due to its Nubian origins, the Triumph Stela's value as representative of Egypt in the
          eighth century <sc>bce</sc> (and in turn its potential relevance for the Joseph Story) may
          be contested, but in support of its value as a source of information for this period, see

        <p>Piye washing his face in a body of water is one among other purification rituals
          described in the Triumph Stela. Line 97 contains the purification of a place with natron
          and lines 110, 141–42 describe a king undertaking purification with a divine oath. See
          also Piye's instruction to his army before their entry into Egypt in line 12: ‘Quand vous
          arrivez dans Thèbes; devant Ipet-sout, entrez dans l'eau, purifiez-vous dans le fleuve,
          habilliezvous de lin pur; posez l'arc, déposez la flèche’ (in Grimal,

        <p>In addition to the above references cited from J, P, and H, other descriptions of washing
          (‭ץחך‬) in water are in D (Deut. 23.11 [<sc>et</sc> 12]); Ezek. 16.4, 9. Judith contains
          two descriptions of the heroine washing in water in 10.3 (καì περιεκλνσατo τo σωμα νδατι)
          and 12.7 (κα` επαπτíζετo εν τη παρεμβoλη επì τηs πηγηs τoν νδατos). Descriptions of
          washing in a river are elsewhere in Dtr (‭ץחך‬ and ‭לבט‬ in 2 Kgs 5.10–14) and in both
          recensions of Tob. 6.2 (<sc>lxx</sc><sup>BA</sup>: τò δε παιδαριoν κατεβη περικλνσασαι;
            <sc>lxx</sc><sup>S</sup>: και κατεβητò παιδíoν περινíασαι τoνs πòδαs εís τòν Tíγριν

        <p>Gen. 19.2 is the other notable exception in J. Situated in Sodom, Lot invites the
          ‭םיכאלמ‬ to stay and wash their feet but there is no mention of water. The lack of water
          may be an intentional omission (cf. Gen. 13.10 [J]: ‭הקשמ הלכ יכ ןךךיה ךככ לכ תא אךיו‬)
          that foreshadows the inhospitality of the Sodomites against the sojourners in Gen. 19.</p>
