<abstract>
<p>In 1645 the Portuguese historian Francisco Manuel de Melo published the <italic>Historia de los movimientos, separación y guerra de Cataluña</italic>, an account of the so-called ‘Rebellion of Catalonia’ against the Spanish monarch Philip IV. Although the accuracy of the book has been the subject of controversy, very little has been said about its discursive strategies, in spite of its having been considered ‘an exceptional work’ (Menéndez y Pelayo 1893) and ‘full of perfections’ (Rosell 1852) in terms of its <italic>elocutio</italic>. The aim of this paper is to analyze the historiographical strategies that govern the construction of the <italic>Historia</italic>, in an attempt to place the early modern writing of history within a tradition that goes back to the ancient rhetoricians. In the particular case of Melo, the most immediate reference is that of the <italic>Dell’arte istorica</italic> (1639), a treatise by the Italian Jesuit Agostino Mascardi, specifically mentioned and praised by Melo.</p>

<body>
<p>Tolstoy’s readers might remember that in the skirmishes preceding the Battle of Austerlitz Nikolai Rostov, one of the main characters in <italic>War and Peace</italic>, is wounded in his arm. When his comrades ask him about the circumstances of the incident, the narrator does not specify Rostov’s answer; what we read instead is a rather general comment on how Rostov reported the facts ‘just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was’, since ‘to tell the truth is very difficult, and … men are rarely capable of it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691411428389">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The nature of historical truth is a matter that philosophers and historiographers have been debating for centuries. For quite a few early modern historians and theoreticians the mention of truth, the consideration of history as <italic>lux veritatis</italic>, is just, I presume, a faint recollection of a passage in Cicero’s <italic>De oratore</italic> that had by then become commonplace. That is precisely what I find in the works of don Francisco Manuel de Melo, the Portuguese historian who wrote about, among other things, the so-called ‘Catalan Revolt’ or <italic>Revolta dels segadors</italic> (‘Harvesters’ revolt’) of 1640. The rhetorical character of the allusion to truth is important because it indicates how highly codified the writing of history was at the time. That implies neither that Melo’s account is necessarily deceitful (as some authors claim), nor, on the other hand, that his writings manifest a ‘critical and distanced conscience’ (as others hold).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691411428389">2</xref></sup> The goal of this essay, however, is not to find out whether Melo’s narrative matches the facts, but rather how he has built his account, and why he has chosen to do it in such a way. I will thus examine the <italic>Guerra de Cataluña</italic> in order to analyze its rhetorical design, and to check how Melo’s report is connected to certain historiographical trends of his time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691411428389">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries that he scattered throughout several of his works show that Melo was concerned with historiographical issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691411428389">4</xref></sup> Some scholars have emphasized the need to analyze Melo’s historical oeuvre in conjunction with ‘sixteenth- and seventeenth-century historiographical and rhetorical treatises [which] are indispensable in decoding his discourse’, since his writings abide by ‘a set of norms previously defined by rhetoric’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691411428389">5</xref></sup> However, the present state of research amounts to only a few generic simplifications, and further and more complex clarifications are needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691411428389">6</xref></sup> One of the places in which Melo deals with historiographical matters is the <italic>Hospital das Letras</italic>, where he admiringly quotes the Italian Jesuit Agostino Mascardi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691411428389">7</xref></sup> Let us, then, begin by examining the ideas of this one theoretician mentioned by Melo, in order to understand the <italic>War of Catalonia</italic> in the light of the rules stated by Mascardi’s <italic>Dell’arte historica</italic>, published in 1636, nine years before Melo’s <italic>War</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691411428389">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will start by acknowledging that Mascardi’s treatise definitely succeded (after earlier attempts by George of Trebizond and his disciple Giovanni Pontano in the fifteenth century) in spreading a compact combination of Latin and Hellenistic rhetorical threads in the field of historiography: Hermogenes of Tarsus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Demetrius of Phalerum are adduced side by side with Cicero and Quintilian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691411428389">9</xref></sup> <italic>Dell’arte historica</italic> went through several editions in the 1600s, and was reissued in 1859 and in 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691411428389">10</xref></sup> Melo praises the work – which apparently had aroused great expectations even before its publication – as a ‘book of great and successful study’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691411428389">11</xref></sup> Several sections of the text are of interest to us, and more specifically Book V, the last and longest of all, entitled ‘Della struttura dell’istoria’, and composed of nine chapters, which will lead me through my analysis of Melo’s text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691411428389">12</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-0265691411428389"><title>Amplification, Evidentia and ‘Celerità’: The Motion of Affects</title>
<p>The characteristic that has been most widely noticed in the <italic>War of Catalonia</italic> is the author’s ability to endow his account with great ‘vividness’. Let us take, for example, the moment when he describes the preparations for the Battle of Montjuic in Book V:<disp-quote>
<p>At the sound of the bugle the whole army began to move in the way it had been ordered by the corporals; extending thus through the field, the army presented a vision as beautiful to the eye as was pitiful to the word: feathers and taffetas waved colorfully; the breastplates glittered in streaks on the squadron; the sound of the moving train of horses was mingled with the discordant murmur of cuirasses; the artillery carts and baggage, ordered in lines resembling streets, seemed like a walking populated city; the drums, fifes, trumpets and bugles completely dispelled the raw recruits’ fears, giving each of them spirit and courage anew; the order and the disposition of the army’s movements announced the success of the venture; the courage of the soldiers promised a great victory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691411428389">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The passage emphasizes the visual, and in general, sensory aspects of the scene so that the reader can ‘see’ it rather than ‘read’ it, a phenomenon called <italic>evidentia</italic> or <italic>enargeia</italic> by rhetoricians. In order to achieve <italic>evidentia</italic>, classical rhetoric recommended a few techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691411428389">14</xref></sup> Some of them are present here: catalogues of sensory details, accumulations of individual features, and enumerations in form of <italic>distributio</italic>, which create a pleasant and vivid description, such as Mascardi mentioned as early as in Book I, and fully developed in Book V.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691411428389">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the discussion about the style of history opens with an allusion to <italic>amplificatio</italic>, a resource forbidden by some authors, but admitted by Pontano and strongly recommended by Mascardi as an effective instrument to move emotions. With amplification the writer will be able to ponder all the circumstances that surround the fact, and the narrative will reach the reader more efficiently. Mascardi talks about two ways of developing <italic>amplificatio</italic>, two ‘virtues of elocution’: <italic>enargeia</italic> and ‘celerità’. <italic>Enargeia</italic>, considered ‘marvelous’ by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, corresponds to what Cicero calls <italic>evidentia</italic> or <italic>illustris explanatio</italic>, and springs from an ‘accurate and minute account, where nothing is overlooked … [It] puts the narrated things so evidently under the eyes of the reader that we seem not to read them but see them’, and so the truth more easily gets to the readers. <italic>Enargeia</italic> must be used for two reasons: because without it history becomes ‘imperfect and lacking’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691411428389">16</xref></sup> and because it contributes to amplification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691411428389">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second virtue is ‘celerità’. <italic>Celeritas</italic> is the word that some humanists had used to translate the Greek term <italic>gorgotes</italic>, the fourth of Hermogenes’ seven forms or types of style, as Marcardi points out. Modern translators have chosen to translate <italic>gorgotes</italic> as ‘vivacité’ (Patillon) or ‘viveza’ (Ruiz Montero), which indicates how close ‘celerità’ and <italic>enargeia</italic> are, and explains why Mascardi pairs them together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691411428389">18</xref></sup> In Book IV, devoted to style, Mascardi had explained Hermogenes’ rhetorical system, and now, in Book V, he specifically addresses the form <italic>gorgotes</italic> as specially fitting for historical discourse. The definition of this type of style, which follows that of Pontano’s, is this: ‘a dense and careful gathering of many things together by means of a brief, concise and efficient discourse’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691411428389">19</xref></sup> Hermogenes had said that the most suitable style to produce <italic>gorgotes</italic> was the segmented style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691411428389">20</xref></sup> To illustrate <italic>celeritas</italic> Mascardi quotes the passage in Sallust where Catiline fights before falling dead. I will cite it in full to demonstrate the stylistic similarities between Sallust’s text and other fragments by Melo that will be analyzed later – translation notwithstanding:<disp-quote>
<p>On reaching a distance at which the light troops could engage, the two armies raised a great shout and charged each other, standard to standard. Dropping their javelins, they fought with swords. The veterans, remembering their ancient valor, pressed on to engage at close quarters; their opponents fiercely withstood them, and the conflict raged with the greatest fury. Meanwhile Catiline, with his light troops, was busy in the front. He relieved the hard-pressed, called up fresh men to fill the places of the wounded, had an eye for every need, often fought himself, and often struck down his man. In fine, he played the part at once of an active soldier and a skillful general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691411428389">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Mascardi praises in this passage the components of <italic>celeritas</italic>, one of whose strengths lies in the fact that clauses do not simply repeat or paraphrase themselves, and are not of the same type, but rather display a certain variety:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691411428389">22</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>The density of this narrative, thick and divided into clauses that are not pointless but all related to different things, what an idea of the battle will imprint in the mind of the reader! And without this form of <italic>celerità</italic>, how many words would the writer need to say half of what is hinted by these clauses? And even then the narrative would result feeble and without spirit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691411428389">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Melo’s description of the Battle of Montjuic will allow us to verify both the type of style prescribed by Mascardi and the similarities with Sallust’s fragment:<disp-quote>
<p>Other soldiers of the cavalry who had not learned of the beginning of their alteration unsheathed their swords, blocking those who were miserably fleeing from caprice to death. Then there spread through the field a damned voice that repeatedly shouted ‘betrayal’ … All yelled ‘betrayal’, each one expecting it against himself, nobody trusted anyone, and they did not approach one another unless with utmost care; all that could be heard were the voices, complaints, and weeping of those who saw themselves cut into pieces without reason; all that could be seen were smashed heads, broken arms, beating entrails; all the land was blood, all the air was a clamor; what could be heard, noise; what could be seen, confusion. Compassion mixed with rage, everyone killed, everyone took pity, no one knew how to stop.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691411428389">24</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The segmented style, punctuated by asyndetic clauses, accumulations, and brief distributions – as perceived in this passage – is an attribute of <italic>gorgotes</italic> or Rapidity, according to Hermogenes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691411428389">25</xref></sup> <italic>Celeritas</italic> is combined here with <italic>enargeia</italic> in order to enhance the importance of the moment. Monfasani has explained that <italic>gorgotes</italic> involves also the use of sharp and chopped sentences, since Hermogenes himself had related Vividness to Sharpness (<italic>oxytes</italic>) and with Subtlety (<italic>drimytes</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691411428389">26</xref></sup> Melo offers a good example of the type of style which is vivid (or ‘rapid’) and sharp at the same time at the beginning of Book I, where he presents his historiographical program:<disp-quote>
<p>Released and free from all inclination and violence, I put my shoulders to the weight of such a great history. Fortunately I speak of princes over whom I must not fawn and whom I must not loathe, and of nations which I do not know for their good or their bad deeds, with completely certain news of the events, because in many of them my sight took part, and in all of them my observations, not only by inclination, but as a rule … Castilians, French, Catalans, nations, ministers, republics, princes and kings I have to deal with, neither do I consider that I owe them nor I hope they owe me. Truth dictates, I write; hers are the reasons, mine the letters; that is why I am not worthy of accusation or of praise. Let this religious equity, never altered in my writings, be good to compensate or disoblige those who might read me, fretful or grateful, although the variety of events and opinions … will lead to understand that I do not silence anybody’s error or praise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691411428389">27</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0265691411428389"><title>Experiments in Truth: Inserted Speeches</title>
<p>After <italic>enargeia</italic> and <italic>celeritas</italic>, Mascardi devotes a chapter to characters’ speeches. The subject had been addressed in Book II, when dealing with truth in history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691411428389">28</xref></sup> The placing of the topic in such a context as the elucidation of historical truth is far from innocent: some authors had declared themselves against the use of orations in historical accounts, arguing that it is highly unlikely, if not completely impossible, that the historian could know the exact content of the speeches. In addition, orations might also be considered as too close to oratorial fineries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691411428389">29</xref></sup> Mascardi, however, far from refusing them, states that they are a necessary accompaniment of the narrative, and, if the historian should be ‘extremely precise’ in the narrative, in the speeches he can feel ‘more free’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691411428389">30</xref></sup> In Book V Mascardi lists some fundamental precepts. The first rule is that orations be used with restraint.</p>
<p>Melo introduces six speeches in direct style and a few others in indirect style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691411428389">31</xref></sup> The six direct speeches are distributed into three pairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691411428389">32</xref></sup> The first two pairs are placed within the narration of the consequences of the so-called <italic>Corpus de Sangre</italic>, the ‘Bloody <italic>Corpus Christi</italic> Day’. On 7 June 1640, a group of harvesters rose up against the Castilian soldiers who had occupied Catalonia as reinforcements for the war with France, an action that triggered the Catalan rebellion. In view of the facts, both the Catalan and the Castilian authorities – the assembly of dignitaries presided over by the count-duke of Olivares, and the <italic>Generalidad</italic> (Catalonia’s government) – were forced to make decisions about what strategy to follow: resort to arms or negotiate. We find two positions on both sides, a more radical one and a more moderate one, and it is those two positions that lead to the two pairs of discourses, one pair for each party. It is undoubtedly an occasion similar to the ones Mascardi calls ‘noble and honorable’, which are those where ‘war, peace, confederations, orders, and state resolutions are discussed, and [where] there is often disagreement among the counselors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691411428389">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mascardi also advocates that the speakers introduced in the narrative be only persons considered honorable by age, rank, credit, value or authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691411428389">34</xref></sup> Melo’s orators are explicitly described with these attributes. The first pair is made up of the count of Oñate, a prominent member of the <italic>Consejo de Estado</italic>, and man of ‘authority and very great experience’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691411428389">35</xref></sup> and cardinal don Gaspar de Borja y Velasco, ‘president of Aragon, man of great dignity and fortune’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691411428389">36</xref></sup> The second pair is composed of Monsignor Durán, bishop of Urgel, a man born ‘more from virtue than from nature, learned among his people, practical in the business of the Roman court, where he occupied the position of auditor in the Rota Court [Vatican court of appeal], and now that of chancellor of Catalonia’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691411428389">37</xref></sup> and deputy Pau Claris, ‘of superior authority … not less because of his dignity than because of his spirit, extremely attentive to public matters’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691411428389">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been pointed out that the tradition of opposing orations goes back to Latin historiography, where we find conflicting pairs of speeches pronounced by military chiefs. The formulaic character of harangues in general and of pairs of speeches in particular, and the fact that those speeches offer the speakers an opportunity to display their rhetorical abilities as opposed to an occasion to reveal the truth have also been attested to.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691411428389">39</xref></sup> The validity of the device is also noticeable in Renaissance texts. It has been observed how these pairs of speeches appear in contexts of collective threat, when making a decision may affect not only a group or faction, but a whole equilibrium system. The two orations represent opposing points of view, but both of them are usually reasonable and feasible, as proposed by persons of great prudence and wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691411428389">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>As far as stylistic norms are concerned, Mascardi recommends following in general the rules of any type of oratorial discourse, although he does recognize some specific traits of the <italic>concione historiale</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691411428389">41</xref></sup> The first one is that the orations be composed having readers – rather than listeners – in mind. Because in any case the speeches never reflect the exact words pronounced by the real orator, and since their aim now is to ‘persuade’ a reader and not the original audience, the historian will adjust the style to the characteristics of a leisure reading, avoiding the typical flaws of spontaneous (and perhaps hasty) speech, and emphasizing the elements of argumentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691411428389">42</xref></sup> He will be temperate in the use of such figures as allegory, prosopopoeia, apostrophe or irony, he will keep away from sophistic ornaments, and he will refrain from long exordia to get to the point as soon as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691411428389">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The suitable style for orations, Mascardi specifies, is the high style, and more attention should be given to reasons, arguments and proofs than to bright words.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691411428389">44</xref></sup> In addition, the style of the speech must stand out from the purely narrative sections. In Melo’s work we can easily corroborate the difference between the style of the narrative and the style of the harangue – one more plain, the other more ornate – if we compare these two passages, chosen almost at random. The first one recounts an ambush against the Catholic troops near Gerona; the second one is part of the fourth speech, by Pau Claris:<disp-quote>
<p>They left Gerona not without confusion and the death of two captains, and having been warned by a Castilian that their bread was poisoned, they took the road to San Feliu through Caldas, where, upon receiving more infantry, their misery grew with their number; but the <italic>villanos</italic> (that is how military people used to call peasants), lest they waste time, which would take them to disaster, concealed over two hundred shooters between San Feliu and Blanes, who in due time assaulted the Catholic troops. The skirmish lasted a while, and the natives were broken, although without much damage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691411428389">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Catalonia is the slave of arrogant people; our towns, like amphitheaters for their spectacles; our properties, the plunder of their ambition; our buildings, matter for their wrath; the roads, that had been secured by the industry of our officers of justice, are infested again; the houses of the nobility are used as easy lodgings, the golden ceilings and precious paintings sadly burn in their bonfires. But, how are they going to treat with reverence the palaces, when they do not disdain being temple arsonists? And so, in view of all these calamities, will anyone dare persuade us to truces, negotiations and meeknesses? Truly, he who tries to correct the fire with delicate sticks, aids it rather than punishes it. Mercy is a divine thing, but in issues related to the honor of His house, Jesus Christ himself teaches us how to use the scourge against His enemies until He throws them away from it. He [the other orator] says that we should use gentler means. This undoubtedly is an accusation of our justification. How long, gentlemen, have we been suffering?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691411428389">46</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The use of digressions, interrogations, exclamations and brief apostrophes, as seen in the second fragment, are all strategies that Mascardi suggests for the motion of the spirit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691411428389">47</xref></sup> The tone and content of Claris’ speech reveal as well yet another technique proposed by Mascardi: the strengthening of the reasons of the orator who will prevail at the end. The historian should take pains to make the speech which will ultimately predominate more convincing, and he might want to introduce some weak point in the opposite oration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691411428389">48</xref></sup> In the pairs of speeches that we are examining, the person who wins the dialectical battle speaks last, having had therefore the opportunity to refute each of his opponent’s arguments. This is exactly what happens in the example quoted, where Claris imposes his position over that of the Bishop of Urgel.</p>
<p>One element stands out in the style of orations because of its frequent use: the maxim. In the last fragment quoted above we find at least two <italic>sententiae</italic> (‘he who tries to correct the fire with delicate sticks, aids it rather than punishes it’, and ‘Mercy is a divine thing’). A detailed analysis would elucidate the density in the use of maxims in direct speeches, which sometimes present real chains of <italic>sententiae</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Terrible is the disobedience of any law, and, just as contagion has no other cure but fire, no better companion is found for disloyalty than death. All dignities in the world are built on obedience, the throne of monarchs has no other foundation but the consent and conformity of their subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691411428389">49</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Mascardi reminds us that interspersed orations are an ideal repository for precepts, so that ‘with the frequency and gravity of sentences … military, moral, political or any other type of doctrine’ is instilled in the minds of the readers, as can be observed in Tacitus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691411428389">50</xref></sup> It is in the speeches where the historian must insert the doctrine he wishes to convey, since in the narrative part he should maintain a certain sobriety. The use of sentences is the most effective instrument to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The third pair of speeches shows features that are different from the other two. The speeches are uttered by the military commanders – the Marquis of Vélez and deputy Tamarit – before the Catalan and the Castilian armies during the siege of Barcelona in the moments that preceded the Battle of Montjuic, in the last pages of the work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691411428389">51</xref></sup> According to Mascardi – who with this finishes his discussion on inserted orations – speeches delivered to soldiers constitute a particular type of oration, where the captain’s words must be few but passionate and smart, and addressed to touch the souls rather than to persuade the intellect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691411428389">52</xref></sup> As regards brevity, the speeches of this third pair occupy a half or a third of the length of each of the other four. As for the rule of touching the souls rather than persuading the intellect, it is noteworthy that one of the speakers that Melo introduces, Vélez, explicitly expresses this same idea, when he opposes the ‘arguments’ of the leader to the ‘eyes’, the ‘hearts’, and the ‘impulses’ of the soldiers:<disp-quote>
<p>Although military custom teaches us that the leader’s arguments can be beneficial before the attack, I do not deem them necessary now, because none of you can forget the justification of the cause that brought you here, and there is no need to remind you, Spaniards, of the excellent quality of your courage, which are the two main things that in such cases are usually brought to the combatants’ memories. Your eyes and your hearts are witnesses of both of them, the former by looking at the rebelliousness and opposition that this miserable town presents to you; the latter, by experiencing the constant impulses of your zeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691411428389">53</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These are the words that open Vélez’s speech. As we saw earlier, Mascardi encourages dispensing with the exordium in military orations, and that is exactly what we have here. The same standard is found in the second speech of the pair, delivered by Tamarit to the Catalans, where we also notice how he is appealing to the emotions rather than to the mind:<disp-quote>
<p>If you, brave Catalans, doubt the condition of fortune, I think you are right, but if you show fear of the forces that threaten you, futile and pointless is your suspicion: your biggest enemy is nearby; look at it over there; behind that mountain hides the ruin of your homeland; look, over there is the big cup of poison that soon will be put into your hands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691411428389">54</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The speaker has entered the argument directly, appealing to the senses (‘look’, ‘look’) and to the feelings of his audience – with the great strength of the ‘cup of poison’ metaphor – and not so much to their minds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691411428389"><title>Praise and Rebuke</title>
<p>The chapter on interspersed speeches closes with a brief warning against the inclusion of praise and censure in the orations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691411428389">55</xref></sup> The following chapter expands the topic to cover historical narrative in general. Mascardi invokes the authority of Pontano, who, unlike Cicero, had declared eulogy and criticism as appropriate for history. For practical indications Mascardi turns to Lucian of Samosata, the second-century writer and rhetorician, who had asserted that in history ‘praise and censure must be used moderately, without exaggeration and always with evidence’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691411428389">56</xref></sup> and must be adapted to circumstances of place, time and manner. An appropriate occasion for praise and rebuke is the death of the person described, a moment that allows the historian to reflect on the vices and virtues of the deceased, and to propose that person as an example for posterity. When he reports the facts of the ‘Bloody <italic>Corpus Christi</italic>’, Melo introduces the following moral consideration after the count of Santa Coloma’s murder:<disp-quote>
<p>Thus ended his life don Dalmau de Queralt, count of Santa Coloma, remarkably disappointing the ambition and pride of humans, since the same man, in the same region, and almost at the same time, one minute was worthy of envy, and the next minute of sorrow. Alas, you excellent men, who think you are born naturally fastened to power, what does power matter, if it does not last longer than life, and the violence of authority always drags you to the precipice?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691411428389">57</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the most notorious occasions for presenting eulogy and censure is the first time a character is introduced. In the following passage Melo judges the character when he first appears in the narrative:<disp-quote>
<p>The Catholic king equipped a large army, whose command he gave to Felipe Espínola, Marquis of Balbases … Felipe is Ambrosio’s son, and disciple of that great master. How could it be believed that he would miss that heritage of blood and doctrine? For this I consider that he should be called a most honorable captain to the prince he would want to serve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691411428389">58</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The point in Melo’s account where we more clearly find opinions about different characters is the beginning of Book III, where the election of the General of Philip IV’s army is reported: The list of candidates gives rise to a brief description of each one, in which praise and criticism are mixed if necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691411428389">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another possibility is to develop someone’s assessment of the character after having talked about a glorious or a damnable deed the person might have done.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691411428389">60</xref></sup> Let us consider this example, where the papal nuncio acts, at the king’s request, as mediator in the unsatisfactory attempts to reach an agreement between Castile and Catalonia. When the account finishes, Melo introduces a general thought which no doubt conceals a rebuke of the nuncio’s performance, for having surrendered to Olivares’ power:<disp-quote>
<p>Now allow me to say what little attention ministers (in whose wisdom the church trusts its authority) pay when they intervene to support a prince’s feelings, coming close to his party. Political interests seldom follow reason, and one is bound – if force is to follow them – to turn justice towards the more powerful part, with big scandal of the universe. How could the great pontifical and paternal dignity over the whole world, Christ’s vicar, utmost truth, utmost integrity, justify the denial of attention to any one of the sheep that have been entrusted to his spiritual flock?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691411428389">61</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In any case, the procedure that Mascardi commends with particular emphasis, because it is the one readers like the most, is to praise or vituperate not people but actions, and to weave these comments into the narrative. Let us pay attention to the disapproving tone that Melo applies to his interpretation of the context and background of the Catalan revolt, that is, the war between Spain and France within the framework of the Thirty Years’ War, and more specifically to the desertion of some French positions that had already been taken:<disp-quote>
<p>The French opposition to recover their positions was growing, and Spain increasingly recognized that it had been a mistake to have taken those positions. They attempted to amend the past disorder, and they created a bigger one in trying to fix it. It seemed that the positions taken in France should be abandoned, and the action was carried out as carelessly as the planning. There is no monstrous case in the beginning which is not followed by a disturbed ending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691411428389">62</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum, praises and censures appear in the <italic>War of Catalonia</italic> with the restraint that Lucian and Mascardi instructed, and some of them are even almost disguised in the story. The moral lessons that Melo typically draws from them underlines the usefulness of history, another significant issue in the philosophy of history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691411428389">63</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0265691411428389"><title>The Order of Things</title>
<p>One of the difficulties that historians usually find is how to arrange their account. Let us read this comment that Melo makes when Vélez accepts the position of captain of the Castilian army:<disp-quote>
<p>Vélez accepted it with satisfaction, because he, like the other ministers, had been deceived in that matter … He considered himself to be as happy as those who conquer victory without fighting. This thought made seem light the weight that after a short while proved so heavy to him, to the extent that he found himself in the predicament of having to lose his reputation or his command.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691411428389">64</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Vélez’s appointment took place on August 18 1640, but Melo anticipates at this point the ill-fated (for the Castilians) outcome of the Battle of Montjuic five months later, which would be disastrous for the captain. A similar procedure is used when the story mentions the duke of San Jorge before the Battle of Montjuic, at which point Melo announces the duke’s unhappy end:<disp-quote>
<p>San Jorge was a young gentleman of great courage. He tried to enhance his reputation, and he deserved in the excess of his gallantry the anticipated applause that he already enjoyed among the Spaniards, whom he loved very much. He judged that fortune had brought him the best of days. Persuaded by this hope, he did not want or did not know how to look at uncertainty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691411428389">65</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Mascardi states that there are two kinds of order, natural and artificial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691411428389">66</xref></sup> Aristotle and Horace are invoked as authorities by those who consider that the natural or chronological order is distinctive of history, and the artificial order is distinctive of poetry. Mascardi, however, asserts that the historian, like the poet and the orator, is allowed to use the artificial or disrupt order, and not only the natural one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691411428389">67</xref></sup> He devotes the first part of chapter five to demonstrate this:<disp-quote>
<p>Order has to do with time, place or other circumstances. Normally history will abide by time order, and not to the order of place or other elements (like presenting first the author, then the causes, the occasion, the instruments, the means, and the result), it will follow the natural and chronological order, but the historian can bring back or forward the events if this accomplishes some kind of benefit, like making the account more clear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691411428389">68</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The best, Mascardi argues, is that if the historian begins to report a fact, he should continue to the end, without interrupting the narrative to talk about other previous or simultaneous events. In Melo’s <italic>History</italic> we find that approach quite often, especially when he writes about battle preparations or the political circumstances of both sides. The narrative is usually organized in a twofold way, recording what happens in both the Castilian and the Catalan camps. In Book III, after explaining the decision of the Castilian assembly to embark on the war, Melo turns to the Catalan side, and he resumes the narration where he had left it in Book II: ‘While in Castile they were proceeding with reports, treatises and registers, the Catalans were also busy preparing the necessary things. After Cardona left the government, they met to shape up their republic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691411428389">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>In chapter five, Mascardi talks about transitions, that is, ways of connecting arguments. The first rule to be observed is variety. There are two types of transitions: the perfect one (which briefly summarizes what has just been said and announces what is going to be said next), and the imperfect one (which only announces the next topic). The discussion ends with numerous examples of different authors’ transitions, among which he includes his own repertoire: ‘at the same time’, ‘while’, ‘at this time’, ‘it was never time’, ‘finally’, ‘at this point’, ‘anyway’, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691411428389">70</xref></sup> The transitions in Melo are, of course, innumerable, and there is hardly need to emphasize their variety; I will just transcribe a few, chosen from a few pages in Book II: ‘then, ‘at this time’, ‘it was midnight’, ‘while’, ‘in this way’, ‘at approximately the same time’, ‘anyway’, ‘every day’, ‘at that time’, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691411428389">71</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0265691411428389"><title>The Historian’s Words</title>
<p>Chapters six and eight of Mascardi’s Book V analyze ingredients of the historical <italic>elocutio</italic> which are related to one another, so I will discuss them together. Once he establishes that the historical discourse is free from meter, Mascardi expounds on the poetical ingredients allowed in history. Chapter six is structured around three subjects: lexical choice, <italic>compositio</italic> and epithets. Firstly, for the section on lexical choice, the longest one, Mascardi draws on Lucian and Dionysius (who had stated that historical diction is close to poetic diction), as well as on Cicero (who had assimilated the sophists’ style to that of the historians because both practice epideictic discourse) and on Hermogenes (who had placed poetry and history under the <italic>genus demonstrativum</italic>). However, although Lucian requires for historical style words that are ‘full, beautiful, significant, noble and great’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691411428389">72</xref></sup> those words should refrain from resorting to poetic enthusiasm, since what the poet and the historian have in common is thought rather than diction. Mascardi proposes making scant use of brilliant phrases and words (therefore, metaphor ought to be restricted as much as possible), and always paying attention to decorum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691411428389">73</xref></sup> Secondly, <italic>compositio</italic> or harmony should be carefully designed, like in oratory, but rhythm must not be too strong or too noticeable, as it is in poetry. And in general the <italic>compositio</italic> of history must look natural and not disclose the writer’s efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691411428389">74</xref></sup> Finally Mascardi bans epithets from historical narratives, because although in poetry they might be advisable, in history they render the historical style cold and boyish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691411428389">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>In dealing with the types of style appropriate for history, chapter eight then turns to the great authors of post-Aristotelian rhetoric, Longinus, Demetrius and Hermogenes. The sublime style is assigned to history, first of all because of the issues it covers: state matters, war and peace deliberations, political decisions, sea and land battles, sieges, or alliances among princes. It is no wonder, then, that the historical and the political styles are closely related. However, since orations and descriptions (analyzed in chapter seven) must stand out over narrative sections,<disp-quote>
<p>the body of history extended through the narrative parts cannot be formed with the sublime character, if we do not want that descriptions and speeches, enhanced over it, become swollen, excessive and cold, which are the vices that border the virtue of sublimity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691411428389">76</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In other words, the historian is to follow the mitigated type of the high style (Mascardi distinguishes three degrees for each of the three traditional styles), and narrate ‘with the temperate manner of the great character, and then proceed to the sublime character when he describes and introduces speeches … keeping for descriptions and orations a full-strength, noble and well conducted cut’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691411428389">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following Hermogenes, the characters that Mascardi designates for history are those of the type Grandeur (<italic>mégethos</italic>), excluding Asperity (<italic>trachytes</italic>) and Vehemence (<italic>sphodrótes</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691411428389">78</xref></sup> These two are opposed to Sweetness (<italic>glykytes</italic>) and therefore they do not allow a careful <italic>compositio</italic> (which would be formed by hiatuses and different and incongruous feet, producing an unpleasant sound),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691411428389">79</xref></sup> so they are incompatible with historical style. In short, according to authors from Antiquity (Cicero, Quintilian, Demetrius), ‘the historical style must be fluid, numerous and comprised within a temperate period’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691411428389">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final section of the chapter deals with brevity in history. Mascardi distinguishes between <italic>brevitas</italic> of things and <italic>brevitas</italic> of words: the first one is reprehensible, not the second.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691411428389">81</xref></sup> Brevity of words does not mean dryness. The words should accommodate themselves to the topic in a comfortable way, without falling into the opposite vice, obscurity. Brevity is not incompatible with <italic>amplificatio</italic>, since amplification is appropriate for historical discourse, as explained above. What must be avoided is the superfluous, like for example going too far back in time or talking about things which do not belong to the argument. <italic>Brevitas</italic>, in short, must adjust to the argument: the judicious thing to do is to be neither too brief nor too wordy, and, if the occasion requires it, even an abundant and copious style may be used.</p>
<p>In general, Melo’s prose goes along rather precisely with Mascardi’s rules. He usually applies a high style to his narrative, but he modulates it according to subject matter and genre. In moments of great solemnity, for example when moral thoughts are expressed, or in speeches, or when crucial facts are reported, we can easily recognize a higher density of ‘poetic’ figures (metaphor, simile, exclamation), a density that decreases in the account of lesser facts. Let us compare a couple of passages from Book V that cover the preparations and development of the Battle of Montjuic. The first text is preceded by a comment on a letter written by Olivares, the Castilian first minister, where he ‘urged [the Castilians] to the assault, he promised success … he ordered and judged on no other basis than his wish’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0265691411428389">82</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>Skillful and well-composed words are only a delightful sound, a dream to the prince who listens to them, but shortly after [they are] the principate’s precipice. Nobody wins a battle from his private chambers, although there he might be in command, against the superstitious faith of a politician. The war, indomitable animal, never obeyed the whip, much less the shout. The eyes of Europe are witness that on that famous desk [Olivares’], so worshiped by Spanish adulation, many more sentences of ruin have been written than instructions for victory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0265691411428389">83</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The sententious tone of the fragment is embodied in digressions, metaphors, metonyms, antithesis, paronomasias … In this instance, syntactic <italic>compositio</italic>, with long members and solemn words, are those of Brilliance rather than those of Solemnity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0265691411428389">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>But other times Solemnity is preferred over Brilliance, in which case sentence members are short, nouns prevail over other types of words, and unequivocal value judgements are stated. Let us read the final part of the siege of San Sadurní by the Castilians, with remarks about the inexperience of the Catalan army:<disp-quote>
<p>Art perfects [nature], necessity barely desires it and sometimes it ruins it. Fear does not help wisdom: he who fears does not know; he who knows has less to fear. War has been reduced to terms of science. Order reaches beyond fortitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0265691411428389">85</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Opposed to this kind of discourse, we find other passages where the style seems to decrease, not so much as to become colloquial, but enough to admit more fluent members and very few figures:<disp-quote>
<p>Shortly afterward, when it seemed that the army was able to move, [Vélez] appointed the chief of staff don Fernando de Tejada as governor of Tarragona, so that with his troops and cavalry he would secure the town, so desirable for both army branches, and the ill would go to the village of Constantín so that the town would be spared contagion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0265691411428389">86</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To sum up, Melo clings very precisely to the grand style, although he modifies it according to the varieties we have discussed. His prose ‘is always kept inside an elevated and grave tone’, with ‘syntactic periods [which] organize themselves in well-measured, rhythmic clauses’, full of a ‘great dynamism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0265691411428389">87</xref></sup> It is the kind of prose that, as Agostino Mascardi recommended, does not abound in epithets or similes or metaphors, and therefore, when those figures do appear, they acquire great strength, and are used to provoke a particular effect, as can be easily confirmed by reading, for example, pages 336–7 or 382–3, from where I extract these samples: ‘Margarit considered that this enterprise [the assault to Constantín] was adapted to his strength, and he thought that this action would distract the army’s strength, as sometimes the lioness leaves her prey to her roaring captive cubs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0265691411428389">88</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>[They], blindly horrified, charged at others in a mad rush, and, full of fury, broke their first squadrons, and as it might happen to a stream, which, with the flow from other waters that come into it, acquires more and more strength to push forward everything that resists it, in the same way the stream of those who started coming down, shoving and dragging those who were closer, was already arriving to the others with doubled strength, so that those who were farther away received the strongest blow. Some fell, some stumbled, some ran over others and were run over yet by others. Sometimes, in various confusing whirlpools, they thought that they were going forward and they were going backwards or were walking in circles; everyone cried; the shouts and clamors were endless and numberless; everyone asked without knowing what they were asking for; everyone commanded without knowing what they were commanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0265691411428389">89</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>History of the Movements, Separation and War of Catalonia</italic> is, no doubt, a fundamental piece in Spanish historical prose; in Menéndez y Pelayo’s words:<disp-quote>
<p>an exceptional work, or rather a unique work, of grim and solemn beauty, rich in bitterness and disillusionment, sharpened with conceptual depths, where even leniency shows traces of the gloomy irony not of the censor but of the hidden enemy, and where, for once in our literature, the terrible eloquence of popular tumults found a voice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0265691411428389">90</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Further research is needed to help unravel how that ‘beauty’ is created, and what it entails, which are its components, and what is its historiographical background. And in a broader context, more work is also required to understand historical writing in the light of historiographical theories and norms. Examinations of that kind will allow us to better understand the mechanisms that govern the writing of history in early modern Europe.</p>

Compare it with what Mascardi asserts: ‘The most proportionate matter of history must be the one that best teaches those who read, and, since war reports cannot be omitted, all the more so must state councils be explained, because in the former only news of the facts and some warning to the soldiers are included; [whereas] in the latter the world regiment’s doctrine and the arcana of the principate are taught’ (Book I, chapter 4, 79).

Melo, exhibiting his usual conscience about historiographical matters, comments on the order of the narrative: ‘It will be advisable now to give notice of the Catholic king’s arms and advances (although with this we will go a little forward as far as time order is concerned) so that we follow the facts of Catalonia without the interruption of other events, in such a way that both are more clearly understood’ (1996: 211).

Hermogenes proposes that sentences written in solemn style end with a noun of no fewer than three syllables (59), as it happens here with ‘fortitude’ (‘fortaleza’ in the Spanish original). Similar effects can be identified in other passages, where polysyllabic words are used to end the periods: ‘This piece of news [that fresh troops had been requested] was heard in town with great sadness and annoyance. Peaceful men accept badly and believe even worse the troubles of war; the civilian accuses, as he pleases, the soldier of being lazy, and the captain of not winning; no one manages to measure their inequality. Leisure in war is an earthquake in the republic. What is confusion in town is calm in the army; peculiar misfortune is for incomprehensible war actions to be judged by the tribunal of politicians – so swift in ascertaining the qualities of dangers they ignore – from which sometimes courage is sentenced, sometimes prudence, as if Mars weighed with Astraea’s scale, and between fortune and reason there were great conformity’ (1996: 339). And: ‘Blows, roar, smoke, clamor and blood, confusedly mixed, the hurrahs of the victors, the sighs of the dying: all was part of the constant sorrow of their failed years and expectations’ (1996: 373).</p></fn>

Equally full of admiration are Rosell’s words: ‘Why go further in celebrating the value of a work so full of perfections? If one considers it in regard to its style, there is nothing superior to it; if to its diction, reading it is enough to feel the emotions that drag the writer’s pen; and whether it is examined in parts or in full, it is always satisfying and captivating, to such extent that its imitation seems impossible. Those who want to recommend it mention the prologue, canon Claris’ vibrant speech, the count of Oñate’s grave oration, the picture of the Corpus Christi day, and the description of the assault of Montjuich; but where everything is beautiful and magnificent there is no sane choice or easy priorities. Melo is an author who writes in the manner of the ancient classics, and reasons like a modern philosopher. He was a great lyrical poet, and his use of epithets and metaphors is admirable; he was a deep thinker, and he shows it in his sublime sentences; he understood the aesthetics of art, and he knows how to place orations in a natural and appropriate way, so that they do not seem a puerile ornament; finally he was an excellent stylist, and he did not let himself be corrupted by the bad taste of his time. His book, that unfortunately left the matter at its beginnings, will always be, for those who devote themselves to history, the most perfect model of that century; and Melo, although Portuguese, one of the first writers of our nation’ (1852: xx).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
