<p>The 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures, and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS) was held from 18–20 September 2011, in Phoenix, Arizona. As in its prior incarnations, the conference was a highly successful and energetic forum in which to develop discussions and collaborations among the conference delegates in adaptive structures, intelligent systems, and structural health monitoring. Participants enjoyed the distinctive atmosphere of the desert climate at a special pioneer banquet that was held in the beautiful Sonoran desert with a traditional Arizona cookout, singing cowboy and his tricky horse Dusty, and ending with the spectacular native American hoop dance.</p>
<p>The Symposium on Enabling Technologies and Integrated System Design focused on the design process and technological development of smart materials and devices, active technologies, and intelligent systems, and the integration of these enabling technologies in a controlled system. Papers describing research in the fundamental understanding and characterization of smart materials were focused on resolving material issues beyond the realm of current state-of-the-art for practical implementable systems. Papers also focused on emerging smart material systems, as well as advanced device technologies, for applications as diverse as automotive, rotorcraft, aircraft, robotics, and other systems. A key aspect in these research efforts was to focus on aspects of devices, systems, or necessary architectural elements (such as packaging, connections, or control algorithms) to enhance commercial viability of these integrated systems. Sessions focused on device controls, optimization and design, aircraft morphing, transportation systems, rotorcraft technologies, robotics, magnetorheological and magnetostrictive technologies, and novel actuators, sensors, and their applications.</p>
<p>Selected papers from the symposium are highlighted in this special issue of the <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</italic>. All papers considered for this special issue were subjected to the established peer review procedures of the journal.</p>
<p>The final two papers included in this special issue are from the Symposium on Structural Health Monitoring / NDE, which was chaired by Andrei Zagrai (New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology), with the able assistance of his two co-chairs, Oliver Myers (Mississippi State University) and Kenneth Loh (University of California, Davis).</p>
<p>We would like to thank authors for contributing manuscripts to the special issue, and the reviewers for their tireless efforts in evaluating submitted papers. The symposium organizers would also like to acknowledge sponsorship of ASME and American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), as well as the strong support of the Conference General Chair, Diann Brei (University of Michigan) and European Technical Chair, Prof Stefan Seelecke (University of Saarland).</p>
