<abstract>
<p>Individuals with clefts present considerably more dental anomalies than individuals without clefts. We also have shown that these individuals report cancer in their families more often than do unaffected individuals. We investigated how these conditions correlated with genetic variants associated with clefts to ascertain if specific molecular signatures exist that could help identify individuals at risk for having offspring with these defects. We examined 573 individuals, 158 with clefts, 254 unaffected family members, and 161 non-related controls. Several clinical features, such as laterality, the presence of dental anomalies, medical history, and pregnancy history, were used to assess each individual’s cleft status. Then, we performed molecular studies with genes that have been independently associated with oral clefts. We analyzed two datasets: nuclear families and case-control individuals where the case was the child from the family and controls were unrelated non-clefted individuals. In the family data, we confirmed association between clefts and rs987525 on chromosome 8 (p = 0.007) and found an association with rs987525 and tooth agenesis (p = 0.0003). In the case-control data, clefts, supernumerary teeth and familial cancer history were associated with <italic>ABCA4-</italic>rs481931 on chromosome 1 (p = 2E-19, 0.0007, 2E-06, respectively), and clefts and microdontia were associated with rs1325474 on chromosome 6 (p = 1E-06, 0.0002, respectively).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most common congenital malformations is cleft lip with or without cleft palate, whose prevalence at birth is roughly 1 in 700 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512444928">Mossey and Little, 2002</xref>). Individuals born with clefts have three to four times the odds of presenting dental anomalies, particularly tooth agenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512444928">Letra <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>), and increased frequencies can also be seen in their parents and siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512444928">Küchler <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the presence of dental anomalies may represent an additional clinical marker for oral clefts, suggesting a common genetic background between the two anomalous conditions. Another emerging relevant clinical finding is cancer. Alterations of the E-cadherin pathway were suggested to contribute to both human clefting and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512444928">Frebourg <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512444928">Kluijt <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We have recently shown that an increased risk of isolated cleft lip and palate may exist in families where a cancer case is identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512444928">Taioli <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), as well as an increased frequency of self-reported family history of cancer in families segregating cleft lip and palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512444928">Menezes <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), thereby strengthening the hypothesis that common genetic factors may play a role in both conditions. This work contradicts previous data suggesting that the frequency of cancer was not significantly increased in first- or second-degree relatives of individuals born with isolated cleft lip and palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512444928">Steinwachs <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). In this study, we evaluated dental and demographic variables, which are still understudied for their role in the etiology of cleft lip and palate and their potential interaction with genetic variation. Our hypothesis was that dental anomalies and a positive family history of cancer are associated with the occurrence of forms of cleft lip and palate, and that specific genetic variants are involved, depending on the clinical presentation of the clefts.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>We examined 573 individuals, 158 with clefts, 254 unaffected family members, and 161 non-related controls with no history of syndromic clefting. All participants were recruited at the Department of Pedodontics clinics, Istanbul University, Turkey. Individuals born with isolated forms of cleft of the lip with or without cleft palate or cleft palate only and all their available first-degree relatives were invited to participate in this study between October 2007 and October 2009. We also invited at least one unrelated individual for each cleft case recruited of the same age and gender during the same period. Since we had both families (parents with between one and five offspring) and controls, we could perform family-based and case-control analyses. Individuals born with clefts had an average age of 10.89 yrs and ranged in age from 3 to 23 yrs. Their ages were no different from the ages of control individuals (average age, 10.79 yrs, ranging from 3 to 23 yrs; p = 0.839). Ages of family members of the individuals born with clefts ranged from 3 to 57 yrs (average, 32 yrs). All study participants were examined in a dental office by the same professional (M.Y.), and panoramic radiographs were available for all participants. Dental anomalies outside the cleft area (tooth agenesis, supernumerary teeth, macrodontia, microdontia, malocclusion, and enamel hypoplasia) were recorded. Tooth agenesis was defined based on the age of the individual and when initial tooth formation would be visible radiographically. The following demographic variables were collected from all persons with clefts and from unrelated individuals according to a standardized data collection tool: gender, cleft type (cleft lip with cleft palate, cleft lip only, and cleft palate only), intermarriage, family history of oral clefts, family history of cancer, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal illnesses during pregnancy, and maternal drug use during pregnancy. These data matched the information available in the dental records. Family history of cancer was not sufficiently detailed to allow for analysis by types of cancer, and this variable included any self-reported family cancer history. All participants signed an informed consent document prior to entering into this study. Parents consented for their offspring, and age-appropriate consent was obtained from all children older than 7 yrs of age. This protocol is approved by both the Istanbul University and University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Boards.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA samples were obtained from saliva. Genotyping was performed by the Taqman method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512444928">Ranade <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), with a 7900 automatic instrument and pre-designed probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034512444928">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Two analyses were performed, one based on the family pedigrees and the other on the age- and gender-matched case-control sample. For the family data, we used Family Based Transmission Distortion Tests (TDT) as implemented in the FBAT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512444928">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For the case-control sample, we used Fisher’s exact test for both the allelic transmission and logistic regression, to determine the genotypic association between case (as defined by clefting or specific types of dental anomalies) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes. We also used logistic regression to investigate the possible confounding of or gene-environment interaction with cancer history, medication during pregnancy, and smoking during pregnancy. Logistic regression was performed both in SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and PLINK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512444928">Purcell <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Model selection was determined largely by the significance of the difference in the -2 log likelihood, since main effects or interactions are added to the model as well as the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> statistic that calculates the variance explained by the main effects and their interactions. The purpose of the regression is to determine if the genetic effects need to be adjusted for environmental effects and to determine if there is a gene-environment interaction.</p>
<p>Single-nucleotide polymorphism markers flanking <italic>ABCA4</italic> (1p22), <italic>IRF6</italic> (1q32), <italic>TGFA</italic> (2p13), <italic>PRSS35</italic> and <italic>SNP91</italic> (6q14), 8q24, <italic>MMP3</italic> (11q22), <italic>TIMP2</italic> (17q25), and <italic>PVR</italic> (19q13) were selected for this study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512444928">Table 1</xref> summarizes the loci studied. We used Bonferroni correction and considered alpha lower than 0.002 (0.05/30) as statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred and two nuclear families ranging in size from one to five offspring were available for this study. In these families, there were 356 individuals, 117 born with clefts out of 152 offspring. For the case-control comparisons, probands from the families plus another 45 individuals born with clefts were studied. Four affected siblings were removed to allow for independent observations. One hundred and fifty-eight cases and 161 controls remained for analysis. Those born with cleft lip and palate commonly presented a skeletal Class III-like phenotype, but final determination of Class III status would be made only in late adolescence, which for many participants was not possible. Therefore, this variable was excluded from the analysis. Tooth agenesis was defined based on the age of the participant and when initial tooth formation should be visible in the radiographs [according to this criterion, second premolar agenesis was considered only in affected individuals above 8 yrs of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512444928">Letra <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512444928">Küchler <italic>et al</italic>., 2008)]</xref>.</p>
<p>The results of the case-control baseline analysis of demographic and clinical variables are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034512444928">Table 2</xref>. Dental anomalies are more common in individuals born with clefts. From logistic regression analysis, family history of cancer, medication during pregnancy, and smoking during pregnancy were the biggest predictors of clefting. In a model with the three main effects, the overall R<sup>2</sup> was 29%, and the individual main-effect terms had p values of p = 1E-11 (cancer history in the family), p = 2E-06 (medication during pregnancy), and p = 0.001 (smoking during pregnancy). In a model of two main effects (medication and smoking during pregnancy), the R<sup>2</sup> was just 14%, demonstrating the magnitude of the effect of familial cancer history. The individual main-effect terms had p values of p = 9E-7 and p = 0.006 for (maternal medication and smoking during pregnancy, respectively). No interactions were significant in any of the models. These three environmental variables were considered as possible confounders to the genetic analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.</p>

<p>In the case-control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512444928">Fig. 2</xref>), we also found a higher frequency of the most common allele of the rs481931 <italic>ABCA4</italic> marker in individuals born with clefts (p = 3E-19, OR = 4.7, 95% CI 3.3-6.6), individuals born with clefts with supernumerary teeth (p = 0.0007; OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.4), and individuals with family history of cancer (p = 2E-6; OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.7).

The PLINK software package does an allelic case-control analysis similar to a 2x2 table chi-square or a Fisher’s exact test. In the genotypic analysis, we essentially looked at the three different genotypes in a 2x3 case-control analysis or a logistic regression analysis to predict case status.

<p>We also investigated whether cancer family history and maternal smoking and medication during pregnancy were confounding the genetic results or perhaps were responsible for a gene-environment interaction. At first, the <italic>IRF6</italic> V274I single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2235371) seemed to be confounded by both medication and smoking during pregnancy in the mothers of individuals born with clefts. Individuals born with clefts were not associated with <italic>IRF6</italic> rs2235371 in this sample (p = 0.24); however, when adjusted for maternal medication and smoking during pregnancy, the p value for the <italic>IRF6</italic> rs2235371 in this sample became p = 0.038 with OR = 4.41 (1.09, 17.86), and the R<sup>2</sup> went from 0.005 to 0.17. However, the low minor allele frequency (1%), coupled with the low number of control mothers taking medication (N = 6) or smoking during pregnancy (N = 3), suggests that these results should not be trusted. No other single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed any possible confounding environmental effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As in previous reports, the cleft individuals evaluated presented considerably more dental anomalies than did controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034512444928">Table 2</xref>), suggesting a common genetic background for these developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512444928">Shprintzen <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512444928">Ranta, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512444928">Shapira <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512444928">Eerens <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034512444928">Vieira, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512444928">Letra <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512444928">Menezes and Vieira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512444928">Küchler <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512444928">Pedro <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512444928">Tannure <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Most cases of isolated forms of cleft lip and palate are sporadic, and instances of family history of clefts account for approximately 15% of the total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034512444928">Vieira <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). It is safe to suggest that families with individuals born with clefts have a higher risk of having other relatives born with the same defect, even though the change in risk may be just an increase in a few percentage points and have no significant impact on one’s perception of risk.</p>
<p>The fact that more cancer in the family was reported by families with individuals with clefts than by controls’ families cannot be ascribed to recall bias among cleft families or to differential reporting according to case-control status, since cleft lip and palate are not known by the general population or by health-care providers to be a risk factor for cancer. Underreporting is also unlikely, since this is a very obvious congenital defect, and a schematic graph of the possible phenotypic presentations of cleft lip and palate was included in the questionnaire. Information regarding specific types of cancers was not available for all individuals, and analysis by cancer types could not be done and may be seen as an important shortcoming of our work. We compared self-reported family history of cancer in families of individuals born with clefts <italic>vs.</italic> individuals without history of cleft lip and palate; however, the cancer types reported may not all be related to the same etiologies. Furthermore, we did not have access to specific data regarding the age of onset of cancer, which makes it impossible to determine if family members of an individual born with cleft lip and palate developed cancer at earlier ages than the general population. Although we did not have enough information to test if individuals born with cleft lip and palate have increased susceptibility of cancer themselves, a previous population-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512444928">Bille <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) suggests that this is the case, even though recent re-analysis of these data did not confirm the earlier results of breast cancer increases in females born with isolated cleft lip and palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512444928">Dietz <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Individuals born with oral clefts have a shorter lifespan, and cancer has been suggested as one of the factors reducing the life expectancy of individuals born with a facial cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022034512444928">Windham <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512444928">Mili <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512444928">Narod <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512444928">Nishi <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). A higher cancer risk in parents of children born with oral clefts was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022034512444928">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the genetic analysis replicated previous findings (<italic>i.e</italic>., the <italic>IRF6, ABCA4</italic>, 6q14, and 8q24 loci). Regarding the locus of <italic>ABCA4</italic> (1p22), we found it to be associated in the context of family history for clefts or cancer as well. <italic>ABCA4</italic> is a member of a superfamily of transmembrane proteins, and mutations in <italic>ABCA4</italic> play a major role in the etiology of retinopathies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</ext-link>; OMIM #601 691). There is a report of at least an incidental association between Stargardt’s disease (caused by mutations in <italic>ABCA4</italic>) and a tumor of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512444928">Bini <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, it is very likely that the association between cleft lip and palate and the 1p22 locus represents indirect associations with other genes or regulatory elements outside any gene.</p>
<p>Associations between specific dental abnormalities and clefts were found in the context of genetic variation, such as the association between markers in 8q24 and individuals born with clefts with tooth agenesis, between markers in <italic>ABCA4</italic> and individuals born with clefts and supernumerary teeth, and between 6q14 and individuals born with clefts and microdontia, and, finally, individuals born with clefts with mesiodens were associated with markers close to <italic>IRF6</italic> and in <italic>MMP3</italic>. Analysis of these data provides further support for our hypothesis that some of the same genes that contribute to cleft lip and palate are involved in disturbances of dental development. Many research programs are centered on newborns, and there is no opportunity to evaluate either their dentition or dental development. Studying older individuals born with clefts allows for the evaluation and inclusion of dental findings in the analysis. We argue that, despite the relative small sample sizes of these individual analyses, and the potential impact of Type I error by ‘sophisticating’ the case definitions, the samples included are more homogeneous and may allow for the identification of specific genetic contributions that are relevant only to a small percentage of individuals with cleft lip and palate. We also predict that the traditional terminology of isolated (non-syndromic) <italic>vs</italic>. syndromic clefts will be replaced by definitions based on genetic variation.</p>
