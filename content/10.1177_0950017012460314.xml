<p>In earlier work (Rubery, 1988), the extent to which women might act as a flexible reserve over the business cycle was argued to depend on three main factors: the pattern of gender segregation and its relationship to employment change; women’s commitment to labour market participation; and state policy and support for women’s employment. This article revisits these factors in the context of the 2008/9 recession and the follow-on austerity policy to explore how gender segregation is associated with employment change by gender, how far reduced demand is influencing women’s labour market participation, and the implications of changes in public policy associated with austerity and reduced labour demand for women’s future employment position.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The financial crisis and subsequent austerity policy has reawakened debate on the gender impact of the economic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012460314">Rake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017012460314">Swaffield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0950017012460314">TUC, 2010</xref>) and provides a timely opportunity to return to frameworks developed in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012460314">Rubery, 1988</xref>) to explore the extent to which women’s employment position is vulnerable to recessionary factors in general and to the specifics of the impacts of the most recent recession and austerity policy. This work suggested that women’s vulnerability could be considered from three perspectives. First from the demand side, where the immediate recessionary effects are influenced by the pattern and form of gender segregation. Segregation reduces direct competition between men and women for jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460314">Bettio, 2002</xref>) but exposes or protects women as a consequence of differential recessionary effects on sectors and occupations. However, as the recession moves from downturn to recovery, changes in gender segregation may occur if the recession promotes processes of gender substitution. The second perspective concerns women’s commitment to labour market participation and the notion that women may act as a flexible labour reserve that is more likely or more willing than men to retreat into inactivity at times of low economic demand. The third perspective concerns the role of state and employer policies in supporting women’s employment and the potential impact of changes in this policy framework. Over the past 15 years or so much of the rationale for policies at national or EU level to promote gender equality in employment has been centred on the business case that gender equality enables employers to retain female staff and capitalize on their investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460314">Dickens, 2006</xref>), or the wider economic case that higher female employment counters the effects of an ageing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460314">Lewis and Campbell, 2007</xref>). In the context of higher unemployment these rationales are likely to weaken, with potential consequences for continuity and progress in gender equality policies.</p>
<p>These perspectives on women’s vulnerability to the business cycle are outlined in the first section below. This is followed by a first empirical look at how such factors are playing out in the current crisis. The focus is on identifying links between men’s and women’s relative job loss and patterns of sectoral gender segregation, on evidence for women’s commitment to labour force participation, and on exploring women’s potential vulnerability to the weakening or reversal of policies to promote gender equality. Given the short time frame and the rapidly changing economic and policy context, these empirical findings must be considered more suggestive than definitive. The final section reviews their implications for theoretical understandings of women’s relationship to waged employment and for identifying the prospects for women in the current age of austerity.</p>

<title>Women’s employment and the business cycle</title>
<p>The rationale for returning to the issue of women and recession stems first from the proposition that gender differences in recessionary effects are related to the different characteristics and roles of women both in the labour market − as indicated by differences by gender in job allocation, working time and pay − and in the household economy and welfare state. These differences may not only influence the immediate outcomes of a downturn for women compared to men but also the pattern of changes taking place within the business cycle and associated incentives for economic restructuring. Furthermore, both gender relations and the associated gendered labour market characteristics are taken to be constructed socially. Thus the gendered impact of a recession will not be the same across time and space as differences can be expected in women’s relative position in the labour market or welfare system linked to varying degrees of attachment to employment and varying social norms and household arrangements. These factors together suggest that variable outcomes can be expected, reflecting both the characteristics of the particular recession but also the variable but evolving pattern of gender differences.</p>
<p>Gender segregation is still a pervasive characteristic of all labour markets, including the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460314">Bettio and Verashchagina, 2009</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0950017012460314">1</xref></sup> even though the extent and form of segregation continues to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017012460314">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). Differences in men and women’s propensity to be employed are found by sector, workplace and occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460314">Bettio and Verashchagina, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460314">Dex and Forth, 2009</xref>). To the extent that these differences are based on enduring social norms or sex-typing of jobs, the immediate impacts of recession can be expected to arise primarily through quantity changes in female vs male sex-typed jobs rather than by direct competition between the sexes. If women are regarded as a flexible labour supply, they may be more likely to be employed in buffer jobs − numerically flexible labour-intensive jobs that enable employers to readily adjust labour input in line with variations in demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460314">Bettio, 1988</xref>). This buffer role may apply to whole sectors, where demand may be expected to be more volatile across the business cycle or may apply within either sectors or individual workplaces. The share of buffer jobs in the economy may itself be influenced by gender difference. Although early versions of segmented labour markets attributed the existence of low skill, labour-intensive jobs to the differential impact of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460314">Doeringer and Piore, 1971</xref>), more feminist interpretations saw the crowding of women into these roles as reducing pay and incentives to create stable high-value-added jobs in these sectors or occupations − that is, job quality may be an outcome of the employment of women, particularly when women are employed on differentiated contracts such as part-time work that facilitate a core vs periphery human resource policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460314">Bergmann, 1986</xref>). Although part-time workers may have permanent contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460314">Kalleberg, 2001</xref>), they may still be excluded from career ladders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012460314">Tomlinson, 2006</xref>) or high involvement human resource policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460314">Kauhanen, 2009</xref>) designed to encourage low turnover among the core. Women may thereby offer more flexibility and higher turnover as a consequence of poor job quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460314">Felstead and Gallie, 2004</xref>). This approach emphasizes that women’s employment may be organized to provide flexibility to employers, acting as a buffer to protect the male ‘core’ workforce.</p>
<p>However, not all forms of gender segregation are linked to business cycle flexibility, and sex typing of occupations and sectors provides women with protected as well as buffer jobs. Segregation may protect women against job loss by shielding them from competition from men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460314">Bettio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460314">Milkman, 1976</xref>) and by placing women in protected sectors. For employers this type of segregation acts as a source of labour market rigidity, restricting their use of women as buffers and opportunities to deploy women as cheap labour substitutes in male-typed jobs. In testing for how far women’s employment was more or less cyclically sensitive than men’s in earlier recessions, research found, for both the UK and the US, that greater cyclical volatility for women was primarily confined to a number of manufacturing industries and was not found either for employment as a whole or in sectors where women’s employment share was low. These results were interpreted as implying that women were taking on primarily buffer roles (losing more jobs than their share of employment would suggest) in some sectors such as manufacturing, but were in more protected occupations in other sectors where their share of job loss was even lower than proportionate to their employment share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460314">Humphries, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012460314">Rubery and Tarling, 1988</xref>). At the aggregate labour market level women’s employment rate continued to rise as overall they tended to be overrepresented in the more protected sectors.</p>
<p>While the pattern of segregation at the start of the recession is likely to shape the immediate pattern of job loss, changes in segregation may subsequently be induced by or accelerated by the business cycle. Although sex-typing is relatively enduring there are longer-term processes of change in the actual form of segregation, induced in part by women’s distinctive characteristic of working for lower wages than equivalent men and by changes in the nature of jobs associated with organizational and technological change. Importantly, processes of substitution or desegregation may not result in the reduction of segregation in the longer term but in the emergence of new forms of sex-typing, with many occupations becoming either feminized or subdivided into male- and female-dominated segments. This approach has been most extensively developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012460314">Reskin and Roos’s (1990)</xref> analysis of changing occupational and gender hierarchies in the US (for the UK see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460314">Bolton and Muzio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460314">Crompton and Sanderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460314">Grimshaw and Rubery, 2007</xref>). Processes of gender substitution have been linked to conditions of labour shortage at the prevailing wage rate, as in Reskin and Roos’s case studies. Thus, in the early phase of the recession where jobs are cut and few vacancies emerge, substitution may be curtailed but may be reinvigorated when vacancies begin to emerge but employers seek to fill them at low cost.</p>
<p>The key conclusion of this earlier research on the links between gender segregation and recession was that women may take on all three roles; some women may provide a flexible reserve in buffer jobs, some may provide services that are protected from cyclical volatility, and some may enter new jobs that provide direct or indirect substitutes for higher-paid core jobs. These different roles will affect different labour force groups and sectors and at different stages in the business cycle. The importance of these different processes can also be expected to vary between recessions.</p>
<p>The notion that women may act as either a voluntary or involuntary labour reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460314">Bruegel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012460314">Rubery and Tarling, 1982</xref>) is again related to women’s presumed distinctive characteristics as carers first and labour force participants second. Despite the Marxist origins of the concept where the floating or latent reserve army acts in competition with the core labour force, the notion of women moving flexibly between work and household now informs more of the debate in mainstream economics on labour market flexibility, where it is presumed that all women are contingent and intermittent participants and will consequently be negatively affected by employment protection legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460314">Bertola et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460314">OECD, 2006</xref>). Women as outsiders, along with others such as younger people, are argued to be vulnerable to unemployment in a recession and to long-term exclusion if regulation reduces job vacancies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460314">Bertola et al. (2007)</xref> even hypothesize that trade unions push up wages and employment protection above competitive levels in those sectors where the labour displaced will not become openly unemployed but will willingly take up non-wage work activities. Displaced women are assumed to take up childcare full-time, on the presumption that women across developed countries are always carers first and workers at best second. In contrast, feminist research has tended to stress the path dependency of women’s relationship to the waged labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012460314">Pfau-Effinger, 1998</xref>), influenced both by the pattern of employment opportunities and the constitution of women’s roles in welfare and economic regimes as primarily wives, mothers or workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0950017012460314">Sainsbury, 1996</xref>). Path dependency suggests that even if it would be convenient for capital, the state or for unemployed men for women to be reabsorbed back into the family economy in periods of job shortage, this is unlikely to be feasible if their integration into wage employment has induced changes in the family economy and in social norms related to the gender division of labour that are not readily reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460314">Humphries and Rubery, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017012460314">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Domestic labour may no longer be able, for example, to act as an effective supplement to wage income where mass-produced commodities have become cheaper than home production. Some role may still be played by welfare systems, particularly tax and benefit systems, in shaping work incentives and by childcare support in shaping the feasibility of employment. However, plans for retrenchment of welfare support may still not lead to voluntary withdrawal if dual-earner patterns have become entrenched in social norms and household finances.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that public policy has had significant impacts on the long-term development of women’s employment integration, within and between countries. There have been relatively widespread positive developments in state supported equality policies across Europe, including the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0950017012460314">Waldfogel, 2011</xref>). These have been spurred on by the economic case that women’s employment has a positive role to play in boosting employment rates in an ageing Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460314">Lewis and Campbell, 2007</xref>), although there is less evidence that the business case has prompted employers to offer work−life balance options or stronger gender equality policies to retain female staff. These arguments were always context-specific and importantly focused only on the economic benefits to the neglect of both the social justice arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460314">Noon, 2007</xref>) and on the need to combine rights to work with rights to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460314">Lewis, 2006</xref>). Significant changes in priorities can be expected in a context where businesses can afford to be less concerned about retaining staff, welfare state expenditure is being cut back and the EU and national governments can no longer assume that work is available for all who seek it. Reversals of public and employer support raise issues of how far these considerations affect the quantity or the quality of women’s employment, in addition to effects on household income and domestic labour.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To explore how the recession of 2008/9 and the subsequent sustained downturn are influencing and are influenced by women’s labour market and labour supply characteristics, some preliminary analyses have been undertaken using the ONS workforce jobs, the UK Labour Force Survey (UKLFS) published tables and micro-datasets, and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). The observation period starts just prior to the recession – October–December 2007 – and extends to the July–September 2011 quarter using the LFS micro-data, and to June 2011 using the workforce jobs data (the latest available data). Separate analyses are undertaken for 2007–09, 2009–2010 and 2010–11 as new patterns are emerging as the crisis switches from private banking to fiscal debt crisis. Our analyses are confined to the labour market as a whole, to change at the sector (NACE 1) level, or differences in trends between public and private sectors. Although the workforce job data are limited in that they do not indicate patterns of <italic>occupational</italic> vertical or horizontal segregation within sectors, trends at the level of industrial sector allow for an analysis of whether gender segregation based on the varying representation of men and women in different sectors influences patterns of male and female job loss, and whether men and women appear to be in ‘protected’ or ‘buffer’ jobs based on their job loss within sectors being proportionate or disproportionate to level of sector representation. As employment may continue to decline or grow slowly owing to the responses to public sector debt and the international turmoil, and as policies and benefits systems are evolving continually, these results should be considered very preliminary, with not only the pattern of change still to be fully established but also the data being subject to relatively frequent revisions. Furthermore, changes observed in the employment data in the recession may have multiple origins, not only linked to the downturn but compounded by longer-term sectoral change such as the decline or growth of employment in specific sectors related to technological change, increased global competition or offshoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012460314">
<title>Segmented labour demand: Some empirical findings</title>
<p>To provide some indication of whether job loss in the period since 2007 reflects differences in the sectoral distribution of men and women or differences in the propensity of men and women to lose employment within sectors, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012460314">Table 1</xref> uses a shift-share analysis to predict expected changes in employment by keeping the gender share of sectors stable at 2007 rates over the period December 2007 to June 2011. If women lose more jobs than their share of employment in December 2007 would predict, it can be inferred that they are more likely to be employed in buffer-type jobs. Conversely, if their job loss is less than their initial share of employment, then they can be inferred to be more likely to be in protected jobs. The data indicate that most of the change in employment by gender is related to the pattern of job loss and job growth by sector, with only limited changes in gender shares observed within sectors. To the extent that gender shares have changed, these have been on average to the detriment of women. That is, although women’s share of jobs remained similar, just increasing marginally over this time period by 0.1 of a percentage point, from 46.5 to 46.6 per cent, if 2007 gender shares by sector had been maintained, the increase would have been 0.8 of a percentage point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0950017012460314">2</xref></sup> Sectoral employment change was most severe in male-dominated sectors, with particularly unfavourable trends in construction and manufacturing, where men’s employment may often constitute both the core and the buffer. In business services, such as financial and insurance activities, and other business activities, women do appear to have suffered disproportionately from the downturn. If the 2007 gender employment share had been maintained in these sectors, women would have lost around 112,000 fewer jobs and men 112,000 more (combining 20.1K and 92.6K in financial and insurance, and other business activities, respectively) with women accounting for around 92 per cent of job losses in finance and insurance. This suggests that women have acted as a buffer in both of these sectors. In the wholesale, retail and restaurant sector women lost around 42,000 more jobs than would be expected based on their sector share, accounting for 58.8 per cent of overall job loss despite only representing 49.6 per cent of the sector in 2007 prior to recession. In professional, scientific and technical activities that experienced job increases over this period, men benefited disproportionately from job growth.</p>

<p>In general we find little evidence of women being protected within sectors. Indeed the only example was energy, where the female share rose by 4.6 percentage points, possibly because they were concentrated in administrative work. However, in general, involvement in clerical work is no longer a source of protection against economic cycles or restructuring, unlike in earlier periods where these could be considered stable segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460314">Milkman, 1976</xref>). In areas such as business services, clerical work has moved to the forefront of restructuring, involving downsizing, outsourcing and offshoring, following the development of new information and processing technology. How far these processes may be accelerated or slowed by recession is an area for future research investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to administrative work, the main other segment where women’s jobs have traditionally been protected is the public sector, owing both to the type of work undertaken and to the tendency for governments to maintain public expenditure to counteract recessionary effects. Up until the end of 2009 this recession was no exception as public sector jobs grew and women benefited in proportion to their 70 per cent sectoral employment share. Although women accounted for only 37.3 per cent of overall net job loss in the 2007–09 period, this share rises to 45.8 per cent if one excludes the public sector (using public administration, education and health and social care as a proxy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0950017012460314">Figure 1</xref>). However, during 2009–10 the protective role of the public sector had already begun to decline. Women lost jobs in both the public and private sectors, while male employment recovered slightly before stabilizing. Although during 2011 men on aggregate lost jobs, the female share of overall job loss remained higher than in 2007–09 (56.1% compared to 37.3%), to a large extent due to increased public sector job loss as their share of private sector job loss was lower (31.0% compared to 45.8% in 2007–09). Once the dramatic 2010 budget cuts in the public sector, estimated to lead to over 330,000 lost jobs by 2014–15 (OBR, 29 November <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460314">2010</xref>) begin to bite, then women’s employment can be expected to fall further.</p>

<p>The significance of the projected pay freezes and job cuts in the public sector for the quantity and quality of women’s employment can be illustrated by a consideration of trends in the gender pay gap over the 2007–11 period. Although the full-time gender pay gap, measured by median hourly earnings, widened slightly in 2008, by 2011 it had narrowed to 9.1 per cent from 12.4 in 2007. The gender pay gap for part-timers relative to male full-time median hourly earnings also declined but only from 39.2 to 38.2 per cent in 2007–11 (ASHE, 2007, 2011, Table 1.6a). The narrowing of the full-time pay gap occurred primarily because of higher pay increases for both sexes in the public compared to the private sector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0950017012460314">Table 2</xref>). The impact on women’s average pay is magnified by their higher representation within the public sector and their higher premium for public compared to private sector work. The outcome was an overall rate of wage increase 4.1 percentage points in higher for women than for men, even though women’s rate of pay increase within each sector was at most 2 percentage points above that for men. If public sector jobs decline in importance, this will affect women’s access to relatively high paid jobs disproportionately, and this combined with the public sector pay freeze may lead to future renewed widening of the gender pay gap.</p>

<p>Evidence of women acting as a cheap labour substitute is difficult to detect at an aggregate level and over a short time period is characterized more by job destruction than job restructuring. Substitution mainly takes place through new hires and may therefore be more common in periods of expansion than decline. Some evidence was found for the 1990s and early 2000s that a process of feminization of some higher-level jobs was associated with a decline in the relative pay status of these jobs, in line with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012460314">Reskin and Roos’s (1990)</xref> earlier findings for the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460314">Grimshaw and Rubery, 2007</xref>). The restructuring that is planned across public services in Britain including more outsourcing may lead to some women acting as a cheap labour substitute primarily for other more highly paid women. This process has already occurred in some public sector services such as social care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460314">Low Pay Commission, 2011</xref>) but may extend to others, such as the NHS, where there are plans to open it up to ‘any qualified provider’. Men may also be affected, but the gains for employers of moving female jobs from public services to the private sector are likely to be greater. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460314">Dolton and Makepeace (2011)</xref> estimate that women enjoy a 6 per cent pay premium in the public compared to the private sector, adjusted for characteristics, while men have a 1 per cent negative premium. This reflects the lower pay for women in the private sector compared to men.</p>
<p>The impact of public service restructuring will depend in part on what happens to regulations covering pay in the private sector. In sectors such as social care private sector wages have at least been partially protected by the increase in the national minimum wage (NMW) in the 2000s. If the NMW were to decline in real or relative terms, the substitution process could be based on even lower wages. In the 2000s, migrants from the new EU states and elsewhere may have become a more important source of cheap labour substitution than native born women, in part because employers were more likely not to observe all employment regulations when hiring migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460314">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This exploration of demand-side change has thus revealed the continuing importance of gender segregation across sectors in explaining patterns of job loss. Nevertheless, overall and within some sectors women are losing a disproportionate share of the jobs, particularly over the 2009−10 period, suggesting a continuing buffer role in some areas. Furthermore, women’s involvement in clerical and administrative work is no longer a source of protection but may be adding to their exposure to restructuring, particularly in a range of business, financial and professional services but also potentially in the public sector. While the public sector did protect women’s jobs and helped to narrow the gender pay gap in this initial recession period, a very different path of development in both job quantity and job quality may be expected over the next period owing to austerity policies.</p>

<title>Women as committed or contingent labour market participants</title>
<p>If women are acting as a flexible labour reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460314">Bruegel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012460314">Rubery and Tarling, 1982</xref>), any decrease in employment opportunities could be expected to lead to an increasing share of women determining their economic status as voluntarily inactive and withdrawing from the labour market. However, between 2007 and 2009 female unemployment increased, albeit at a lower rate than for men, and economic inactivity actually declined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460314">Table 3</xref>). Female economic inactivity rose slightly in 2009−10 as female employment continued to decline, but the net trends between 2007 and 2011 involved a decline in the employment rate (−1.6 percentage points), a rise in the unemployed share (+2.4 percentage points) and a decline in inactivity (−0.8 percentage points). In contrast, male economic inactivity and unemployment both rose strongly in the 2007−09 period but in 2009−10 employment started to rise for men and was associated with a decrease in economic inactivity. Over the 2007−11 period the net outcome for men was a 3.7 percentage point fall in the employment rate reflected in a 3.3 percentage point rise in unemployment and a 0.4 percentage point rise in inactivity.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of women acting as a voluntary flexible reserve could be evidence that they were willing to move voluntarily into part-time paid work as an alternative to full-time employment, or into temporary work in the face of reduced permanent opportunities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0950017012460314">Table 4</xref> shows that involuntary part-time work rose between 2007 and 2011, involving similar numbers for men and for women. For women the increase in those who could not find a full-time job at 274,000 exceeded the overall growth in part-time work of only 146,000. Similarly for men the overall increase in part-time employment (179,000) was less than that for involuntary part-time work (263,000). Comparable increases in levels of involuntary temporary work between men and women further suggest that women are no more likely than men to be satisfied with temporary work as a result of declining permanent opportunities.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Overall there is currently very little evidence of women withdrawing voluntarily from the labour market or indeed willingly moving into more flexible work in response to the downturn in demand. This reluctance to provide a contingent labour supply may reflect more embedded expectations of continuous participation now that the need to quit the labour market at childbirth has been reduced by extended rights to leave and rights to request flexible working. A further explanation for this commitment to economic activity may be found in women’s changing relationships to the benefit system. Historically many women in the UK have not been entitled to unemployment benefits because of earning below National Insurance contributions thresholds or working intermittently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460314">Grimshaw and Rubery, 1997</xref>) and thus had limited incentives to register as unemployed. However, between 2007 and 2011, UKLFS data reveal a decline of 9.5 and 13.2 percentage points, respectively, in the shares of men and of women who are unemployed, based on the ILO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0950017012460314">3</xref></sup> standardized definition of who are not claiming benefits on grounds of unemployment, although the share of women not claiming benefits still exceeds that of men at around 71 per cent compared to 54 per cent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460314">Table 3</xref>). These trends suggest more of those flowing into unemployment as a consequence of redundancy have eligibility for benefits than among the stock of ILO unemployed, probably owing to more continuous employment at higher wages. Nevertheless, if unemployment spells last beyond six months when contributions-based Job Seekers’ Allowance (JSA) expires, some of these with employed partners may withdraw into economic inactivity status.</p>
<p>The UK benefit system has not only limited women’s access to benefits but has also historically encouraged women to withdraw from the labour market, particularly those on a low income, if their partner became unemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460314">Davies et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460314">Gregg and Wadsworth, 1996</xref>). Another reason why women’s relationship to benefits has changed is because the benefit system has changed towards a much greater emphasis on in-work or so-called ‘active’ benefits instead of ‘passive’ benefits. These changes reflect the ‘make work pay’ philosophy based on a policy package that included a guaranteed minimum wage, greater childcare provision and wage subsidy through the tax credit system. More recently, benefit reform and an intensified focus on labour market ‘activation’ through the replacement of Incapacity Benefit with Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and withdrawal of Income Support on grounds of being a lone parent for those with younger dependent children have increased mandated job search activity, placing further upward pressure on JSA claimant counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012460314">Rafferty and Wiggan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In-work benefits are aimed at encouraging breadwinners − whether in couple households or lone parents − to leave out-of-work benefits and enter employment where the jobs on offer are too low paid to make work pay or create sufficient financial incentives without subsidies. At the same time, these in-work benefits tend to create strong disincentives for second-income earners. Data on recipients of Working Tax Credit (WTC) largely confirm these expectations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0950017012460314">Table 5</xref>). For example, in 2008, before the main force of the recession, 58 per cent of coupled households claiming any form of tax credit had a sole male breadwinner − more than the combined total of couples with either only a female breadwinner in employment or with both partners employed. Recent trends, however, show that by 2011 there was a 31.5 per cent increase in coupled household claimants with a sole female earner, and a 25.3 per cent increase in dual-earner coupled household claimants compared to a 19.3 per cent increase in male single-earner coupled households. This indicates a slight increase in the use of women’s participation as a means of keeping the household afloat in a period of recession rather than both partners withdrawing from work if the man loses employment or receives a cut in hours of available work. In contrast, the 41.3 per cent increase in male single households receiving WTC potentially indicates stagnation in male earnings and/or reductions in working hours available.</p>

<title>How the recession will affect the economic and business case for gender equality</title>
<p>Considerable scepticism has been expressed over the reliance on the economic or business case to support equal opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460314">Dickens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460314">Noon, 2007</xref>). Not only does this approach leave the door open for policy reversal in recession but the policies implemented at the workplace tend to be reserved for relatively advantaged workers. At the societal level the focus is on raising women’s employment rate rather than on improving job quality or facilitating care. Nevertheless, this rhetoric opened up opportunities for new policy initiatives that could generate positive and potentially permanent gains for women. In the UK the policies enacted by New Labour provided much to criticize for, although significant in range, their content stopped well short of the level of state support for dual-income households found in some countries such as Sweden. For example, leave was extended but only provided low flat-rate benefits, some childcare support was available but costs remained very high, and the right to flexible working was only a right to request flexible working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460314">Lewis and Campbell, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, even though employers did introduce more work−life balance policies, some have argued that these are a form of compensation for and a means of legitimating the widespread diffusion of employer-oriented flexible working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460314">Fleetwood, 2007</xref>). Despite such problems one positive effect may be the apparent growth in opportunities to combine part-time hours with higher skilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460314">Gallie and Zhou, 2009</xref>) and higher paid work. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0950017012460314">Table 6</xref> indicates that the public sector has more and increasing numbers of quality part-time jobs, as evidenced by the high level of pay and faster increase for the upper quartile of public sector part-timers, both compared to the private sector and those at the lower quartile. This development may be due to the opportunities for continuity of employment offered by the right to request flexible working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460314">Neuburger et al., 2010</xref>), which may be implemented more as an employee right in the public sector, which has taken the lead in developing work−life balance policies over recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460314">Dex and Forth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460314">Hooker et al., 2007</xref>). These opportunities may shrink if public sector jobs decline or are transferred to the private sector, where employers appear less likely to offer quality part-time working.</p>

<p>The extent to which there will be a reversal of employer policies aimed at retaining female staff is not yet clear. However, the line of policy direction from the state is more evident even if it differs by the income and family situation of women. The general approach of the coalition government is to withdraw state support for mothers in work, through proposed or implemented reductions in child benefits, child tax credits, share of childcare costs that can be claimed and failure to ring-fence expenditure on nurseries, after-school or holiday clubs. Fertility, childcare and work choices are presented increasingly as a private matter, with facilitating the employment of mothers no longer a policy priority to be promoted by government. Furthermore, the plan to convert tax credits into a Universal Credit currently involve treating the household as one unit for assessment and payment, which if implemented can be expected both to transfer resources from purse to wallet and increase negative incentives for second-income earners. The briefing note (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460314">DWP, 2011</xref>) states that maintaining incentives for second-income earners is not a priority for government. However, for lone parents the state is withdrawing the stay-at-home, domestic labour option and is imposing ever more draconian requirements for them to seek work even when responsible for young children. The only concession is the maintenance of some childcare support for these families to facilitate this work first programme.</p>
<p>This policy stance will not necessarily have the expected impact on women’s work patterns. Those on benefits may not find jobs to go to and those who are being encouraged to provide domestic labour for childrearing will not necessarily leave the labour market, either because of their own work orientations or because of the squeeze on household earnings. Another reaction to the withdrawal of state support may be a reduction in fertility, as has happened in other recessions internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012460314">Santow and Bracher, 2001</xref>). Thus the power of policy change to reverse or halt long-term secular changes in family formation patterns and gender relations must not be exaggerated. Nevertheless the withdrawal of state support from the costs and the care of children will have an impact on both material outcomes and the short-term behaviour of at least some women.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>This exploration of the immediate trends in women’s employment position during the recession and continuing government debt crisis in the three years from the end of 2007 provides support for the key propositions that gender segregation across sectors is the prime factor shaping outcomes, that within sectors women are still often bearing a disproportionate share of job loss and that women are becoming more permanently attached to the labour market. The analysis also suggested that the characteristics of the specific recession matter. Thus sectors protected in one period may become vulnerable or flexible sectors in another. This is particularly evident in the current recession, where first of all the crash was concentrated in the banking sector − in the past an area of stability and growth − and now the public sector. Although normally a source of protection, the public sector is poised to be a source of women’s vulnerability to both job loss and employment downgrading. The ‘savings’ on women’s jobs that can be obtained by outsourcing arguably provides a motivation for the policy of promoting the use of any qualified provider for the delivery of public services.</p>
<p>The data also suggest that to date women are resisting taking on the role of a flexible and contingent labour supply, reflecting changes in women’s aspirations and attachment to the labour market, in the family economy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0950017012460314">4</xref></sup> and in state support for working parents and in women’s rights under tax and benefit systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017012460314">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Some of these changes are now under pressure but even if the retrenchment in support for working parents is aimed at re-establishing women as a flexible and family-dependent labour supply, women are declaring themselves as unemployed rather than inactive and are beginning to use the in-work benefit system to facilitate becoming the sole or the joint breadwinner in recession-hit families. Part-time and temporary work is increasing but the share of women who would prefer a full-time or permanent job is increasing even faster. These are tentative trends and may still be reversed by policy changes and by demand-side restrictions on women’s employment opportunities. Nevertheless they are indicative of a strengthened rather than reduced commitment to wage employment in the face of recession and pressure on family budgets.</p>
<p>This review has also brought to light the benefits but also the costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460314">Noon, 2007</xref>) of the promotion of the business and economic case for equal opportunities over recent years. Recession itself undermines the key assumption in the EU employment strategy and the business case that there is work for whoever needs it, and shortage of labour or talent is a key motivator of business practice. Clearly there are strong economic arguments to provide women with opportunities to use their skills and talents but these opportunities need supporting by rights based on social justice now that it is clear that the problems of boom and bust are still present. Even in the boom the private sector was not so persuaded of the business case as to change its employment practices. The public sector’s greater provision of quality part-time jobs suggests that its policies were more informed by social justice or that it was more agile in adjusting its business practices to meet the new social conditions. Whatever the case, any dismantling of the public sector as a major employer will have negative consequences for women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, now that the coalition government’s policy is to reduce active support for working mothers in couple households, what remains of the economic case for promoting higher employment among women is a focus on reducing welfare expenditure by increasing pressure on all lone parents with a child over 5 years old to seek work. This exemplifies the one-sided nature of the approach, where the right to work has become a requirement to work without a complementary right to care. These examples also indicate that the recession and its aftermath are having differential but still damaging effects on different groups of women, from more advantaged public sector professionals to lone parents forced to seek often low-paid work. However, perhaps the legacy of the economic case for equal opportunities may be its impact in raising women’s aspirations for employment, which may ensure that women remain permanent participants and competitors in the wage labour market. This may scupper any government hopes that women might voluntarily return to the home to reduce the high open unemployment that may be a persistent outcome of the combined financial and sovereign debt crises.</p>

<p>The UK has a relatively low level of segregation at both occupational and sectoral levels (24th lowest and 20th lowest, respectively, out of 29 countries) but nevertheless the UK’s occupational segregation index of 25.3 represents over half the maximum value of 50 at which the same number of men and women work in the labour market but in entirely segregated occupations. Sectoral segregation is lower but significant at 18.7. Occupational segregation has declined more than sectoral segregation in the UK over the 1997−2007 decade, and this decline is the net outcome of structural changes in the type of jobs that has been increasing segregation coupled with a significant decline in segregation within occupational categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460314">Bettio and Verashchagina, 2009</xref>).</p>
