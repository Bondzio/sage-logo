<p><bold><italic>If DEC were to cease to exist tomorrow, why would we bring it back?</italic></bold> This is a question I’ve challenged myself and DEC board members to answer. The question emerged from our work over the past several years as we reflected on why we operated and governed in the way we did and as we examained the true goals we wanted for DEC. At first, I found the challenge to be daunting, and I was surprised that I did not have a ready-made answer. I’ve been a member of DEC since 1992—What has made me remain a member, be active, and feel like DEC is my professional home? After months of conversations and tireless efforts by the DEC board, I can now say with confidence, I have an answer: <bold>DEC exists so that young children with disabilities and other special needs participate as full members of families and communities</bold>. Every time I read the phrase I get inspired—How about you? What an amazing challenge the answer presents us with, as well as a clear vision as to why DEC exists!</p>
<p>As I begin my transformation from president of DEC to past president, I plan to continue to think about and make sure I’m helping to reach the end result of why DEC exists. I hope each of you will also continue to reflect on how DEC can serve as a community for your work and how you can help DEC reach an end where all young children with disabilities participate as full members of families and communities. Last, I hope that members see the benefit and value added by our amazing organization. For those who are not members, but work with young children with disabilites, please consider being a part of the DEC community (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dec-sped.org/Join_Now">http://www.dec-sped.org/Join_Now</ext-link>).</p>
<p>I would also like to take the opportunity to express my appreciation for other DEC members who serve on the executive board and who (without fanfare) serve in leadership positions within our subdivisions. Each and every day, DEC members are working to better the lives of young children with disabilities and their families, and I appreciate each and every effort.</p>
<p>Last, I would like to remind you of several exciting activities that are underway. I hope each of you will find a way to be involved and to shape the next generation of our organization.</p>
