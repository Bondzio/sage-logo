<abstract>
<p>The present study was designed to test a model of contextual and intrapersonal predictors of adolescent risky sexual behaviors and of sexually transmitted infection diagnoses. Using Waves I and II from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors estimated a structural model in which intrapersonal factors such as adolescents’ attitudes about sex, perceived parental norms, knowledge about sexual health, and birth-control self-efficacy partially mediated the effects of contextual factors such as parent–adolescent relationship quality, school connectedness, and exposure to AIDS and pregnancy education on a number of risky sexual behaviors and outcomes: early sex initiation, sex under the influence of substances, condom use at last intercourse, and having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Different patterns of direct and mediated effects emerged for each sexual outcome. Results are discussed in terms of the complex interplay between environment and individual and in terms of how, when, and with whom to intervene in order to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes.</p>

<p>Adolescents bear a disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198112447800">Straub, 2009</xref>). A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report found that almost 22,000 young people aged 10 to 24 years were living with HIV/AIDS; almost a million were reported to have chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis; and almost 25% of all girls aged 14 to 19 years had contracted human papillomavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112447800">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>). Not surprisingly, many adolescents reported sexual risk behaviors that may have led them to contract these diseases. By the age of 18 to 19 years, 70% of girls and 65% of boys report having had sexual intercourse. Alarmingly, 45% of sexually active girls and 26% of sexually active boys reported never having used condoms during sex in the previous 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112447800">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to inconsistent condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198112447800">Mosher &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>), other indicators of sexual risk should also be considered. These include early sex initiation and sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Individuals who initiated sex early, categorized as the lower quartile of the age range of initiation, were more likely to report a history of STIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198112447800">Sandfort, Orr, Hirsch, &amp; Santelli, 2008</xref>). Substance use has also been found to be associated with early initiation of intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1090198112447800">Whitaker et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, having sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol has been associated with lower likelihood of condom use and greater likelihood of perpetrating or experiencing sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198112447800">Alleyne, Coleman-Cowger, Crown, Gibbons, &amp; Vines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198112447800">Walton et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>No single model of risk and protection, or of sexual behaviors themselves, has been consistently used in previous research. Attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, parent–adolescent relationships, and school connectedness have all been used in a variety of studies as predictors of unprotected intercourse, sex under the influence of substances, early initiation of sex, and having been diagnosed with an STI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112447800">Buhi &amp; Goodson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198112447800">DiClemente et al., 2008</xref>). However, results in these studies have been inconsistent in terms of whether the same or different sets of predictors are most influential for each indicator or outcome of risky sexual behavior. To the extent to which different indicators are important for different behaviors, interventions may need to focus on multiple processes in order to achieve the most impact.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112447800">Ajzen’s (1985)</xref> theory of planned behavior (TPB) provides a framework for predicting sexual risk behaviors and outcomes based on individuals’ attitudes about sex, perceived parental and peer attitudes about one’s behavior (which represent perceptions of social pressure from those who are important to an adolescent), and perceived behavioral control (a construct similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198112447800">Bandura’s, 1977</xref>, self-efficacy—a belief that one will succeed at a specific behavior). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112447800">Buhi and Goodson (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112447800">Albarracin, Johnson, Fishbein, and Muellerleile (2001)</xref> found that the components of the TPB—attitudes, perceived parental attitudes, and self-efficacy—correlate with sexual risk outcomes in theoretically consistent ways: condom use was related to intentions to use condoms, which in turn were predicted by an individual’s attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Similarly, a study testing an integrated model found that constructs of attitude, norms, and self-efficacy were directly associated with condom use in young women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198112447800">Reid &amp; Aiken, 2011</xref>). Finally, higher sexual knowledge has been associated with less sexual risk behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198112447800">Chen, Thompson, &amp; Morrison-Beedy, 2010</xref>), although knowledge alone may not be enough to directly influence behavior.</p>
<p>In addition to psychosocial mechanisms, positive family and school processes may also be important in preventing risky sexual outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198112447800">DiClemente, Salazar, Crosby, and Rosenthal (2005)</xref> have discussed the importance of considering ecological factors and how they affect and provide context for adolescent behavior. The school and the home can be viewed as micro- or mesosystems that affect the daily lives of adolescents, as framed within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198112447800">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> ecological systems theory. Parent–adolescent relationship quality has been linked with lowered degrees of risky sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112447800">Buhi &amp; Goodson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198112447800">Chen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198112447800">Voisin, DiClemente, Salazar, Crosby, &amp; Yarber, 2006</xref>), and these relationships have been found to operate, at least in part, through the teen’s attitudes toward sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198112447800">Parkes, Henderson, Wight, &amp; Nixon, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198112447800">Voisin et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198112447800">Denny et al. (2011)</xref> have found that involvement with and bonding to school may protect against early sexual debut and risky sexual behavior, among adolescents. Finally, sex education in schools has been used as a way to decrease rates of risky sexual behavior and STIs among adolescents and young adults, largely by increasing knowledge and changing attitudes and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198112447800">Kirby, Laris, &amp; Rolleri, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198112447800">Santelli et al., 2006</xref>). However, only a small number of studies have focused on both contextual and intrapersonal predictors of adolescent sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198112447800">Salazar et al., 2009</xref>). Integrating a contextual perspective (the ecological systems theory) with an intrapersonal perspective (the TPB) into a larger, overarching framework appears to provide a conceptual and empirical way of modeling various levels of influence (the internal microsystem as well as several layers of context; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198112447800">Newcomb, Locke, &amp; Goodyear, 2003</xref>) on adolescent risky sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Existing literature has focused primarily on examining direct effects of intrapersonal and contextual factors on risky sexual behavior. However, some contextual processes may have both direct and indirect (mediated) effects on sexual outcomes, or the influences of some contextual factors may be primarily indirect. For example, parent–adolescent relationship quality has been found to affect sexual risk behaviors in adolescents both directly and indirectly through adolescent attitudes, knowledge, and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198112447800">Hutchinson &amp; Montgomery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198112447800">Tinsley, Lees, &amp; Sumartojo, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112447800">Bellamy et al. (2008)</xref> found that school connectedness influenced adolescents’ self-efficacy for engaging in safer sex, which, in turn, was related to using condoms during intercourse. Some sex education programs have been found to prevent sexual risk behaviors by delaying sexual initiation (or not hastening it) and by increasing condom use and influencing mediating factors such as sexual knowledge, adolescent sex attitudes, and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198112447800">Kirby et al., 2007</xref>). Mediation models not only allow researchers to identify important independent predictors of health behaviors but also explicitly examine the indirect, complex paths through which interventions may affect sexual outcomes. Given the complexity of adolescent sexuality and its predictors, it is important to test a mediational model of risky sexual behavior, which provides information on a range of direct and indirect intrapersonal and contextual mechanisms underlying and facilitating behavioral outcomes, and to model each sexual risk outcome separately so that unique associations are not overlooked.</p>

<title>The Present Study: Research Questions and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The present study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198112447800">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the hypothesized conceptual model guiding the present study. This model includes both intrapersonal and contextual factors that have been previously found to predict risky sexual behavior and outcomes. Although similar predictors have been found for different sexual risk behaviors and outcomes—in this study we used early initiation, sex under the influence of substances, condom use, and STI diagnosis—it was not known whether this would remain the case in a more complex mediational model. To obtain a clear understanding of specific effects on each of the sexual risk outcomes, we chose to model each of the four sexual outcomes separately. We posited that intrapersonal predictors of risky sexual behaviors and STI diagnoses would be consistent with the TPB and would include self-efficacy, individual attitudes about sex and pregnancy, perceived parental attitudes (i.e., subjective norms) about sex, and knowledge about sex and reproduction. We further hypothesized that contextual factors drawn from the ecological systems theory would be associated with the four sexual outcomes in part directly and in part through intrapersonal factors. In this context, parental subjective norms were not hypothesized to act as mediators, because they involved adolescents’ perceptions and, as such, were themselves intrapersonal factors. Furthermore, parental subjective norms were not highly correlated with the contextual factors, so they were not used as mediators. Rather, these variables were entered into the model as independent predictors of risky sexual behaviors. Our study hypothesis is consistent with the contention that contextual processes influence behavior at least partially through intrapersonal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112447800">Dodge &amp; Pettit, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Source and Procedures</title>
<p>The data used in this study were taken from the in-home interview portion of Waves I and II of Add Health. Add Health is a prospective, nationally representative, school-based cohort study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112447800">Harris, n.d</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198112447800">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). The primary sampling units were 80 high schools and 52 middle schools around the United States. These schools were selected so that they would represent all the schools in the United States. Systematic sampling methods and stratification were used to ensure representativeness of this sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112447800">Harris, n.d</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198112447800">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). Data were collected from students, school administrators, parents, siblings, friends, and romantic partners. Finally, weights were assigned at each wave to correct for nonresponse and to make the sample nationally representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198112447800">Chantala &amp; Tabor, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The initial survey wave was conducted in 1994-1995, with a second wave conducted in 1996. Adolescents in Grades 7 through 12 were selected to complete an in-school interview. Furthermore, some students were selected for in-home interviews for Wave I. These in-home interviews were conducted in 1995 with 20,745 adolescents. Follow-up (Wave II) in-home interviews were conducted in 1996 with 14,738 adolescents in Grades 8 through 12. Twelfth graders from Wave I were not reinterviewed the following year (a type of planned attrition). The response rate in Wave I was 78.9%, and the retention rate in Wave II (excluding 12th graders from Wave I) was 88.2%.

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The hypotheses tested in this study focused on aspects of risky sex and its consequences. Therefore, the subsample for the present analyses consisted of only those adolescents who reported having initiated sexual intercourse by Wave II (<italic>n</italic> = 6,540). Adolescents were classified as having engaged in sexual intercourse if they reported sexual initiation at either Wave I or Wave II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198112447800">Dariotis, Pleck, Sonenstein, Astone, &amp; Sifakis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198112447800">Upchurch, Lillard, Aneshensel, &amp; Li, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198112447800">Table 1</xref> provides a comparison of the study sample (i.e., those adolescents who have initiated sexual activity) with those adolescents who did not initiate sexual activity by Wave II. Very few participants (79 out of 6,540) had missing data on all variables (i.e., dropped out of the study) at Wave II in the study subsample, though those who had missing data may have been engaging in risky sexual behavior before or during Wave I. A sizeable proportion (2,445 out of 6,540) of participants had missing data on exogenous variables in the model (i.e., age, sex, school connectedness, receipt of sex education in schools, and parental closeness). Because cases with missing values on exogenous variables are dropped from analysis—even when using maximum likelihood estimation—our effective sample size for the structural model was 4,095. The missingness analysis recorded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198112447800">Table 2</xref> indicated that most of these variables were missing completely at random (see the Analyses section). Therefore, we made the assumption that this subsample is representative of the entire sample of 6,540 participants who had engaged in sexual activity prior to Wave II.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. Because the χ<sup>2</sup> is extremely sensitive to the large sample size used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198112447800">Little &amp; Rubin, 1987</xref>), the alpha level was set at .01 for the missing data analyses. The missingness analysis was run on the entire Wave II subsample of 6,540.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Most minorities were overrepresented in the subsample, and adolescents who identified as multiethnic were most likely to have initiated sexual activity by Wave II. Sexually experienced adolescents were also slightly older than the remainder of the Wave II sample. Participants in this subsample also reported engaging in the risky sexual behaviors of interest: 51% had initiated intercourse before age 15, 11% had ever had sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, 11% had been diagnosed with an STI, and 67% reported having used condoms at most recent intercourse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198112447800">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data on all of the variables used in the present analyses were self-reported by the adolescent participants. All predictor and mediator variables were measured at Wave I, whereas all of the sexual outcome variables were measured at Wave II. We constructed all scales using questionnaire items from the in-home interview. All items, unless indicated otherwise, were responded to on a 5-point Likert-type scale (where 1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Negatively worded items were reverse-coded before the item responses were summed.</p>
<p>Four outcome variables were used to index different aspects and outcomes of risky sexual behavior: whether the adolescent initiated sexual intercourse early (before age 15), whether or not a condom was used during the most recent intercourse, whether the adolescent had sex under the influence of substances during her or his first or most recent sexual intercourse, and whether or not the adolescent had ever been diagnosed with one or more of the following STIs: chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts (human papillomavirus), trichomoniasis, or hepatitis B. Responses for all of these variables were dichotomous and were calculated from responses to multiple questions.</p>
<p>Sex knowledge was measured using a knowledge test consisting of 10 true/false items on the topics of contraception, pregnancy, and reproductive health. The sex knowledge score was computed as the percentage of questions answered correctly. Questions that were skipped were not counted as incorrect.</p>
<p>Adolescents’ own attitudes about sex and pregnancy were assessed using a sex attitude scale (α = .69) and a pregnancy attitude scale (α = .74). Lower scores on these scales indicated a more negative attitude toward having sex now or toward becoming pregnant or getting someone pregnant.</p>
<p>Two scales assessed the adolescents’ subjective norms about sex—the adolescent’s perceptions about her or his mother figure’s (α = .75) and father figure’s (α = .80) attitudes about the participant having sex now. In cases when there was no mother or father figure (including resident, biological, adoptive parents, and others), these questions were coded as missing. Higher scores on these scales indicated greater perceived parental approval regarding the adolescent’s possible current sexual contact.</p>
<p>Condom use self-efficacy was assessed using three items, and higher scores indicated a higher feeling of self-efficacy. The reliability of this scale was relatively low (α = .60), so these questions were used in the construction of a self-efficacy latent variable that would allow us to factor measurement error out of the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198112447800">Loehlin, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, because self-efficacy is a specific construct that applies to specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198112447800">Bandura, 1997</xref>), we included this variable as a predictor only of condom use at most recent intercourse and of diagnosis with an STI.</p>
<p>To assess parent–adolescent relationship quality, we constructed three scales. The parental closeness scale (α = .70) consisted of four items tapping into the adolescent’s feeling close to her or his mother and father figures. The relationship with mother (α = .84) and the relationship with father scales (α = .89) were calculated such that higher scores indicated a more positive relationship. Because three scale indicators were available, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ascertain whether a latent variable could be extracted. This would provide us with a single predictor (rather than three separate indicators) for family relationship quality (see the Results section).</p>
<p>The school connectedness scale (α = .72) consisted of six questions that queried the adolescent about feeling close to the people at school, feeling part of the school, and so on. Finally, we used two items from the “Learned in School” section of the Add Health survey to assess whether participants were taught about HIV/AIDS and pregnancy in school. These two items were scored dichotomously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1090198112447800">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>All scoring, reliability and missingness analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0. The results of the missingness tests were consistent with the assumption that data were missing completely at random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112447800">McKnight, McKnight, Sidani, &amp; Figueredo, 2007</xref>) for most variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198112447800">Table 2</xref>). The only variable that did not meet this criterion was Parental Connectedness. On closer examination, it was found that the missingness in this variable was at random (i.e., the predictors of missingness, such as gender and age, were included in the model). Nevertheless, we estimated a model with only cases who provided complete data on both parents, and the results were not different from the model with the full sample. This suggests that the patterns of responses provided by respondents from two-parent families and from other family forms were largely similar.</p>
<p>All path and factor analyses were conducted in Mplus 5.1, using weights from the data set to keep the sample representative and to account for the complex sampling design. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and CFAs were conducted using the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator, which adjusts fit indices for nonnormality and allows modeling of data that are missing at random, provided the variables that predict missingness are included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112447800">Muthén, Kaplan, &amp; Hollis, 1987</xref>). In addition, the MLR estimator allows for estimation of logistic regression coefficients and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes. Relationships between intrapersonal variables and outcomes were estimated controlling for age, gender, and mother’s educational attainment (an indicator of socioeconomic status). The four outcomes were all tested in a single model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198112447800">Figure 1</xref>). All theorized relationships were retained in the final model, even in cases where path coefficients were not significant, to retain the theoretical underpinnings of the full model.</p>
<p>Mediation analyses were conducted using PRODCLIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198112447800">MacKinnon, Fritz, Williams, &amp; Lockwood, 2007</xref>) using the weighted unstandardized regression coefficients or log odds from the Mplus output. PRODCLIN provides unstandardized mediated path coefficients using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112447800">MacKinnon’s (2008)</xref> asymmetric distribution of products test. Each mediated path coefficient can be converted into an odds ratio by exponentiating the mediated path coefficient and raising this exponentiated value to a power represented by the standard deviation of the predictor variable (David P. MacKinnon, personal communication, September 9, 2010, October 30, 2010). Indirect paths were tested for mediation, regardless of the significance of the direct effect, given that the effects of predictors on outcomes can be entirely indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112447800">MacKinnon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198112447800">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). We tested one mediated path at a time, given that each mediated path included one contextual predictor and one intrapersonal mediator.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>A CFA model was estimated for both the self-efficacy and the parental relationship latent variables to ensure that they fit the data well. The self-efficacy and parent relationship latent variables were each attached to three indicators. These latent variables were later used in the analysis as predictor variables.</p>
<p>We estimated the CFA model with both latent variables simultaneously in order to obtain fit statistics, because a latent variable with three indicators per variable results in a fully saturated model with zero degrees of freedom if fit alone. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198112447800">Kline (2005)</xref>, comparative fit index (CFI) values of .95 or higher and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) values of .05 or lower represent excellent model fit. We report the chi-square statistic but do not use it in interpretation because this statistic tests the null hypothesis of perfect model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198112447800">Kline, 2005</xref>), which is rarely tenable in large samples. The measurement model fit the data well: χ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 30.178, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, CFI = .997, RMSEA = .012, 90% confidence interval = .008-.017, SRMR = .015. For self-efficacy, the standardized factor loadings were .63, .68, and .51 for Questions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parent–adolescent relationship latent variable was associated with standardized factor loadings of .86 for parental closeness, .65 for relationship with mother, and .72 for relationship with father.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090198112447800">
<title>Structural Model</title>
<p>The MLR estimator was used in the SEM analysis because the outcome variables were dichotomous, and thus logistic regression coefficients and odds ratios were needed. However, using the MLR estimator with categorical outcomes does not produce traditional SEM fit statistics (i.e., chi-square, CFI, RMSEA, and SRMR). Instead, the −2 log likelihood is provided, along with the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC). These indices can be compared across models to determine relative fit (where a lower value denotes better fit).</p>
<p>First, to ascertain whether intrapersonal mechanisms would partially or fully mediate the effects of contextual variables on sexual outcomes, we estimated two models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112447800">Holmbeck, 2002</xref>)—one implying partial mediation, that is, with contextual variables associated with outcomes both directly and indirectly through intrapersonal mechanisms (AIC = 156,827.32, BIC = 157,566.47), and one implying full mediation, that is, only indirect paths from contextual variables to the outcomes (AIC = 156,870.47, BIC = 157,508.54). Because these models were nested within one another, a likelihood ratio test can be performed to compare their respective fit to the data. The partial mediation model provided a significantly better fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(16) = 75.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This suggests that contextual mechanisms were related to adolescent sexual outcomes both directly and indirectly through adolescent intrapersonal factors.</p>
<p>Because SEM is a confirmatory technique and is not designed to identify the “best” model from among a set of possible models, it is essential to specify and estimate a theoretically plausible alternative model and to compare the fit of this model against the fit of the hypothesized model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198112447800">MacCallum &amp; Austin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198112447800">Vandenberg &amp; Grelle, 2009</xref>). We derived an alternative model by reversing the mediation so that the relationship between the intrapersonal and outcome variables was partially mediated by contextual variables. This model would indicate that the effects of intrapersonal mechanisms on sexual risk outcomes operated through the adolescent’s perception of her or his relationship with her or his parents, connectedness to the school, and whether or not she or he had received sex and HIV education at school. The information criteria for this model indicated poorer fit compared with the model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198112447800">Figure 1</xref> (alternative model AIC = 183,932.939, BIC = 184,889.711). As a result, we retained our specified model and explored the direct and mediated paths in further depth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090198112447800">
<title>Predictors of Intrapersonal Mechanisms</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198112447800">Table 3</xref> reports all of the path coefficients from the partial mediation model, including (a) those between predictors and mediators and (b) between mediators and outcomes; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090198112447800">Figure 2</xref> displays the model in graphical form (including only significant paths). We first examined the relationships between contextual predictors and intrapersonal mediators. As expected, a more positive parent–adolescent relationship was associated with higher self-efficacy for contraception use and with less favorable attitudes toward sex. Having learned about pregnancy in school was significantly related to greater sex knowledge, whereas school connectedness and a more positive parent–adolescent relationship were associated with less sex knowledge. Exposure to pregnancy education in schools was associated with less positive attitudes toward pregnancy in adolescents. Exposure to HIV/AIDS education did not predict any of the social-cognitive mediators—though it should be noted that the vast majority (93%) of the adolescents in the sample had received some form of HIV/AIDS education, and therefore there was little variability in this predictor.</p>

<title>Predictors of Sexual Outcomes</title>
<p>Interestingly, the four sexual outcomes were associated with different sets of predictors, both directly and indirectly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198112447800">Table 3</xref>). A 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in perceived father’s and mother’s favorable attitudes toward sex resulted in a 27% and 15% reduction of the odds of initiating sex early, respectively. Furthermore, for each 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in favorability of adolescents’ attitudes toward sex and pregnancy, the odds of initiating sex prior to age 15 increased by 25% (for sex attitudes) and 14% (for pregnancy attitudes). This finding should be interpreted with caution, because not all of the adolescents had reached their 15th birthday at the time of the Wave II assessment and may have engaged in intercourse soon after the assessment. Also, it is possible that a portion of those who had initiated sex prior to age 15 had been forced or coerced.</p>
<p>Condom use during the adolescent’s most recent intercourse was strongly associated with self-efficacy for condom use and with exposure to HIV/AIDS education—those who reported higher self-efficacy by one standard deviation were 18% more likely to have used condoms during their most recent intercourse, and adolescents with exposure to HIV/AIDS education were 48% less likely to use condoms. Furthermore, adolescent attitudes about pregnancy were significantly associated with condom use—a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in positive attitudes about pregnancy was associated with an 8% decrease in the odds of condom use.</p>
<p>A 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in sex knowledge and a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in positive attitude toward sex were linked with a 12% and 19% increase in odds of sex under the influence of substances, respectively. Finally, a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in school connectedness was associated with a 13% decrease in the odds of engaging in sex under the influence.</p>
<p>Finally, a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in self-efficacy for using condoms during sex was associated with a 19% reduction in the odds of being diagnosed with an STI. HIV/AIDS education exposure in school directly predicted a very large reduction (48%) in the chances of being diagnosed with one or more STIs. Finally, a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in favorable adolescent attitudes toward sex was associated with a 13% increase in the odds of being diagnosed with an STI.</p>
<p>Results of mediation analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090198112447800">Table 4</xref>. All of the intrapersonal factors (except for parental subjective norms, which were not used as mediators) proved to be important in at least some of the pathways between contextual factors and outcomes. Parent–adolescent relationship quality was negatively and indirectly associated with early initiation of sex. Adolescents’ attitudes toward sex partially mediated this relationship. Similarly, parent–adolescent relationship quality and education about pregnancy were positively associated with condom use at most recent intercourse, with self-efficacy and attitudes toward pregnancy serving as mediators in these pathways. Parent–adolescent relationship quality and school connectedness were negatively associated with sex under the influence of substances. However, exposure to education about pregnancy was associated with an increase in the odds of having sex under the influence of substances. Sex knowledge served as a mediator for all of the associations involving sex under the influence. Finally, parent–adolescent relationship quality was indirectly and negatively associated with the odds of an STI diagnosis, with self-efficacy for condom use serving as a mediator.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study represents an attempt to develop an integrative model for predicting a variety of risky sexual behaviors and outcomes (i.e., STI diagnoses) in adolescents. This model included direct effects of contextual factors, as well as mediated effects through intrapersonal processes. We found that each specific sexual risk behavior was associated with a different set of predictors—suggesting that different points for intervention may be needed to affect specific behaviors.</p>
<p>Early initiation of sexual intercourse, defined as occurring before age 15, was associated with a wide range of factors. Although not all of the adolescents in the sample had reached their 15th birthday before Wave 2—suggesting that some adolescents may have initiated intercourse after the Wave 2 assessment—our results appear promising nonetheless. Favorable adolescent attitudes toward sex and pregnancy and perceived positive parental attitudes about sex were all directly and positively associated with early sex initiation. Higher parent–adolescent relationship quality and exposure to education about pregnancy were indirectly and negatively related to early sex initiation. These associations provide practitioners with a number of avenues through which to influence young adolescents before they initiate intercourse (e.g., early interventions that focus on strengthening parent–adolescent relationships and changing the adolescents’ attitudes toward sex and pregnancy). In particular, it is important to note that working with adolescents’ immediate contexts, such as school or family, is vital for influencing their attitudes and beliefs and ultimately their sexual behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112447800">McKay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198112447800">Pantin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to condom use at most recent intercourse, an unexpected result emerged. Those adolescents who were exposed to HIV/AIDS education were <italic>less</italic> likely to use condoms at their most recent intercourse. This result should be interpreted with caution, however, for two reasons. First, the HIV/AIDS education indicator did not show much variability. Second, the question asked in the survey did not ask about the kind of education students received—it may have been abstinence-only education, which likely did not emphasize condom use, or it may have been more comprehensive education that would have covered safer sex practices. Some previous studies have found, for example, that abstinence-only education did not have a positive effect on condom use, whereas comprehensive sex education did increase rates of condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198112447800">Kirby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112447800">Kohler, Manhart, &amp; Lafferty, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the precise effect of HIV/AIDS education in the Add Health sample is difficult to discern. The effects of specific types of HIV/AIDS education on condom use should be further explored in future research.</p>
<p>In contrast, the effect of exposure to pregnancy education on condom use was indirect and positive. It may be that what adolescents considered to be pregnancy education was more focused on safer sex practices, whereas HIV/AIDS education may have been more focused on the biology of the disease. The effect of pregnancy education on condom use was mediated by adolescent attitudes about pregnancy, suggesting that prevention programs, especially pregnancy education in schools, may need to address teens’ attitudes about pregnancy when educating them about condoms and STIs.</p>
<p>More negative views of teen pregnancy and higher self-efficacy for contraception were unsurprisingly found to be directly associated with condom use, whereas the adolescent’s attitude about pregnancy also served as a mediator in the relationship between pregnancy education and condom use. These patterns, which have emerged in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112447800">Albarracin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198112447800">Rhodes, Stein, Fishbein, Goldstein, &amp; Rotheram-Borus, 2007</xref>), suggest that intervention programs should focus directly on changing adolescents’ attitudes about pregnancy, on teaching them how to use condoms properly, and on emphasizing the importance of pausing sexual activity to ensure that a condom is used. Finally, parent–adolescent relationship quality positively and indirectly (through higher self-efficacy for contraceptive use) predicted condom use at last intercourse. Again, this result can be used in planning and implementing interventions, by including parents in programs aimed at increasing adolescents’ self-efficacy for condom use.</p>
<p>School connectedness seems to be particularly important for intoxicated sex, because it both directly and indirectly negatively predicted the likelihood of having had sex while using drugs or alcohol. This suggests that a positive bond between the adolescent and the school environment is protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198112447800">Maddox &amp; Prinz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198112447800">Voisin et al., 2005</xref>) and that programs intended to decrease risky sexual behaviors should focus some of their efforts on encouraging adolescents to be positively bonded to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198112447800">Lonczak, Abbot, Hawkins, Kosterman, &amp; Catalano, 2002</xref>). Parent–adolescent relationship quality predicted sex under the influence of substances through sex knowledge and adolescent attitudes about sex. These findings support the need for comprehensive interventions—addressing both intrapersonal and contextual factors such as school and parent relationships—to prevent this particular sexual risk behavior.</p>
<p>The strongest predictor of STI diagnosis was exposure to HIV/AIDS education. The discrepancy between the effects of HIV/AIDS education on STI contraction versus condom use may involve monogamous relationships—adolescents in monogamous relationships may be less likely to use condoms compared with those who are not in these kinds of relationships. However, we were not able to include a measure of monogamy because the Add Health survey did not include questions about this construct.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a given educational program focuses on abstinence or on safer sex, it is likely to advocate against behaviors that are associated with STI contraction. The importance of HIV/AIDS education vis-à-vis STI contraction is important to note for future educational programs—and it is important to tease apart whether the effects of HIV/AIDS education on STI contraction are due to a focus on abstinence, a focus on condom use, or both. Finally, self-efficacy exerted a large effect on the odds of STI diagnosis, both directly and indirectly. This effect is further bolstered by the finding that self-efficacy served as a significant mediator of the relationships between parent–adolescent relationship quality and STI diagnosis. This result suggests that practitioners should focus their efforts on increasing adolescents’ self-efficacy for condom use through brief interventions, such as role-playing scenarios, and through strategies to address and strengthen the parent–adolescent relationship.</p>
<sec id="section14-1090198112447800">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The present findings should be interpreted in light of several important limitations. First, all of the variables used in this analysis were obtained through adolescent self-reports. Given that many contextual factors were also included in the model, the study could have benefited from including reports from parents, teachers, and peers to create a more complete picture and to control for shared method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198112447800">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). The Add Health data set includes parent, teacher, and peer reports for some participants and variables, although not for the variables used in the present study.</p>
<p>Second, the data used in this study came from Waves I and II and were collected in the mid-1990s. Given that the present study examined associations of contextual and intrapersonal processes with sexual risk behaviors, the present findings may still be timely and useful. In particular, it is unlikely that relationships such as those between parental and school factors and adolescents’ attitudes and knowledge have changed greatly. However, the nature of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy education has changed in the past 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198112447800">Lindberg, Santelli, &amp; Singh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112447800">Lord, 2010</xref>), and a vast amount of information is now available on the Internet (which was only beginning to emerge in the mid-1990s). As a result, studies using newer data sets may help identify other factors that have become important in predicting risky sexual behavior in adolescents, such as participation in online chat rooms, extent of cell phone use and text messaging, and use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. A new nationally representative cohort focusing on adolescents and emerging adults would allow for studies on these new factors.</p>
<p>Third, although we controlled for gender in these analyses, it is possible that gender may <italic>moderate</italic> some of the relationships found and reported in this study. There may also be ethnic differences in the effects of contextual and intrapersonal variables on sexual risk behaviors. Controlling for involvement in monogamous sexual relationships might have also affected the results found in this study. Further research is needed to explore these possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, although the study was longitudinal, the nonexperimental design does not permit us to assume causation. Although the fact that contextual predictors were measured a year before the outcome variables does help us establish temporal precedence in these predictive relationships, other “third” variables may have also contributed to predicting the outcomes that we examined. Moreover, with regard to early sexual initiation, the precise timing of intercourse is uncertain, given that the variable used in the study is dichotomous. Additionally, there were missing data in the subsample used for this article. Although we found that these data were missing completely at random, assuming that the portion of the sample with complete data on the exogenous variables is representative of the entire subsample is to make a strong assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198112447800">Enders, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential avenue for future research is to examine co-occurrence of risk behaviors among adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198112447800">Jessor and Jessor (1977)</xref> hypothesized and demonstrated that problem behaviors in adolescence and young adulthood are often manifested in a syndrome-like fashion. These behaviors include illicit drug and alcohol use, delinquent behavior, and early sexual intercourse. A latent class analysis might be conducted to ascertain the presence of different risk profiles, involving a variety of sexual risk behaviors, and whether these risk profiles carry over from adolescence to young adulthood. Although different predictors were found to be associated with the four sexual risk outcomes in this study, there may be some common individual and contextual predictors that can help identify adolescents at higher risk for co-occurring risky behaviors.</p>
<p>The present study also has several strengths: It uses a strong theoretical approach to model building, it tests the model using a sophisticated statistical method that also allows for testing mediation, and it uses data from a nationally representative and longitudinal study to identify predictors of risky sexual behaviors. In conclusion, and despite the study limitations (and partly because of the study strengths), the present results provide evidence suggesting that the picture of risky sexual behavior in adolescents involves both contextual and intrapersonal risk and protective factors. Moreover, different sexual risk behaviors are associated with different sets of contextual and intrapersonal predictors. Pregnancy and HIV/AIDS education, as well as bonding to school and to family members, all represent important contextual influences—and self-efficacy, attitudes, knowledge, and perceived norms all represent important intrapersonal mechanisms. However, not all of these mechanisms are salient for all of the sexual risk outcomes, and in some cases mechanisms that are protective against one behavior may increase risk for another. The present findings therefore suggest that generating a nuanced, as well as broad, understanding of sexual risks and the variables that predict them is essential. We hope that the present study will inspire more research in this direction.</p>

<title>Implications for Intervention</title>
<p>Changing health behaviors is an important tenet of the public health field, but before interventions can be designed, the complex web of influences must be more fully understood. Interventions should steer away from simply talking about an individual’s behavior and focus more on bolstering social ties with family and school, while at the same time addressing the intrapersonal factors known to affect risky sexual behaviors and outcomes and actively working to change adolescents’ attitudes, self-efficacy, and perceptions. This may mean involving parents in their children’s programs and building better communication and bonding between parent and adolescent—some studies that have used this type of intervention are Familias Unidas, with Hispanic adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198112447800">Pantin et al., 2009</xref>), and CHAMP, with African American teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112447800">McKay et al., 2004</xref>). The present findings may also suggest that connectedness and bonding to school needs to be addressed as part of sex education curricula. The Seattle Social Development Project may serve as one example of this type of intervention, including teacher education and child skill training to promote students’ active involvement in the school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198112447800">Lonczak et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, intrapersonal factors such as attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and perceived norms should be addressed in the context of these social and environmental factors. Thus, evidence-based programs that have taken into account the different and unique pathways to risky sexual behaviors and outcomes (rather than “one-size-fits-all” interventions) may have the potential to lower the rates of early sex initiation, having sex without condoms or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and/or contracting STIs. The results of the present study point toward a more integrated perspective on the whole of adolescents’ experiences with sex and sexuality (i.e., taking into account contextual and intrapersonal pathways), which should in turn lead toward more efficacious and effective interventions.</p>
<p>Another way in which the present findings may be applied in the context of interventions is by considering mediating pathways when designing programs that attempt to reduce the rates of risky sexual behaviors. For example, knowing that the effects of education about pregnancy on condom use and early sex initiation operate partly through the adolescent’s attitudes about pregnancy may suggest that educators should focus on attitudes and beliefs about pregnancy. Similarly, given that parent–adolescent relationship quality operates, at least in part, through self-efficacy in increasing rates of condom use in adolescents, researchers and program planners who work with parents and adolescents may include a module to increase self-efficacy for the use of contraception.</p>
<p>The present research can be extended to include an analysis of factors that may moderate the relationships that we found. Gender is one possible moderating factor, but others may also be identified, such as romantic relationship status or family structure. Future research in this area should also focus on promoting protective sexual behaviors such as delaying initiation and encouraging safer sex among those adolescents who are sexually active. In addition to preventing or reducing risky sexual contact and its consequences, it is also important to study, strengthen, and encourage positive behaviors. Thus, a multiplicity of behaviors, internal and external factors, and frameworks can be used to promote positive change in adolescent health. Once adolescents are emotionally and cognitively mature enough to engage in sexual relationships, it may be important to focus on the “positive” side of sexuality. Future research may also focus on a person-centered analysis that can examine how risky sexual behaviors occur together or separately in groups of individuals. Thus, different groups within the larger sample may be identified and followed through the Add Health waves to determine how these behaviors affect more distal outcomes such as relationships, achievements, and behaviors in adulthood.</p>
