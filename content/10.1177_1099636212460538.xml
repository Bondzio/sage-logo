<p>Damaged glass fibre reinforced plastic–honeycomb core sandwich beams are repaired using uncured glass fibre reinforced plastic fabrics and a handheld iron. The effect of iron temperature, application time and pressure on the effectiveness of repair is investigated by measuring the failure load and flexural stiffness of the repaired beams using third span four-point bending tests. Repairs are tested in compression and tension. A repair process is suggested which consistently recovers 95% of the compressive strength and 77% of the tensile strength of the damaged beam. The repair is shown to have little effect on beam flexural stiffness.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1099636212460538" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Composite materials have become a mainstay of modern aviation. Their strength and stiffness to weight ratio makes them extremely attractive to airline companies, which are striving to reduce aircraft weight and increase fuel efficiency. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a prime example of the use of composite materials in aircraft, with over 50% of the primary structure (including wings and fuselage) made from composite materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099636212460538">1</xref>]. The use of composite materials also extends to the aircraft interior. Galleys, stowages, partitions and other similar cabin components are manufactured to be as light and as stiff as possible. Though their application is less demanding than the airframe, aircraft interiors must still satisfy strenuous crashworthiness and fire-safety requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099636212460538">2</xref>].</p>
<p>By far, the most popular composite material used for aircraft interiors is the honeycomb sandwich panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636212460538">3</xref>]. Typically, this consists of a honeycomb core made from aramid fibre paper faced with glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) thermoset skins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099636212460538">Figure 1</xref>), or for stiffness-critical applications carbon fibre reinforced plastic skins. The skins provide the stiffness and strength of the panel whilst the honeycomb core acts as the lightweight means to separate the skins and transmit shear forces. The role of the skins and core is similar to that of the flanges and web of an I-beam.
<fig id="fig1-1099636212460538" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Layup and orientation of layers of the honeycomb sandwich panel; <italic>t</italic> = thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212460538-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Damage to the panels, either during manufacture or from misuse during service life, can reduce the structural and aesthetic quality of the panel. Panels are usually too costly to replace entirely and so any damage is repaired locally. One common method of repairing damaged honeycomb cores for aircraft interior applications is to fill the affected area of the sandwich panel with a suitable edge filler material. GFRP skin damage, on the other hand, is commonly repaired by gluing a pre-cured patch made from the same skin material over the damaged area. The repair patch is then sanded and surfaced with a decorative material to cover surface flaws. Although this method of skin repair is effective in recovering most of the original aesthetic and structural properties of the panel, it has the disadvantage of being time consuming and results in relatively thick repairs. The adhesive takes time to prepare and the layers that form the repair patch must be pre-cured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1099636212460538"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to develop a novel repair method that would recover the original strength and stiffness of a damaged honeycomb–GFRP sandwich panel, whilst being quicker, simpler and more cost-effective to implement than current practices. This would significantly cut down on manufacturing and repair costs. A time of repair of no more than a few minutes was targeted.</p>
<p>The strategy presented in this article uses the pre-impregnated phenolic resin within the uncured GFRP fabrics as the adhesive which bonds the repair to the panel. The same principle is used during manufacture of the original panels (‘GFRP–honeycomb sandwich panels’ section). This eliminates the need for any external adhesive. In the proposed strategy, the GFRP fabrics are cured onto the damaged panel using the heat of a standard handheld iron pressed by hand. The use of a household iron greatly reduces cost and complexity. The flat surface of most aircraft interior panels is conducive to the use of an iron, whereas curved airframe surfaces would require a more complicated application method, e.g. vacuum moulding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212460538">4</xref>]. Although the use of pre-impregnated resin as the repair adhesive is not new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212460538">4</xref>], the authors believe this to be the first reported use of heat and pressure being applied by a handheld iron.</p>
<p>The repair conditions which best recovered the original structural properties were sought. Three main factors affecting repair strength were investigated: the temperature of the iron; the time for which the heat was applied; the force with which the iron was applied. The effect of the surface preparation of the damaged area was also considered. The strength and stiffness of repair was quantified using four-point bending tests.</p>
<p>The paper consists of five main parts:

<sec id="sec3-1099636212460538"><title>The GFRP–honeycomb sandwich panel</title>
<p>The honeycomb sandwich panels used for this study were manufactured by Mühlenberg Interiors GmbH, Hamburg. The sandwich panels were symmetric and were composed of a honeycomb core faced on both sides by two layers of bi-directional GFRP. The core was an aeronautical quality EuroComposites Nomex honeycomb core of density 48 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, cell size 3.2 mm and nominal thickness 14 mm. The skins consisted of an inner layer of Gurit PHG 600-68-50 and an outer layer of Gurit PHG 600-44-50. Both fabrics have a marginally higher Young’s modulus in direction 1 and are orientated such that direction 1 is aligned with the honeycomb core transverse direction (W). The layup and orientations of the core and skins are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099636212460538">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The panels are manufactured using flat press moulding, in which the lower uncured GFRP, honeycomb core and upper uncured GFRP are stacked onto a heated steel caul plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636212460538">3</xref>]. A second heated caul plate in a hydraulic plate is lowered onto the layup which holds the stack under a pressure of at least 0.07 MPa for approximately 40 min at 140°C.</p>
<p>Preliminary tests showed that the sandwich panel was stronger and stiffer in bending when the core transverse direction (<italic>W</italic>) was aligned with the bending axis. Therefore, to ensure that the repair would be subject to the most intense conditions, the Mühlenberg panels were cut into test sections of length 400 mm and width 50 mm such that the longest dimension of the beam was aligned with the honeycomb ribbon direction (<italic>L</italic>). The width was chosen to maximise the number of samples cut from a single panel whilst easily satisfying the ASTM standard four-point bending guideline that the width should be at least double the thickness of the specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099636212460538">5</xref>].</p>
<p>This study focuses on the repair of damaged skins since they are the main source of strength and stiffness of the panel. As such, this study does not consider the repair of the honeycomb core. The damage was simulated by a 1.5 mm wide gap through the top skins (both PHG 600-44-50 and PHG 600-68-50) at the centre of the beam, leaving the core and lower laminate in tact. The centre of the gap was aligned with the same repeating structure in the underlying honeycomb core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636212460538">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1099636212460538" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Test sample dimensions and position of the cut relative to repeating core structure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212460538-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1099636212460538"><title>Repair procedure</title>
<p>An overlap repair was preferred to a scarf repair due to its ease of application. It has been shown that matching the stiffness of the repair patch to the stiffness of the parent laminate is important for maximising repair effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212460538">4</xref>]. Therefore, the repair patch consisted of an inner layer of Gurit PHG 600-68-50 and an outer layer of Gurit PHG 600-44-50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212460538">Figure 3</xref>). The PHG 600-68-50 and PHG 600-44-50 fabrics were cut into identical 80 × 50 mm<sup>2</sup> patches. The patches were cut such that the principle direction of the fabric (direction 1) was aligned with the longest dimension of the patch. This was to ensure that the repair patch had identical orientation to the underlying laminate.
<fig id="fig3-1099636212460538" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Position, layup and dimensions of repair.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212460538-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>All materials were cut from new, since preliminary tests demonstrated that exposure of an uncured fabric to standard room conditions for several days resulted in a loss of tackiness and a subsequent stiffening of the uncured repair fabrics. To keep peel stresses to a minimum, it is normally recommended that the ratio of overlap length to repair patch thickness should be at least 30 in supported lap repairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212460538">6</xref>]. Preliminary tests showed a maximum repair patch thickness (after the proposed repair process) of 0.6 mm, which justified the overlap length of 39.2 mm used for all subsequent tests.</p>
<p>Initial tests showed that sanding the surface of the damaged beam before the repair patch was applied increased the reliability of the repair. Repairs sanded with grade P40 paper had a lower chance of failure by repair patch delamination than P60 sanded-repairs or repairs without sanding. All subsequent damaged samples were therefore sanded with P40 over the surface area where the repair patch would be applied. After sanding, the area was cleaned with a dry cloth to remove dust. Additional preparation of the damaged area was deemed unnecessary (e.g. the use of acetone to clean the damaged area after sanding). This was justified by later tests, which showed that repairs made at the optimal temperature–time–load conditions did not delaminate from the parent beam; this suggested that the quality of the interface between the repair patch and parent beam was sufficient.</p>
<p>The repair patch was centred over the damage and the rougher sides of the PHG 600-88-50 and PHG 600-44-50 fabrics were faced towards the parent beam. The cut was not filled. A 120 × 120 mm<sup>2</sup> piece of silicone-layered paper was centred over the top of the repair patch and wrapped around the parent beam. The paper was secured to the beam with masking tape. The oversized silicone-layered paper prevented the pre-impregnated resin flowing from the fabrics to the iron, but allowed clearance for excess resin to flow out of the repair patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212460538">Figure 4</xref>). Securing the silicone-layered paper prevented the repair patch from moving during the repair process, which was important since initial tests showed that movement during the process was detrimental to the final repair strength.
<fig id="fig4-1099636212460538" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Repair method illustrating direction of resin flow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212460538-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The heat was applied using a steamless iron (Philips Trocken-Bügeleisen). The temperature of the iron was monitored using a handheld thermocouple. The iron temperature varied with position and time, with a repeating period of approximately 2 min. For a given position and setting, the temperature could vary by 15°C over a 2-min period. To ensure repairs were subjected to the same heating profile, the repair process was initiated when the indicator light switched off. The same area of the iron base was used for all repairs and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212460538">Figure 5</xref>. The iron was not moved during use. All subsequent iron temperatures quoted in the article are area-weighted time averaged values over the area of the iron used for repair.

<p>The iron was pressed onto the repair by hand and the force measured by a weighing scale placed under the sample. Contraction of the repair was noted after cooling, causing the parent beam to bend upwards and an initial central deflection of the repaired beam of up to 2.5 mm. In general, a full-scale panel would be wider and therefore stiffer in bending than the beams tested here; the same size repair patch (80 × 50 mm<sup>2</sup>) would cause significantly less deflection in a full-scale panel. So the samples had negligible initial deflection and the parent beam was pre-displaced during the repair by 1 mm in the opposite direction and clamped. This resulted in a level repaired beam after unclamping and cooling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212460538">Figure 6</xref> shows a damaged beam and a typical repair.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1099636212460538"><title>Four-point bending test method</title>
<p>Four-point bending tests were used to determine the beam failure load and stiffness. A Zwick/Roell Z050 static load test machine was configured for third span loading and linked to a PC for data acquisition. The span between the lower supports was set to 300 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212460538">Figure 7</xref>) so that the load points were outside the repaired zone. Rubber pads (20 mm wide) were placed under the loading points to spread the load and prevent local skin indentation and core crushing. Load and deflection data were recorded up to failure using testXpert software. The deflection of the load test machine was negligible in comparison with the deflection of the sample and was therefore discounted.

<p>Six of the specimens failed by compressive laminate fracture, four of which occurred in the vicinity of the loading points. The one remaining beam failed by tensile laminate fracture. It was concluded that local stress concentrations under the loading rollers did not cause premature failure, since three specimens failed away from the loading zone within a SD of the mean ultimate failure load. This conclusion was supported by the absence of local core crushing under the loading points. Therefore, the specimen width of 50 mm was deemed sufficient for this study, although verging on the lower limit of acceptable width for four-point bending tests.</p>
<p>Tests were also undertaken to examine how direct heating of the undamaged beam affected failure strength. Heat was applied directly with an iron and without silicone-coated paper over the central 50 × 80 mm<sup>2</sup> of the beam for 90 s at 130°C. The heated side of the beam was placed in compression and tested to failure. The results from seven samples showed a mean decrease in failure load of 1.7 N/mm: a 7% reduction. Failure occurred within the heated zone, between the two loading points and approximately 30 mm from a loading roller. However, it was concluded that the additional layers of repair fabrics and silicone-coated paper during an actual repair would reduce the heat transferred to the parent laminate. As such, it was concluded that the effect would be negligible.</p>
<p>Damaged but unrepaired beams were also tested. Due to the absence of the top skins, failure by core crushing occurred immediately. The maximum load-carrying capacity of the damaged beams was approximately 30% of the undamaged equivalent, clearly showing the need for repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1099636212460538"><title>Preliminary investigations</title>
<p>First, repairs were made using a wide range of temperatures and times at constant load, in order to narrow down the optimum repair conditions. The temperature range was necessarily limited to the operating range of the iron to keep the repair process as simple as possible. The time of repair was capped at 150 s; longer repair times were shown to have little added benefit to the repair effectiveness.</p>
<p>Second, the relationship between applied loading and repair strength was investigated. Repair time and temperature was kept constant. The applied loading was capped at 176 N so the repair could be carried out comfortably by hand. This equates to a pressure of 0.44 bar, which is of the same order as the manufacturer’s recommended pressure of at least 0.7 bar when joining the PHG600 series fabrics to a honeycomb core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212460538">9</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec8-1099636212460538"><title>Repair time and temperature</title>
<p>Twenty five specimens were repaired using five temperatures (85°C, 110°C, 120°C, 130°C and 155°C) over five lengths of time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 s) at constant load (147 N). The repaired beams were tested in compression until failure and the ultimate failure load recorded. Trends are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212460538">Figure 8</xref>.

<p>The repairs made at temperatures ≤120°C were not as effective as repairs made at higher temperatures. The maximum failure load of repairs made at 120°C or below was 16.3 N/mm. In comparison, repairs made at higher temperatures attained maximum failure loads of 24.3 N/mm (130°C–150 s) and 23.0 N/mm (155°C–90 s) which approach the strength of an undamaged beam (24.8 N/mm). The repair effectiveness tended to increase with repair time for all temperatures up to approximately 120 s. Over 120 s, the repair effectiveness appeared to plateau for repair temperatures ≤130°C. A trend was not obvious for repairs made at 155°C over 120 s.</p>
<p>During the high-temperature repairs, gaseous release from the repair fabrics was observed. This is due to boiling of the water and volatile content of the fabrics (organic solvents and other ingredients). The volatile content of the PHG600-44-50 and PHG600-68-50 can account for up to 8% of the fabric weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212460538">9</xref>]. It was also noted that the high-temperature repairs often had potmarks on their surface, which may have been due to rapid gaseous release. Initial indications showed that heavily potmarked repairs were less effective than repairs with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The final colour of the repair varied significantly with the repair conditions. Low temperatures (85–110°C) produced transparent repair patches that retained their uncured tackiness; medium temperatures (120°C) resulted in white repairs; high temperatures (130–155°C) produced light to dark brown repairs. This may be an indication of the final chemical and structural composition of the repair patch. The final repair colour was marked as a possible indicator of the repair effectiveness.</p>
<p>Repairs made at higher temperatures for longer times appeared most promising and were the subject of further tests.</p>

<p>Repairs made at six applied loads: 29, 59, 88, 118, 147 and 176 N. The repair temperature and time was kept constant at 130°C and 90 s. The repaired beams were tested in compression until failure and the ultimate failure load recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636212460538">Figure 9</xref>) and flexural stiffness calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212460538">Figure 10</xref>).

</p>
<p>The results showed a clear increase in repair effectiveness with applied load. Repairs made at 147 and 176 N recovered 95% and 98%, respectively, of the median strength of the undamaged beams (24.8 N/mm). These repairs returned the damaged beam to at least the 25th percentile of the failure load of undamaged beams. In terms of flexural stiffness, beams repaired with an applied load of 120 N or more were stiffer on average than the undamaged beams; the beam repaired at 176 N was 7% stiffer on average than the undamaged samples. In contrast, the lower repair loads (&lt;120 N) decreased the stiffness of the beam by up to 4%.</p>
<p>When choosing the best repair load, a number of factors were considered. Whilst the repair ought to be as strong as possible, a low repair load is preferable as it will be applied by hand. It was also considered that achieving a repaired beam stiffness close to stiffness of an undamaged beam was beneficial for the quality of the repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212460538">4</xref>]. Based on these conditions, an applied force of 147 N was chosen for all subsequent tests.</p>

<p>From the initial investigations, the three most promising repair conditions were identified and chosen for repeat tests: 130°C–90 s–147 N (17 samples), 155°C–90 s–147 N (18 samples) and 130°C–150 s–147 N (13 samples). All repairs were tested in compression using the method detailed.

<p>Repairs made at 130°C and 90 s recovered on average 95% of the median undamaged beam strength, with a median failure load of 23.6 N/mm. Significantly, 25% of repairs made at these conditions failed above the median undamaged beam strength. Indeed the strongest repaired beam was manufactured using this repair method and was 6% stronger than an average undamaged beam. The increase in strength can be attributed to the increase in second moment of area of the beam, caused by the added thickness of the repair. The failure load SD of beams manufactured at 130°C for 90 s was 1.7 N/mm, cf 1.4 N/mm SD of the undamaged beams. This similarity in SD gives confidence in the reliability of this repair method.</p>
<p>Similarly, repairs made at 130°C for 150 s also recovered on average 95% of the beam strength. However, the effectiveness of this repair method was less consistent, with a failure load SD of 2.2 N/mm. This was mirrored in the 155°C–90 s repair method, which had a similar consistency of SD = 2.3 N/mm. Repairs made at 155°C for 90 s produced the weakest repairs, on average recovering 93% of the failure load.</p>

All repair methods showed negligible difference in flexural stiffness compared to the undamaged beams. Repairs made at 130°C for both time periods were on average 2% stiffer. In contrast, repairs made at 155°C for 90 s were 1% less stiff on average than the undamaged beams; they also proved to have the greatest SD (0.05 N mm). It should be noted, however, that all repair methods had comparable SD (0.03–0.05 N mm) to the undamaged beam set (0.03 N mm). Repairs made at 130°C for 150 s were consistently stiffest. It was concluded that the stiffness of all three types of repair were acceptable for the operational requirements of the material.</p>

<p>Of the repairs made at 130°C for 90 s, 82% failed outside the repaired zone. This was seen as a great success for that particular repair method. Approximately, half of the 130°C–150 s repairs failed outside the repaired zone, whilst those repaired at 155°C for 90 s had limited success with only 23% failing outside of the repair. Failures outside of the repaired zone were distributed between fracture of the parent laminate in compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1099636212460538">Figure 13</xref>) and fracture of the parent laminate in tension with an associated ripping of the honeycomb core structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1099636212460538">Figure 14</xref>). For all repair methods, a greater percentage of failures occurred on the tensile side of the beam than the compressive side. In contrast, the undamaged beams failed predominantly on the compressive side. The difference in failure location may be explained by the stiffening of the compressive laminate due to the repair patch, preventing local buckling of the compressive laminate.

</p>
<p>Three main failure methods of the repaired zone (in compression) were identified: fracture of the repaired patch directly above the parent laminate damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1099636212460538">Figure 15</xref>); delamination of the repair patch from the parent laminate, either of one entire side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1099636212460538">Figure 16(a)</xref>), the middle portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1099636212460538">Figure 16(b)</xref>) or in a V-shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1099636212460538">Figure 16(c)</xref>); and a combination of both fracture and delamination. Fracture occurred more often than delamination for all three time/temperature combinations. During the initial tests in which much lower temperatures were tested, the most prevalent mode of failure was delamination. The reduced incidence of delamination was seen as a good indication that the bond between the repair patch and parent laminates was sufficient to transmit the required shear forces. The fracture of the repair directly above the damage is probably due to lack of support for the repair by the honeycomb core at this point.

<p>All three time/temperature combinations were successful in recovering the majority of the undamaged beam strength. In some trials, the repaired beams were stronger than the undamaged beams. Specimens repaired at 130°C for 90 s were consistently strongest, though only marginally. Repairs using this method failed outside the repair zone in the majority of cases, which clearly differentiated it from the other methods in the absence of a distinct preference in terms of flexural stiffness or failure load. Accordingly, the repair conditions 130°C for 90 s at 147 N were chosen for further static tests in which the repaired side would be tested in tension.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1099636212460538"><title>Surface appearance</title>
<p>Interestingly, visual inspection of the repair patches could signal the effectiveness of the repair. The most successful repairs were light brown in colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1099636212460538">Figure 17</xref>). Darker brown repairs often failed by fracture or delamination, whilst white or transparent repairs were too tacky and failed prematurely. Often, potmarks could be seen in repairs made at 155°C and was accompanied during the repair process by gaseous release. Whether the rapid gaseous release (water, organic solvents and other ingredients) was a reason for the moderately lower strength of samples made at 155°C is possible. An even spread of resin out of the sides of the repair patch demonstrated that even pressure and temperature was applied over the repair patch during manufacture and was a necessary sign of an effective repair. These visual cues would be useful for in-line repair quality control. Unintrusive microstructural analysis of the repair would be useful to further qualify the nature of each cure system. Such technologies were unavailable to the authors.

<sec id="sec16-1099636212460538"><title>Repaired beam results (repaired side in tension)</title>
<p>Six damaged samples were repaired with a temperature of 130°C for 90 s, at a load of 147 N. The repaired side was tested in tension by positioning the repair on the lower surface during four-point bending (upside down in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212460538">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The SD in failure load was 1.8 N/mm, which was very similar to the SD of 1.7 N/mm of the same repairs in compression. The average failure load was 19.2 N/mm (both median and mean), corresponding to a strength recovery of only 77%. This was also observed in the work of Mahdi et al., where it was demonstrated that overlap repairs were considerably more effective in compression than in tension. It is interesting to note, however, that four out of six failures occurred outside the repaired zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1099636212460538">Figure 18</xref>).
<fig id="fig18-1099636212460538" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Tensile failure of parent laminate.</p>
<p>All failures of this kind occurred within the shaded region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212460538-fig18.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Mahdi et al. postulated that the reduction in failure load may be due to the increase in stress and strain concentrations resulting from the stress transfer at the end of the overlap. This agrees with the observations in this study, in which the limiting stress concentrations appear within the parent laminate. A solution may be to eliminate the step-change in laminate thickness to form a smooth transition by sanding the repair patch edges. This is more akin to a scarf repair which is shown in the literature to be effective in tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636212460538">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, scarf repairs have been shown to be less effective in compression.</p>
<p>The flexural stiffness of the repaired beams in tension was 1.15 MN mm, an increase of 4% on the undamaged beams. It is to be expected that the repaired beam would be stiffer than the same undamaged beam because of the additional thickness. It is unclear, however, why the same repair would be stiffer in tension more than compression.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1099636212460538" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study was successful in showing the viability of a simple time- and cost-saving technique for repairing damaged GFRP–honeycomb core sandwich panels. It was shown that the repair effectiveness varies significantly with the applied time, temperature and pressure of the iron. Clear advantage was gained from high pressures, long cure times and medium to high temperatures. The repair conditions 130°C–90 s–147 N were deemed to maximise repair strength whilst reducing by as much as possible the time and pressure of the repair. These conditions are therefore suggested for this kind of repair. It should be noted that the proposed procedure in its current form should be limited to flat, non-critical components, due to the individual human factor associated with each repair. It is not intended to compete with vacuum bagging in the repair of critical components and/or curved surfaces.</p>
<p>It was demonstrated that a damaged beam, repaired using the suggested time/temperature/pressure conditions, recovers on average 95% of its undamaged strength when the repair is subjected to compressive forces. The SD in failure load of 17 samples, repaired at the suggested conditions and tested in compression, was 1.7 N/mm. Since this was comparable to the undamaged beam SD of 1.4 N/mm, it is concluded that this repair strategy is consistently effective in compression.</p>
<p>The same repair was weaker when subjected to tensile forces; on average, the repair in tension recovered 77% of the undamaged beam strength. The decrease was attributed to stress and strain concentrations due to the step change in beam thickness at the end of the repair. A method to improve the tensile properties of the repair is suggested by the removal of the step change to smooth the transition between the repair and parent laminate.</p>
<p>Repairs made at the suggested conditions were shown to increase the stiffness of the beam by up to 4%. For the usual applications of GFRP–honeycomb sandwich panels, a 4% difference in stiffness is insignificant and therefore it was concluded that the repairs satisfy stiffness requirements.</p>
<p>The mode and position of failure depended on the exact conditions of repair. Eighty two percent of repairs made using the suggested conditions failed outside the repaired zone, which was regarded as a success for the repair method. Fracture of the repair patch over the cut was the main cause of failure within the repaired zone, possibly due to lack of support of the repair laminate above the damage. Failures of this kind could be reduced by filling the damaged space with GFRP material.</p>
<p>Visual inspection of the repair was a good indicator of repair effectiveness, a useful property for industrial application. Light brown repairs with few potmarks and even resin flow were most likely to result in an effective repair. Naturally, these visual cues are specific to the materials used in this study. Further improvements to the method could include applying a dead load to the repair for a set time after heating and using a bespoke iron with improved temperature control. Research into the cure temperature and load gradients across the repair patch is also suggested.</p>
