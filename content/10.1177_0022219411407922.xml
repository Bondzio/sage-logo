<abstract>
<p>Participants with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often impaired in visuomotor tasks. However, little is known about the contribution of modal impairment in motor function relative to central processing deficits or whether different processes underlie the impairment in ADHD combined (ADHD-C) versus ADHD inattentive (ADHD-I) subtype. The present study analyzes performance on the <italic>Visual Motor Integration Test</italic> relative to less effortful motor tests as well as on measures of energetics. Both ADHD groups showed evidence of impaired motor function on both visual-motor integration (VMI) and the less effortful motor tests. The ADHD-C group performed below the ADHD-I group on VMI, but their performance correlated highly with the measures of the energetic pools of arousal and effort. Different mechanisms may underlie impaired fine motor skills in ADHD. Central processing deficits contribute significantly to the deficit of ADHD-C but do not explain the motor impairment in ADHD-I.</p>

<body>
<p>The current criteria for a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411407922">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) have no reference to motor function, neither with regard to the primarily inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) nor with regard to the combined subtype (ADHD-C). Nevertheless, impaired motor control has been found in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411407922">Meyer &amp; Sagvolden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411407922">Stray, Stray, Iversen, Ruud, Ellertsen, &amp; Tønnessen, 2009</xref>). With regard to subtypes of ADHD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411407922">Piek, Pitcher, and Hay (1999)</xref> found fine motor function to be particularly impaired in ADHD-I, whereas gross motor deficits were more common in ADHD-C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411407922">Watemberg, Waiserberg, Zuk, and Lerman-Sagie (2007)</xref>, however, found ADHD-I participants to be generally more impaired.</p>
<p>The lack of reference to motor function in present diagnostic criteria for ADHD is in contrast to the early precursor of this diagnosis, namely minimal brain dysfunction, in which poor motor control was emphasized as a reliable soft neurological sign indicating disturbed central nervous system integrity thought to underlie the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411407922">Gilberg &amp; Kadesjö, 2009</xref>). Gilberg’s later construct of deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411407922">Gilberg, 1983</xref>) is today considered an interface between ADHD and what is now diagnosed as developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The prevailing view today is that impaired performance of motor acts such as writing or drawing among participants with ADHD is merely secondary to the attention deficit or impulsivity characterizing the disorder. However, the research is inconclusive. Some studies question these assumptions claiming that the poor fine motor ability associated with ADHD represents a primary motor deficit, not attributed to inattentiveness or hyperactivity or impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411407922">Eliasson, Rösblad, &amp; Forssberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411407922">Watemberg et al., 2007</xref>). Contrary to this finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411407922">Schoemaker, Ketelaars, van Zonneveld, Minderaa, and Mulder (2005)</xref> found that deficits in motor planning were mediated by different underlying processes in DCD and ADHD. Overall, their results did not allow any conclusions to be drawn concerning whether the deficits among participants with ADHD were the result of a developmental delay or poor inhibitory control. They suggested that medication studies showing improvement could possibly settle the issue. And indeed, several studies have shown an effect of medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411407922">Flapper, Houwen, &amp; Schoemaker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411407922">Lufi &amp; Gai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411407922">Stray, Stray, Iversen, Ruud, &amp; Ellertsen, 2009</xref>). In accordance with present diagnostic criteria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411407922">Tseng, Henderson, Chow, and Yao (2004)</xref> found that impaired fine motor skills could be explained by impulsivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411407922">Kalff et al. (2003)</xref> compared high-and low-level motor control tasks in preschoolers, finding impairment only in highly controlled tasks among participants later diagnosed with ADHD. They thus concluded that impaired effort might have accounted for the motor deficit. In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411407922">Hurks et al. (2005)</xref> found a dissociation between normal fast automatic visuomotor response preparation and impaired effort demanding or controlled response preparation in ADHD. Hypothesizing that inaccurate motor performance was the result of a lack of intrinsic motivation rather than specific motor impairment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411407922">van Meel, Oosterlaan, Heslenfeld, and Sergeant (2005)</xref> investigated the effect of extrinsic rewards. However, they found no differential effect in the ADHD group and concluded that there is a generic motor timing deficit in ADHD.</p>
<p>Thus, the question of what mediates impaired motor performance in ADHD is still not settled. More specifically, the question of possible different mechanisms in subgroups of ADHD has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Since impaired fine motor skills result in poor handwriting, they are particularly detrimental to academic performance. Tests involving drawing are often used to examine such fine motor skills. The quality of drawing in comparison to the model figure is then taken to reflect the participant’s skill with regard to visual motor integration. Poor correspondence could be the result of impaired perception of the model or poor motor control when drawing it. Taking the above literature review into account, it is reasonable to assume that there is a host of other factors characteristic of ADHD that could also influence the result. These include impulsivity and hyperactivity, which could lead to a “quick and dirty” strategy in which the participant both literally and metaphorically cuts corners. Although the participant may be able to control muscle movements sufficiently for correct performance, he or she may be impaired in higher level behavioral control and thus invest superficial effort into solving the task. That is what would be expected when poor motor function is secondary to the core symptoms of ADHD, namely impaired attention to the stimulus and impulsive hyperactive performance. Trying to differentiate between a general performance style and a modal deficit in motor function, may have implications for both diagnosis and treatment. In the latter case, the participant should be diagnosed with a comorbid DCD. If poor handwriting reflects motor incoordination, interventions should target either training motor function, for example in physical therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411407922">Watemberg et al., 2007</xref>), or learning compensatory strategies such as using a computer instead of handwriting. If the problem is secondary to the core deficits of ADHD, treatment of these should be expected to improve motor function.</p>
<p>In the present study we analyze the results of a frequently used clinical test of visual-motor integration (VMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411407922">Beery, 1997</xref>) in an attempt to identify the underlying mechanisms mediating possible impairment. In this test the participants are asked to copy 27 designs as accurately as possible. Performance on this task is considered to have high ecological validity because of the similarity to daily activities such as writing. Previously, VMI has been found to be impaired in those with both ADHD-C and ADHD-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411407922">Geurts, Verté, Osterlaan, Roeyers, &amp; Sergeant, 2005</xref>). A high correlation between VMI performance and simpler motor tests considered to be less demanding of attention, executive function, or motivation would indicate that impaired VMI performance reflects genuinely impaired fine motor function, whereas a low correlation would indicate that other mechanisms mediate low test performance. We expect both participants with ADHD-C and those with ADHD-I to be similarly impaired, but for different reasons. In line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411407922">Piek et al. (1999)</xref>, motor incoordination is expected to mediate more of the impairment among participants with ADHD-I than among participants with ADHD-C. Participants with ADHD-C are expected to show impaired performance on VMI because of a more general deficit cutting across cognitive modules such as motor performance or learning. Drawing from the cognitive effort model (CEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411407922">Sergeant, 2005</xref>) energetic factors are candidates for modulating the output from motor tests as well as higher order cognitive tasks in ADHD.</p>
<p>According to CEM, there are three distinct energetic pools, two of which are hypothesized to be relevant for VMI performance. These are <italic>effort</italic> and <italic>arousal</italic>. Their neurophysiological function and cerebral localization are well described by the CEM theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411407922">Sergeant, 2005</xref>), but as latent variables underlying performance on neuropsychological tests, they are naturally difficult to operationalize. Based on our own previous research, we nevertheless think it is possible to deduct measures from neuropsychological examinations that can serve as approximate operationalizations, making it possible to extract their contributions to the manifest deficit in motor function.</p>
<p><italic>Effort</italic> is required whenever the current state of the organism does not match that required to perform the task. Effort encompasses factors such as motivation and response to contingencies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411407922">Sergeant, Piek, and Oosterlaan (2006)</xref>, the effort pool is localized within the hippocampus but requires coordination also with frontal lobe structures. The claim that effort seems to be impaired in ADHD is based on findings of variability of performance. Under specific circumstances that increase intrinsic motivation or under high extrinsic reinforcement, participants with ADHD increase their performance more than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411407922">Luman, Oosterlaan, Hyde, van Meel, &amp; Sergeant, 2007</xref>). If reinforcement and motivation contingencies rather than task complexity are decisive, the typical impaired performance of ADHD participants on effortful executive function tasks would better be described as impairment in effort than in executive function per se. An operationalization of effort allocation needs to refer to a task in which the participant can <italic>choose</italic> how much effort to put into the task. It is also necessary to avoid measures of executive function or attention. Such tasks are generally effortful, but impaired performance is difficult to interpret specifically as impairment in motivation and not in executive function by itself. Third, the effort measure must not be a test of general ability in disguise.</p>
<p>The application of deep-level encoding strategies on memory tests satisfies the above criteria. Studying what mediates memory impairment in ADHD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411407922">Egeland, Johansen, and Ueland (2010)</xref> found that four measures of learning strategy explained the diagnosis-specific differences in memory between the normal controls and the participants with ADHD. The same subjects took part both in that study as well as the present one. We thus claimed that impaired effort rather than poor attention or memory per se mediated impaired retrieval among the participants with ADHD. Based on these four effort indices we compute a composite measure of effort in this study and test the explanatory power of this measure also outside the domain of learning. The question then is, How much of the variance in motor function can be explained by such a possible general measure of effort?</p>
<p><italic>Arousal</italic> is defined as phasic responding that is time locked to stimulus processing. Signal intensity and novelty increase arousal. By the same token, decreased intensity of stimulation leads to falling arousal. Manipulating interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in tests of continuous performance have generally found that participants with ADHD typically perform worse with increasing ISIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411407922">Sergeant, Oosterlaan, &amp; van der Meere, 1999</xref>). This is considered as a fall in arousal. Participants with ADHD are considered more stimulus bound than healthy controls. In a study based on the same participants as those examined here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411407922">Egeland, Johansen, and Ueland (2009)</xref> found that only participants with ADHD-C differed from normals with regard to falling off in attention with increasing ISI. In the present analysis, we expect that this tendency to lose arousal without intense external stimulation could contribute to poor performance also on the VMI, even though it is not a test of attention.</p>
<p>The overarching hypothesis is that effort and arousal, previously shown to differentiate between ADHD and controls and explain performance within <italic>specific</italic> behavioral domains, may reflect more <italic>general</italic> nonmodulary features of ADHD and thus explain variance also in the VMI task that differs completely both in design and neuropsychological function tested. To sum up: First learning strategy measures explaining low effort in a memory test are expected to measure low effort <italic>in general</italic> and thus are expected to correlate also with VMI performance among participants with ADHD-C. Second, ISI effects explaining impaired attention on Conners’s <italic>Continuous Performance Test–II</italic> (CPT-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411407922">Conners, 2002</xref>) are considered to measure a <italic>general</italic> tendency for ADHD-C participants to lose arousal when not externally stimulated and thus explain impaired performance also in VMI since it involves consecutive drawing of 27 designs. Third, the VMI performance of participants with ADHD-I, although equally impaired as that of the ADHD-C participants, is expected to reflect genuine motor incoordination more than impaired energetics.</p>
<p>When trying to look for latent variables such as energetic mediating impairment in a manifest function such as visual motor integration, there is always a risk that the chosen candidates for the latent variable in fact are also intermediate variables reflecting some underlying third variable. The third variable most probable to confound the results is IQ, found to correlate with both VMI and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411407922">Egeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411407922">Sortor &amp; Kulp, 2003</xref>). To synthesize the net association between motor function and VMI and energetic and VMI, we thus control for IQ in partial correlations.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In the present study, 67 children with ADHD and 67 healthy control children between 9 and 16 years participated. The patients had been referred for diagnosis and treatment to three child and adolescent outpatient clinics in the county of Vestfold, Norway, between 2004 and 2007. All participants underwent a thorough medical and neurological examination by a pediatrician as well as a structured clinical interview aiming to confirm the presence of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Possible differential diagnoses were also considered. To document that symptoms were present before the age of 7, information was collected in retrospect by interviewing parents and teachers and collecting case records from the school psychology services from the time prior to referral. Teachers and parents, as well as participants older than 12, completed the Achenbach scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411407922">Achenbach, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411407922">Nøvik, 2000</xref>) measuring <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>–oriented affective, anxiety, ADHD, oppositional-defiant, and conduct disorder symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411407922">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Teachers and parents also completed the <italic>ADHD Rating Scale–IV</italic> school and home versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411407922">DuPaul, Power, Anastoupolous, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>). Exclusion criteria for all participants were mental retardation, metabolic disorders, or evidence of organic brain disease such as, for instance, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, myelomenigocele (MMC), or any head injury with resulting unconsciousness. Based on the above-mentioned information, the diagnosis was set by consensus by a team consisting of a clinical psychologist, a pediatrician, and a special education teacher. The pattern of scoring on the Inattention and the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity scales of the <italic>ADHD Rating Scale–IV</italic> together with the information from the interview and the case history decided the further subclassification into ADHD-C and ADHD-I. A total of 41 participants satisfied the criteria for a <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> diagnosis of ADHD-C, and 26 were diagnosed with ADHD-I.</p>
<p>Children with ADHD frequently have comorbid psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411407922">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411407922">Table 1</xref> shows the frequency of comorbid disorders defined as a parent and teacher rating above a <italic>T</italic>-score of 60 on the Achenbach scales. The frequency of all comorbid disorders was higher in both clinical groups compared to the healthy control group. The frequency of oppositional defiant disorder was higher in the ADHD-C group than in the ADHD-I group.</p>

<p>Neuropsychological assessment was conducted prior to medical treatment start for all but one patient. He had started treatment with methylphenidate, but the medication was discontinued 22 hr prior to testing, which is considered appropriate to null the duration of action for MPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411407922">Gualtieri et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The control group was recruited from three secondary schools and one junior high school in Vestfold county, Norway. Based on the teachers’ individual workload, they were asked to randomly select between three and seven students from their respective classes for participation. All control participants attended regular school classes at normal grade levels. Information letters describing the research project were distributed to all students by the teacher. The children’s parents provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as mentioned above, but in addition parents were asked to confirm that the control children were not using prescribed medication, receiving treatment from child and adolescent psychiatric services, diagnosed with a learning disability, or currently receiving any form of special tutoring or education (although he or she may have received such tutoring previously). None of the control children scored in the clinical range (above the 93rd percentile) on the <italic>ADHD Rating Scale–IV</italic> school and home versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411407922">DuPaul et al., 1998</xref>) or on any of the subscales measuring inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (H/I). However, the results of the <italic>Grooved Pegboard</italic> test (GP) showed an unexpected bimodal distribution in the control group. In all, 60 participants clustered around an average performance score varying from 47 to 90 s, whereas 7 participants clustered around a low performance peak with scores varying from 103 to 116 s with the dominant hand. It was decided to use 100 s as a cutoff point for considering these participants as having probable DCD. It must be emphasized that a performance below 100 s represents a severe impairment in motor control. The performances of the ADHD subgroups were normally distributed from a best performance of 52 s to 91 s in the ADHD-C group and from 56 s to 107 s in the ADHD-I group. To adhere to the same cutoff rules, two participants with ADHD-I were excluded from that group and classified as having a combination of ADHD-I and DCD.</p>
<p>Demographic and clinical characteristics for the participant sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411407922">Table 1</xref>. ANOVAs with least significant difference post hoc analyses were used to investigate differences between the groups for continuous measures and chi-squares for categorical variables. The ADHD-I group was older than healthy controls (HC). The two participants classified as ADHD+DCD were younger than the remaining groups, indicating that their low performance on the GP test could have been the result of their young age. The seven participants in the DCD group, however, were numerically older than both ADHD-C and HC, although this difference was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to sex, IQ, or dexterity. One participant in the ADHD-I group was classified as ambidextrous as he had no writing hand preference.</p>
<p>As expected, both ADHD groups had higher scores than both HC and DCD on attention problems and H/I as rated by parents. The teachers, however, rated also the DCD participants as having higher inattention than the remaining HC. Still, the DCD group scored significantly lower on inattention than both ADHD groups. With regard to H/I both ADHD groups had higher scores than HC, and the ADHD-C group had higher scores than ADHD-I and DCD. With regard to <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> ADHD-related problems, on the Achenbach scales both teachers and parents rated both the two ADHD groups and the DCD group higher than HC. However, the parents rated the DCD group with fewer symptoms than both ADHD groups, and the teachers rated the DCD group and the ADHD-I group as having fewer ADHD symptoms than the ADHD-C group. Looking at <italic>T</italic>-scores, the average of the DCD group was less than t-60, indicating that they were not a ADHD group in disguise. Summing up, we nevertheless state that at least in school, the DCD group scores somewhere between the remaining HC and the ADHD groups.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022219411407922">
<title>Materials and Measures</title>
<p>The participants were examined with the following tests:</p>
<p>The <italic>Visual Motor Integration Test</italic> (4th ed., revised) and the VMI <italic>Supplemental Developmental Tests, Visual Perception</italic> and <italic>Motor Coordination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411407922">Beery, 1997</xref>) were given. On the VMI, the participant is asked to copy 27 geometrical designs as correctly as possible. The designs range from very simple (a straight line) to quite complicated figures (cubes, overlapping circles). It is a commonly used standardized test with an objective scoring system. On the supplemental <italic>Visual Perception Test</italic>, the participants are asked to match the same 27 designs to the exact similar design among three to six alternatives. On the <italic>Motor Coordination Test</italic>, the participants are once again asked to draw the figures, but this time only by tracking within boundary lines delineating the correct design. Although the <italic>Visual Perception Test</italic> should measure the degree to which form perception contributes to overall VMI score, the <italic>Motor Coordination Test</italic> should measure the motor contribution. However, relevant to our hypothesis that VMI performance is highly modifiable also by central processes, the satellite tests are found to explain about 22% to 36% of the variance in VMI performance in healthy children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411407922">Avi-Itzhak &amp; Obler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411407922">Kulp &amp; Sortor, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The GP test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411407922">Matthews &amp; Kløwe, 1964</xref>) and the <italic>Halstead Finger Tapping Test</italic> (FT; for descriptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411407922">Meyer &amp; Sagvolden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411407922">Prigatano, Gray, &amp; Legacy, 2008</xref>) were performed according to manual instructions. Both tests are of short duration and are considered to require a low degree of effort. The GP measures fine motor coordination and the FT measures fine motor speed. The reported measure from the GP is time to complete inserting 25 pegs into a metal board, whereas the reported measure from the FT is the mean number of key tappings within a 10-s period.</p>
<p>The effort measure is derived from four measures of high-effort learning strategies applied in the encoding phase of <italic>Children’s Auditory Verbal Learning Test–II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411407922">Talley, 1993</xref>). These are <italic>Semantic Clustering</italic>, <italic>Lack of Build-Up of Proactive Interference</italic>, <italic>Responses from Middle Section Items</italic>, and <italic>Retroactive Interference</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411407922">Egeland et al., 2010</xref>, for details). Effect sizes were computed from the performance of the HC. The composite effort measure is the sum of effect sizes for the four measures divided by 4. This measure can therefore be read as a <italic>z</italic> score.</p>
<p><italic>Hit Reaction Time ISI Change</italic> (ISI Change) from the CPT-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411407922">Conners, 2002</xref>) was used as the measure of arousal. This is a measure of the change in reaction time over the three ISIs in the test (1, 2, and 4 s). A positive slope indicates a slowing of reaction time as the time between targets increases and is taken as an indication of decreasing arousal while not externally stimulated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022219411407922">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Since there was a significant age difference between the groups and since test performance is highly related to age, age was controlled for in the analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs). This precludes the possibility of post hoc tests. Therefore, each clinical group was compared to each other and to the HC in pairwise comparisons. The relationship between the motor tests and energetic variables was analyzed in separate partial correlations for each ADHD group including the HC. Although losing statistical power, two separate analyses were necessary since the hypotheses regarding correlations were specified for each of the clinical groups. The HC group was included to avoid analyzing only intragroup variability, which is smaller and increases the risk of coincidental results (Type I error). With an age range of 7 years, age had to be controlled for in the correlations. To ensure that possible correlations were not an artifact of a general effect of IQ, this was also controlled for in the correlations. Because of low statistical power, we performed no statistical analyses with regard to the two participants with both DCD and ADHD-I.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Teachers and parents of children and adolescents with ADHD often describe poor quality handwriting and drawing skills, and several studies have shown impaired motor control in ADHD. It is, however, unclear what mediates this impairment, when examining ADHD participants without comorbid DCD. Furthermore, little is known about possible differences between the combined type of ADHD and the inattentive type of the disorder. The groups could differ both with regard to level of impaired function and with regard to the mechanisms mediating impairment.</p>
<p>By design, the VMI test is considered to measure visuomotor function in an ecologically valid way since it involves drawing that is a real-life activity. In the present study, both ADHD groups performed below typical children on the VMI. However, the ADHD-C group also performed below the ADHD-I group. Considered in isolation, this could be taken to mean, contrary to the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411407922">Piek et al. (1999)</xref>, that ADHD-C participants are the most impaired in fine motor function. However, the remaining tests tell another story. Both ADHD groups were equally impaired on the two satellite tests, <italic>Visual Perception</italic> and <italic>Motor Coordination</italic>, as well as on GP and on FT dominant hand. Only the ADHD-C group was impaired also on FT nondominant hand, but this was because of smaller statistical power in the ADHD-I group, which scored numerically below the ADHD-C group. So, when simple tests of motor function such as GP and FT are taken into accord, the two subgroups are equally impaired. Why then is the ADHD-C group most impaired on VMI? Our overarching hypothesis is that this is not because of a larger motor impairment in ADHD-C but because of central processing deficits that are more pronounced in ADHD-C.</p>
<p>As candidates of such central processing deficits, we chose measures taken from other neuropsychological domains, namely an effort measure based on whether participants used deep-level encoding strategies on a learning test. The other central processing measure was taken from a continuous performance test and was presumed to operationalize change in arousal since it measured change in performance with increasing ISIs. These two measures have previously been shown to differentiate between normal controls and participants with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411407922">Egeland et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411407922">2010</xref>). What is new in the present study is using these measures to test whether they represent a <italic>generalized</italic> tendency to invest less effort in tasks and to loose activation also in repetitive and effort-demanding motor tasks such as the VMI. The correlation matrix shows that both measures correlate with VMI performance for the ADHD-C group and controls. For the ADHD-I group, only simple motor performance measured by Pegboard correlated with VMI. The correlations between Pegboard and the Energetics measures were close to zero. This indicates that Energetics and simple motor performance represent different sources of variance with regard to VMI performance.</p>
<p>We interpret these correlations to mean that when participants with ADHD-C are more impaired in a complex fine motor test such as VMI, this is the result of an impairment in both simple fine motor control and Energetics, whereas only impaired fine motor control contributes to the impairment in ADHD-I.</p>
<p>Few studies have systematically varied central processing demands of different motor tests to examine the relative contributions to impaired fine motor skills in daily functioning. To the best of our knowledge, two studies have reached similar conclusions as the present study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411407922">Kalff et al. (2003)</xref> found that high level processing such as self-control and self-regulation particularly affected high-effort motor tasks in ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411407922">Tseng et al. (2004)</xref> found no group difference between ADHD participants and controls with regard to strength, upper limb, or other tasks that did not tax sustained attention. Moreover, they commented that the nonimpaired tests had a fast event rate, which usually improves performance in children with ADHD. In their study, measures from a continuous performance test correlated specifically with fine motor function. This led them to conclude that impulsivity causes handwriting or graphomotor output of children with ADHD to often show recklessness, careless errors, or a lack of attention to detail. None of these studies, however, included a group of ADHD-I participants. Thus, the present study seems to be the first to lend support to the notion that central processing deficits play a minor role in the fine motor output of ADHD-I participants and that their impairment in complex tasks reflects a genuine modal motor deficit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411407922">Watemberg et al. (2007)</xref> have previously found that more ADHD-I than ADHD-C participants had a comorbid DCD, but they diagnosed DCD from motor and movement test results, without differentiating between underlying mechanisms mediating the impairment.</p>
<p>Although not intended as a separate diagnostic group in the original design of the study, the results of the DCD group deserve some comments. They were recruited to the control group of the study, and their parents had signed a statement of adherence to the inclusion criteria, that is, that the children had no learning deficit or psychiatric diagnosis and were not receiving special education. Their motor impairment seems to have gone unattended, and in fact they scored perfectly normal on the more complex VMI test. The size of the group and the fact that they were diagnosed post hoc, after analyzing their test results, prevent us from drawing firm conclusions. Suggestive for further research, we would like to point out that their effort score numerically deviated from the rest of the normal controls. This indicated that they in fact invested <italic>more</italic> effort than the other controls. It is possible that they had a particularly meticulous strategy on the VMI, compensating for their simple motor impairment. If this should prove correct in larger samples, they do not suffer from a subclinical DAMP condition. DAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411407922">Gilberg &amp; Kadesjö, 2009</xref>) has been suggested as a term for participants with comorbid ADHD and DCD. Studying DCD children without a formally diagnosed comorbid attention disorder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411407922">Piek et al. (2004)</xref> found only weak relationships between motor and executive functions. They thus concluded that there is not a common etiology between the two disorders.</p>
<p>Regarding limitations, the post hoc diagnosis of DCD of course represents a methodological shortcoming. Another limitation is the lack of information about reading ability of the clinical participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411407922">Kooistra, Crawford, Dewey, Cantell, and Kaplan (2005)</xref> found that although the participants with ADHD were impaired on the VMI, the motor impairment was more closely related to reading disability (RD) than with ADHD. In that study, however, the majority of ADHD participants were medicated with methylphenidate. This could have normalized their performance or at least reduced the part of their deficit that was a result of impaired central processing. Nevertheless, it would have been preferable to be able to control for RD.</p>
<p>Taking the limitations into accord, the present study represents an approach to deconstruct fine motor impairment in ADHD. The results indicate the joint contribution of central processing energetic factors as well as genuinely impaired modal fine motor skills in ADHD-C, whereas the latter plays a more prominent role in ADHD-I. Regarding clinical implications, we think that poor motor performance resulting from energetic factors implicates other treatment or intervention strategies compared to the situation when motor control is impaired on a more basic level. In the first case, treatment with stimulating drugs might alleviate the impairment, as several studies have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411407922">Stray, Stray, Iversen, Ruud, &amp; Ellertsen, 2009</xref>). In the second case, interventions must be targeted either at reducing the motor demand of a given task, for example, by using computers for writing, or at training motor function as has been shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411407922">Watemberg et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
