<p>A little more than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997)</xref> proposed a broad self-concept construct called “core self-evaluations” defined as fundamental, bottom-line evaluations one makes regarding one’s self-worth, capacity to control one’s life, general competence, and a general sense that one’s life will turn out well. Contrary to some models of self-concept, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al. (1997)</xref> took a “top-down” approach, arguing that situational specific appraisals and related behaviors depended on core self-evaluations. Early research measured core self-evaluations indirectly, modeling it as a higher order construct indicated by four well-established personality constructs: (a) self-esteem, or the overall value one places on one’s self as a person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442964">Harter, 1990</xref>); (b) generalized self-efficacy, or one’s belief regarding one’s ability to perform well in a variety of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812442964">Locke, McClear, &amp; Knight, 1996</xref>); (c) locus of control, or beliefs that events in one’s life are the result of one’s behavior rather than the result of external forces (Rotter, 1996); and (d) neuroticism, the tendency to have negative cognitions and to focus on negative aspects of life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1548051812442964">Watson, 2000</xref>). More recent research has used a direct measure of core self-evaluations (the Core Self-Evaluations Scale [CSES]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2003</xref>) designed to provide greater measurement precision while addressing conceptual and methodological concerns raised regarding modeling the construct as a higher order latent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812442964">Johnson, Rosen, &amp; Levy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research indicates that core self-evaluations are related to several important criteria, including job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, Durham, &amp; Kluger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1548051812442964">Rode, 2004</xref>), life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442964">Judge, Bono, Erez, &amp; Locke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, et al., 1998</xref>), coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442964">Kammeyer-Mueller, Judge, &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>), job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442964">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, &amp; Bono, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>), earning and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812442964">Judge &amp; Hurst, 2008</xref>), citizenship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442964">Bowling, Wang, &amp; Li, 2011</xref>), and service quality orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1548051812442964">Salvaggio et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, previous research indicates that core self-evaluations demonstrate incremental predictive validity after controlling for several well-established measures of individual differences including the Big 5 personality dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442964">Judge, Heller, &amp; Klinger, 2008</xref>) and measures of dispositional affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442964">Piccolo, Judge, Takahashi, Watanabe, &amp; Locke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1548051812442964">Weitz, 1952</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these results are encouraging, more research regarding the construct’s incremental predictive validity is needed in at least two areas, if core self-evaluations are to become a part of the accepted individual differences nomenclature. First, the incremental validity of core self-evaluations over other self-oriented traits is not fully known. Although initial research has investigated the incremental validity of core self-evaluations over self-esteem on measures of subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2002</xref>), the incremental effects relative to other self-oriented constructs have not been investigated as far we know. Second, additional research is needed regarding the generalizability of the construct’s incremental predictive validity across cultures. Initial research supports the predictive validity of core self-evaluations in cultures outside the United States with respect to job satisfaction in both Israeli and Dutch samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442964">Judge, Van Vianen, &amp; De Pater, 2004</xref>), career ambition in a Spanish student sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2004</xref>), career success in a German sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1548051812442964">Stumpp, Muck, Hulsheger, Judge, &amp; Maier, 2010</xref>), and both job and life satisfaction in Japanese and Swiss samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442964">Hirschi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442964">Piccolo, Judge, Takahashi, Watanabe, &amp; Locke, 2005</xref>). Research on non-Western samples is particularly important to core self-evaluations research given the self-focus of the trait, which from the onset was one of the defining characteristics of the concept.</p>
<p>We extend previous research by addressing these deficiencies in three ways. First, we examined the incremental predictive validity of the CSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>) relative to three self-focused individual difference constructs: self-esteem, Protestant work ethic, and narcissism. Although self-esteem has a rich history in the industrial-organizational psychology literature, and has demonstrated notably strong correlations with the CSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>), both narcissism and Protestant work ethic were conceived in distal research traditions and have only recently appeared in the industrial-organizational psychology literature. Second, we examined a broad range of outcome criteria, many of which have yet to be studied in core self-evaluations research, including various job performance and job satisfaction facets, as well as an array of other job attitudes. Third, our analyses included both U.S. and Chinese data sets. The demonstration of the incremental predictive validity of core self-evaluations in a highly collectivistic culture such as China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442964">Fu, Wu, Yongkang, &amp; Ye, 2007</xref>), where the role of the self relative to the group differs significantly from more individualistic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442964">J. D. Campbell et al., 1996</xref>), would provide strong support for the universal predictive validity of the construct.</p>
<p>Given the cultural differences inherent in our samples and the differences in both the independent and dependent variables contained in the two samples, we present hypotheses specific to each study in separate sections rather than the more traditional approach of including the hypotheses for both studies in the same section. Study 1 used longitudinal multisource data to examine the incremental effects of core self-evaluations over self-esteem with respect to a host of job attitude and job performance criteria in a sample of U.S. workers. Study 2 examined the incremental effects of core self-evaluations over both Protestant work ethic and narcissism with respect to overall life satisfaction, three measures of job satisfaction, and seven additional measures of job attitudes, in a sample of Chinese workers.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051812442964">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Study 1 examined the incremental predictive validity of core self-evaluations over self-esteem. We focused on self-esteem because of its notably strong empirical relationship with core self-evaluations. Research indicates that of the four constructs used as indirect indicators of core self-evaluations in early research, self-esteem is the most highly correlated with the CSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1548051812442964">1</xref></sup> Moreover, self-esteem has demonstrated particularly strong factor loadings, relative to the other three measures, in research that has modeled core self-evaluations as a higher order construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442964">Judge, Bono, &amp; Locke, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1548051812442964">
<title>Core Self-Evaluations and Overall Job Attitudes</title>
<p>Self-verification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1548051812442964">Swann, Stein-Seroussi, &amp; Giesler, 1992</xref>) suggests that intrinsic job characteristics, such as those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442964">Hackman and Oldham (1980</xref>; e.g., task significance, autonomy, feedback, etc.), mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and general job attitudes such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Individuals with higher perceived core self-evaluations seek out jobs with characteristics (i.e., greater complexity, autonomy, etc.) that verify their high level of perceived competence and capacity, which in turn, are associated with positive job attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812442964">Brief, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812442964">Fried &amp; Ferris, 1987</xref>). More directly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al. (1997)</xref> suggest that core self-evaluations are related to perceptions of the work environment. Individuals with low core self-evaluations may experience little satisfaction with a given work context because they expect that their incompetence will eventually lead to failure, disgrace, and unfulfilled expectations. Conversely, positive feelings associated with high self-regard contribute to an increased focus on more positive aspects of the work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442964">Bower, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442964">Brief, Butcher, &amp; Roberson, 1995</xref>). Previous research has provided initial support for both the direct and indirect effects described above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442964">Judge et al. (2000)</xref> found that core self-evaluations were related to the attainment of complex jobs as well as to perceptions of job complexity, after holding objective job complexity constant. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, et al. (1998)</xref> found that perceptions of intrinsic job characteristics partially mediated the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>We extend these findings by examining the incremental predictive validity of core self-evaluations on perceived intrinsic job characteristics, job satisfaction, and affective organizational commitment, after controlling for the effect of self-esteem. Self-esteem is one of the most studied constructs in psychology, and it has been associated with a variety of outcomes of interest in industrial-organizational psychology, including job attitudes, job performance, and subjective reactions to the work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442964">Brockner, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812442964">Locke, McClear, &amp; Knight, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Core Self-Evaluations and Job Satisfaction Facets</title>
<p>Previous research has not examined the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction facets (i.e., work satisfaction, supervisor satisfaction, coworker satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and promotion satisfaction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1548051812442964">Smith, Kendall, &amp; Hulin, 1969</xref>). We expected core self-evaluations to be related to job satisfaction facets as a result of the self-verification and perceptual process described above as well as processes specific to several facets. For example, the higher levels of intrinsic job characteristics (i.e., overall complexity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442964">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442964">Hochwater, Zellars, Perrewe, &amp; Harrison, 1999</xref>) associated with high core self-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2000</xref>) should result in higher pay and promotion satisfaction, as jobs higher in intrinsic job characteristics are generally associated with more challenging work, higher pay, and higher organizational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442964">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>). Similarly, the positive social interactions associated with high core self-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1548051812442964">Scott &amp; Judge, 2009</xref>) should result in higher levels of both supervisor and coworker satisfaction.

<sec id="section4-1548051812442964">
<title>Core Self-Evaluations and Job Performance</title>
<p>Research indicates that core self-evaluations may be related to job performance through at least two mechanisms. First, core self-evaluations may influence performance by increasing motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, et al., 1998</xref>). Logically, we would expect one who believes oneself to be unworthy and generally incompetent to set less challenging goals and to be less persistent in the face of obstacles than one whom believes the converse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442964">Erez and Judge (2001)</xref> found in both lab and field studies that roughly half of the relationships between core self-evaluations and various aspects of job performance were mediated by motivation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442964">Judge, Erez, et al. (1998)</xref> also proposed that core self-evaluations may represent an ability or skill factor for certain positions and for certain aspects of job performance. Individuals with high core self-evaluations may use more effective problem-solving strategies, thereby increasing their ability to overcome unexpected obstacles. Similarly, core self-evaluations has been linked to effective coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442964">Kammeyer-Mueller et al., 2009</xref>) and positive interpersonal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1548051812442964">Scott &amp; Judge, 2009</xref>), both of which have implications for jobs that include high levels of ambiguity and/or social interaction, as well as for “contextual” aspects of job performance, such as organizational citizenship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051812442964">Organ, 1988</xref>). In support of the core self-evaluations as an ability perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442964">Kammeyer-Mueller et al. (2009)</xref> found that high core self-evaluations were associated with lower levels of avoidance-based coping and with higher levels of problem-solving-based coping. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1548051812442964">Scott and Judge (2009)</xref> found that core self-evaluations were associated with more positive social interactions and with higher levels of contextual performance. Again, we extend previous research by testing the incremental effects of core self-evaluations on a specific type of job performance (i.e., service performance) that has not been examined in previous CSE research as well as on task, contextual, and overall job performance, after controlling for the effects of self-esteem.</p>

<title>Method: Study 1</title>
<sec id="section6-1548051812442964">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were employees of a medium-size production and distribution center located in three states in the United States. At Time 1, research assistants distributed surveys containing core self-evaluations, self-esteem, and job attitudes measures to workers at three different locations. Employees were assured that while their responses were not anonymous (so as to match their surveys to their supervisor’s ratings as described below), all individual responses were completely confidential. At Time 2, between 2 and 4 weeks after administration of the employee survey, supervisors completed a confidential assessment of the various measures of job performance for each of their direct reports. The supervisors were assured that their ratings were confidential. Thus, the data for this study were longitudinal and came from multiple sources. Of the 375 employees eligible to respond, 281 completed surveys for a response rate of 75%. Of those 281 employees, corresponding supervisor performance ratings were available for 236 (84%) of those employees. Among the employees who responded, 14% were exempt personnel (i.e., managers or supervisors); 64% worked at the company headquarters; and employees worked in various positions, the most common of which were the shop floor (33%), sales/marketing (34%), and transportation/distribution (22%). The average supervisory span of control of 4.2 indicates the average manager supervised roughly four employees. Listwise deletion resulted in a final sample size of <italic>N</italic> = 220.</p>

Responses were collected using the traditional 0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>?</italic>, and 3 = <italic>yes</italic> response scale. Because three Job Descriptive Index facets (work, supervision, coworkers) have 18 items whereas the other two (pay, promotion) have 9 items each, scales were formed by adding the responses and doubling the scores on the latter two scales. Overall job satisfaction was measured by summing the five scales. This measure has demonstrated reliability and validity in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442964">Buckley, Carraher, &amp; Cote, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1548051812442964">Roznowski, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Job performance</title>
<p>The measure of job performance was developed by interviewing several members of management to obtain information about the critical behaviors underlying the job. The organization also provided job descriptions. From that information we drafted a performance rating instrument. This instrument was then further refined by management. Behaviorally anchored scales for each item were then developed using both the literature on behaviorally anchored rating scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442964">Bernardin &amp; Smith, 1981</xref>) and interviews with three top managers in the organization, who provided incidents of excellent, average, or poor performance for each dimension. Finally, the dimensions and anchors were shared with management, and slight adjustments were made to form 1 (<italic>poor</italic>) to 5 (<italic>excellent</italic>) response scales for each item. Using these scales, supervisors evaluated employee task performance with three items (e.g., “On the technical areas of his/her job”), contextual performance with eight items (e.g., “In supporting and encouraging a coworker with a problem”), and service performance with five items (e.g., “In willingly going out of his/her way to make a customer satisfied”). Because the dimensions were assessed with different numbers of items, the scales were standardized prior to aggregation, and a measure of overall job performance was formed by averaging these three dimensions.</p>

<title>Results: Study 1</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051812442964">Table 1</xref> provides the descriptive statistics intercorrelations of the study variables. Of particular note is the strong, positive correlation between self-esteem and core self-evaluations (<italic>r</italic> = .67). This underscores the idea that self-esteem is a partial indicator of core self-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442964">Bono &amp; Judge, 2003</xref>). To test the incremental validity of core self-evaluations over self-esteem, we performed a hierarchical regression. In Step 1 we entered self-esteem, and in Step 2 we entered core self-evaluations. The results of these regressions are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442964">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1548051812442964">3</xref>.

<title>Discussion: Study 1</title>
<p>All our hypotheses were supported, thus providing strong evidence for the incremental predictive validity of core self-evaluations over self-esteem with respect to a wide range of attitudinal and individual performance criteria.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 2 extended the findings of Study 1 in three ways. First, it examined the incremental validity of core self-evaluations over Protestant work ethic and narcissism, two self-oriented constructs that have been the subject of increased research attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442964">Ghorpade, Lackritz, &amp; Singh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812442964">Judge, LePine, &amp; Rich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442964">Miller, Woehr, &amp; Hudspeth, 2002</xref>) and that have been associated with theoretical indicators of core self-evaluations. Second, in addition to the previously studied criteria of job satisfaction and life satisfaction, Study 2 included seven other job-related attitudes that have not, to our knowledge, been included in empirical tests of core self-evaluations. Finally, and perhaps most important, these relationships were tested in a Chinese sample, a culture that to date has not been included in core self-evaluations research.</p>
<p>Empirical results from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research Program indicate that China differs from the United States on at least two dimensions relevant to self-views: institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442964">House et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, China ranks among the highest on both dimensions of collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442964">House et al., 2004</xref>). Individuals in collectivist societies tend to have interdependent views of the self, whereby, in contrast to more individualistic cultures, judgments of self-worth and capabilities are based less on one’s ability to be assertive and to control the situation and more on one’s ability to control one’s internal states and to adjust to various interpersonal contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051812442964">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). Indeed, some have suggested that personal identity is less dependent on self-referenced evaluations in collectivistic cultures than in individualistic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442964">Bond &amp; Tornatzky, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051812442964">Suh, Diener, Oishi, &amp; Triandis, 1998</xref>). However, other self-oriented constructs have been found to be valid in collectivist cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442964">Ghorpade, Hattrup, &amp; Lackritz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1548051812442964">Zhang &amp; Norvilitis, 2002</xref>), consistent with arguments suggesting that basic human tendencies are independent of cultural influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1548051812442964">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997</xref>). Still, the demonstration of incremental predictive validity in a highly collectivistic culture such as China, where the conceptualization of the self differs significantly from that in more individualistic cultures, would provide strong support for the universal predictive validity of core self-evaluations.</p>
<p>We included Protestant work ethic in Study 2 because, in addition to the collectivistic traits described above, Chinese culture has been strongly influenced by the tenets of Confucianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1548051812442964">Z. H. Li, 1986</xref>). Among other things, Confucianism stresses diligence, internal control of emotions and urges, and delayed gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1548051812442964">Weber, 1951</xref>). Similarly, Protestant work ethic measures the extent to which one values hard work, personal control of internal states, and personal responsibility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442964">Furnham, 1990</xref>), as well as the extent to which work is a central aspect of one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442964">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, Protestant work ethic may be particularly relevant to individual outcomes in China, as the behaviors associated with the construct will be valued and presumably rewarded by various cultural institutions. Moreover, Protestant work ethic has been found to be relevant in cross-cultural research including collectivistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442964">Furnham et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442964">Furnham &amp; Reilly, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Protestant work ethic is considered a self-oriented construct in that it constitutes a part of one’s self-definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442964">Cockley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442964">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). It is particularly relevant to our focus on incremental validity as it is significantly correlated with both indicators of core self-evaluations (i.e., self-esteem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1548051812442964">Tang &amp; Ibrahim, 1998</xref>; and locus of control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442964">Ghorpade et al., 2006</xref>), as well as with outcomes associated with core self-evaluations, including job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442964">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1548051812442964">Wanous, 1974</xref>), organizational commitment, and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442964">Miller et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, we included Narcissism because of its strong self-oriented focus as well as its demonstrated empirical associations with constructs known to be related to core self-evaluations. Narcissism is characterized by a positive and inflated self-image, especially with respect to agentic traits such as power, importance, and physical attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442964">W. K. Campbell, Rudich, &amp; Sedikides, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1548051812442964">Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</xref>). It is moderately correlated with self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442964">Brown &amp; Zeigler-Hill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442964">W. K. Campbell et al., 2002</xref>) and is associated with a strong belief in one’s ability to perform in a variety of situations (i.e., generalized self-efficacy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442964">W. K. Campbell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1548051812442964">Paulhus, Harms, Bruce, &amp; Lysy, 2004</xref>). Narcissism is also correlated with both life satisfaction and positive affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1548051812442964">Rose, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1548051812442964">Sedikides, Rudich, Gregg, Kumashiro, &amp; Rusbult, 2004</xref>), two criteria that are also associated with core self-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2008</xref>). Although mean levels of the construct tend to be lower, meaningful variation of narcissism exists at the individual level within collectivist cultures such as China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442964">Foster, Campbell, &amp; Twenge, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Core Self-evaluations and Job and Life Satisfaction</title>
<p>Previous studies have found relationships between the individual traits used in earlier research as indicators of core self-evaluations (i.e., self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, locus of control, and neuroticism) and job satisfaction in non-Western cultures. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812442964">Cheng (1994)</xref> found that locus of control was related to multiple measures of job attitudes and perceptual processes in a sample of Hong Kong secondary school teachers. More direct evidence comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442964">Piccolo et al. (2005)</xref>, who found that, in a sample of Japanese pharmaceutical sales representatives, an overall composite measure of core self-evaluations was significantly related to both job and life satisfaction after controlling for the effects of trait-based affectivity. Thus, even though studies suggest that individuals in collectivist cultures use different references when making satisfaction judgments compared with individuals in individualistic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1548051812442964">Suh et al., 1998</xref>), initial research indicates that core self-evaluations have positive relationships with overall attitudes across cultures. We extend these findings by examining the effects of core self-evaluations on overall job satisfaction and life satisfaction, as well as job satisfaction facets, after controlling for the effects of Protestant work ethic and narcissism in a Chinese sample.

<title>Core Self-Evaluations and Other Job Attitudes</title>
<p>Although the top-down processes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al. (1997)</xref> imply that core self-evaluations may be related to a broad array of job-related attitudes, research has focused largely on job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442964">Piccolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1548051812442964">Rode, 2004</xref>). However, empirical research indicates that in addition to the perceptual processes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al.

Conversely, those with low core self-evaluations are less proactive in their employment search, reasoning that they have little capacity to find a suitable environment or to secure employment in such an environment.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442964">Kammeyer-Mueller et al. (2009)</xref> found that high core self-evaluations was related to fewer perceived stressors, less avoidance coping, and more problem-solving coping.

In support of this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442964">Best, Stapleton, and Downey (2005)</xref> found that core self-evaluations had both direct effects on job satisfaction and indirect effects that were mediated by burnout, a construct closely related to the ongoing experience of environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1548051812442964">Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1981</xref>).

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were employees of a large retail company headquartered in Beijing, China. Research assistants distributed surveys to employees chosen from a stratified random selection process developed with the help of the organization’s human resource manager. Employees were assured that their responses were confidential and that no individual responses could be identified by either the company or the researchers. A total of 297 surveys were sent out, of which 269 were returned with usable data, representing a valid response rate of 89.7%. Among the employees who responded, 58% were female, and 49% held bachelor or higher education degrees. The average age was 33.96 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.59), and the average organization tenure was 8.92 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.38). Of the respondents, 21% were first line employees, 56% supervisors, and 23% middle- and top-level managers.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>All the measures are rated on the 7-point Likert-type scale with 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The turnover intention and affective commitment measures were originally developed in Chinese culture with Chinese language. The organizational identification and burnout measures used scales that had been previously translated and validated in Chinese samples. The core self-evaluations, Protestant work ethic, narcissism, overall job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction measures were all translated using the translation and back-translation procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442964">Brislin (1970)</xref>. The original English versions of these scales were first translated into Chinese by two doctoral students in organizational behavior and human resource management and two professors of management independently. A mutually agreed on version of the translation was produced after in-depth discussions among the translators. The Chinese version was then back-translated into English by two doctoral students in psychology and English literature who were fluent in both English and Chinese and who had no knowledge of the study’s purpose. The two translators discussed discrepancies until they reached mutual agreement. The back-translated English version of all the measures was then sent to the authors, and both the American and Chinese authors discussed and compared the translated version with the original English version to establish that the final Chinese version and the original English version had conceptual equivalence. All scales demonstrated acceptable internal reliability (i.e., α &gt; .70), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1548051812442964">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion: Study 2</title>
<p>Core self-evaluations predicted significant incremental variance in job satisfaction, life satisfaction, both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, and seven other job attitude variables, after taking into account the effects of Protestant work ethic and narcissism. Of particular note, although Protestant work ethic and narcissism both displayed incremental predictive validity with respect to some of the included criterion variables, in no cases were the incremental effects as strong as those associated with core self-evaluations. Also notable was that although narcissism and core self-evaluations displayed a moderate and positive association with each other (<italic>r</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), narcissism was negatively associated with the three measures of job satisfaction in the regression analyses, whereas core self-evaluations were positively associated with these criteria. Similarly, narcissism was positively associated but core self-evaluations were negatively associated with burnout in the regression analyses. The implications of these results are discussed in further detail below.</p>

<sec id="section36-1548051812442964">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, core self-evaluations, as measured by the CSES, explained incremental variance in each of the 13 criterion variables included in Study 1 and 11 criterion variables included in Study 2. The strength of the effects in Study 1 is particularly impressive, given the relatively strong correlation between core self-evaluations and self-esteem. These results indicate that although core self-evaluations and self-esteem share notable similarities, the broader core self-evaluations concept has significant incremental predictive validity over self-esteem.</p>
<p>The consistency of the results across two studies is notable. In Study 1, core self-evaluations explained 4% and 7% incremental variance in affective commitment and job satisfaction, respectively, compared with 9% and 11% in Study 2. Similar results were found for the closely related measures of intrinsic job characteristics (7%, Study 1) and intrinsic job satisfaction (18%, Study 2). This consistency is notable, given that the two studies included different control variables, different industries and functional areas, and perhaps most important, vastly different cultural settings. Thus, our results support the notion that core self-evaluations are a robust predictor of a wide range of attitudinal and individual behaviors across a wide range of settings and environmental circumstances.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, our results support both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al.’s (1997)</xref> contention that core self-evaluations affect general perceptual processes as well as research suggesting that core self-evaluations are also related to self-regulatory and social interaction processes, which, in turn, affect both attitudes and behavior. Moreover, the consistency of our results in both an individualistic and a highly collectivistic culture indicate that the effects of core self-evaluations may be universal, at least with respect to work attitudes (work performance criteria were not included in Study 2). In contrast to authors who have proposed that satisfaction judgments in collectivist cultures are based on the existence of harmonious relationships rather than on positive self-regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442964">Diener &amp; Diener, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1548051812442964">Oishi, Diener, Lucas, &amp; Suh, 1999</xref>), our results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442964">Piccolo et al. (2005)</xref>, indicating that positive self-concept plays an important role even when the self and others are viewed as highly interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051812442964">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). However, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1548051812442964">Stumpp et al. (2010)</xref>, who examined the effects of core self-evaluations on career success in a German sample, cross-cultural core self-evaluations research has focused almost exclusively on attitudinal criteria. Future cross-cultural research should focus on more objective outcomes such as job performance and citizenship behaviors that have been linked to core self-evaluations in U.S. samples.</p>
<p>The finding that narcissism was positively associated with core self-evaluations but had effects in the opposite direction as core-self evaluations in the regression analyses raises several questions for future research. On one hand, these findings may reflect the possibility that excessive self-regard may manifest itself as narcissism. Alternately, it may be that the behaviors associated with narcissism are met with particularly high levels of disapproval in the collectivist Chinese culture, where modesty is highly valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442964">Fu et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442964">Judge et al. (2008)</xref> found that narcissism was related positively to self-views of leadership but negatively to other’s ratings of leadership, in two samples from the United States. However, little research has examined the relationships between narcissism and job attitudes or overall job performance. Further research is needed to better understand the relationships among core self-evaluations, narcissism, work attitudes and other work outcomes, and culture.</p>
<p>Our studies have several notable limitations. First, although we did have longitudinal data in Study 1, we did not manipulate any of the independent variables, so we cannot make conclusive statements regarding causality. However, the consistency of the results between the two studies, as well as with previous studies of core self-evaluations that have used longitudinal designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1548051812442964">Rode, 2004</xref>) and significant other reports to measure attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, et al., 1998</xref>), support the implied causal relationships between core self-evaluations and the various outcome criteria contained in our analyses. Second, we used single-source, cross-sectional data in Study 2, and consequently our findings may have been influenced by common method bias. However, as previously mentioned, the results from Study 2 were consistent with those obtained in Study 1 and with those reported in previous research that used longitudinal and/or multisource data collection methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442964">Judge, Locke, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1548051812442964">Rode, 2004</xref>), thereby indicating that the results were unlikely to be significantly influenced by common method bias. Finally, although the inclusion of a Chinese data set provided an excellent opportunity to examine predictive validity in a highly collectivist culture, we did not include the same control variables in Study 1 and Study 2. Thus, although the consistency of our results provides some evidence of generalizability, more empirical research will be necessary before equivocal claims regarding the incremental predictive validity of the CSES over Protestant work ethic and narcissism in non-Chinese samples can be made.</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, our results provide significant support regarding the incremental predictive validity of core self-evaluations. The consistency of our results across samples from two cultures with very different views of the role of the individual relative to others, and with differing sets of self-oriented control variables, provides strong evidence that continued study of core self-evaluations will provide unique insight into the critical role of self-views in a wide range of work-related phenomena.</p>

<p>Given that initial research modeled core self-evaluations as a higher order latent construct consisting of the variance common to self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, locus of control, and neuroticism, one might argue that to use self-esteem and core self-evaluations in the same multivariate analysis falls into a part-whole correlation problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442964">J. Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>). However, the part-whole problem refers to explicit inclusion: “A correlation has been computed between some variable J and another variable W, which is the sum of scores on a set of variables including J” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442964">J. Cohen et al., 2003</xref>, p. 59). Since, in this study, self-esteem and core self-evaluations are separate measures, one might argue that the problem does not apply here, at least explicitly. Nevertheless, because self-esteem is a presumed indicator of core self-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442964">Judge et al., 1997</xref>), it is worthwhile to consider the issue further. If core self-evaluations are a latent concept, such that the individual core traits are (imperfect) indicators of the concept and the core is what the individual traits have in common (i.e., measures of the individual traits reflect their common core [core self-evaluations]), then this representation in no way denies the validity of individual-trait variance. Indeed, such comparisons are essential to determine whether criteria are better predicted by single-factor (self-esteem) variance, general-factor (core self-evaluations) variance, or both.</p></fn>
