<p>First thing, I never saw <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> in colour until I watched some of it just now on YouTube. Second thing, I never saw Kenneth Clark’s <italic>Civilisation</italic> in colour until I watched some of it just now on YouTube. And third, although the Berger seemed like an antidote to the Clark, both made one angry, but in different ways; and while the anger at Berger was (evidently, perhaps?) the more constructive, today both of them look better in colour, even on YouTube’s low resolution uploads.</p>
<p>Obviously enough YouTube gives them a different frame, and to pursue the debates and comments that follow the uploads is to enter a world that could not have been imagined back then. Chase the links, the individual pages of the uploaders and commentators alike, from <italic>nietzschean14</italic> to <italic>Doonvallionstallion</italic> and the context for Clark and Berger’s enunciations, their framing, and even their profound iconology becomes, as one might then have said, ‘something else, man’. A favourite tube of some Berger fan, calling himself <italic>adownwardmachine</italic>, is entitled ‘Fucking Wake up to yourselves’. It is a home video in which we see an angry and butch Australian bloke raving as he compares the inauthenticity of a pair of bloated, silicone breasts to that of Christianity; uncannily germane to both our televisual heroes of 1969–72.</p>
<p>So some context back then, in its own way authentic: I watched <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> on a smallish black and white TV that I had brought down to London already 10 years old – <italic>Civilisation</italic> had flickered across its screen as well as <italic>The Forsyte Saga, Zed Cars, Top of the Pops, Ready Steady Go</italic>, early Ken Russell, <italic>Doctor Who</italic> and so forth. It stood in the corner of the living room of a walk up, rent controlled flat on the top floor of a decaying, late Georgian terrace just north of Montagu Square that my sister and I had taken in 1970. Its four small but charming rooms, with low and leaky ceilings, were furnished in an eclectic, post-hippy style, some walls in black, some in figured velvet acquired from a hippy tailor off Shaftesbury Avenue called <italic>The Major Arcana</italic>, worn but warming Quashquais on floors and divans, and loads of plants flourishing in the Co2 of a paraffin heater; in sociological terms, terms that John Berger and Pierre Bourdieu alike would have appreciated, the décor was probably an extension of middle-class shabbiness or comfort, attenuated by a cutting edginess, a hint of first-generation anxiety, and representing a modest level of a contemporary, avant-garde cultural capital.</p>
<p>The moment was not long after the demise of the Arts Lab in Drury Lane, with its charged, aesthetic sensuality, and Berger’s famous shirt was only a shimmy away from one or another of my possible sartorial realities. I had become acquainted with a startling number of young men (even younger than I, that is to say) who claimed to have had sex with Peter Schlesinger (an in-law, one might say), and had started trying to teach a more or less marxo-hegelian kind of art history to the sardonic but committed art students who had formed the Portsmouth Sinfonia.</p>
<p>I had read <italic>The Talks at the Yenan Forum</italic> by Chairman Mao and Lu Hxun, as well as Frederick Antal, Francis Klingender, Aby Warburg, Pierre Francastel, Simone de Beauvoir, some articles in <italic>Tel Quel</italic> and Doris Lessing too. And, as important as all of these, what was it to have seen Berger’s little group discussion of the female nude, his anti-Clark, so many years after the opening sequences of Jean-Luc Godard’s <italic>Le mépris</italic> (1963)? With their extended exposition of the irony of Bardot’s body, had they not already made their way into one’s own sense of irony, of distanciation, of the co-terminus implosion and explosion of the intolerable bourgeois thing? But I had read no Walter Benjamin, or maybe just the <italic>Little History of Photography</italic>, and so I missed the very obvious influence on Berger of his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">1969[1935]</xref> essay on mechanical reproduction; which, in the event, was never to become a part of my canon!</p>
<p>So all of that is just a bit of the time, the place, the person of this watching, one of the ways of seeing <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, which seems to be important for what Berger had to say. It was fascinating, a relief from the TV trash, though remember that this was an immense time for good TV and art documentaries; but, above all, as the book followed on the broadcasts, it made instant syllabus material for the under-nourished reading lists of the marxo-hegelian thing - which we were struggling to shape up and put into place in the Polys; so there it went while I moved on from <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, and more or less forgot about it. But I do see that, in part, this was because its slightly prissy confidentiality fitted all too well into our living room. It could be relegated to the other dust.</p>
<p>Years later I was visiting H, a well-known leftist dramaturge, in the large and shabby house that she occupied in St Johns Wood. It was late in the day, just before all such houses, with their bursting sofas and crumbling chintzes, were to be expropriated and done over by the new rich to resemble the first-class lounge at Zurich airport (I guess), or some other role model. There were drawings on the wall, drawings I admired and found attractive. John, H said, had given them to her, when they first came to know one another: I was left to supply the Berger. But they looked good there, very good, just as the broadcast had once looked right in our flat, and it came to me, perhaps for the first time, that shabby middle class is a rather Adornian critical category, a space where faded values and new leftism can make something freshly critical – a space of comfort and of detachment, where edges can rub sharp.</p>
<p>That’s how Berger could have come to write <italic>Corker’s Freedom</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">1993[1964]</xref>) or <italic>Art and Revolution: Ernst Neizvestny and the Role of the Artist in the U.S.S.R</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">1997[1969]</xref>) long before <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. Alas that he took up the peasantry. Alas that one of the things he shared with Clark was this: a grimace, the straight male grimace; not a gaze but a way of offering a permission, with a little twitch that was so much more controlling, more manipulative than the liberating, queer grimace of a Frankie Howard – or Anthony Blunt’s masquerade; no space for the queer in Berger.</p>
<p>So, if Clark offered an over-identification with Western culture, then Berger maybe suggested an over-dis-identification. When Berger allows, permits, one of the women in his little round-table to say of the canon of European nudes that she cannot ‘identify with them because they are so immensely exaggerated’, I want now to say yes, this was politically necessary, and yes, Zdhanov rides again. For what would exaggeration be were it not an excess, a sign of overdetermination, a mark of differentiation? It was against the sense of excitement ‘we’ (fags) got before those endless Saint Sebastians and their mind-blowing armpits. But no, for Berger the peasants will want peasants’ art (I too liked peasant art a lot), especially the right peasants’ art, and so on for women, perhaps eventually for gays, and others. In the breathiness of Berger’s programme rises the stifling of Bourdieu’s <italic>Distinction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912444187">2010[1979]</xref>), the dead weight of the notion of cultural capital and its all too predictable exclusions.</p>
<p>I do not want to moralize about this, I just want to say that it is a risk of any radical setting out, and that we may as well note it. From liberation to an Andrea Dworkin or a Catherine McKinnon was one grim route, but there were already others that might nuance, or simplify or set aside what were Berger’s problematics. For one, hidden behind Berger, there was the already more complex thinking of <italic>Tel Quel</italic>, and Julia Kristeva’s Madonnas and her blissful blues, a more captivating France than that of the ‘peasant’ earth.</p>
<p>A celebration or reviewing of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> need not be an instance of Anglophone complacency – so Berger himself had to go elsewhere to find his peasants, or at least their simulacrum, for which I have never forgiven him.</p>
<p>One of the things I remember from <italic>Civilisation</italic>, as being especially stupid, and a check up on YouTube shows that I have had it verbatim all this time, was the point when Clark is smugly sliding along a canal in Amsterdam; he admits the role of the economy in art, in major aesthetic shifts, but says that he will not say much about economics ‘in this programme … chiefly because I don’t understand them.’ Now I do like the use of economics as a plural, it is truly quaint; yet, on reflection, it is tempting to risk a joke in poor taste.</p>
<p>In what follows, in Clark’s discussion of the tulip boom and bust in 17th-century Holland, he shows himself to be absurdly more up to date than Berger in the cultural disputes of the moment. It is rather he who is concerned with the Althusserian ‘relative autonomy of the superstructure’, while his rival is still stuck with ‘determination in the last instance’.</p>
<p>What a muddle.</p>
<p>It was not so much that the space between Clark and Berger was a new distribution of the sensible as that it was a new carve-up.</p>
