<p>One Sunday morning over coffee, while flipping through the <italic>New York Times</italic> and daydreaming about what I’d say on this topic today, I got absorbed in an essay appearing in the feature “Modern Love.” There <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003065113486928">Rachel Jones (2012)</xref>, in “A Child of Two Worlds,” recounts her pregnancy and giving birth in Djibouti, near Somalia in the Horn of Africa. After a nightmarish description—it was a medically “normal” birth, but it included screaming while her torn vagina was stitched up without anesthesia, and being scolded by the midwife—“Don’t be such a weakling!”—Jones ends the piece: “She [the midwife] stood in the doorway, silhouetted by the hall light, and we smiled at each other. We had done what women throughout the centuries have done and would continue to do, what no divisions or rhetoric or wars could ever stop. We had brought life and beauty and love into the world.” The baby Lucy, delivered in Djibouti by a Somalian Muslim midwife to an American woman and her English-born husband, was given a middle name that means “gift from Allah.” The baby would have an American passport, and her birthday was September 11, a date that in her own country has gone down in infamy</p>
<p>As psychoanalysts, we are rarely as close as that midwife to hands-on life-and-death situations. To do our work well, we rely greatly on our mentalization capacities, our memories, our capacity to identify empathically with our patients, and resonate with all the emotional nuances of past treatments and our own lived lives, while being careful to keep listening to and learning about the “otherness” of the patient’s world. Our job is often to help patients distinguish between taking action, and thinking thoughts about action. We dwell deeply in a world of imagination, and in the tohu wa-bohu primal world of the unconscious that is present in our offices, and in our patients’ narrations and contemplations. We have our own kinds of chaos, panic, agony, and thrills to cope with. But the inner psychic lives that we lead and allow to mingle with the inner lives of our patients are not a function of emotional interaction alone. They are also powerfully derived and imaginatively elaborated from hands-on action, and from the bodily experience of living.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, for complex reasons, the connections between thinking, imagining, and theorizing about our patients’ real-life happenings and their encoded experiences within their material bodies can become lost to us. We psychoanalysts can overthink, becoming intellectually obsessional, or by doing private mental gymnastics on behalf of others sometimes neglect to engage the corporeal narratives of lived lives. We embrace a familiar distance in thinking at the expense of directly translating bodily experience into our theoretical frameworks and being able to speak to it. Freud’s view of women was unfortunately seriously biased, but still, viewed even in English translation, he was far more successful than most theoreticians and modern clinicians in engaging a patient and his own theory in a body-based, people-based psychological narrative.</p>
<p>The result of contemporary distance from the body and biology in psychoanalysis today is, I believe, a complex loss of valuable experience-near associative material from patients in our fieldwork. The psychological impact of events surrounding childbirth is a particular example of this scotoma in our vision, which I hope to shed some light on today.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003065113486928">
<title>A Contemporary Example</title>
<p>Recently I attended a lovely presentation at our local institute by psychoanalytic child researchers, featuring the brain-imaging techniques that occupy the interface between neuroscience and psychoanalysis. The question was: How does a new mother’s depression or affective symptoms after pregnancy and delivery impact her perception of infant faces at a neural level? The hypothesis was that depression would dampen sensitivity to infant cues—specifically facial expressions—thereby reducing that marker of brain response. The finding, however, was surprisingly the opposite. The greater the depressive<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065113486928">1</xref></sup> symptoms, the greater the maternal brain response was to the infant’s face. Could it be, then, that inward-turning processes that <italic>look</italic> like depression are actually something else—a heightened maternal preoccupation, perhaps, that actually <italic>increases</italic> sensitivity to babies’ facial cues? Speculation and excitement abounded. I asked at that juncture: Were there data on how these mothers had responded to the actual deliveries of their babies? The researchers answered that they had <italic>not thought</italic> about the delivery of the babies and its impact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065113486928">2</xref></sup> They immediately recognized this as a key question, however, because it points to the mother’s <italic>experience</italic> of childbirth as a possible key to her perception of and attention to the infant in those first weeks and months postpartum. These researchers were not careless. They are brilliant and careful researchers, doing cutting-edge neuropsychiatric scientific investigations with mothers and newborn infants. My point is that even gifted contemporary scientist-analysts working so close to these bodily experiences did not allow themselves to engage mentally in a mother’s act of childbirth. And they are far from alone. They are like most therapists, analytic clinicians, and other investigators working outside the specific field of obstetrics. Difficulty in contemplating childbirth takes a prominent place over the entire history of our field. This oversight to me, then, is both exciting and dramatic, and requires more thought.</p>

<title>Why Do We Need to Pay More Attention?</title>
<p>Material about childbirth experiences gleaned in clinical psychoanalysis could better our understanding and help us improve contemporary theory about gender and sex. In the old psychoanalytic view, childbirth was unquestioned proof of a woman’s psychological maturity and a clear declaration of resolved gender issues in becoming “a woman.” In many quarters it is still perceived that way. Birth is allowed symbolic dream referents, as from the inception of attention to the unconscious—the patient swimming, say, or the sea, or rising from or falling into water—but the female body itself in pregnant or nonpregnant states seems to have been allotted no referents or imaginative space at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113486928">Balsam 1996</xref>). <italic>All</italic> bodies, for example, regardless of attributions of roundness, or fruitfulness, cherry trees, rocking boats accompanied by seasickness, seem indiscriminately, in those instances in which people have chosen to write about their unconscious significance, to have been pretty much read as phallic symbols. “The body as phallus” was a commonly accepted universal symbolic formula (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065113486928">Lewin 1933</xref>), regardless of its mophological and visual difference in at least half of all cases!</p>
<p>If this blind but phallocratic reading of the unconscious is still the case (as it of course inflects all of Lacan’s theorizing), then I’d like to join others and suggest a few added refinements! We need not give over to such rationalized foreclosures in our thinking. We have profited from postmodernism’s influence by now, and we’ve reaped the rewards of the challenges, begun in the early 1970s, to gender components and culturally fixed binary categories of sex and gender, challenges initiated by writers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003065113486928">Stoller (1968)</xref>, and carried though today in contemporary sophisticated ways by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065113486928">Chodorow (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065113486928">Dimen and Goldner (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003065113486928">Harris (2005)</xref> and other writers of the relational school, and many others, especially in women’s and gay and lesbian studies in academia. Consequently, we can now open ourselves to the magnitude of the experience of childbirth, and the impact of this bodily based, potentially violent, tsunami-like experience—with its amazing finale—in the lived life of a woman. Only a female body can give birth—outside of science fiction. Gender and sexuality may still be unsettled questions in the inner world of any particular individual, but childbirth itself is a pivotal confrontation with a female’s owning of her body’s sexed maturity. This owning, of course, is not dynamically static and demands further mental work in order to integrate the bodily experience into her particular gender portrait. As analysts in this arena, we are joining in Freud’s early commentary on the Riddle of the Sphinx, and his characterization of the age-old original question that every child asks: “Where do babies come from?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065113486928">1908</xref>, p. 212). By <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065113486928">1925</xref>, however, Freud had unfortunately shifted the broad focus of that question onto the narrower one of children’s reaction to genital difference. But his original question remains for me the most fundamental.</p>
<p>Many secrets of life, though, are hidden in plain sight, in the apparently mundane. Eighty-two percent of females in the U.S. have given birth by the time they are forty-four. In 1976 the figure was 90 percent. This is as common an experience of female life as any layperson in the street appreciates that it is. Moreover, even for those females who by menopause have not had the experience of childbirth, the expectation, excitement, and dread—the whole world of fantasy about it—has been just as lively, just as anticipated, or just as dreaded or denied, during girlhood and adolescence and beyond, as is was for women who have actually borne a child. Our field has by far the greatest possibility of any of the mental health disciplines to be aware of, and alert to, how a physical and emotional experience so common in our patient population can affect women of any age.</p>
<p>Childbirth experience, being a quintessential experience of females, has succumbed to repression in our midst in the same way that other aspects of female development have been struggled over in waves of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065113486928">Fliegel 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065113486928">Hoffman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065113486928">Balsam 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003065113486928">Young-Bruehl and Schwartz 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065113486928">Obaid 2012</xref>). This is why I have titled my talk “(Re)membering”—alluding to Freud’s “Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through.” Repressing childbirth has to do with “repeating” a pseudo-ignorance of the female body from early childhood on, and especially its reproductive capability. Repression, we know well, is often a function of emotional trauma. Only when elements of the trauma can be entertained in consciousness can we enter a phase of “working through.” In my title I use postmodern brackets for the laconic (re) in remembering, because the group of traumata I hope to draw attention to are deeply involved in the mental representational act of allowing us to “member” the female body in a world of fantasied corporeal female <italic>lacks</italic> that are symbols of a group unconscious collusion to “<italic>dis</italic>-member.” To make restitution requires patient “re-membering” and restoring the female parts of the body. Given how hard this seems to be in real life, it must represent psychically unconscious danger, after the fashion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065113486928">Richard Gottleib’s 1994</xref> account of his patients’ unconscious vampire fantasies, blood feasts, and the “undead” from Transylvania being brought back to life. Discussing his paper at the time, I brought up the possibility that an aspect of this pained fantasy of loss and restoration of bodily integrity may well concern childbirth—perhaps even more vivid in those days when it was thought that 20 percent of all women died giving birth, and sibling deaths at childbirth would have been very common. My aim of restoring conscious intent to interest in childbirth is to reanimate all aspects of the female body in membership in the arena of our current psychoanalytic gender studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003065113486928">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Why Should We listen to Women’s Experiences of Childbirth?</title>
<p>Here are a batch of vignettes that come to mind. These are random patients I have treated over the years, not selected for anything in particular about childbirth per se. None of these patients, as far as they were concerned, felt any pressing need to focus on the topic. All of these people presented for treatment with repeated relationship problems, or with varying complaints of anxiety or depression and/or problems in work or in their sense of personal achievement. Some were on medication, some not. Many had had previous psychotherapy or analysis. But all were interested in further in-depth psychological work for chronic dissatisfactions in their ability to love, to play, or to work.</p>

<title>Vignette 1</title>
<p>A woman in her forties was about to divorce a husband she had married in college. Her body, as a powerful athletic servant of her will, was to her a work of art, and glorious. She had been a world-class athlete when in college. Her first birth experience befitted her effortless vision of her physical and biological ease and strength. She had a beautiful baby, and was thrilled with her body’s strength and performance, in awe of its elasticity and ability to return to its original state. Her second childbirth took place in her well-appointed home, with a midwife she loved and trusted in attendance: a socially progressive and calm scene of home birthing. But things suddenly went into terrifying overdrive when the baby’s cord presented at her dilated introitus and the baby’s heart rate was lost. The obstetrician was rushed from nearby to assist the midwife, but the baby died. My patient was devastated. She was violently shocked by the breathtaking cruelty and indifference of nature—a nature she had so joyfully inhabited within her gifted body, and with such investment of trust and loving care. How could such a random act of unconformity rob her of the chance to take this child into her arms and give to her, from her breast, the nourishing warm colostrum waiting in anticipation of the tiny mouth, now blue and motionless? Her confidence in her body—indeed, something in her spirit—was fractured. Her marriage went downhill in a vortex of blame and self-blame, and ruined the couple’s sexual intimacy. She turned to her career for solace. Of course we can talk about the loss of the child, or her inconsolable grief, or her difficult interaction with her husband, or a host of other angles—but many of the ways this narrative could be told would overlook the impact of the insult to her assaulted female body’s anticipation of bringing a life into her world. Most of them do. This patient’s sexuality was and is deeply tied to her capacity to bear children. The blending of these two elements of female life is too often conceptually split, likely due to an ongoing, unconscious phallocratic bias in theory building.</p>

<p>An Afro-Caribbean woman, an artist in her mid-fifties, deplored her tall, delicate, thin frame, nearly breastless and hipless, but loved her athletic ability to spring and jump high, and to embody a tall shadow in childhood games as she play-acted the cow jumping over the moon. She remembered fondly the delight of bearing twins, expanding widely in pregnancy, the thrill of feeling noticed as a large presence, powerful, big, enlarged, and physically competent; the triumph of pumping milk out of large, fruitful breasts; the force of the squirt of the milk flow as it escaped her nipples; and the sheer high of being admired as a bosomy woman and fecund baby-producer, when there were two of them inside one of her, as it were. Her birth experiences were surgical and fast. The size of her body and her preoccupation with the meanings of the ebb and flow of her shape—including the subsequent flattening and shrinkage and fear of loss of power after delivery—these were vital building blocks of her ongoing embodied self-awareness. Yes, we could have dwelt accurately but solely on how easily she felt overlooked by her original internal objects, or socially, or by me in the transference, or on her envy of and rage at artists with bigger reputations. But her body’s wiry delicacy in her mind’s eye, with its narrowness approaching disappearance, that had morphed into an astonishing width and convexity in her fecundity, giving her a new weight of significance in the world, became embedded in her mind, through reflective psychological work, as a vital part of a more flexible spatial and sensory relationship to her body, herself, and the universe.</p>

<p>A woman in her early seventies, a senior partner in a law firm, angry at her arthritis, her back problems, and the aging of a body she had once inhabited more fluidly, engaged in playful fantasies of still being a preadolescent tomboy. The peak of body prowess for her as a child was playing stickball with the boys in the side street her family’s apartment was on. Though her parents and relatives fought constantly, anxiety and bad feelings were alien territory in her memory of her childhood, as she could rid herself of them with her frantic and restless push into physical motion. She was always running around, and she loved to win and be “on top of it” at whatever she did. They said she had “ants in her pants.” She did very well in a law career that required her to be strong and active defending clients, and she married a rich real estate broker while in her early forties. She had not planned on having children. Imagine her shock and disbelief, then, at finding herself confined to bed for weeks on end with a threatened hemorrhage from a placenta praevia. Everything went wrong in that birth—wrong and out of control. She had a C-section that entailed significant pain, which continued postoperatively. The pressure applied to the uterus afterward to prevent bleeding, a procedure usually performed in the OR while the patient’s spinal block is still working, caused her unbearable agony. She had, in addition, a significant loss of blood. The experience took her emotionally from the carefree tomboy she still thought herself in her mind’s eye, to a confrontation with the femaleness of her body, through the hellish confinement of her pregnancy, and then into a struggle with the malignant power of nature, as well as a most unexpected soaring sense of beneficence and physical survival that childbirth unleashed. It was a breathtakingly anxious, helpless, humiliating experience in which she felt betrayed by her youthful, flexible notions of her body. The experience still traumatized her, over thirty years later, and she tried to minimize and distance herself from the experience with black humor. But the memories were filled with a deep dread that needed constant psychic suppression, in a way that had became compounded and woven into the fabric of her character defenses.</p>

<title>Vignettes 4 and 5</title>
<p>Consider also a woman in a recent gay marriage, matronly in her mid-sixties, divorce well past, and in a new romantic relationship, children grown. And also, in that same time-frame in my office, a thin, gawky, brilliant single heterosexual woman of twenty. Both lay on my couch similarly, with fists clenched tightly across their breasts, once in a blue moon revealing verbally what they each demonstrated nonverbally day after day—that they hated those breasts, considered them too large and excessive, and felt unbearable shame that that they showed through their clothes. Unconsciously, the older woman disliked her body intensely, with early elements of her physical experiences as a young girl—always uncomfortable in her skin, except for secret pleasurable moments of mutual body exploration with girlfriends under covers in the dark during sleepovers—meshing with her acute embarrassment in the light at what she saw as the menopausal decline of her skin quality and body shape. Her fantasies of what I thought of her body were often painfully denigrating, but she longed for my admiration and occasionally had exciting delighted fantasies of my sensual pleasure in her large breasts. She declared my body more beautiful than hers. So her body image expressions were full of mixed messages, negativity, and ambivalence. Yet her childbirth experience had been next to miraculous for her. She said she had had no fantasy growing up that she would ever have a baby—the idea just did not appear in her thoughts. It thus seemed awe-inspiring and incredible that an exquisitely formed, perfect little baby body could emerge fresh and unscathed out of hers—moreover, a little body that so filled her heart with tenderness and admiration. She took on breastfeeding vigorously and in pride and triumph, with many aggressive thoughts about showing up her disgusted and scandalized mother. For those moments, she felt she had successfully defied this mother’s prediction that she would be a failure. The love of her own femaleness during these seismic events around giving birth and breastfeeding had to some extent shifted the interior geography of her mind, so that even though these pleasures were eluding her in menopause, their images could be accessed for further integration.</p>
<p>The twenty-year-old came from a piously religious home. When she was about eleven, her father had beaten her with a strap for having a secret date with a high school boy. Obsessed with the fear of getting pregnant, she had thought until recently that a girl could get pregnant from a public toilet seat. The thought of masturbation made her sick to her stomach. She revealed piecemenal how a brother had been born when she was twelve (about a year after her beating). She had loathed the change in her mother’s body shape to what she thought of as fat and disgusting, and was enraged at the hypocrisy of this father, who had beaten her for seeking a boy’s company, now, in her book, having forced her mother to get pregnant. (One can hear the troubled sadomasochistic connection here between physical beating, the sex act, and pregnancy.) To boot, she felt confused about what was happening to her own newly developing body. Did her mother have a cancerous tumor, she remembered, half hoping? She wanted to slam her mother’s belly and breasts. “It all seemed violent and against her will,” the daughter said. In this tableau in my office, there was a connection between her destructive fantasy and the now punishing clenched fists smashed down upon her own breasts to hurt her procreative body. Unconsciously she worried about my male physical, sexual attack on her from behind.</p>

<p>A young married woman talked in psychotherapy about what once had been her ease with her physicality, and about her prowess in basketball. But a late miscarriage due to an undiagnosed abnormal fetus, a few years before I first saw her, had wreaked “a mess on her body,” she said. The horror of this had left her feeling robbed of all her poise and all her goodwill toward her body. No longer could she trust in the bodily nature of her female confidence. She had withdrawn then from her sexuality. All good feeling about her body seemed to evaporate into numbness. She was traumatized by this confrontation with the terrible fact that not only did she produce an abnormal child, but she might easily have lost her own life while in the act of giving birth in this difficult, hemorrhagic, and lethal delivery.</p>
<p>And indeed, she reminds us that every childbirth is a confrontation with death, as well as with life. Modern medicine can now lull us, comfort us, and soothe our terror of personal physical annihilation in most cases of birthing. But not in all. When Rachel Jones—the essayist with whose story I began—became pregnant, the Somali friend who had encouraged her to conceive kissed her cheeks and taught her an old proverb: “the mouth of your grave is open.” “You should . . . ask [people] to pray for you,” the friend advised her; “You or the baby could die at any time.” The infant mortality rate in Somalia is 15 percent, and the maternal mortality rate, though lower, is also cause for concern. Our rates are no longer in that category, but the emotional stakes for every new mother bearing life into the world are every bit as high.</p>
<p>In a review article of six recent books in the <italic>Times Literary Supplement</italic>, titled “On Maternity: Medeas and Clytemnestras, Prostitutes and Their Daughters, Yummy Mummies and Other Fantasies,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003065113486928">Emily Wilson (2012)</xref> writes that an essay in one book, on woman as mother and sex object in antiquity, finds “analogies between contemporary British and American cultural imaginations on these matters and the mothers of Augustan Rome.” Another “speaks of the breast as both nurturing and—incestuously, revoltingly, dangerously—desirable” (p. 3). Childbirth comes into intense focus in ancient and modern preoccupation—for the ancients as a real event; for us, I believe, as still embedded deeply in our group gendered unconscious, however soft-pedaled by modern medicine. Fathers too are deeply affected. From another essay in the book, Wilson quotes part of a translated funerary inscription from the second century <sc>b.c</sc>., written by a distraught father, expressivley enmeshed in his grief over his dead wife and baby: “The unstoppable Fury of the newborn infant took me, bitter, from my happy life with a fatal hemorrhage. I did not bring the child into the light by my labor pains, but it lies hiding in its mother’s womb among the dead” (p. 4). Modern, well-defended women, too, can fear deeply for their very lives in the fruit of the sex act, and men can fear deeply the damage they may inflict in this same act of sex. Childbirth can become a major source of grief and loss for both partners.</p>
<p>My traumatized patient became pregnant again three years after her ordeal. She was nervous about it, but this time the end-story was completely different and she gave birth to her first living child. She had had a positive experience with a cesarian delivery, after which she was awake enough to see her husband tenderly put the baby boy’s mouth to her nipple, before she sank into a contented postdelivery sleep. She was slowly, bit by bit, recovering her bodily confidence at the time I saw her in treatment, beginning once more to do her yoga and recover her sexual enjoyment. The birth announcement she sent out to friends included a quotation from Shakespeare’s <italic>King John</italic>: “my fair son! / My life, my joy, my food, my all the world” (3.4.103–104). His living birth had restored the assets of her own body to her soul.</p>

<p>A young male supervisee, Dr. M., who happens to be single, talks rather woodenly about helping his patient Brian, an expectant father, speak up with questions he has for his wife’s obstetrician. He sees himself as working on Brian’s aggression. Brian’s wife had now just given birth successfully with her young husband by her side. I hear in the story Brian’s pride in his own sense of survival, in his proud description of overcoming feeling faint at watching his wife give birth. As Dr. M. talks to me, I am thinking also of this patient Brian, a sensitive poetry teacher, watching his wife’s Herculean effort—and of Carol Burnett’s line that giving birth is like pulling your head through your top lip! And I am imagining Brian’s sickening, “outsider’s” view of this impossible physical feat, and the infectiousness, perhaps conveyed to the inhibited Dr. M., of his terror for the integrity of his own genitals. Brian then tells Dr. M. how weak, shaky, and very <italic>old</italic> his own father looked to him in the waiting room, when Brian announced the glad tidings of the safe birth! My supervisee hears in this only Brian’s sweetness in empathic response to the exhaustion of his poor old father’s long wait. I hear oedipal rivalry, Brian’s defeat of the father, the mighty defiance of his own castration fantasies, the male surge of pride: Dr. M., at least temporarily, seems oblivious to these dynamics. So I am left deflated in responding to Dr. M., with an experience of feeling very alone in the room in my vicarious emotional high of imagining this male patient’s thrill in becoming a new father! I despair very briefly in my supervisory task of getting across to Dr. M. what he is seemingly missing in this hour, in not letting himself imagine vicariously this new father’s triumphs, and indeed what he is missing out on by almost ignoring the forgrounded family scene of childbirth.</p>

<p>I could go on and on with the birthing narratives. I think that my male supervisee’s reporting in this last vignette is not unlike the way many of us listen when a pregnancy or childbirth story is told long after the event, and is not the absolutely immediate concern of that moment. My supervisee’s patient was not himself giving birth, as it were, so the analyst’s attention defensively goes to business as usual, in this instance to the patient’s personal conflicts about his fear of assertion. If the subject is a female whose children are grown, then a reference to childbirth can be overlooked in a mutual collusion of compartmentalizing—hearing the content as ignorable, expectable past history, focusing on the present relationship with the children, and thus missing the significance of this cosmic bodily event in the sexed and gendered body history of this person. Perhaps, most commonly, the subject matter is treated as a distraction from the immediacy of the here-and-now transference. Yet this attitude can be a defensive position for an analyst, one that inadvertently compounds the body erasure.</p>
<p>Recently, when I was presenting case material that detailed an analysand’s prideful experience of her swelling breasts while pregnant, a thoughtful and seasoned male analyst in the audience asked a question: “But is it possible that you were missing the transferential component here about a reference to her being ‘born again’ in your office, with you as mother?” This is reasonable, and it is certainly not wrong, depending on one’s judgment about the level of integration in that sequence. But technically, here the good is the enemy of the even better. One way of judging this moment would be to ask oneself if the material is new to the analyst, as opposed to a familiar and already known experience; if it is fresh and an addition to the narrative, then it should be listened to as such. I would consider it a deflection for the analyst to bring up the transference implications so quickly. Clinically, the “better” here is the expansion of the analytic narrative; theoretically, more ambitiously, it would be a body of accumulated knowledge about the impact of these common average expectable birth experiences, something we currently lack. We <italic>do</italic> have a body of accepted literature on the impact on character formation, both immediate and longitudinal, of separation phenomena, sibling rivalry, maternal depression, paternal decline, seduction, physical violence, physical illness in analyst or patient, family moves from one place to another, marriages, divorces, sibling illness or pathology, and the death of a parent or other loved one. But where are the short- and long-term data about childbirth? Rushing past the session’s content to personal transference, I believe, is often defensive, especially when glimpsing psychic territory that is so little known theoretically. Collusion between therapist and patient protects psychic equilibrium, sometimes much to the relief of both; new and unfamiliar material can be painful or puzzling to an analyst, or at odds with other features of the patient. Distinctions between what is “female” relating to the material body and the far more complex inner meanings of what personally is regarded as “feminine” abound in this area; they are important and take patience. Amalgamating “female” and “feminine,” treating them as interchangeable, is defensive on our part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065113486928">Elise 1997</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065113486928">Janice Lieberman (2000)</xref> has noted, therapists sometimes rush too soon to metaphor. For one of her chapters, she chooses as an epigraph a quote from Oscar Wilde: “Sometimes it is superficial to look beneath the surface!” (p. 109).</p>

<title>The Historical Dimension of Trauma to Theory About Females</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065113486928">Jones (1955)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003065113486928">Roazen (1975)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003065113486928">Rudnytsky (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065113486928">Gay (1988)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065113486928">Makari (2008)</xref>, and others have testified to the fact that for Freud the oedipal complex—its inherent sexuality with taboos and attendant tensions toward civilizing forces—was the centerpiece of mental life, and that this idea held together the aspirations of the entire psychoanalytic movement. Nonadherence to this focal tenet was the best reason for him to shed a colleague who was disseminating ideas other than this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003065113486928">4</xref></sup> Avid adherence to this tenet, of course, is one way of privilegeing the patriarchy, the male, and heterosexuality (a point widely discussed in the academic feminist community). As long as females and males alike were interepreted through a male heterosexual lens, the fracture lines of metatheory didn’t show. Later, especially after 1970, those fracture lines became all too clear. The feminist, gay, lesbian, and queer challenge meshed with a postmodern Foucauldian antiscientific challenge to instinct theory. Biology, ever since abhorred, was left to lab researchers in the push to theories that are drive/conflict-averse. These shifts have helped the relational and intersubjective aspects of our theories to develop richly. However, the new plurality has resulted in different psychoanalytic schools paying sharply focused attention only to those segments of theory that are of special interest to them. Even the contemporary popular concept of “embodiment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065113486928">Balsam and Harris 2012</xref>) can be so elastic and vague as to obscure living anatomical detail. Attempts in psychoanalysis to integrate metatheory have been entirely abandoned as fruitless, as we all know. In this current fragmentation of theory, though overall it has had a broadening and very positive effect on our thinking, what little attention used to be paid to bodily experience following Freud’s engaging beginnings has, I believe, been quite overshadowed. But splits, fragmentation, and trauma are nothing new in our group’s history—or “nonhistory” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003065113486928">Young-Bruehl and Schwartz (2012)</xref> would have it, due, in their opinion, to ill-worked-over fragmentations evoked by the plethora of traumata to the theory resulting, for example, from the two world wars and the flight of analysts to countries foreign to them: “Each time there was a split, a valuable part-theory disappeared from consideration, impoverishing psychoanalysis and distorting its development” (p. 140). I want to take up an unusual angle on a few of Freud’s famous radical disagreements. The fights were naturally complex in nature, but I have noticed a scarlet thread running through each painful disagreement, a thread that involves in-depth psychological issues about women. Why we have ended up ignoring the power and intensity of childbirth is thus a sidebar to a history embedded in the history of psychoanalysis itself. In 1910 Alfred Adler, the first of Freud’s followers to anger him, theorized a “masculine protest” as a reaction to infantile powerlessness. This protest was not confined solely to females and their lack, but applied also to males. Thus to Adler, an avid socialist politically, males and females seemed coequal figures struggling within the confines of a patriarchal domination. Adler’s colleague, Margarete Hilferding, a pioneering female doctor and fellow socialist, was the first woman to be admitted to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. In 1911 she gave an astoundingly prescient presentation to the society, “On the Basis of Mother Love” (see details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113486928">Balsam 2003</xref>), in which, to the horror of those present, she decried a natural “maternal instinct.” She shockingly (for the time) spoke of an active maternal sexual involvement with the child, which she saw as an interactive stimulus to the child’s responsive oedipus complex. She foresaw the development of a two-person psychology, and the psychic reciprocity between mother and child as developed later by Winnicott, Loewald, Laplanche, and others. She described disturbances in bonding that she attributed to difficulties she had observed in women giving birth and in breast-feeding, and she described the baby as an object of hatred for the mother after disappointments in giving birth. Hilferding’s presentation fell flat that night, and soon after she followed the expelled Adler out of the society. Her observations about females and their bodies were thus lost to the nascent psychoanalytic theory then in formation. Her powerful voice in that group might have made all the difference.</p>
<p>Here is another example: Carl Jung. His 1912 work, “Transformations and Symbols,” expressed exceeding interest in the archaic mother and “an early stage of human history when women ruled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065113486928">Makari 2008</xref>, p. 275). This was the last straw for Freud and resulted in the irreconcilable rift between Vienna and Zurich. Makari has traced their arguments over the universality of the incest taboo: “Jung told Freud he believed the incest taboo emerged from this matriarchal period . . . [as] a defense against the desire to return to the womb” (p. 275). To make matters worse, Sabina Spielrein, Jung’s close colleague and “muse,” gave a talk called “Transformations” as a new member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1911. Spielrein was fleeing from Zurich and her broken heart over Jung, with whose work on life, death, and sacrifice she had been totally enmeshed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065113486928">Kerr 1994</xref>). In her paper that night, she talked of the Siegfried myth, a private Wagnerian reference she shared with Jung. In her transference fantasies to Jung, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065113486928">Kerr (1994)</xref> says, “‘Siegfried’ stood simultaneously for the son she would give Jung and for Jung himself, with Spielrein in the role of the protective, self-sacrificing mother” (p. 227). Spielrein argued before Freud that night that a fusion of creation and destruction is analogous “to being transposed into the mother’s womb; the dying individual, too, is transferred back into the mother and then reborn. The prenatal state is equated to death . . ., a shadow existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003065113486928">Nunberg and Federn 1974</xref>, p. 331). Shedding light on this imagery, Spielrein wrote in a 1912 paper, “Contributions to the Knowledge of the Child’s Soul,” that “it is a common occurrence that a woman imagines a new being as something that grows at the expense of the old one. It is interesting that we react sometimes with lust, sometimes with anger, or at least with displeasure to these images of destruction” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113486928">Appignanesi and Forrester 1992</xref>, p. 206). The Vienna group did not respond well to her talk in November 1911. Freud used it to attack and denigrate Jung, who, he said, used “any mythological material whatsoever . . . without selection.” We can note that an aspect of Spielrein’s work, like Jung’s, assumed a central place for females equal to that of males. Freud, inflamed even further than before, wrote to Jung the day after her talk, first expressing disappointment that Bleuler had opted out of interest in psychoanalysis, and then noting his displeasure at Jung’s turn in theory making: “I am afraid there is a misunderstanding between us. . . . you once said . . . that to my way of thinking libido is identical with any kind of desire, whereas in reality I hold very simply that there are two basic drives and that only the power behind the sexual drive can be termed libido” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065113486928">Freud and Jung 1974</xref>, p. 209). The master was increasingly challenged and irritated by the intrusion of others’ ideas into his theory, especially these ungovernable runaway ideas about the centrality of mythology, matriarchy, maternal transferences, women, and childbirth. The birth process and merger fantasies in particular were prominent when in 1926 he broke with Otto Rank.</p>
<p>“Little Rank,” was what Freud affectionately called his beloved student early on in 1906, when at twenty-two Otto was the ideal disciple, meticulously taking the minutes of meetings of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Early work on the myth of the birth of the hero was acceptable as a learned work on comparative mythology. But by 1926 Rank had become so threatening, due to his 1924 book, <italic>The Trauma of Birth</italic>, as to be thrown out of the movement by Freud. Rank’s focus in the book is not on giving birth from the point of view of a woman, but on birth through the female genital as the human’s most profound encoded experience of anxiety. His confident central theme is “that the child’s every anxiety consists of the anxiety at birth (and the child’s every pleasure aims at the re-establishing of the intrauterine primal pleasure)” (1924, p. 20). The work contains many gems of insight, but a modern reader would have to notice Rank’s monomaniacal quest to find this birth trauma anxiety everywhere in the psyche as <italic>the</italic> definitive unconscious experience. He found it basic in everything from the child’s fear of the dark to the blinding of Oedipus in the play, as a return to the darkness of the womb, to phobias about animals, games of hiding, conjuring, swinging, hopping, and ultimately as sublimated into art and theater. Rank questioned the centrality of the oedipus complex. Instead he put the mother at the center of evey neurosis, and for Freud and his close followers, this became heresy. Freud initially tried to downplay the importance of Rank’s claim, in the interest of maintaining his affection, and because Rank believed he was extending the Professor’s views, but soon alarm set in among Freud’s closest followers on the Secret Committee. Vigorous efforts were successfully made to dissuade Ferenczi from supporting Rank, who eventually was extruded as a misguided heretic whose father-complex and greed for fame in America had interfered with his clearer vision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065113486928">Obaid (2012)</xref> quotes a letter to Freud in 1924 in which Rank explains that “the transference libido is a purely maternal one, and the anxiety basic to all symptoms was originally tied to the maternal genital, and was transferred to the father only secondarily” (p. 703). Abraham and Jones, both members of the Secret Committee, were frantic at this, and also at his radically shortening the time frame of analyses—in his view, a prefigured psychic parallel with pregnancy, with treatment termination a form of birth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065113486928">Obaid (2012)</xref> says it was “clear that the birth trauma thesis threatened to undermine the very pillars of their theory by trying to displace, or directly refute, the value assigned to the Oedipus complex, the function of the father and castration. It was not just a complement to their theories but indeed a radical attempt to reformulate the theory and praxis of psychoanalysis” (pp. 703–704). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065113486928">Gay (1988)</xref> quotes a letter from Freud to Rank in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065113486928">1925</xref>: “You are the formidable David who, with his trauma of birth, will manage to invalidate my work” (p. 480). Rank was putting the <italic>female</italic> genitals instead of male genitals at the heart of the neuroses! It was Rank who coined the term <italic>preoedipal</italic>. He explains a boy’s denial of the vagina as his primal, anxiety-filled refusal to remember the pain of emerging from the birth canal. This was a more basic level of castration anxiety than Freud’s classical castration anxiety suffered in relation to the father, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065113486928">Rank (1924)</xref> viewed as a later and displaced iteration of the confrontation with birth trauma: the boy “wishes to avoid the horror of passing this organ [the vagina], which still haunts him in every member” (p. 38). Rank’s definitive (but limited) focus on the female body was enough to cause enormous consternation in Freud’s inner circle. But to a modern reader like me, how easy it would have been in Rank’s vision to see that the young girl’s genital anxieties and difficulty with the vagina were part of her female contemplation of the terror of herself giving birth some day. Instead, as is usual for writers of Rank’s era, even when challenging Freud, and seeming so close to understanding something more about women’s relationship to their own bodies, a veil descends on his curiosity. What he sees is only that “the little girl has the same negative attitude towards her own genitals [because] she cannot share in the narcissistic advantage of possessing a penis” (p. 38). The young girl is still perceived through male eyes. Rank’s theory holds that pursuit of the primal pleasure of returning to the womb is melded with sexual intercourse, in which the boy is fortunate to be able to seek the return, while the poor girl must “give up all active idea of return to the mother, a penetration which is recognized or imagined to be the masculine privilege, and in the supreme joy of motherhood, to be content with the wish to regain the blessed primal state by means of passive reproduction—that is, by means of pregnancy and the birth of her own child” (p. 42). Rank is still a man of his day. However, he is to be admired for his effortless depiction of a corporeal sense of psychic dilemmas so vigorously portrayed in his expressive writing. He speaks of the adult’s lost memory of the child’s “earlier place abode”; or the woman’s “genital exit-and-entrance”; he connects the image of the so-called “woman-with-the-phallus” to a huge, overlively phallus like an elephant’s trunk that is unmistakably a baby equivalent. “The phallus as baby” reverses “the baby as phallus” for a refreshing change! He sees misogyny as a “primal repression which tries to degrade and to deny woman both socially and intellectually on account of her original connection with the birth trauma” (p. 37). This may be an unfortunate and vital truth, this connection of the denigration of females with a common unconscious horror, stemming from earliest childhood, of imagined birth processes. Rank gets carried away in his defense of women that begins to betray his own recoil, however. “In attempting to make conscious again the repressed primal memory of the birth trauma, we believe we shall reinstate the high estimation of women which was repressed simultaneously with the birth trauma, and we can do this by <italic>freeing her from the weight of the curse on her genitals</italic>” (p. 37; emphasis added). Think of it: “The weight of the curse on her genitals!”</p>

<title>A Contemporary Case Example</title>
<p>A woman in her late forties, in the course of her treatment, gave me a memorable account of giving birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003065113486928">5</xref></sup> But first a little background.</p>
<p>The patient said to me, “I was all my life afraid of being hurt physically. When I was about two or three they said I’d say “Oh, boo-boo!” and cry every time I fell or hit my hand or foot on something. I screamed at the doctor’s office when I got shots.” Once on my couch she found a stray push-pin. She was very funny about it, but she really thought I was torturing her (in the role of her big brother) to get “a rise” out of her (as an unconscious reference to her child’s view of getting pregnant, and anxiously, miserably, confronting her possession of a too tiny vaginal opening) and to show her what a crybaby she was. She was exquisitely sensitive, like the girl in “Princess and the Pea.” I could say a lot about how from about six years old and onward her mother had made a confidante of her, telling her nightmarish bedtime stories that included every detail of this daughter’s agonized and agonizing passage into life: how she had become stuck in her mother’s birth canal; how labor had slowed to a stop; the furious pains of an oxytocin drip and subsequently forceps to her head, which had precipitated her so furiously into the world that she had ripped open her mother’s vagina. For years thereafter, her mother had complained of her vaginal prolapse. But such was her fear of surgery and surgeons, she maintained, and so mangled had she been during this daughter’s birth, that she’d rather suffer prolapse and urinary incontinence to her dying day. (The father, unfortunately for the little girl, had long since abandoned this woman to her loneliness.)</p>
<p>So here is a snippet of process notes from this patient’s treatment, taken by me many years ago, when she was in her early forties, and about three years into a four-year analysis. Her own children were teenagers at the time, but she brought the birthing experience to life with me almost as a participant, as if it were yesterday. (She had managed to establish a decent relationship with her own husband. Resilience was an interesting feature of our work together.)</p>
<p>“I had tried to read about giving birth—what on earth could it be like? . . . I mean, apart from those gruesome stories my mother’d told me . . . to try to imagine what it would really FEEL like for <italic>me</italic>. I poured over books . . . I went to the library . . . I played over and over the movie I’d been given in my birthing class. I read any account I could of other women’s stories. I was trying to imagine my mother giving birth and at the same time imagine other women. . . . Would it be painful? . . . Would it feel as if I couldn’t escape? Would it go on and on and on forever? Would my genitals ever be the same again? Would I get torn apart? I was sick of thinking about it incessantly.</p>
<p>“Then when I was near term—you’ll like this [it turned out to be a reference to my being Irish]—I went to the video store to get a movie to take my mind off all that. I picked <italic>Man of Aran.</italic> I thought—the furthest thing I could find from giving birth. This would surely distract me for a while. Even ‘man’ in the title appealed to me. Some faraway island and a family with a hardscrabble fishing existence. Thinking about others and their problems would be good, and get me away from mine. [This is a black-and-white movie made in 1934, highlighting the tough world of fisherfolk off the wild, wild West Coast of Ireland, where the vast open Atlantic Ocean crashes off the cliffs and a few hardy people subsist on seaweed and poteen in a harsh climate.]</p>
<p>“I set up the video, and I turned out the lights. . . . I’m sitting there by myself. . . . It’s dark. . . . The movie is about to start. . . . Jeez. . . . My water breaks right there on the couch. . . . Ahhhhhhh I think. . . . Thank God, it’s started. . . . So I’m cleaning up the flood and I called the doctor and then my husband. . . . They told me to wait a while till the pains were regular before I started to go to the hospital. OKAY . . . Okay. . . . Urgent time for distraction.”</p>
<p>As she was waiting and feeling the inklings of the beginnings of contractions, “the hiss of the sea and the thunder of the wind on their oars . . . the boats pushing, pushing through the high sea, the waves towering over those little frail curraghs . . . the struggling oarsmen . . . soaked to the skin in freezing water, pushed and pulled by the power of natural forces . . . now under the waves . . . now gasping over the waves . . . not straightening out before yet again, under the grey dark surf . . . then . . . into the light. Then all is calm. It quiets. The sun appears. . . . It’s over. They survived. Oh, God, they survived. . . .</p>
<p>“How painful . . . was it going to get? [Referring now to the increase in her labor pains.] Could it be exciting? . . . How exciting to look forward to seeing this little creature, my new little baby. . . . Then the waves of pain were washing over me. . . . I took some whiskey . . . well, just a sip. . . . At that point John came rushing in. “Let’s go. The car is running. . . . I came as fast as I could.” And we were off, the pains were coming faster.</p>
<p>“Have you seen it? [She was back to the movie.] . . . It’s black-and-white . . . . So it was grey . . . so fierce and dark grey in the storms at</p>
<p>sea . . . off the craggy coast of Ireland. . . . The curraghs were ploughing through the waves, the wind was beating the sides of the little barks. . . . The crew were shouting muffled curses. . . . And they lost their big fishing net. . . . Each wave as it ran out they’d pull the net up the beach, and then the wave would devour it again and haul it back into the surf and they’d run and grab it and pull it up again and again up the beach . . . hauling with each incoming crashing breaker . . . till they got it up. . . .</p>
<p>“‘Oh, Mother of God!’ I screamed—the pains were getting worse. . . .” So my patient gave birth that night while in a drugged haze, reliving in a slightly stuporous state the lives of the fishermen in their curraghs, going to sea herself in that storm, feeling the disequilibrium of crashing with the waves, and letting go as the surf trailed up the granite chips of the shore, letting the forces of nature take her over and trusting to her curragh bark. And through it, apparently, she heard her mother Maggie’s voice when the heavy fishing net was finally recovered and the powerful tide went out over the sand: “Och, now sure, sure we’re all right, after all.”</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I believe I have evidence from the stories that women tell in psychoanalysis that there is, as Freud suggested, a deep and abiding psychological connection to the biologically sexed body; these are rich and multifarious gender portraits, with an interweaving of procreative compromise formations within their sexuality. The style of sexuality, the choice of partner or no partner at all, is not the issue here. Birthing is an emerging personal confrontation with the potential of having a baby inside one’s female body, and the mentalized possession of that female body. The unyoking of the latter from heterosexuality or the choice of sex partner, or from a predictable gender portrait, can begin to free us to listen in less biased ways, to attend with surprise, to engage a post-postmodern interest, if you will, in stories that centrally involve the body. We can learn how a woman’s style and expression of sexuality is regularly mingled with her procreative aspirations, her fears, her hopes, and her repulsions without needing to find this essential to “femininity,” or, on the other hand, without automatically believing she is oppressed socially and politically if she wishes to or decides to participate in using her body’s potential. The danger of death in childbirth, in every age, comes side by side with ecstasy. We must reassess the contemporary notion that it is politically incorrect for psychoanalytic theory to attend psychologically to our biology. The body is not just a source of pain and trauma. The pleasures of this female body need also to be released from the silence so long and so fiercely imposed on them, and I will end with those.</p>

<p>There are surprisingly few psychoanalysts who are interested in this topic. One of these is Joan Raphael-Leff, an Independent British analyst who writes extensively, both clinically and theoretically, about the subjectivity of inhabiting the female body (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065113486928">Raphael-Leff 2001</xref>). In my 2012 book I mention the others in two chapters about childbirth. My concern is that writing about women becomes marginalized as a specialized theme, rather than seamlessly entering the general line of theorizing about how the mind works.</p>

<p>Jones dropped his controversy and stayed close to Freud. But in the Jones-Freud controversy of the 1930s, Jones coined the term phallocentrism in criticism of Freud’s flawed account of sexual difference, arguing with Klein and Horney (who, of course, formed their own theoretical schools) for a primary femininity, and for “penis envy” as a defense based on fantasy, rather than an actual “wound” of the body, as suggested in Freud’s presentation. In a reformulation of the castration complex, Jones created the concept of “aphanisis” (never used these days) to refer to a female unconscious dread of an obliteration of the ability to have sexual enjoyment.</p>
