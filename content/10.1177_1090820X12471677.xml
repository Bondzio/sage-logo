         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Reviewing the <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic> by Drs Guyuron and Kinney made me think of the future of book publishing and my kids. My son is a published author and my daughter has her master’s degree in communication studies. Not many topics of conversation around the dinner table get us as “worked up” as a discussion about the future of the printed book and how, for better or worse, it’s giving way to its digital counterpart.</p>
         <p>The way we read books is changing. In 2011, bookseller Amazon sold more e-books than paperback and hardcover books. In the last 3 weeks of the year, the company sold 1 million Kindle e-readers per week. When I was a resident, I studied from file folders full of photocopied research. I hauled these folders around in a huge briefcase, which made me look like a mover with a bad back.</p>
         <p>Now surgical residents have all of their study material stored on their laptops. They read articles and study for exams entirely from their computers. With books such as <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic>, we no longer need to carry either the book or our laptop. The text is available anytime we need it and wherever we have access to the Internet. So while studying in the library or standing outside the operating room, the surgeon can easily and quickly look up a chapter that he or she needs to review.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic> is a multiauthored book with each chapter written by an authority in their field. Twenty-two chapters outline all the major areas of aesthetic surgery, including, among others, liposculpture, abdominoplasty, rhinoplasty, facelift, and breast augmentation. Several chapters cover topics not often seen in plastic surgery textbooks: skin care including chemical peeling, nonsurgical facial rejuvenation with fillers, botulinum toxin, laser facial resurfacing, and dermabrasion. These chapters provide ample material for plastic surgeons to develop a working knowledge of procedures that are often lacking in plastic surgery training programs.</p>

         <title>Strengths</title>
         <p>Drs Guyuron and Kinney have produced a book that heralds a new age in book publishing. <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic> is, first and foremost, a beautifully crafted and authoritative textbook on aesthetic surgery. Equally exciting, however, is the online content with which it is associated. On the inside cover of every book, an activation code allows access to the online book. Once activated, readers find something new that revolutionizes book publishing. The user has access to a complete web-based copy of the book, accompanied by a library of videos varying in length from 2 to 14 minutes that demonstrate surgical techniques correlating with most of the book chapters. The availability of the entire content online and the association of procedural videos with the book chapters make <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic> an important book to own for plastic surgeons and studying residents alike.</p>
         <p>The videos that are associated with the online version of this book are an accurate reflection of how we should be learning. Plastic surgery is an unusual medical specialty. Information about diseases and diagnosis can be transmitted by written text, but so much of what we as plastic surgeons do needs to be learned by observing how procedures are performed. No amount of text can compare with what we learn by watching a movie. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video must be worth an entire chapter.</p>
         <p>The book maintains a cohesive feel by organizing each chapter into Indications, Preoperative Considerations, Operative Approach, Postoperative Care, and Complications. All of the artwork is detailed, similar in style, and nicely complements the text. Although not exhaustive, every chapter is authoritative and complete.</p>

         <title>Weaknesses</title>
         <p>I have very few criticisms of this book, and I will couch my discussion of the weaknesses in terms of what could be improved with the next edition. An attempt to have every chapter accompanied by a procedural video (which isn’t the case in this edition) would round out the work. Standardized video would do as much for the project as standardized artwork. Asking the authors of the written chapters to capture a video related to the chapters they have written about in the book would make the entire project as unified as the textbook itself.</p>

      <sec id="section4-1090820X12471677">
         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Video Atlas</italic> is a book that every plastic surgeon and student of plastic surgery will refer to again and again in their career in ways that are as unique as our specialty itself. The book represents an invaluable study source for residents and would be equally useful for established aesthetic plastic surgeons looking to hone their surgical technique.</p>
