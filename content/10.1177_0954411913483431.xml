<abstract>
<p>Wedged insoles may produce immediate effects on knee abduction angular impulses during running; however, it is currently not known whether these knee abduction angular impulse magnitudes are maintained throughout a run when fatigue sets in. If changes occur, this could affect the clinical utility of wedged insoles in treating conditions such as patellofemoral pain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether knee abduction angular impulses are altered during a prolonged run with wedged insoles. It was hypothesized that knee abduction angular impulses would be reduced following a prolonged run with wedged insoles. Nine healthy runners participated. Runners were randomly assigned to either a 6-mm medial wedge condition or a 6-mm lateral wedge condition and then ran continuously overground for 30 min. Knee abduction angular impulses were quantified at 0 and 30 min using a gait analysis procedure. After 2 days, participants returned to perform the same test but with the other wedge type. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate main effects of wedge condition and time and interactions between wedge condition and time (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05). Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for post hoc analysis (<italic>α</italic> = 0.01). No interaction effects (<italic>p</italic> = 0.958) were found, and knee abduction angular impulses were not significantly different over time (<italic>p</italic> = 0.384). Lateral wedge conditions produced lesser knee abduction angular impulses than medial conditions at 0 min (difference of 2.79 N m s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) and at 30 min (difference of 2.76 N m s, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). It is concluded that significant knee abduction angular impulse changes within wedge conditions do not occur during a 30-min run. Additionally, knee abduction angular impulse differences between wedge conditions are maintained during a 30-min run.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common running injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913483431">1</xref></sup> Retrospectively, it has been shown that runners with PFP experience larger knee abduction angular impulses (KAAIs) than healthy controls during running, and in a prospective study, it has been shown that healthy runners with elevated KAAIs are more likely to develop PFP over a 6-month period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483431">2</xref></sup> Thus, it is believed that prevention and treatment of PFP may be achieved by altering KAAIs.</p>
<p>Medial and lateral wedge footwear insoles can influence KAAI magnitudes during running.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483431">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref></sup> Specifically, medial wedges tend to increase KAAIs, and lateral wedges tend to decrease KAAIs; however, subject-specific reactions that are opposite to these group trends are common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483431">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref></sup> Consequently, a patient-specific approach to wedge prescription may use either medial or lateral wedges for clinical management of PFP.</p>
<p>Biomechanical measurements with wedged insoles are typically made under nonfatigued conditions. Geiser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913483431">5</xref></sup> reported that knee joint moments were reduced during running following hip abductor fatigue; however, the effects that fatigue may have on KAAIs in combination with biomechanical insole interventions are not known. If KAAI changes are not maintained during a prolonged run, this could have implications on the clinical utility of wedged insoles. For instance, if wedges interact with fatigue to increase KAAIs, then wedges may actually be harmful. Conversely, if wedges interact with fatigue to reduce KAAIs even further, then the clinical benefit may be enhanced. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether KAAIs are altered during a prolonged run with wedged insoles. It was hypothesized that KAAIs would be reduced following a prolonged run with wedged insoles.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0954411913483431">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Based on pilot data, nine participants were required to achieve a desired power of 80%. Nine recreational runners with no lower extremity injury or history of orthotic use were recruited (six male, three female; mean age of 25.9 years (standard deviation (SD) = 2.3 years), height of 169.6 cm (SD = 10.4 cm), mass of 67.4 kg (SD = 11.1 kg)). All subjects gave informed consent prior to participating. Ethics approval was obtained from the university prior to recruitment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411913483431">
<title>Footwear conditions</title>
<p>A 6-mm (∼6°) medial wedge and a 6-mm (∼6°) lateral wedge were tested. These wedge thicknesses were chosen since they are commonly used in clinical and research settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913483431">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913483431">7</xref></sup> While medial wedges are more commonly used for PFP, lateral wedges were included in this study since they tend to reduce KAAIs and thus have recently been suggested as an alternative therapy for PFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref></sup> Wedges were placed underneath the sock-liner of a neutral shoe during testing (Adidas AdiZero Mana; men’s size = 8–12, women’s size = 6–10). Wedges were constructed by layering two sheets of 3-mm-thick ethylene vinyl acetate and cutting out the shape of the insole. These were sanded medially or laterally along the full length of the insole to create a wedge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411913483431">
<title>Protocol</title>
<p>Each participant was fit to their appropriate shoe size and randomly assigned to one of the two wedge conditions. Three retroreflective markers were secured to each of the shoe and shank segments of the participant’s right leg, which would later be used to determine segment three-dimensional (3D) kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913483431">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913483431">9</xref></sup> Before collecting dynamic data, a standing neutral trial was collected where additional joint markers were placed over the medial and lateral malleoli and the medial and lateral epicondyles. Joint centers were calculated as the midpoint between each set of joint markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913483431">8</xref></sup> and were used to define the shank and shoe segment lengths. Segment masses, centers of mass and moments of inertia were then determined using previously published anthropometric data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913483431">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913483431">11</xref></sup> These parameters were applied to future dynamic trials.</p>
<p>Participants then ran continuously at 3.6 m/s around a 65m circuit in a biomechanics laboratory. Participants were asked to turn on opposite legs at either end of the circuit to ensure that fatigue was not localized to one leg in particular. Speed was monitored using two photocells situated on either side of a force platform (Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) mounted flush with the lab floor that sampled ground reaction force data at a frequency of 2400 Hz. The force platform was placed along a 25 m straight component of the circuit to capture linear running data. Eight infrared cameras (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) simultaneously recorded the 3D trajectories of the retroreflective markers at a frequency of 240 Hz. With each loop of the circuit, a trial was collected. The first five trials where the participant was within 5% of the target speed, and also made direct contact with the force platform with the right foot, were used in subsequent analysis. The participant then continued to run at a self-selected pace for 30 min to simulate a normal recreational run while wearing wedged insoles. Following this, participants returned to a speed of 3.6 m/s, and the procedure described above was repeated until an additional five successful trials were collected with the assigned wedge. The time difference of 30 min represented the fatigue variable in this study, as it was simply assumed that participants were more fatigued at the end of the run than at the beginning. After 2 days, participants returned to the laboratory to complete the same testing procedure mentioned earlier with the other wedge condition.</p>

<title>Processing</title>
<p>3D resultant knee joint moments were calculated using a Newton–Euler inverse dynamics approach, and the internal knee abduction moments during stance were integrated with respect to time to obtain the KAAI for each trial. A detailed description of the method used for kinetic and kinematic data processing and calculation of joint moments are available elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913483431">12</xref></sup> The mean KAAI across the five dynamic trials for each condition for each participant was used in subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify KAAI main effects for wedge condition and time and/or an interaction between wedge condition and time (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05).

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913483431">Table 1</xref> shows the main results for this study. ANOVA revealed that no interaction between wedge condition and time occurred (<italic>p</italic> = 0.958). A significant KAAI main effect for wedge condition (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0017) was found; however, a KAAI main effect for time was not found (<italic>p</italic> = 0.384). Post hoc comparisons for wedge condition identified that the lateral wedge produced KAAIs that were, on average, 2.79 N m s (SD = 2.30 N m s) or 19.2% lower than the medial wedge condition at 0 min (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006). At 30 min, the lateral wedge condition produced KAAIs that were, on average, 2.76 N m s (SD = 1.54 N m s) or 18.7% lower than the medial wedge condition (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). For comparison, KAAIs changed by less than 0.26 N m s or 2.2% with either wedge condition over the 30-min run. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913483431">Figure 1</xref> shows the subject-specific changes in KAAI over time with each wedge condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section10-0954411913483431">
<title>Main results</title>
<p>The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that KAAIs would be reduced following a 30-min run with wedged insoles. Geiser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913483431">5</xref></sup> showed that with isokinetically induced hip abductor fatigue, knee abduction moments were decreased by about 80% during the weight-acceptance phase of running. Therefore, the 1%–2% nonsignificant changes observed here were more likely due to small variations in running speed within the target range, slight marker movement due to sweat or stride-to-stride gait mechanics variability rather than fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913483431">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913483431">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483431">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Stefanyshyn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483431">2</xref></sup> found that patients with PFP experienced KAAIs that were, on average, 4.5 N m s (36%) higher than healthy controls. These researchers also found that healthy runners who developed PFP over a 6-month period had KAAIs that were 4.5 N m s (19%) higher than matched healthy controls. Based on this, and the earlier discussion concerning stride variability and marker movement, the nonsignificant KAAI changes observed over time in this study are not likely mechanically or clinically meaningful. Instead, the large differences in KAAI induced by the differing wedge types may be of far greater importance.</p>
<p>Laterally wedged insoles produced lower KAAIs than medially wedged insoles at 0 min, and this finding is consistent with the results of others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483431">4</xref></sup> Additionally, this study has shown that these KAAI magnitudes are maintained throughout a 30-min run. In the long term, MacLean et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483431">14</xref></sup> have shown that the effects of wedged insoles on KAAIs remain unchanged after a period of 6 weeks. Assuming that insole structural integrity is maintained, it can therefore be concluded that once the appropriate wedge for the desired KAAI effect is identified for a particular runner (i.e. decrease KAAI), the effects should last throughout their runs and should produce similar effects in each of their future runs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0954411913483431">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Strengths of this study included use of a common wedge design and common neutral shoe for all subjects. Additionally, a 30-min run was used to simulate a clinically relevant amount of fatigue for a recreational runner. Use of overground running was also a strength since recent research has indicated that measurement of biomechanical variables using an instrumented treadmill may slightly, though significantly, alter peak kinetic values such as joint moments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913483431">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913483431">16</xref></sup> Conversely, a limitation is that the extent to which outdoor running is simulated using an enclosed circuit is not known. Although a neutral condition was not compared to the wedge conditions in this study, the initial effects of wedged footwear relative to neutral are already well established, and a neutral condition was not needed to achieve this study’s purpose. Finally, this study used healthy participants and so the effects on PFP populations are not known.</p>

<sec id="section12-0954411913483431" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>No differences in KAAI magnitudes were observed between time points with either the lateral or medial wedge condition. Thus, it is concluded that KAAI magnitude is maintained throughout a 30-min run with wedged insoles. Clinically, this indicates that a wedge prescribed based on baseline KAAI data can be expected to produce similar KAAI effects during prolonged runs.</p>
