<abstract>
<p>Multifaceted, sustained efforts are needed to reduce early pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases among high-risk adolescents. An important area for research is testing youth development interventions offered through clinic settings, where access to high-risk adolescents is plentiful and few efforts have rigorously evaluated a dual approach of building protective factors while addressing risk. This article presents findings from a pilot study of Prime Time, a clinic-based youth development intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors among girls at risk for early pregnancy. Girls aged 13 to 17 years meeting specified risk criteria were assigned to Prime Time treatment groups. The Prime Time intervention included a combination of case management services and peer leadership groups. Participants completed self-report surveys at baseline, 12 and 18 months following enrollment. At 12 months, the intervention group reported significantly fewer sexual partners than the control group. At 18 months, the intervention group reported significantly more consistent condom use with trends toward more consistent hormonal and dual method use. Dose-response analyses suggested that relatively high levels of exposure to a youth development intervention were needed to change contraceptive use behaviors among adolescents at risk for early pregnancy. Given promising findings, further testing of the Prime Time intervention is warranted.</p>

<p>Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases pose substantial threats to adolescent health. U.S. adolescents have among the highest pregnancy and STD rates in the industrialized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910386011">Panchaud, Singh, Feivelson, &amp; Darroch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910386011">Ventura, Amba, Mosher, &amp; Henshaw, 2008</xref>). More than 30% of teenage girls become pregnant at least once by age 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386011">Kirby, 2007</xref>). Recent data suggest that 26% of 14- to 19-year-old girls have at least one of the most common STDs (human papilloma virus, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, trichomoniasis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386011">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008</xref>). Related to these outcomes, adolescents are more likely than adults to have multiple sexual partners and engage in unprotected intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839910386011">Weinstock, Berman, &amp; Cates, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>For adolescents at high risk for pregnancy and STDs, research suggests that preventive interventions must be multifaceted and sustained to have substantive effects on health risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386011">Flay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910386011">Kirby, 2001a</xref>). Two decades of evidence underscore the utility of investing in youth development approaches to prevent negative sexual health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386011">Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386011">Lonczak, Abbott, Hawkins, Kosterman, &amp; Catalano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910386011">Philliber, Kaye, Herrling, &amp; West, 2002</xref>). Youth development programs tap the power of protective factors—within adolescents and their environments—to counteract risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910386011">Resnick, 2000</xref>). These programs provide opportunities for adolescents to build skills that allow them to function and contribute in their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910386011">Roth &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective youth development programs with vulnerable populations have included case management and peer leadership components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910386011">Denner, Coyle, Robin, &amp; Banspach, 2005</xref>;), both of which have been offered through health settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910386011">CDC, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386011">DiClemente, Wingwood, &amp; Harrington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910386011">Rosenfeld et al., 2000</xref>). Case management ensures attention to diverse psychosocial issues confronting at-risk youth involved in sexual risk behaviors. Case managers’ interpersonal skills, empathic support, and sensitivity to cultural nuances are foundations for a trusting youth–adult relationship that becomes a basis for lasting behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910386011">Morrow &amp; Styles, 1995</xref>). A peer leadership component may incorporate peer educator programming, as a mechanism for enhancing skills and contributions of the peer educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386011">Komro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910386011">Philliber, 1999</xref>). A peer leadership component may also include service learning experiences that allow adolescents to practice social and emotional skills, build caring relationships, and gain experience in pro-social community engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910386011">Denner, Coyle, Robin, &amp; Banspach, 2005</xref>). Sustained involvement in peer educator and service learning programs has been linked to reductions in adolescent sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910386011">O’Donnell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910386011">Smith, Dane, Archer, Deveraux, &amp; Katner, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386011">NRC/IOM, 2009</xref>) emphasize that to improve health systems for adolescents, priority must be given to incorporating youth development and prevention services. Such services are particularly lacking for adolescents most vulnerable to negative health outcomes. Although innovative efforts have used a youth development framework to guide health service delivery, very little evidence exists on outcomes of these efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386011">NRC/IOM, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe participation and preliminary efficacy outcomes from a pilot study of <italic>Prime Time</italic>, a clinic-based youth development intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors among girls at high risk for early pregnancy. <italic>Prime Time</italic> aims to change core attributes related to sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910386011">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386011">Manlove et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386011">Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910386011">Resnick, 2000</xref>) through a combination of case management and peer leadership over 18 months.</p>

<title>Study Design and Sample</title>
<p>This study was a Phase II clinical trial, pilot research to establish and refine intervention protocols and determine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839910386011">Whittemore &amp; Grey, 2002</xref>). In total, 128 participants from three clinics in a Midwestern metropolitan area were involved in this study. Participants were recruited in two phases, first from Clinics 1 and 2 (September 1999-May 2001) and then from Clinic 3 (October 2001-December 2002), allowing refinement of intervention protocols during the pilot study. During Phase 1, participants from Clinics 1 and 2 were randomly assigned to study treatment groups. During Phase 2, all participants from Clinic 3 were assigned to the intervention group for 10 months, to accumulate a group large enough to test an expanded intervention. For the remaining recruitment period, all Clinic 3 participants were assigned to the control group.</p>
<p>Clinics participating in this pilot study were selected to represent a range of settings in which adolescents seek health services. Clinic 1, in a middle-income suburb, provides adolescent reproductive health services. Clinics 2 and 3, in low-income urban neighborhoods, provide adolescent primary care services.</p>
<p>This study targeted adolescents at high risk for early pregnancy. Our sample consisted of sexually active 13- to 17-year-old girls meeting one or more of the following eligibility criteria: (a) clinic visits involving negative pregnancy test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386011">Manlove et al., 2001</xref>), postabortion exam, or emergency contraception; (b) young age (ages 13-14 years); and (c) elevated scores on a seven-item screening tool indicating high-risk sexual behaviors, described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386011">Duke, Sieving, Pettingell, &amp; Skay, 2008</xref>). The study excluded girls who did not understand consent materials, were married, pregnant, or had given birth.</p>
<p>To minimize attrition, enrollment involved two clinic visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910386011">Henneken, 1987</xref>). At Visit 1, clinic staff informed age-eligible girls about the study. Study staff invited girls meeting eligibility criteria to return for a second visit within 2 weeks. At Visit 2, girls signed a consent statement, completed a study survey, and were assigned to a treatment group. This study was approved by university and participating clinics’ IRBs.</p>
<p>Demographic items on the screening tool (completed at Visit 1) were used to compare participants to eligible girls who did not enroll. Participants were similar to eligible non-participants in terms of age, household mobility, and school enrollment. Participants were less likely to be Caucasian, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>n</italic> = 183) = 44.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, and more likely to have families receiving public assistance, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>n</italic> = 185) = 27.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910386011">Table 1</xref> shows girls’ baseline characteristics. The prevalence of sexual risk behaviors (multiple partners, inconsistent condom and hormonal contraceptive use) suggests that participants were at high risk for negative sexual health outcomes compared to national samples of sexually active teens (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910386011">Abma, Martinez, Mosher, &amp; Dawson, 2004</xref>). At baseline, no significant differences were found between intervention and control groups on age, ethnicity, family composition, public assistance, school status, contraceptive use, or number of sex partners, despite lack of random assignment in Clinic 3.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The conceptual model for the <italic>Prime Time</italic> intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839910386011">Figure 1</xref>) was informed by social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910386011">Bandura, 1986</xref>), the resilience paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910386011">Resnick, 2000</xref>), and research on antecedents of sexual risk behaviors among adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386011">Manlove et al., 2001</xref>). This model guided design and implementation of the <italic>Prime Time</italic> intervention.

<p>All programming was led by trained case managers—health educators and youth workers experienced working with teens from diverse cultural backgrounds. Training included practice and feedback on intervention strategies. Case managers received ongoing clinical supervision from a masters’-prepared professional with extensive experience working with culturally diverse youth populations. Each intervention component is described below and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839910386011">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Case management</title>
<p>Case managers attempted monthly visits with each girl for 18 months. Participants received $10 for each monthly visit. Initial visits focused on establishing a trusting relationship. Depending on each girl’s needs, subsequent visits focused on topics of enhancing motivation and skills for responsible sexual behavior, building expectations and skills for healthy relationships, promoting positive school and family involvement, and addressing emotional health needs. Case managers addressed each of these topics using standardized guidelines. Case managers also helped girls access appropriate family, clinic, school, and community resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839910386011">
<title>Peer leadership groups</title>
<p>Designed to complement one-on-one case management, peer leadership groups provided hands-on leadership experiences.</p>
<sec id="section6-1524839910386011">
<title>Peer education</title>
<p>All girls in the intervention group were invited to join peer educator training groups and become peer health educators. Peer educator groups had weekly 2-hr training sessions for 15 weeks. Sessions followed a standardized curriculum that addressed communication skills, stress management skills, conflict resolution skills, expectations and skills for healthy relationships, understanding social influences on sexual behaviors, sexual decision making, and contraceptive use skills. Each session consisted of hands-on activities that emphasized skill-building.</p>
<p>Beginning with their first training session, girls were charged to reach and teach others in their daily lives. Peer educator contacts were defined as at least a 15-minute conversation on a topic covered in training. Girls received $5 for each documented contact, for up to 50 contacts during the 15-week training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839910386011">
<title>Service learning</title>
<p>Systematic feedback from participants in the first phase of the intervention indicated a strong desire for additional peer leadership programming. Thus, an advanced leadership group, was developed from a literature review of service learning programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386011">Kirby, 2001b</xref>) and consultation with service learning experts. Offered to Clinic 3 participants who completed peer educator training, service learning groups met weekly for 16 weeks and followed a standardized curriculum. The curriculum emphasized group decision-making and problem-solving skills, emotional self-regulation skills, supportive peer relationships and planful community involvement. Service projects included coaching elementary students preparing a school performance and producing a video on actions that convey respect.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839910386011">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Participants completed a self-report survey at baseline, 12 and 18 months following study enrollment. Of 128 who completed baseline surveys, 85.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 110) were re-surveyed at 12 months and 82.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 106) at 18 months. At both follow-up points, there were no significant differences in age, ethnicity, family welfare status, baseline contraceptive use, or number of sexual partners between those lost to follow-up and those who remained in the sample. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in these characteristics between those lost to follow-up in intervention and control groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839910386011">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Primary outcome measures included consistency of condom use, hormonal contraceptive use, and dual method use with a participant’s most recent sex partner and number of sex partners in the past 6 months. Prior research had established the reliability of these measures among sexually active adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910386011">Sieving, Hellerstedt, Fee, Snyder, &amp; Resnick, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1524839910386011">
<title>Contraceptive use consistency</title>
<p>Participants indicated which of the past 6 months they had sex and in which of these months they used a hormonal method (birth control pills, patch, injection), dual methods (hormonal method plus condoms), or condoms every time they had sex with their most recent partner. For each method, a continuous measure was created by dividing the number of months a participant reported consistent use by the number of months she had sex with that partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910386011">Sieving et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839910386011">
<title>Number of sex partners</title>
<p>Participants indicated the number of males with whom they had vaginal sex in the past 6 months.</p>
<p>Intermediate outcomes representing environmental, personal, and behavioral attributes targeted for change by <italic>Prime Time</italic> were also examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839910386011">
<title>Age difference with partner</title>
<p>A continuous measure was created by subtracting the participant’s reported age from her most recent sex partner’s reported age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839910386011">
<title>Desire to use birth control with partner</title>
<p>Participants indicated their feelings about using birth control with their most recent partner. Analysis used a dichotomous variable distinguishing those who always wanted to use birth control from others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524839910386011">
<title>Beliefs supporting birth control use</title>
<p>A four-item scale assessed beliefs supporting birth control use (α = .60). Sample items: “Using birth control will help me reach my future goals,” “Using birth control is easy.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1524839910386011">
<title>Sexual communication with partner</title>
<p>A 12-item scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910386011">Sieving et al., 1997</xref>) measured sexual communication (α = .85). Participants reported when they talked to their most recent partner about aspects of sexual risk, including using condoms and other contraception, preventing pregnancy, STDs, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1524839910386011">
<title>Condom use self-efficacy</title>
<p>Participants indicated how likely they were to ask their partner if he had condoms when they were getting “turned on” sexually.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1524839910386011">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Differences between intervention and control groups in each outcome were assessed at 12- and 18-month follow-up points, adjusting for a baseline measure of that outcome and the variation in design between study phases (random assignment in Phase 1; non-random assignment and extra peer leadership activities in Phase 2). These analyses used an intent-to-treat approach in which data from participants who completed a follow-up survey were included in the group to which they had been assigned at baseline.</p>
<p>Because intervention participants engaged in different levels of case management and peer leadership groups, we also assessed whether different outcomes were associated with different levels of exposure (dose-response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386011">Birnbaum, Lytle, Story, Perry, &amp; Murray, 2002</xref>). The main independent variable in the dose-response analyses was a categorical measure of intervention exposure: 0 = <italic>no exposure</italic> (control group); 1 = <italic>minimal exposure</italic> (&lt;4 case management sessions); 2 = <italic>case management only</italic> (≥4 case management sessions, &lt;7 peer leadership sessions; range = 4-26 total sessions); and 3 = <italic>case management + peer leadership</italic> (≥4 case management sessions, ≥7 peer leadership sessions: range = 18-56 total sessions).</p>
<p>For all analyses, ANCOVA models were used for continuous outcomes; logistic regression models were utilized for dichotomous outcomes. Because this was a pilot study and it was possible that significant effects would not be found because of the small sample size, we report statistical significance of <italic>p</italic> &lt;.10.</p>

In total, 23%, 48%, and 70% of participants from Clinics 1, 2, and 3 (respectively) completed half or more of peer educator training sessions. Across clinics, the majority of participants actively involved in case management (≥70%) also participated in peer educator training. In Clinic 3, where service learning groups were offered, 55% of participants (61% of those actively involved in case management) completed half or more of service learning sessions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from this pilot study support a multicomponent, sustained approach to preventing sexual risk behaviors among adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy. Participation data suggest that the <italic>Prime Time</italic> model is well accepted by high-risk, urban adolescent girls. Intent-to-treat findings demonstrate preliminary efficacy of the <italic>Prime Time</italic> intervention with respect to sexual risk behavior outcomes. At the 12-month interim and the conclusion of the 18-month intervention, differences between intervention and control groups in primary outcomes were in the hypothesized direction. At 12 months, the intervention group reported significantly fewer sexual partners than the control group. At 18 months, the intervention group reported significantly more consistent condom use, with trends toward more consistent hormonal and dual method contraceptive use. These findings indicate the potential efficacy of a sustained intervention including case management and peer leadership group components.</p>
<p>Dose-response findings suggest that relatively high levels of exposure to a youth development intervention that combines adult and peer support may be needed to change contraceptive use patterns among adolescent girls at risk for early pregnancy. At 18 months, the <italic>case management + peer leadership</italic> group reported significantly more consistent dual method use than did the <italic>control</italic> and <italic>minimal exposure</italic> groups. Consonant with other successful youth development intervention studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910386011">Resnick, 2000</xref>), these findings suggest that multifaceted efforts are needed to change behaviors among vulnerable adolescent populations.</p>
<p><italic>Prime Time</italic> demonstrated mixed effects on intermediate outcomes. At 12 and 18 months, the intervention group had significantly stronger beliefs supporting birth control use. At 18 months, the control group trended toward earlier sexual communication with their most recent partner. This finding suggests the need for intervention activities to give greater emphasis to enhancing adolescent girls’ communication about sexual risk with their sex partners, in order to bring about desired changes in partner communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910386011">Perry, 1999</xref>). No group differences were found in intermediate outcomes of teen–partner age difference, partner-specific attitudes about contraceptive use, or condom use self-efficacy. Our inability to document differences in these intermediate outcomes could relate to inadequate measurement. For example, condom use self-efficacy was measured with one item assessing confidence to ask a partner if he had condoms.</p>
<p>The finding that girls recruited from primary care settings were more likely to engage in intervention activities than were girls recruited from a reproductive health setting may reflect the fact that teens are likely to utilize primary care clinics for a broad range of health-related services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386011">Klein, McNulty, &amp; Flatau, 1998</xref>). This finding may indicate that <italic>Prime Time</italic>’s sustained intervention with at-risk teen girls is best suited for clinics where adolescents receive ongoing primary care services. Alternatively, the <italic>Prime Time</italic> intervention may be especially attractive to teens from lower income communities where access to positive youth development services is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910386011">Pittman, Irby, Tolman, Yohalem, &amp; Ferber, 2003</xref>). Intervention participation rates were highest in clinics that served low-income communities, and participants whose families had or may have received public assistance in the year prior to study enrollment were more likely to engage in the intervention than girls whose families had not received assistance. This pilot study does not allow us to definitively answer questions of whether participation rates vary by type of clinic through which the intervention is offered (primary care vs. specialty services), availability of positive youth development services in the surrounding community, or some combination of these factors. Further research is needed to better understand clinic settings and populations for which this type of intervention is best suited.</p>
<p>Additional limitations should be noted. First, with a small sample size, inadequate power precludes strong conclusions or clinical implications. Second, Clinic 3 participants were not randomly assigned to treatment groups because of fieldwork time limitations. However, intervention and control groups appeared equivalent at baseline, in terms of demographic characteristics and risk behaviors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To prevent early pregnancy and STDs among adolescents at high risk for these outcomes, multifaceted and sustained interventions are needed. A key area for research is testing of youth development interventions offered through clinic settings, where access to high-risk adolescent girls is plentiful and few efforts have rigorously evaluated a dual approach of building protective factors while addressing risk. Indeed, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386011">National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine (2009)</xref> propose that incorporating youth development services is fundamental to improving health services, especially for those young people most vulnerable to risk behaviors and poor health outcomes. Given pilot study findings and the critical need for evidence-based youth development services in clinic settings, refinement and efficacy testing of the <italic>Prime Time</italic> intervention is warranted. Furthermore, as not all high-risk youth access clinics, consideration should be given to adapting and evaluating this youth development intervention in community organizations that have sustained contact with vulnerable youth.</p>
