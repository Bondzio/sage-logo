<abstract>
<p>Drawing on the four authors’ experiences as members of a collective made up of faculty and staff housed across several academic and non-academic educational institutions in the Seattle metropolitan region, the article argues that practitioners of cultural studies can best address questions of praxis by developing and institutionalizing more diverse sites for the critical and creative study of culture. A non-affirmative model of cultural studies needs to be grounded, both institutionally and theoretically, in collaborations that cut across, bridge, and reconfigure the relations among educational institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community groups.</p>

<p>The cultural ideal assimilated men’s longing for a happier life: for humanity, goodness, joy, truth, and solidarity. Only, in this ideal, they are all furnished with the affirmative accent of belonging to a higher, purer, nonprosaic world. They are either internalized as the duty of the individual soul (to achieve what is constantly betrayed in the external existence of the whole) or represented as objects of art (whereby their reality is relegated to a realm essentially different from that of everyday life). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">Marcuse, 1969 [1937]</xref>: 114)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Herbert Marcuse meditated on the intersections of cultural critique and cultural practice in his 1937 essay ‘The affirmative character of culture’, he wrote within an historical conjuncture that provocatively refracts our own. Deeply aware of the threat German fascism posed to traditionally liberal ideals of culture as a site of human desire and freedom, Marcuse defended the radical potential of such affirmative imaginings (‘men’s longing for a happier life’). But he attended even more closely to the ways in which those imaginings were contained and institutionalized through the opposition of cultural ideals (‘humanity, goodness, joy, truth, and solidarity’) and material reality (the ‘prosaic world’ of ‘everyday life’). ‘Affirmative culture’ is the name Marcuse gave to the social totality produced through this dualistic way of thinking about culture as ‘a world essentially different from the factual world of the daily struggle for existence, yet realizable by every individual for himself ‘from within,’ without any transformation of the state of fact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">1969 [1937]</xref>: 95). Marcuse saw in the rise of fascism in Germany not a betrayal of affirmative culture (and its muted or interiorized idealism), but its self-abolition. The authoritarian state may have explicitly opposed ‘idealist art and philosophy’, but it also relied on culture and its industries as a means of inserting the individual into what Marcuse called ‘a false collectivity (race, folk, blood, and soil)’: ‘That individuals freed for over four hundred years march with so little trouble in the communal columns of the authoritarian state is due in no small measure to affirmative culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">1969 [1937]</xref>: 125). In response to both affirmative culture and its fascist self-abolition, Marcuse joined his Frankfurt School collaborators in advocating a ‘non-affirmative culture’, one that links critique and practice. He described this non-affirmative culture as grounded in the material realities of everyday life – ‘burdened with mutability and necessity’ – and as critically utopian – ‘dancing on the volcano, laughing in sorrow, flirtation with death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">1969 [1937]</xref>: 132).</p>
<p>Writing in the early 21st century in the northwestern United States, we begin with Marcuse’s 1937 essay because it provides a set of conceptual tools for thinking broadly about the relation between cultural critique and cultural practice under the globalizing neoliberalism of the current historical conjuncture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877911422293">1</xref></sup> But we also modify the title of Marcuse’s essay to mark our extension of his analysis to our central concern with what Stuart Hall famously called the ‘profound danger’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877911422293">1991</xref>: 286) involved in the institutionalization of cultural studies as a site of cultural praxis across the field of higher education. The difference is that Marcuse noted how the keywords ‘art’ and ‘beauty’ as deployed within theories of affirmative culture reproduce a dualism between idealism and realism, where we join Hall in focusing on the conceptual labor performed by conventional understandings of ‘cultural studies’ as one (inter)discipline among others and ‘critique’ as a practice that fails to reflect on the university itself. Take as an instance of this analogy a brief summary passage from Marcuse’s essay:<disp-quote>
<p>What counts as utopia, phantasy, and rebellion in the world of fact is allowed in art. There affirmative culture has displayed the forgotten truths over which ‘realism’ triumphs in everyday life. The medium of beauty decontaminates truth and sets it apart from the present. What occurs in art occurs with no obligation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">1969 [1937]</xref>: 114)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Substitute our categories for Marcuse’s:<disp-quote>
<p>What counts as utopia, phantasy, and rebellion in the world of fact is allowed in cultural studies. There affirmative culture has displayed the forgotten truths over which ‘realism’ triumphs in everyday life. The medium of critique decontaminates truth and sets it apart from the present. What occurs in cultural studies occurs with no obligation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The affirmative character of culture, according to Marcuse, protects a space of uncontaminated (and therefore uncontested) idealism by opposing it to the material realities of everyday life. The affirmative character of cultural studies, we suggest, enables a critical idealism (often posing as a political radicalism) when it shields that critique from an engagement with the messiness of everyday life, the institutional practices of the research universities where cultural studies has found its most comfortable home, and the diverse forms of cultural work that occur alongside and outside of those universities.</p>
<p>We anticipate that this observation will produce in our readers both a flash of recognition and a sense of injustice. Few practitioners of cultural studies will disagree that the field could do a better job of linking its documentary, critical, and pedagogical practices to the cultural projects that those practices claim to document, critique, and disseminate. But does this mean that all approaches to the study of culture need to engage directly with the material realities of everyday life? Isn’t this an updated version of a second cliché Marcuse warned against: the ‘counterimage of affirmative culture’ as the ‘transformation of the earth into a gigantic community center’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422293">1969 [1937]</xref>: 132)? Even if this shift were desirable, is it possible within institutions of higher education today, especially given the material effects of disciplinary and professional specialization and subspecialization? Or worse, isn’t this a variant of the neoliberal call to reduce all knowledge to application, to make the study of culture less critical and more expedient within emerging economic and administrative modes of governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911422293">Miller and Yudice 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877911422293">Yudice 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877911422293">2003</xref>)? Drawing on our experiences as members of a collective made up of faculty and staff housed across several academic and non-academic educational institutions in the Seattle metropolitan region, we argue in this article that those of us who labor under the sign of cultural studies can best address these questions by developing and institutionalizing more diverse practice sites for the critical and creative study of culture. A non-affirmative model of cultural studies is one that needs to be grounded, both practically and theoretically, in collaborations that cut across, bridge, and reconfigure the relations among educational institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community groups.</p>
<p>We begin our argument for a non-affirmative cultural studies by reviewing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ien Ang’s (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911422293">2006)</xref> widely read provocations to rethink cultural studies as a form of applied humanities centered on cross-sectoral research practices. We then modify and expand on this recommendation by sketching three engaged research projects that instance what we have come to understand as a more robust and transdisciplinary approach to the study of culture. Because the sites of these engagements have varied among us – from a semi-formal encampment of people experiencing homelessness to a community center that supports recent immigrants to a student theater company that performs regionally and internationally – what follows can be best understood as our collective field report on a network of collaborative projects linked through a common geography. They are all located in a region of the Pacific Northwest that is home to Microsoft and affiliated technology companies, Boeing and its light-industry subsidiaries, the Bothell campus of the University of Washington and several community colleges, and a developing corridor of biotech start-ups. This regional geography is marked by the history of white flight from the Seattle metropolitan core during the bussing and school desegregation battles of the 1960s and 1970s, but currently attracts a range of new immigrant populations. In ways that will become clear, these historical and sociological trajectories shape each of our ongoing projects, even as the projects themselves seek to reshape the region. The current article draws on the evidence of those projects to make a general argument about how a non-affirmative cultural studies might be practiced and institutionalized through local and translocal instances of what we have come to theorize as place-based scholarship-in-action. We intend it to serve as an opportunity to document and disseminate our findings to date, as a means of building theory out of our collaborative and place-based practices, and, in the sections that follow, as an opportunity to address some of the more skeptical responses we have encountered along the way.</p>
<sec id="section1-1367877911422293">
<title>‘Why would anyone want a degree in cultural studies?’</title>
<p>Readers of this article will likely be all too familiar with this question. Students of cultural studies hear it from their friends and family, from their fellow students in other academic and professional programs, and from people they come across in their everyday lives. Teachers of cultural studies hear it from their colleagues in other academic programs, from potential students, and from cultural workers across knowledge-producing fields outside educational institutions. Administrators hear it from students and parents, from community members, and in some cases from Boards of Regents and state legislatures. We heard it from an interim chancellor at the university where the four of us work. When he first arrived at the University of Washington Bothell, our interim chancellor was presented with a proposal for a new Master of Arts degree in Cultural Studies. The program had been in gestation for several years and was designed to attract and educate students who were seeking either to enter careers in social, cultural, and arts sectors or to pursue further interdisciplinary graduate education across the arts, humanities, and social and natural sciences. Those of us developing the program had been doing the hard intellectual and institutional work of building a regional community-based learning network capable of providing students with opportunities to document off-campus educational experiences and to hone professional skills suited to their individual career goals and life ambitions. We were, in other words, fashioning a hybrid academic-professional graduate program in cultural studies that could prepare students for careers and lives as cultural workers either inside or outside educational institutions. ‘Why,’ our chancellor asked incredulously upon first hearing of the proposal, ‘would anyone want a degree in cultural studies?’</p>
<p>We find this question annoying, but we are not wholly unsympathetic with it. To be fair, our chancellor had not yet heard the details of the proposal and his response is far from idiosyncratic, even within the writings of cultural studies practitioners. Take as an example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ien Ang’s 1999</xref> article ‘Who needs cultural research?’ Written by a globally prominent practitioner of cultural studies and grounded in her experiences at the Centre for Cultural Research at the University of Western Sydney (UWS), the article begins with a scene in which Ang’s hairdresser asks her client what she teaches. Ang takes her own inability to answer this simple question in accessible terms not as an opportunity to blame her hairdresser, but as a symptom of the failure of cultural studies scholarship to articulate its public purposes. This failure, Ang suggests with reference to the 1994 volume <italic>The New Production of Knowledge</italic> (Gibbons et al.) reflects the field’s uneasy commitment to two contradictory modalities of university-based research activity. Traditional ‘mode 1’ research activity generates knowledge largely in (inter)disciplinary academic contexts, orients that knowledge toward other researchers and scientists working in those contexts, and is relatively indifferent to broader questions of utility and application. Emergent ‘mode 2’ research activity creates knowledge in transdisciplinary social and economic contexts, addresses a wide spectrum of knowledge practitioners, and links research activity to concerns with how the ability to make knowledge is and should be socially distributed. Echoing the authors of <italic>The New Production of Knowledge</italic>, Ang’s explanation for this historical shift lies not simply in the factors cited by other scholars and critics of the corporate turn in university knowledge policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911422293">Aronowitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911422293">Bok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422293">Bousquet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877911422293">Newfield, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877911422293">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877911422293">Readings, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877911422293">Williams, 2006</xref>), but also in institutional shifts occasioned by the post-Second World War expansion of higher education. By producing more highly trained and credentialed researchers than they are able or willing to employ, universities have effectively undermined their monopoly in those areas and enabled the proliferation of non-university research sites. One result of this shift in how and where research activity takes place has been the creation of new knowledge geographies capable of sustaining cross-sectoral research partnerships that breach the boundaries of the academy and its (inter)disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877911422293">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ang’s introduction of this heuristic distinction between two competing modalities of knowledge production alerts her audience to the ways in which cultural studies scholarship participates in this institutional shift. While it may be theoretically aligned with the pragmatic, transdisciplinary, and potentially democratic norms that inform the second mode of knowledge production, cultural studies is often institutionalized in universities through the academic, (inter)disciplinary, and organizationally insular procedures of the first. This contradiction informs much of the wide-ranging critical literature on the institutionalization of cultural studies as an academic (inter)discipline, especially in discussions that dwell on tensions among political activism, intellectual labor, and academic professionalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877911422293">3</xref></sup> It also explains why Ang asks us to worry about her inability to respond to her hairdresser. If the scholarship cultural studies practitioners generate is intended both to theorize and to work across the boundaries of research universities, and if the conditions of contemporary knowledge production increasingly invite this boundary-crossing work, then the pressing question concerns how cultural studies scholars can best build bridges for generative and mutually beneficial campus–community collaborations. Like many other commentators who have addressed this question, Ang turns toward an engagement with national and regional policy analysis to provide an answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911422293">Bennett, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911422293">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911422293">Miller and Yudice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877911422293">Murdock, 1997</xref>). Cultural studies scholarship – including the field’s framing questions, methodological orientations, and pedagogical commitments – may have good reason to remain insular if it can imagine itself only as responding to invitations to solve existing problems as they are defined by policy institutions ranging from local and national governments to community and neighborhood organizations. But it can also create new knowledge partnerships that ‘generate a mode of self-reflexivity by explicating the biases implicit in the very way in which the “problem” is named and described’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ang, 1999</xref>: 8–9). ‘The distinctive intellectual currency and social utility of cultural studies research lies’, according to Ang, ‘in its capacity for inducing conjunctural questioning, rather than providing positivist answers to set questions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">1999</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>We agree with this prescription for an intellectual and institutional practice of cultural studies dedicated to developing what Ang calls more ‘relevant’ forms of ‘applied humanities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">1999</xref>: 3) or, in her 2006 article, more ‘engaged’ forms of ‘cultural research’. And policy work – like that conducted by the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI; the original audience for and initial publisher of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ang’s 1999</xref> essay) or the Centre for Cultural Research at UWS – certainly provides one productive site for this type of collaborative praxis. Drawing on our experiences in building and institutionalizing a community-engaged (or ‘mode 2’) cultural studies graduate program, however, we are left with several questions, all of which can be traced through the figure of Ang’s hairdresser. Positioned as a stand-in for the ‘general public’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">1999</xref>: 1), this unnamed figure indexes a desire to effect social change by speaking with non-academic audiences constituted in and across diverse public spheres. But the local figure of the hairdresser can represent this imaginary of the soon-to-be mobilized general public only after being evacuated of any sociological particularity, geographical specificity, or psychological interiority. This quite traditional understanding of both the public (as a potentially receptive audience abstracted of particularity) and the public sphere (as an undetermined site freed of any barriers to participation) is all the more surprising since it contradicts Ang’s own insight into how the historical production of new knowledge-making geographies has facilitated equally new and collaborative forms of cross-sectoral cultural praxis. In the absence of any dialogue or discussion, we cannot assume that Ang’s hairdresser is not a university-trained knowledge worker, or that the salon itself does not double as an art gallery or performance site or meeting space for community activists. Nor can we assume that the hairdresser would be readily sympathetic with academics who work with students and policy-makers to ‘[open] up new questions rather than providing answers to existing ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ang, 1999</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>Our point in making these observations is not to accuse Ang of neglecting the issues of social class and cultural privilege that are clearly present in the scene with which her article begins. We don’t think that this is the source of the problem, either here or elsewhere in the literature on cultural studies. Instead, we want to pursue the implications of her call for more ‘relevant’ and ‘applied’ forms of cultural studies – forms that more tightly and heterogeneously link critique and practice – by suggesting that any effective response to that call needs to transform what cultural studies does and how it is institutionalized. This transformation cannot rely simply on developing and deploying the types of post-positivist critical thinking skills that enable students, activists, and policy-makers to open new questions and formulate better problems. These skills are essential, but they need to be supplemented by competences oriented toward practices and collaborations that are appropriate for forms of culture work across diverse sectors, including the higher education sector as one among many potential sites of cultural praxis. For this reason, our answer to the question posed by our interim chancellor is necessarily prosaic: the reason someone might want a degree in cultural studies is because that person wants to hone the skills and competences that will enable them to do better culture work across diverse sectors. But we also recognize that this answer is convincing only if it invites three obvious follow-up questions: (1) How are local constituencies and practice sites best engaged as potential collaborators in cultural studies scholarship? (2) How do the pragmatics of collaborative knowledge production shape what is recognized and rewarded as scholarship in the academy? (3) What skills and competences will an education in cultural studies hone in its students and practitioners? In order to address these more pragmatic questions, we shift now from a focus on the dangers involved in the institutionalization of cultural studies and toward our experiences with three instances of cultural studies as a form of place-based scholarship-in-action. While our findings are necessarily limited to the specifics of our ongoing projects, our intent is to index a non-affirmative cultural studies, one that can link the utopian and critical pasts of cultural studies to better academic and non-academic futures.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367877911422293">
<title>‘So you want to rent the space?’</title>
<p>As we have developed forms of cultural studies that engage with diverse types of community partners, we have been reminded time and again of the ways in which existing structures and strategies for university–community collaboration reinforce and amplify uneven power dynamics. These dynamics have manifested themselves early in our experience, often in the initial contacts we have made with community-based organizations. One brief example occurred in the context of a year-long faculty and staff development project we undertook in 2004–5, ‘Placing the Humanities: New Locales, New Meanings’. Funded by the University of Washington’s (UW) Simpson Center for the Humanities, ‘Placing the Humanities’ involved a core group of faculty and staff drawn from two UW campuses and two community colleges in the Seattle region. We came together to explore new ways of engaging with local geographies of knowledge production that extended beyond our classrooms, offices, departments, and professional organizations. Over a series of two-day workshops held during the year, this core group worked at and with a number of different sites, including a tribal cultural resources division, a literary arts center, and a community-access television station. The workshops invited faculty and staff to step out of their accustomed roles as expert consultants, just as they encouraged community partners to see themselves as active collaborators who can shape exchanges among community organizations and institutions of higher education. Nonetheless, the ease of falling back into familiar patterns of university–community partnership was striking. The executive director at one community-based media organization we initially approached with an eye to collaborating on ‘Placing the Humanities’ listened politely as we described our interest in forging new ways of working together, and then replied matter-of-factly, ‘So you want to rent the space?’</p>
<p>This question makes sense. Community-based organizations often receive requests from universities to partner with faculty, staff, and students in only the most superficial or expedient ways. This tendency has been exacerbated over the past decade by an increased emphasis among funding agencies on campus–community partnerships as a part of any grant proposal. While these mandates may be well-intentioned, they do not necessarily result in revisions of conventional (‘mode 1’) research design or pedagogical practice. Consequently, university groups often approach community-based organizations only after the goals of a project have been solidified. Collaboration quickly becomes a zero-sum negotiation; ‘rent’ is exchanged for ‘real-world’ experience; and volunteer labor compensates for instruction ‘in the community’ as organizations are trained to seek tangible, short-term benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877911422293">Joseph, 2002</xref>). Similarly, community-based organizations often play the same game by treating universities as depositories of credibility and expertise that can be mobilized to address specific issues or to solve certain problems. These benefits (publicity, money, volunteers, credibility, and expertise) are important, especially for community-based organizations with limited spare time, staff, and funding. But cross-sectoral partnerships based only on short-term and contractual goals will not develop the generative capacity to transform unequal relations of exchange. They may even reify the university–community distinction by replicating uneven power dynamics in the very name of ‘outreach’ or ‘engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877911422293">Jay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877911422293">Sanchez, 2005</xref>). These failures are further amplified when participation in campus–community projects reproduces structural inequalities by carrying with it an often racialized sense of <italic>noblesse oblige</italic> on the part of the ‘privileged’ college student or researcher ‘serving’ the ‘needy’ in the ‘community’. While many universities claim to have moved beyond these negative dynamics in their ‘town–gown’ relationships, few have succeeded in blurring the fundamental distinction between the ‘campus’ and the ‘community’. These structural relationships lead to a de facto renting of the ‘community’ as it is imagined by the ‘university’ (or the ‘university’ as it is imagined by the ‘community’), thus flattening the very real distinctions within local geographies of knowledge production both on and off campuses.</p>
<p>Cultural studies scholars know all of this, of course. One of the great strengths of the field is the attention it pays to the complex and uneven relations among institutions, organizations, and individuals as they travel through and shape social and cultural space. The question is how to link this theoretical and descriptive knowledge about culture to transformative forms of cultural praxis. To this end, we shift now to one instance of an ongoing collaboration that moves beyond clearly defined roles that perform additive tasks within a contractual framework. The collaboration involves UW Bothell and Tent City 4 (TC4), a homeless encampment in the Bothell suburbs modeled after a successful Tent City located within the Seattle city limits. Tent Cities take on different forms in different local circumstances, but they share a commitment to providing temporary shelter for residents, while also serving as vehicles for enhancing public education and community awareness about the politics of homelessness. In the Seattle area, Tent Cities are self-regulating, consensus-led cooperatives of people experiencing homelessness, capable of housing up to 100 individuals at a time. They provide physical shelter, a sense of emergent community, and far greater freedom of movement than typical night shelters. In May of 2004, TC4 was created by two local organizations, the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort (SHARE) and the Women’s Housing Equality and Enhancement League (WHEEL), to provide these resources to homeless people on the eastside of Lake Washington, the largely suburban region east and north of the Seattle city limits where the UW Bothell campus is located. After the county chose the city of Bothell as the site for TC4, a number of residents began to protest its location and eventually its very existence. Meetings of the city council became highly contentious, with audience members engaging in shouting matches with both the council and those testifying on behalf of TC4.</p>
<p>The collaboration between UW Bothell and TC4 started small. In the months immediately following TC4’s inception, an undergraduate student in one of our courses wrote (and subsequently published) her senior seminar research paper on the discourse utilized by those resisting the initial placement of TC4 in Bothell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911422293">Lersch, 2005</xref>). The following year, students in one of our senior seminars developed a relationship as a whole with TC4, distributed the earlier student’s paper to those living in TC4 and then held discussions at the site, which had since moved (as it must, by law, every three months) to a neighboring suburb. In those initial discussions, the relationship began to morph into a generative partnership. TC4 residents made it clear that the best ‘service’ students could provide would be to spread the word about TC4, its organizing principles, and the reality of homelessness in the eastside suburbs as counter-discourses to those deployed by their opponents. Students responded by inviting residents of TC4 to speak at several different events on campus, thus utilizing their own social connections. Students in the seminar then chose to dedicate their final day of class, which typically serves as an opportunity to celebrate the conclusion of their undergraduate education, to invite their friends and family to participate in another discussion at TC4, thus spreading the word further through their own social and personal networks. As the collaboration grew, students across a variety of classes continued to collaborate with TC4 by organizing local pools of volunteers to help with the logistically challenging moves of the group, creating a website for SHARE/WHEEL’s annual fundraising auction, and holding jewelry-making workshops and other well-received events at TC4 itself. In the summer of 2007, three years after the initial steps were taken toward collaboration, residents of TC4 joined participants in the University of Washington’s Summer Institute in the Arts and Humanities in a participatory action research project exploring the concepts of home, neighbor, and community. Working together to tell their personal stories, students and residents created a documentary film and an art installation designed to travel to communities ahead of TC4’s arrival in order to educate neighborhood residents about TC4 and to open a broader dialogue around these key concepts.</p>
<p>The ongoing evolution of these interwoven forms of cultural work could not have been imagined whole-cloth in a single meeting between faculty members and residents of TC4 at the initiation of the relationship. Community-based organizations, ranging from regional affiliates of national organizations such as the YMCA to grassroots projects like TC4, bring to their partnerships with universities a wide variety of resources, knowledges, experiences, political perspectives, and social networks. In the case of TC4, activists and residents shared with students and faculty members an emerging understanding of community-based and participatory forms of action research that profoundly shaped the process throughout. This re-theorization of academic research as aligned with local activism developed in tandem with a re-conceptualization of activism as a research- and teaching-based activity. The collaboration process mapped the particular strengths and resources of both TC4 residents and UW students. Their strengths and resources included social networks of friends and family, religious and secular organizational memberships, professional and volunteer affiliations, and individual skills that ranged from photographic and film-making expertise to activist training to the ability to connect through shared histories and experiences of homelessness and poverty. At the same time, significant turnover has taken place among the TC4 residents and UW students. This turnover is a positive sign for both TC4, since its mission is to provide temporary shelter for homeless people, and the UW, since its goal is to graduate students, but it also results in a constant rotation of leadership within the partnership. Adapting to this reality, the students and faculty members have learned much about democratic forms of cultural praxis from TC4’s insistence on consensus as the organizing principle. Rather than viewing turnover and consensus-based processes as destabilizing forces for cross-sectoral partnership, they emerged as indicators of the strength of TC4 as a collaborator. TC4 became for the students – and in their social and professional networks – a resilient and democratic community in the process of formation, rather than the deficit-ridden group of individuals it was portrayed to be in mainstream local media outlets and city council debates.</p>
<p>As in other university–community partnerships, this particular collaboration raises the question of how cultural studies practitioners can help university and community actors to work together, leaving behind the model where agencies rent students as volunteer workers (even workers who ‘learn’ from the ‘experience’), universities rent agencies as brokers of clients with whom to put students in contact (even when those agencies benefit from unpaid student labor), and faculty members rent communities as sites of research (even when that research is published to progressive ends within academic and professional fields). An even more difficult question may be how cultural studies practitioners can remain in those emerging networks of research- and teaching-based cultural praxis when conflicts arise. We all know that universities are complex organisms with many sub-units, ranging from large and small academic departments to research and writing centers to various student organizations. And most of us are familiar with the ways in which any given university’s engagement activities can be fraught with implicit and explicit forms of political and financial calculation. University administrations often need to choose between supporting collaborative projects with organizations involved with the dispossessed or cultivating projects developed with socially sanctioned agencies that garner much applause and little controversy. And they sometimes face situations where a partnership with one organization (a research project involving a workers’ rights cooperative or an activist independent media project) comes into conflict with a partnership with another (an effort to secure internships through a local business or mainstream media outlet). Responses to these dilemmas are necessarily situational. But we are confident in asserting that truly generative and reciprocal partnerships need to develop in innovative, mutually constitutive ways. There is simply no substitute for time given to becoming acquainted with each others’ complementary or contradictory decision-making processes, motivations, and guiding philosophies. Nor is there a substitute for time dedicated to theorizing writing and testing new languages designed to embody and make visible these emerging formations of partnership, reciprocity, and praxis.</p>

<title>‘Sounds good, but I need to work on my book’</title>
<p>If relationships with community partners constitute one side of the equation for university-based practitioners of a non-affirmative cultural studies, then there can be little doubt that relationships with the university and its sub-units constitute the other side. As we have developed our collective understanding of cultural studies as a form of place-based scholarship in action, we have seen the task of publishing our work as central to our role as academic researchers and teachers. We need, after all, to shift what is recognized and rewarded as scholarship if we are going to make this type of work viable, for ourselves and for others. To this end, we have presented our findings on conference panels and in keynote addresses; we have run workshops and served as program reviewers; we have published articles that have appeared in venues ranging from quarterly newsletters to peer-reviewed journals. We have even created a collective curricula vitae which we, along with our other collaborators, have submitted with our individual vitae as part of merit review processes in our academic units. While the responses we have received to this activity have been generally positive, we have also encountered a consistent reaction of enthusiasm followed by hesitation. Some of our colleagues have embraced the idea of praxis-oriented forms of cultural studies (‘sounds good’), but then backed off a deeper engagement by deferring to their own intellectual and professional commitments (‘but I need to work on my book’). Others have warned those of us who are on the tenure-track but not yet tenured, or even tenured but not yet promoted to the rank of full professor, that we ‘should wait to do this kind of work’. Still others have listened to our descriptions of our projects and responded with comments along these lines: ‘Wow! And what are you working on?’ or ‘Great! How do you find any time for your work?’ The statements differ, but the central concern is clear: the metrics used to assess scholarly activities consistently mis-measure the activities and accomplishments that are central to collaborative, cross-sectoral, and community-engaged forms of scholarship. Our point here is not that our colleagues who write books (as some of us do) or publish in professional journals (as all of us do) are misguided. But we do question the formal and informal norms that shape the concern with and confusion about what does and does not, should and should not, count as academic scholarship and professional development.</p>
<p>In pursuing this question, we are not alone. Ernest Boyer’s well-known writings from the early and mid 1990s mark one renewed starting-point in the ongoing attempt to articulate and value forms of scholarship that extend beyond traditional, ‘basic’, or ‘mode 1’ research activities, all of which Boyer labeled the ‘scholarship of discovery’ and placed alongside three other ‘scholarships’: ‘integration’, ‘application’, and ‘teaching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911422293">Boyer, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911422293">1997</xref>). In the health disciplines, Community–Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH) has extended Boyer’s insights by developing assessment tools for community-engaged scholarship, a category that the CCPH’s 2005 report of the Commission on Community-Engaged Scholarship in the Health Professions defines as including diverse forms of research and teaching activity in the context of any ‘mutually beneficial partnership with the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911422293">2005</xref>: 12). Similar definitional work has been undertaken in the cultural disciplines by a team of researchers at Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life. Co-authored by Julie Ellison and Tim Eatman, <italic>Scholarship in Public: Knowledge Creation and Tenure Policy at the Engaged University</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911422293">2008</xref>: 1–2) describes a ‘continuum of scholarship’ that ‘gives public engagement full and equal standing’, and recommends policy changes designed to recognize and reward publications aimed at academic and non-academic audiences, to create more capacious career and professional development pathways for graduate students and faculty members, and to generate assessment criteria capable of evaluating publicly engaged scholarship on its own terms. The obvious point of these policy recommendations is to expand what counts as scholarship, both in and beyond the cultural disciplines. Applied specifically to cultural studies, the enactment of these policies would surface activities that have shaped the field from the start. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877911422293">Ann Gray (2003)</xref>, for example, recounts the long history of the University of Birmingham’s Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) in similar terms. While the CCCS is best known today for its exportable brand (‘the Birmingham School’), widely disseminated terms of art (articulation, conjuncture, interpellation, difference, hegemony), and internal divisions (race and gender), it focused much of its day-to-day energy on critical pedagogy and engaged forms of culture work that traveled across the city of Birmingham and West Midlands region, including the collaborative place-based research projects the CCCS supported.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to present these two modes of cultural studies scholarship, the ‘book’ and the ‘collaboration’ or ‘project,’ as mutually incompatible. Like the authors of the <italic>Scholarship in Public</italic>, we prefer to think in terms of a continuum of scholarship that includes activities that focus on knowledge created through an active and ongoing engagement with local projects in the world. But we do want to emphasize that the second mode of knowledge production may necessitate a shift in how we approach culture as an object of study, as well as an adjustment in how we disseminate our research. The second of our three ongoing projects, a participatory action research project that focuses on the role of arts and cultural practice in social service program development and evaluation, addresses this shift. The community center that hosts the project engages local residents across multiple age groups and ethnic backgrounds in programming and events designed to empower children and adults who are stigmatized as different, while also providing human services for all persons. As it has grown and become a resource for new immigrants in the region, the center has generated controversy about everyday cultural practices. The symbols and activities related to sustaining and prizing multicultural identities have been perceived as both enhancing and threatening to longtime residents of the region. Officials in one of the local city governments have been offended by someone answering the phone at the center ‘with an accent’ and voicemail options offered first in Spanish, then in English. Hate crimes have increased in local high schools and white middle-class families have moved out of one apartment complex near a local elementary school as Spanish-speaking families have moved in. Yet the same elementary school houses a highly-valued bilingual education program, one that is nurtured by shared family leadership drawn across class and ethnic divisions. English-only speaking adults have been turned away from the center’s over-subscribed free Spanish-language classes and even the McDonald’s drive-through in a nearby business park now advertises its menu in Spanish and English.</p>
<p>To assert that culture in this local conjuncture is a site of hegemonic struggle over the practices of everyday life is to confirm a useful truism of cultural studies. This is the view from afar. Up close and in the context of our research conducted with the center, culture also operates as a means of participant engagement, a catalyst for community formation, and a mechanism to ensure collective empowerment over the center’s programs and mission. Based on a relationship entering its fifth year, stakeholders at the center asked us to help them collect information, stories, and artifacts in preparation for a move to a new site several blocks away. Again, one of our senior seminars allowed us to respond to this request. Students in the seminar formed research teams that worked on evaluation projects involving three different programs: a play-and-learn program for young children and their caregivers; a multicultural and multilingual program for school-age children; and an English-language program for adults. Like the engagement with Tent City 4, each of these projects challenged students and community participants to think of themselves as collaborative research partners. In relation to the multicultural and multilingual after-school program, for instance, undergraduates partnered with children by using visual, written, and oral forms of documentation (photographs, written narratives, drawings, and shared storytelling) to represent and reflect upon themselves and their sense of place. The projects provided participants with a sense of ownership concerning future directions of the center by building the research skills necessary to become involved in all phases of the program evaluation process: deciding what the research questions should be; developing appropriate methods to address those questions; conducting the research itself; interpreting the results of the research; implementing changes to the center’s programming; beginning the process anew. At the same time, the UW Bothell students learned the important lesson that meaningful evaluation practices need to be shaped to the local needs and strengths of participants. At the end of this phase of the ongoing collaboration, they shared a portfolio of their work with center staff and participants, and presented their findings at a regional academic conference. Two of the students in the original seminar have continued to work at the center, first as volunteers and later as staff members, partnering with new cohorts of students in participatory and arts-based projects.</p>
<p>We don’t want to overstate the efficacy of these local and place-based forms of cultural studies. We remain deeply aware of their limitations and of the need to balance the view from afar (culture as a generalized site of hegemonic struggle) and the view up close (culture as a local practice of engagement, reflection, and action). This dual vision is especially important in an environment where campus–community research and teaching partnerships can easily morph into a volunteerism that provides cover for neoliberal policies intended to reduce government services. George Sanchez puts a point on the latter concern in a discussion of service-learning and community partnerships at the University of Southern California: ‘How do we confront the possibility that our very acts of service delay the time when the larger society would have to confront the embedded inequalities in education and government services?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877911422293">2005</xref>: 14). Sanchez’s question serves as a challenge to any facile equation of community engagement with positive social change. We accept this challenge, though we hear in the question not a call for moral self-reflection, but a demand for better research and assessment. We need to design research and teaching projects that assess when and where those projects challenge the status quo and when and where they perpetuate inequality and oppression. And we need to acknowledge that there are seldom clear dividing lines between activities that enhance social equality and activities that merely bandage a festering social wound. In the local instance of the center, these general needs become more nuanced. We need to know for whom the center is welcoming and vibrant, for whom it is off-putting and sterile, and who counts as its ‘stakeholders’. To these ends, children and youth, along with their caregivers, can become agents and collaborators in research that generates shared understandings and facilitates a more equitable distribution of authority and expertise. Creative practices such as photography, drawing, writing, and speech can access and document knowledges that otherwise resist being reported or tend to be reduced to convention. Beneath these practices lies a theoretical question familiar to all researchers: How do we know? Across their surface lies another, less familiar question: With and for whom do we produce knowledge?</p>
<p>This second question concerning the production and circulation of knowledge returns us to the issue of how we disseminate our research. As cultural studies scholarship moves across different institutional and intellectual formations (a university campus and a community center in this case), its forms of publication need to correspond to its sites of intervention. This much seems obvious. One does not present a scholarly monograph when asked to produce a program evaluation for a local non-profit, just as one does not submit a program evaluation written for a local non-profit to an academic journal. In each case, the (mis)match reflects differences in the forms of intelligibility and the norms of reception that structure each sector, though not necessarily differences in either the research activities themselves or the theories that inform them. In neither case does it suggest any judgment concerning the inherent merits of one form of dissemination over another. What is less certain is how universities will respond to research projects, in cultural studies or elsewhere, that move laterally across academic and non-academic sectors. The traditional response is to isolate one vertically integrated sector of the university – a Department of English or Communications, for example – and to assume that its professional organizations, disciplinary journals, scholarly presses, and systems of peer review will answer all questions concerning merit and value, including questions concerning the form that scholarship should take. The challenge is to counter this response by generating criteria that can assess scholarly projects that move laterally across vertically integrated sectors and take on different forms as they engage those sectors. These lateral projects correspond to what Boyer called the scholarships of ‘integration’ and ‘application’; we prefer to think of them as the scholarships of interdisciplinarity and intersectorality. In either case, they point to the necessity of developing more integrated forms of professional evaluation, for tenure and promotion among other things, that can make visible and valuable within universities the continuum of research activities and scholarly publications that typically emerge from projects and collaborations that transcend single disciplines and engage non-university partners.</p>

<title>‘That’s great. Students who don’t get jobs can do something else’</title>
<p>Along with community-based partners and university-based faculty and staff, students are the third critical element within any campus–community partnership. They too have been a focus of our conversations. The comment that stands out for us occurred in a discussion with a colleague about our Master of Arts in Cultural Studies. After hearing a description of the mission and curriculum of the program, including one core course on ‘cultural studies as collaboration’, she excitedly responded, ‘That’s great. Students who don’t get jobs can do something else.’ Clearly, our colleague was excited about the program’s educational emphasis on cross-sectoral forms of cultural praxis, along with the prospect of preparing graduate students for professional and life pathways beyond faculty positions at research-intensive universities. Yet she remained rhetorically committed to the term we have come to think of as the keyword of these conversations: ‘job’. Here and elsewhere, the term names the horizon of academic apprenticeship (‘do something else’ – something other than what ‘we’ do), even as it points toward an aspiration to nurture practices that transcend that horizon (‘that’s great’ – to do something other than what ‘we’ do). The result is a form of vocational thinking that focuses, either approvingly or disapprovingly, on the task of reproducing one narrow career pathway for any student of culture. In this sense, our colleague’s response reversed our interim chancellor’s skepticism about the practicality of cultural studies: ‘Why would anyone want a degree in cultural studies?’ Where our colleague expressed support for a program that educated students to ‘do something else’, our interim chancellor worried that the program’s graduates wouldn’t be educated to do anything at all. Yet the two responses share a common sense understanding of educational development that treats students as apprentices within professional guilds. As the labor market is perceived as tightening within the guild, the pressure increases on apprentices (and their masters) to focus more intensely and exclusively on the craft skills required for success (a ‘job’) in that guild.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877911422293">Chris Newfield (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422293">Marc Bousquet (2008)</xref> have observed, this approach to educational and professional development reflects a tendency to treat markets (for goods, services, or jobs) as objective realities rather than social systems of exchange and negotiation that are shaped through policy agendas, management decisions, and craft and labor organizing, among other factors. With regard to cultural studies, it also misses the factor that we have presented as critical: the emergence of cross-sectoral forms and networks of cultural praxis that breach the boundaries of traditional academic guilds and ways of knowing. This oversight, in turn, risks supporting familiar claims about the ‘rigor’ of various programs of study, another keyword related to educational and professional development. Like ‘job’, ‘rigor’ references implicit assumptions about the pedagogical aims of the cultural disciplines and their knowledge-making machinery. It provides a very rough and flexible metric that leaves unexamined the basic premise that prestige and recognition result from a systematic way of reading the world as a legible text, and the expectation that the best students continue that tradition. That is, after all, what a practitioner of cultural studies is presumed to be and do, through either ethnographic or textual forms of inquiry. This premise implies that certain pedagogical practices, and not others, should occur in serious programs or classrooms as we prepare undergraduate and graduate students for the long and arduous path to academic success. We certainly don’t have time to play around since only the persistent, the compulsive, and the intellectually gifted ultimately make it. If this is the case, then any new or emergent knowledge-making practice or pedagogy runs the risk of being seen as a temporary diversion, a risky detour, or a renegade operation. This accusation has often been launched at interdisciplinary programs and courses: they are merely ‘broad’, neither ‘serious’ nor ‘deep.’ Cross-sectoral programs and courses, lateral work across vertically integrated university and non-university knowledge-making sites, are perhaps even more vulnerable to this logic. It will only be a matter of time, the guardians of the disciplines reassure themselves, before we get back to serious work. No doubt the job market will provide the requisite discipline, both on and off campus.</p>
<p>Yet it may be that we need more play, not less, if we are serious about the task of preparing students for cross-sectoral forms of cultural praxis. At least that is the lesson we have drawn from the third of our three engagement projects. Founded in 2004, the Empty Suitcase Theater Company (ESTC) is an arts research collaborative, made up of UW Bothell students, staff, and faculty members, along with members of the surrounding community. Over its short lifetime, the ESTC has developed an identifiable set of practices that work at the interstices of art and research with the goal of creating original performances and training students in the generative skills of creativity and play that are critical to any form of engaged cultural work. Drawn from the theories of Augusto Boal, Rudolf Laban, Anna Halprin, and Anne Bogart, among many others, these practices focus on the power of arts-making and arts-based research to open up new models of inquiry, collaboration, and exchange. Like the Surrealists’ games, the Situationists’ <italic>dérive</italic>, the Judson Street Church Movement’s work on ordinary movement, and Butoh artists’ investigation of perception, the ESTC’s collaboration processes are designed to break open perceptual thinking, enhance creativity, and challenge normalizing or static forms of collectivity. Each of these innovations uses play as a reframing device designed to develop new capacities for cross-sectoral work in all participants. Games encourage exploration through the use of role-play and chance; situations produce new encounters with communities and environs through small shifts in everyday practice; studies encourage critical approaches to remapping interior space and the relationship to the environment as ways of initiating new spheres of activity and affect. In each instance, practices of arts- and culture-making activate forms of individual and collective agency that access and rely upon mutable sensory fields. These practices widen the perceptual field, recalibrate what we call observation and theory, and prepare students for new research and community engagement activities across multiple sectors (such as education or health) and areas of concern (such as diversity or the environment).</p>
<p>During its first two years, the ESTC developed these practices through a series of performances collectively named <italic>The Bus Chronicles</italic>. These performances emerged from stories ESTC members recounted or collected about riding buses, either around the Seattle region or elsewhere. Buses appeared in these stories as provisional spaces of community formation. As part of its method, the ESTC supplemented this (auto)ethnographic work with historical research on the relations between buses and democratic collective action: the 1955 story of Rosa Parks’s seminal act of civil disobedience; the Montgomery (United States) and Alexandra (South Africa) bus boycotts of the 1950s; the Freedom Rides of the 1960s; disability activists’ interventions in the 1970s and 1980s demanding accessible public transportation; and the Migrant Worker Freedom Rides in 2003. Local historical research further thickened the subsequent performances as students accessed and archived documents about how the region in which they live and work has been shaped by white flight from public school busing in the early 1970s and, more recently, by the arrival of new immigrants unable to afford housing in the re-gentrified urban core. These complex and overlapping stories and histories appeared in <italic>The Bus Chronicles</italic> as plot lines, monologues, gestures, visual and audio backdrops, and physical stagings. As the performances themselves moved (from the campus to a local art walk to Kent State University to a theater festival in Arezzo, Italy), ESTC members collected more stories from audience members, creating a performance-based feedback loop not unlike the collaborative program evaluation processes developed at the community center: research led to performance which led to new research discoveries, revised performances, and so on. Across the performances that made up <italic>The Bus Chronicles</italic>, an understanding of buses as metaphorical <italic>and</italic> physical sites for contesting and reinstating democratic collective action emerged. Stories and histories of micro-communities on the move challenged fixed notions of community, blurring lines of class, gender, race, and disability even as those divisions became focal points for dialogue and debate about the pasts, presents, and futures of the region.</p>
<p><italic>The Bus Chronicles</italic> shares with the projects developed with TC4 and the community center a commitment to arts- and culture-based modes of working together as an important means of community engagement and cultural development. But it also reveals the ways in which practices of arts- and culture-making can be central to the acquisition of a set of skills and competences that exceeds the textual and ethnographic training generally required for apprenticeship in the cultural disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877911422293">4</xref></sup> The community-engaged and practice-oriented approach to cultural studies we have described necessitates that we (students, staff, and faculty) shuttle between multiple learning spaces and sites of engagement, on and off university campuses. In turn, this shuttling requires that we develop new habits of knowledge-making that respond to the particularities of diverse spaces and sites. In order to advance this type of work, students (and staff and faculty) need to develop a rich toolkit: collaboration skills that are flexible and adaptive to different situations and expectations; creative and critical approaches to problem solving that do not always subordinate means to ends; documentation practices that can move across textual, visual, performance, and media-based modes. <italic>The Bus Chronicles</italic> sought to meet these learning objectives through creativity and play. As the students and their collaborators wrestled with the history of the region through the metaphor of the bus and the realities of busing, they integrated personal stories and collective history through the use of everyday reference points. As they forged the resulting performances, they learned that the ability to work with elements of play, chance, and imagination can be central to generating an emergent sense of community-in-the-making. The emphasis on developing embodied practices that link thinking and doing encourages students to approach critique as a form of action and making as a form of theory, while also allowing unanticipated discoveries to emerge in the process. These types of pedagogical innovations allow us to treat the contemporary moment in which the horizon of culture is disappearing neither as a threat to cultural studies nor as a triumph of neoliberal forms of expediency, but as an opportunity to reclaim the centrality of culture to the labor of creating more robust and cross-sectoral forms of democratic praxis.</p>

<title>Between the volcano and the community center</title>
<p>By focusing in this article on research and teaching projects that engage with Tent City 4, a local community center, and the Empty Suitcase Theater Company, we may seem to have traveled far from the Marcuse essay – and the Frankfurt School genealogy of cultural studies – with which we began. Like his collaborators, Marcuse’s thinking about what he called non-affirmative culture tended to become alternately utopian and critical, invoking as a counterpoint to affirmative culture ‘dancing on the volcano’, even as it worried about the refiguration of that utopia as an uncritical ‘transformation of the earth into a gigantic community center’. In partial contrast, the experiences and projects that we have drawn upon and documented in this article have led us to theorize more pragmatic and situated forms of cultural studies praxis, and to suggest that a non-affirmative cultural studies ought to hone in its students, staff, faculty, and community partners the capacity to work collaboratively to develop new spaces and temporalities for a cultural studies scholarship capable of reconfiguring the relations among diverse and otherwise vertically integrated organizational sectors. Does this mean, to return to Marcuse’s metaphors, that we need to choose between the ‘volcano’ and the ‘community center’? Our answer is clearly no. Like the tasks of writing powerful and persuasive academic essays, reading and discussing critical theory, and preparing graduate students to become future faculty, those of directing or participating in a performance group, coordinating projects with a grassroots organization, building and sustaining a local community center, and reshaping the institutional requirements of graduate education all require specific skills and competences that need to be nurtured, developed, assessed, and refined. An affirmative cultural studies asks us to choose between these two sets of tasks, between the skill sets that contribute to their successful completion, and between the ‘campus’ and the ‘community’ as practice sites. A non-affirmative cultural studies creates an alternative rhythm for our scholarship. It suggests that we – a ‘we’ that can emerge only within praxis-oriented collaborations embedded in specific historical conjunctures and knowledge geographies – can and ought to do both.</p>

<p>The four co-authors are all members of a multi-year collaboration of faculty and staff at academic and non-academic educational institutions in the Seattle metropolitan region. The long-term goals of the collaboration are to generate and disseminate new research on the multiple locations of the arts and humanities, to initiate and institutionalize curricular innovation across the four campuses listed above, and to build and develop arts and cultural pathways for community-engaged research and teaching. While the primary authors of this article are Bruce Burgett, Kanta Kochhar-Lindgren, Ron Krabill, and Elizabeth Thomas, it is best understood as an outgrowth of the ongoing work of the collaboration as a whole.</p>

<p>In her use of <italic>The New Production of Knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911422293">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ang (1999)</xref> both draws on and modifies the findings of Gibbons and his collaborators. Two of these modifications are significant to the translation of those findings to discussions of cultural studies. First, <italic>The New Production of Knowledge</italic> does not equate cross-sectoral research partnerships with more democratized or egalitarian distributions of knowledge-making resources and capacities. On the contrary, the authors predict that knowledge practices will become less democratic and more monopolistic as major players across sectors form partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911422293">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>: 165). While Gibbon et al. cast this sociological possibility as an inevitability, practitioners of cultural studies should see it as a challenge to build more equitable partnerships. Second, <italic>The New Production of Knowledge</italic> devotes only one chapter to culture, suggests that the humanities will begin to intersect more complexly with ‘culture industries’ and ‘image industries’, and misidentifies cultural studies as an outgrowth of literary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911422293">1994</xref>: 90–110). While this argument replays several commonplaces about cultural studies, it misses the movement of the field across a wide array of disciplines and sectors by seeing the humanities as its academic location and the culture and image industries as its primary sites of non-academic practice.</p>

<p>We could state this point more strongly by suggesting that the contradiction in fact determines the generic conventions of the critical literature. Spurred by the rapid and largely unanticipated institutionalization of cultural studies as a field in the US academy in the early 1990s, skeptical commentators ranging from Stuart Hall and Alan O’Connor to Gayatri Spivak and Kuan-Hsing Chen provided the genre with its contours as they debated the limitations of the ‘Americanization’ of cultural studies, often using the 1990 Crossroads conference held at the University of Illinois and the resulting anthology, <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877911422293">Grossberg et al., 1991</xref>), as their starting-point. Within these debates, three enduring and interlinked lines of argumentation emerged. The first critiques the professionalization of cultural studies in the US academy by contrasting it to the emphasis on organic intellectual work – and the figure of the organic intellectual – in British cultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877911422293">Hall, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877911422293">O’Connor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877911422293">Pfister, 1991</xref>); the second focuses on the failure of Anglo-American versions of cultural studies to respond to the internationalization of the field beyond the UK and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911422293">Ang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422293">Chen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877911422293">Spivak, 1993</xref>); the third argues for a situated and activist version of cultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422293">Ang, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911422293">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877911422293">Tomaselli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877911422293">Wright, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877911422293">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877911422293">2003</xref>). One can still hear these arguments rehearsed every two years at the biennial Crossroads of Cultural Studies conference. For our purposes in this article and in the institutional work that it reflects and documents, the third line of argumentation is the most valuable since it opens onto a version of cultural studies centered on local and translocal forms of praxis that do not locate the university as the primary site of knowledge creation.</p>

<p>One symptom of this unspoken assumption concerning the training required for work in the cultural disciplines, including cultural studies, is the difficulty of finding overviews of cultural studies research practices that explicitly engage with arts- or performance-based methods. Otherwise excellent books by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877911422293">Ann Gray (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877911422293">Paula Szarko (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877911422293">Richard Johnson et al. (2004)</xref> introduce students to a mixture of methods, including ethnography and autoethnography, textual and archival research, and some elements of political economy. This range of research orientations is bracketed on one side by the quantitative and experimental approaches typical of the non-qualitative social and natural sciences and, on the other, by the arts- and performance-based approaches typical of performance studies and other fields focused on practices of arts- and culture-making. Powerful arguments for the integration of performance and arts-based research methods into cultural studies research practices have been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911422293">Dwight Conquergood (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911422293">Manthia Diawara (1992)</xref>, among many others, though those arguments are too seldom central to debates about field formations in cultural studies.</p>
