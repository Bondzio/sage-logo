<abstract>
<p>A key feature of India’s economic transformation has been a change in the nature of diets. There is a move away from inferior to superior foods and a substitution of traditional staples by primary food products, reflected in higher consumption of proteins, sugars, fats and vegetables. As part of this dietary transition, our analysis focuses on the pervasiveness of eating out and is based on a rich household survey for 2005. We broadly confirm the important role of urbanization, demographic changes, expansion of the middle class and its growing affluence on eating out. Since even more deprived sections are not immune to these evolving dietary patterns and given their limited access to medical care, health outcomes may well be grim.</p>

<title>Dietary Transition</title>
<p>India is undergoing a rapid economic and demographic transformation. Since 1980 average living standards have experienced a sustained and rapid rise. The gross domestic product per capita rose by 230% – a trend rate of 4% annually. Poverty declined at an annual rate of 0.88% during 1983–94 and at a slightly lower rate of 0.77% during 1993–2005. Life expectancy has risen from 54 years to 69 years while the (crude) birth rate has fallen from 34 to 22 over the period 1980–2008. Rapid economic growth has been accompanied by rising urbanization. Between 1980 and 2000, the share of the urban population rose from 23% to 28%. By 2030, it is likely to be as high as 41%.</p>
<p>The growth momentum was accelerated by wide-ranging domestic and external liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s. A key feature of the economic transformation has been the change in the nature of the Indian diet. As the global markets integrate and communication becomes better, diet transitions are unavoidable. There is a move away from inferior to superior foods and a substitution of traditional staples by primary food products that are more prevalent in western diets. These shifts are reflected in higher consumption of proteins, sugars, fats and vegetables.</p>
<p>Some of the underlying factors include expansion of the middle class, higher female participation, emergence of nuclear two-income families, a sharp age divide in food preferences, with younger age groups more susceptible to new foods advertised in the media, and a rapid growth of supermarkets and fast-food outlets.</p>
<p>Some dietary changes observed since the 1980s (based on food and agricultural organization statistics (FAOSTAT)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909612472040">1</xref></sup>) are delineated below:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909612472040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>During the 1980s consumption of both animal and vegetable products rose sharply.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among animal products, the largest proportional increase was in the consumption of milk.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among vegetable products, there were large increases in rice, pulses, wheat, spices and oils.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>During the 1990s the pattern of food consumption changed significantly.</p>
<list id="list2-0021909612472040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There was a marked increase in the consumption of animal products – especially animal fats – but a relatively modest increase in that of vegetable products.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among the latter, there were large increases in the consumption of wheat, starchy roots, vegetable oils, sugar and sweeteners, and fruits while that of rice, pulses and other cereals declined.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among the starchy roots, potato recorded a sharp increase given its salience in energy-dense food products (e.g. fries and potato chips).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use of wheat has changed, too, as there is a move away from the traditional <italic>chapatti</italic> to more commercialized and westernized bread products.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The health implications of the dietary transition are not clear-cut. A more varied and nutritionally balanced diet and higher levels of food hygiene are associated with better health. But there is a trade-off as more energy-dense foods are linked to a higher incidence of diet-related non-communicable diseases or NCDs (e.g. diabetes, coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909612472040">2</xref></sup> Although India lags behind other developing countries in the epidemiological transition – decline in infectious disease mortality increasingly compensated for by higher mortality from chronic degenerative NCDs – there is some evidence of this transition taking place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909612472040">3</xref></sup> The estimated deaths from NCDs are projected to rise from 3.78 million in 1990 (40.46% of all deaths) to 7.63 million in 2020 (66.70% of all deaths).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909612472040">4</xref></sup> Worse, many of these deaths occur at relatively early ages. About a quarter of the deaths occurred in the 35–64 age group in urban areas.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>From this perspective we report our findings on eating out, based on an analysis of a nationwide household survey, India Human Development Survey 2005 (IHDS), conducted jointly by the University of Maryland and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER).</p>
<p>IHDS covers over 41,000 households residing in rural and urban areas, selected from 33 states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909612472040">5</xref></sup> The sample comprises 384 districts out of a total of 593 identified in the 2001 census. Villages and urban blocks constituted the primary sampling unit from which households were selected.</p>
<p>The rural sample contains about half the households that were interviewed initially by NCAER in 1993–94 in a survey entitled Human Development Profile of India (HDPI) and the other half of the sample households was drawn from both districts surveyed in HDPI as well as from districts located in the states and union territories not covered in HDPI. The original HDPI was a random sample of 33,230 households located in 16 major states, 195 districts and 1,765 villages. In states where the 1993–94 survey was conducted and re-contact details were available, 13,593 households were randomly selected for re-interview in 2005. About 82% of the households were contactable for re-interview resulting in a re-survey of 11,153 original households as well as 2,440 households which had separated from the original households but were still living in the same village.</p>
<p>In each district where re-interviews were conducted, two fresh villages were randomly selected using a probability proportional to size technique. In each village, 20 randomly selected households were selected. Additionally, 3,993 households were randomly selected from the states where the 1993–94 survey was not conducted, or where re-contact information was not available.</p>
<p>In order to draw a random sample of urban households, all urban areas in a state were listed in the order of their size with number of blocks drawn from each urban area allocated based on probability proportional to size. After determining the number of blocks, the enumeration blocks were selected randomly. From these enumeration blocks (of about 150–200 households), a complete household listing was obtained and a sample of 15 households was selected per block.</p>
<p>Comparison of IHDS data with the National Sample Survey or NSS (2004–5), National Family Health Survey III (2005–6) and census (2001) confirms the robustness of the IHDS data. For example, the IHDS sample distribution on urban residence, caste and religion is remarkably similar to the NSS and the NFHS-III, although all three surveys (IHDS, NSS and NFHS) have higher proportions of households claiming Scheduled Caste status than enumerated in the census (2001).</p>

<title>Cross Tabulations</title>
<p>Our focus is on the socio-economic status of households eating out and their spatial distribution. The latter disaggregates household locations into rural and urban areas and urban slums. A further disaggregation separates six metros from the rest. Eating out refers to meals or snacks served in restaurants, roadside eating places, tea and snack shops, and food vendors. Three sets of cross-tabulations are given below: the first focuses on location (rural, urban, urban slums, metros); the second on socio-economic characteristics of those eating out; and the third on amounts spent.</p>

In these and subsequent tables, two different types of locational classification are used: the first distinguishes metros, non-metro urban and (non-metro) rural areas; and the second distinguishes rural, urban and urban slums. As illustrated, eating out is not just a feature of metros or urban areas but also of urban slums and rural areas. Admittedly, although it is less pervasive in urban slums and rural areas, it is non-negligible. Nor is eating out a feature of affluent households only, as it is not uncommon among the poor and other deprived sections.</p>

<p>The proportion of households eating out is well above one quarter. The highest proportion is found in the six metros, followed by non-metro urban, and rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909612472040">6</xref></sup> The differences, however, are small. The differences among the metros are large, with over three-fourths of the households in Bangalore eating out, followed by Chennai, and then Mumbai. At the other extreme are Kolkatta (20.13%) and Delhi (about 25%). Another locational classification further corroborates the pervasiveness of eating out. Somewhat surprisingly, the proportion of households eating out was highest in urban slums (45.9%), followed by urban areas (35.2%) and then rural areas (27.29%).</p>
<p>As economic deprivation is highest among the scheduled tribes (STs), followed by the scheduled castes (SCs) and then other backward castes (OBCs), the cross-classification of households affiliated to these groups by whether they ate out is revealing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021909612472040">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909612472040">7</xref></sup> The proportion eating out was highest among the STs, followed by the OBCs and then others. So the convenience and cheapness of eating out are presumably inducing relatively deprived households and/or those living in deprived areas to turn to this option in large numbers. As may be noted from subsequent cross-tabulations of eating out by poverty status, we find some striking differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909612472040">8</xref></sup> In the metros, the proportion of non-poor eating out is more than five times higher than that of poor (36.73% and 7.38%, respectively). So clearly the relatively affluent display a stronger propensity to eat out. However, while it is not surprising that the proportion of non-poor eating out in non-metros is markedly lower (31.30%), that of poor is higher (13.84%). As we are unable to probe the quality and price differences, these may be key to the narrower gap between proportions of non-poor and poor eating out in non-metros.</p>

<p>Whether the decision to eat out is linked to family type – nuclear or joint – is sought to be captured in the cross-tabulation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021909612472040">Table 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909612472040">9</xref></sup> About 28% of nuclear families ate out compared with a slightly higher share of joint families. The corresponding proportion of the residual group was considerably lower (over 19%). Among those who ate out, more than 50% belonged to nuclear families and a little under half to joint families. If joint families displayed a stronger propensity to eat out, it could be in part a manifestation of diverse living arrangements (e.g. some relatives may simply live under the same roof but may not share meals).</p>

<p>One striking feature is that the proportion of households eating out rises among the three lowest expenditure ranges and then falls sharply in the highest range (&gt;Rs 1,000). Another striking result is that amounts spent vary in a somewhat complex fashion. If we consider those in extreme or moderate poverty (i.e. the first two monthly expenditure ranges), small or moderately high fractions of households spending small amounts on eating out fall sharply. In the intermediate range of monthly expenditure (Rs 500–1,000), the proportions spending small to moderate amounts is higher and a non-negligible proportion spends more than moderate amounts on eating out. In the highest expenditure range or among the relatively affluent (i.e. with a monthly per capita expenditure &gt;Rs 1,000), there is a clear progression of proportions spending larger amounts on eating out except in the highest range of eating out expenditure (&gt;Rs 500). But even in this cell, the share of the relatively affluent is non-negligible (about 7%). So the upshot is that relatively affluent are more likely to eat out as also to spend larger amounts.</p>
<p>This comes out more sharply in the sub-sample for the metros in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021909612472040">Table 6</xref>. Among the relatively affluent, for example, the proportion spending larger amounts on eating out rises from over 6% to about 18% but falls to about 12% in the highest eating out expenditure range (i.e. &gt;Rs 500).</p>
<p>To avoid cluttering the text, and to throw more light on the differences between the poor and non-poor, let us first consider the sub-sample for the metros in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0021909612472040">Table 7</xref>. While the proportion spending larger amounts on eating out decreases sharply among the poor, there is a progression among the non-poor except in the highest range of eating out expenditure. In the non-metro sub-sample, however, while the proportion of poor spending larger amounts drops sharply, it also falls among the non-poor but more slowly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0021909612472040">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<p>As monthly per capita expenditure is only a proxy for the standard of living, it is worthwhile examining linkages between eating out and castes – some of which are highly poverty prone. Two cross-tabulations are given below: one for the sub-sample for the metros and another for the non-metros (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0021909612472040">Tables 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0021909612472040">10</xref>). Two remarks are in order. One is that proportions of those eating out are not higher in all cases in the metros. While those of the SCs and OBCs are higher in the metros – especially of the latter – that of the STs is much higher in the non-metros. The second remark is that the amounts spent by each of these deprived groups – with varying degrees of deprivation – are higher in the metros. So it follows that even relatively deprived groups are not immune to changing lifestyles and dietary changes.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0021909612472040">Table 11</xref> throws light on eating out amounts in three different locations: rural, urban and urban slums. The contrast in some respects is striking. The proportions of households spending larger amounts decreases in rural areas but not so sharply; in the urban areas, by contrast, the proportion of households spending larger amounts rises but slowly until the highest eating out expenditure range. In fact, about 16% of the households spend moderately high or high amounts on eating out. But the urban slums are not far behind. About 33% of the households spent small or slightly larger amounts but about 14% also spent moderately high or high amounts. As noted already, thus even deprived locations are not immune to lifestyle changes and the convenience of eating out.</p>

<p>Among those who eat out in nuclear families, there is a steady decrease in the share of households as expenditure on eating out rises. In fact, a large majority of these (76%) spent small amounts (i.e. &lt;Rs 200) while the remaining spent &gt;Rs 200. The pattern is similar among joint families. About 71% spent small amounts (&lt;Rs 200), and the remaining moderate amounts (&gt;Rs200). If these results are compared with those for the metros, the patterns are different, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0021909612472040">Table 13</xref>. It is not just that more nuclear families eat out; they also tend to spend larger amounts (relative to the aggregate sample). About 50% of these spent small amounts (&lt;Rs 200) while about 17% spent large amounts (&gt;Rs 500). Among the joint families, a considerably higher proportion ate out. However, about half spent small amounts (&lt;Rs 200) while over 16% spent large amounts (&gt;Rs 500). So more joint families in the metros ate out and spent larger amounts too, compared with the aggregate sample.</p>
<p>In the rural areas about the same proportion of nuclear and joint families (about 25%) ate out and large majorities (84% and 78%, respectively) spent small amounts, while a larger segment of the latter spent amounts exceeding Rs 200. Some of the key results of the cross-tabulations are illustrated graphically using pie charts in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0021909612472040">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
<p>In sum, eating out is a pervasive phenomenon – especially in the urban areas and, more specifically, in the metros. While the relatively affluent are more prone to eating out and spending larger amounts, some of the deprived segments, using not just income/expenditure criteria but also caste and location, do not seem to lag far behind. Nor is eating out merely an urban phenomenon, as large segments in rural areas eat out too.</p>

<title>Heckman Selection Model</title>
<p>While these cross-tabulations yielded some insights into the pervasiveness of the eating out phenomenon, the marginal contributions of household traits – including their poverty status, demographic composition, whether a nuclear or a joint family – and locational effects could not be assessed. To do so, we experimented with the Heckman selection model. This comprises two stages: first, the decision to eat is analysed, followed by how amounts spent on eating out vary with household and other characteristics. As detailed expositions of the Heckman model are available in various text books (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612472040">Wooldridge, 2006</xref>), an intuitive exposition is given below.</p>
<p>The first question is the amount people spend on eating out. But this amount is observed only for those households which choose to eat out (a little over 30% in our sample). If households made this decision randomly, we could ignore the fact that not all amounts spent on eating out are observed and use ordinary regression to explain variation in amounts spent. Such an assumption of random eating out is, however, unlikely to be true, as it is closely linked to the opportunity cost of time used in eating meals cooked at home. If, for example, both spouses work, and/or travel long distances to work, the opportunity cost of cooking meals at home is likely to be high. So if there are variables that strongly affect the decision to eat out (e.g. number of adult females working, their age profiles, whether a nuclear or a joint family) but not the outcome (i.e. the amounts spent), the Heckman selection model offers a convenient solution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021909612472040">10</xref></sup> The approach is to add an explicit selection equation to the main equation for determining the amount spent on eating out. The selection equation takes the form of a probit on the complete sample. This yields an estimate of the inverse Mills’ ratio for each household, λ̂<sup>i</sup>. In a second step, a regression is run of amounts spent on appropriately specified explanatory variables, <bold>x</bold> and λ̂<sup>i</sup>, using the selected sample of households eating out. The β̂<sup>i</sup> are consistent and approximately normally distributed. Without the sample correction, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of β<sub>j</sub> will suffer from an omitted variable bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021909612472040">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two estimation procedures are generally employed. One is the two-step procedure sketched earlier to check if there is evidence of sample selection. If there is no evidence of sample selection, there is no reason to continue. If, however, there is selection bias indicated by the <italic>t</italic>-value of λ̂<sup>i</sup>, the two-step procedure is supplemented by the joint estimation of the regression and selection equations by maximum likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612472040">Wooldridge, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021909612472040">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Let us first consider the probit results. The main findings are:</p>
<list id="list3-0021909612472040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Both metro and non-metro urban locations induce eating out, relative to rural locations. As lifestyle changes in these locations have been more dramatic and convenience of eating out is greater, these are plausible results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both nuclear and joint families display higher propensities to eat out relative to others. Between the two, joint families are more likely to eat out.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While the coefficient of SCs/STs is negative, it is weakly significant, implying a lower propensity to eat out, relative to the omitted group of others. That of OBCs is positive and significant, suggesting that they are more likely to eat out.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The higher the number of adult males in paid work in the two age groups (18–24 years and 25–45 years), the greater is the likelihood of such households eating out. The same applies to the number of adult females in paid employment in these age groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Controlling for the effects of these and other right-side variables, the higher the ratio of per capita expenditure to the poverty cut-off expenditure, the higher is the probability of such households eating out. This confirms the important role of growing affluence in dietary changes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We have further examined whether the sources of income matter too. The higher the share of salary in household income, the greater is the likelihood of eating out. While the effect of higher share of business income is positive too, it is weakly significant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The higher the number of adult males in paid work in the two age groups (18–24 years and 25–45 years), the greater is the likelihood of such households eating out. The same applies to the number of adult females in paid employment in these age groups.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Turning to the factors underlying the eating out expenditure, our main results are the following.</p>
<list id="list4-0021909612472040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Location matters a great deal. Households located in both metros and non-metro urban locations are likely to spend larger amounts on eating out, relative to rural areas. Between the metros and non-metros, households in the former are likely to spend much larger amounts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both SCs/STs and OBCs are likely to spend lower amounts relative to others.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The higher the number of adult males in paid employment in the age-group 25–45, the greater is the amount spent. A similar result is obtained for the number of adults in paid employment in the older age group, &gt;45 years, but the coefficient is only weakly significant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effect of higher per capita expenditure relative to the poverty line is large and significant, confirming that the more affluent are not just likely to eat out more often but also likely to spend larger amounts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the higher the share of salary in household income, the lower is the amount spent. By contrast, the higher the share of business income, the larger is the amount spent.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In sum, most of the results are plausible. Specifically, location of households, their demographic and caste characteristics and, above all, their relative affluence influence both the decision to eat out and, conditional on it, the amount spent.</p>

<title>Concluding observations</title>
<p>The main findings are summarized from a broad policy perspective. Attention was drawn to growing affluence, urbanization and dietary changes that are occurring at a rapid pace in developing countries. Of particular significance in the Indian context is the expansion of the middle class, higher female participation, emergence of nuclear two-income families, a sharp age divide in food preferences with younger age groups more susceptible to new foods advertised in the media, and a rapid growth of supermarkets and fast food outlets.</p>
<p>There have been concomitant changes in dietary patterns. Consumption of animal products – especially fats – has increased but that of vegetable products only moderately. Among the latter, consumption of wheat, starchy roots, vegetable oils and sweets and sweeteners and fruits has increased while that of rice, pulses and other cereals has declined. Also, the forms in which some of these products are consumed has also changed – <italic>chapatti</italic>, for example, is increasingly replaced by commercialized and westernized bread products.</p>
<p>Health implications of these dietary patterns are, however, not clear-cut. On the one hand, a more varied and nutritionally balanced diet and higher levels of food hygiene are associated with better health outcomes. On the other, although energy-dense foods associated with fast food outlets are cheaper and more convenient, these are also linked to a higher incidence of diet-related non-communicable diseases or NCDs (e.g. diabetes, coronary heart disease). Although India lags behind other developing countries in the epidemiological transition – decline in infectious disease mortality is increasingly compensated for by higher mortality from chronic degenerative NCDs – there is some evidence of this transition taking place.</p>
<p>Viewed from this perspective, our analysis broadly confirms the important role of urbanization, demographic changes, expansion of the middle class and its growing affluence in eating out or, more generally, consumption of snacks, beverages and precooked meals. To the extent that even more deprived sections are not immune to these evolving dietary patterns, and given their limited access to medical care and dietary awareness, the health outcomes may well be a lot grimmer than often acknowledged.</p>

<p>The computations were carried out competently by Raj Bhatia. We are grateful to Sonal Desai for clarifying a number of issues relating to the sample design and variables used in the household survey carried out jointly by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Economic Research; and Ajay Mahal and A. V. Subramanian for sharing their research. We are especially grateful to Lawrence Haddad for his constructive advice in the initial stage, and Anil Deolalikar for his valuable help in econometric estimation. We are grateful to an anonymous referee for helpful comments and the editor for encouragement. A. Venkatraman offered useful advice on the epidemiological transition in India. This study was funded by the British Government, under the Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures Project. The views expressed are, however, the sole responsibility of the authors.</p>
