<title>Background:</title>
<p>No study exists that directly measures the distances between posterior portals and the popliteal artery under arthroscopic conditions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0363546513492704">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To define the anatomic relationship between the neural structures and standard posterior arthroscopic portals and between the popliteal artery and posterior as well as transseptal portals in different knee positions.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546513492704">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seventeen fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. The posterolateral, posteromedial, and transseptal portals were established at 90° of knee flexion. The popliteal artery was revealed using a shaver placed through the posteromedial portal. The distance from those portals to the popliteal artery was measured using a precision caliper. After the measurements were made, each specimen was dissected. The distance from a needle, blade, and cannula in each portal site to the adjacent neural structures was successively measured at 30°, 90°, and 120° of knee flexion.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean distance (in millimeters) from the posterolateral, posteromedial, and transseptal portals to the popliteal artery was significantly smaller at 30° (32.1 ± 4.6, 36.5 ± 4.9, and 9.0 ± 3.9, respectively) than at 90° (40.7 ± 5.1, 41.0 ± 3.8, and 18.0 ± 3.8, respectively) and 120° (38.4 ± 4.8, 38.7 ± 6.0, and 21.0 ± 4.0, respectively) of knee flexion. The mean distance from the posterolateral portal to the common peroneal nerve at 90° of flexion (needle, 26.6 ± 9.5; blade, 24.7 ± 6.9; cannula, 22.1 ± 6.9) was significantly greater than the distance at 30° (needle, 23.4 ± 6.5; blade, 21.4 ± 6.4; cannula, 18.4 ± 6.3) and 120° (needle, 21.8 ± 6.6; blade, 19.1 ± 6.3; cannula, 17.4 ± 6.7) of knee flexion. The mean distance between the posteromedial portal and the inferior infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve at 30° (needle, 18.6 ± 4.3; blade, 15.5 ± 3.3; cannula, 13.7 ± 5.8) of flexion was smaller than at 90° (needle, 20.1 ± 6.1; blade, 16.5 ± 5.3; cannula, 14.3 ± 4.4) and 120° (needle, 21.1 ± 3.6; blade, 17.7 ± 4.9; cannula, 15.1 ± 5.9) of flexion, but there was no statistical significance. The mean distance from the posteromedial portal to the sartorial branch of the saphenous nerve at 30° (needle, 22.8 ± 6.1; blade, 19.8 ± 5.3; cannula, 17.7 ± 6.2) of flexion was significantly smaller than that at 90° (needle, 29.7 ± 3.6; blade, 26.3 ± 6.3; cannula, 23.1 ± 4.7) and 120° (needle, 31.5 ± 3.9; blade, 28.9 ± 4.1; cannula, 25.4 ± 5.1) of flexion.</p>

<title>Conclusion/Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The position of 90° of knee flexion is safe to establish posterior and transseptal arthroscopic portals. The position of 120° of knee flexion is practically safe to establish posteromedial and transseptal portals, but it is unsafe to create a posterolateral portal because the risk of damaging the common peroneal nerve is high.

<p>The improvement in surgical techniques and arthroscopic equipment has led to a continuing increase in knee surgeries that require the use of posterior arthroscopic portals. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstructions, removal of loose bodies, synovectomies, repair of tears in the posterior horn of the menisci, and arthroscopic fixations of tibial avulsion fractures of the PCL can now be performed establishing these portals. While various methods to enter the posterior compartment of the knee have been extensively described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513492704">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513492704">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513492704">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513492704">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513492704">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513492704">18</xref></sup> there are few studies describing the anatomic relationships of the neurovascular structures with posterior arthroscopic portals and the risks associated with their establishment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513492704">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513492704">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513492704">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513492704">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513492704">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513492704">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513492704">19</xref></sup> Although the location of the nerves in relation to surrounding structures at the level of the knee joint has been adequately defined,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513492704">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513492704">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513492704">25</xref></sup> the anatomy usually varies among patients.

<p>The purpose of this cadaveric study was to define the anatomic relationship between the neural structures and standard posterior arthroscopic portals and between the popliteal vessels and posterior as well as transseptal portals in different knee positions. The authors hypothesized that the risk of a neurovascular injury during the creation of posterior and transseptal portals would diminish during knee flexion greater than 90° and would increase when the knee is extended.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Seventeen fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. The mean age of the donors was 76 years (range, 72-82 years). There were 9 right and 8 left knees, while 10 knees were from men and 7 from women. For each specimen, the entire lower extremity was preserved to avoid disruption of the relationship between the soft tissue, neurovascular bundles, and bony landmarks. After disarticulation, the proximal end of the femur was clamped into a fixation device at the table, and the knee was positioned at 90° of flexion.</p>
<p>A routine arthroscopic examination of the knee joint was performed through standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals with the knee joint distended to 50 mm Hg and using an arthroscopic infusion pump. Next, a posteromedial portal was created by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon with a transillumination technique as a 30° arthroscope was placed through the intercondylar notch (between the PCL and the medial femoral condyle) via the anterolateral portal. Then, a 21-gauge needle (0.81-mm outer diameter, 40-mm length) was inserted into the posteromedial compartment, located approximately 5 mm above the medial meniscus and just posterior to the medial femoral condyle. The posterolateral portal was established in the same manner (approximately 5 mm above the lateral meniscus and just posterior to the lateral femoral condyle), passing the arthroscope from the anteromedial portal toward the posterolateral compartment through the intercondylar notch.</p>
<p>Next, the transseptal portal was created by passing a Wissinger rod from the posteromedial portal through the posterior septum of the knee in close contact with the posterior cortex of the tibia. This was performed under direct visualization as the arthroscope was placed through the intercondylar notch via the anterolateral portal. The popliteal artery was revealed using a shaver placed through the posteromedial portal. The Wissinger rod was left in place as a reference point to the previously established transseptal portal. The distance from the posterior and transseptal portals to the anterior margin of the popliteal artery was measured (in 1-mm increments) using a precision caliper that was handled with the use of an arthroscopic probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513492704">Figure 1</xref>) and directed posteriorly.</p>

<p>After the measurements were made, each specimen was dissected. The overlying skin and soft tissue were incised carefully to preserve the adjacent neurovascular structures, while the needles remained in the posteromedial and posterolateral portals.</p>
<p>A surgical scalpel blade (No. 11, length of 40 mm, width of 6 mm) and a cannula 8.5 mm in diameter were placed successively to the posteromedial and posterolateral portals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513492704">Figure 2</xref>). The distance from these elements (needle, blade, cannula) in each portal site to the adjacent neural structures was measured (inferior infrapatellar branch and sartorial branch of the saphenous nerve and common peroneal nerve). Distances were recorded with the knees in 30°, 90°, and 120° of flexion using a precision caliper, and calculations were rounded to the nearest millimeter.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With the development of arthroscopic techniques, more and more complex surgical procedures are performed that require excellent knowledge of the application of posterior arthroscopic portals. Despite the detailed documentation of the anatomy around the knee, posterior arthroscopic surgery remains problematic because the anatomy varies from one patient to another. Moreover, arthroscopic surgery is a dynamic procedure requiring a frequent change in knee position, while the dilation of the joint with the inflow of saline further distorts the anatomic relationship of neurovascular structures.</p>
<p>The most important finding demonstrated in this cadaveric study is that the position of 90° of knee flexion is safe to establish posterior and transseptal arthroscopic portals. The position of 120° of knee flexion is practically safe to establish posteromedial and transseptal portals, but great care is needed to create a posterolateral portal because the risk of damaging the common peroneal nerve is high. The position of 30° of knee flexion is not recommended to establish posterior arthroscopic portals.</p>
<p>In general terms, complications resulting from the damage of neural structures during knee arthroscopic surgeries have been extensively described, and their prevalence has been reported to range from 0.06% to 0.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513492704">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513492704">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513492704">23</xref></sup> Ahn et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513492704">2</xref></sup> in their study, focused on the potential risk of damage to all related nerves, according to knee positioning, during the establishment of posterior portals. They showed that the position of 90° of knee flexion is reasonably safe to create a posterior portal during knee arthroscopic surgery. The same authors proposed a limited posterior capsular release during transtibial PCL reconstruction to increase the distance from the popliteal artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513492704">3</xref></sup> Tifford et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513492704">24</xref></sup> recommended a position of knee flexion and horizontal incisions when installing anterior arthroscopic portals to minimize injuries to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve. In the present study, we further examined the relationships between the posterior portals and nerves at high flexion knee angles, while we expanded the measurements using No. 11 knife blades and cannulae. Indeed, the findings showed that a posteromedial portal can safely be established at flexion knee angles ≥90° and that the distances can be adequate using a needle, blade, or cannula. However, the potential risk of damage to the common peroneal nerve is high not only near extension but also in high flexion angles. This probably is because of the more consistent course of the nerve, which does not allow great mobility, thus permitting the posterolateral portal to approach this structure during excessive knee flexion. In clinical practice, this could be very important because orthopaedic surgeons must be aware of this risk and should avoid creating the posterolateral portal beyond the angle of 90° of knee flexion.</p>
<p>Although knee arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, injuries of the popliteal artery have been reported by several authors, and their incidence has been accounted in between 0.5% and 1% of all arthroscopic procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513492704">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513492704">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513492704">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513492704">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513492704">23</xref></sup> Matava et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513492704">16</xref></sup> determined the distance between the PCL tibial insertion and the popliteal artery at 5 different knee flexion angles. While joint distention was maintained, each cadaveric specimen underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measurements were made in the axial and sagittal planes. The Matava et al study suggested that moving the starting point for the guide pin distal to the tibial tubercle and increasing knee flexion reduce the risk of arterial injuries during PCL reconstruction. However, they recognized a possible overestimation of the PCL–popliteal artery distance because of atherosclerotic lesions and subsequent diminution of the diameter of the vessels.</p>
<p>Keser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513492704">10</xref></sup> investigated the mediolateral localization of the popliteal artery with axial MRI scans. It was found that the artery was located lateral to the midline in 94.3% of cases, but it was on the central axis in 5.7% of cases. The authors concluded that preoperative evaluation of the popliteal artery with MRI axial scans may prevent iatrogenic injuries during posterior knee arthroscopic procedures.</p>
<p>Recently, the safe establishment of a transseptal portal proposed by Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513492704">11</xref></sup> included penetration of the septum from a lateral-to-medial direction. Performing magnetic resonance arthrography, they showed that the average anterior-to-posterior dimension was consistently greater in the posteromedial compartment and that the popliteal artery was always located lateral to the septum. However, measurements were taken in one position (90°), and no arthroscopic pump was used to distend the joint. In the present study, the anatomic distances between the popliteal artery and posteromedial portals were longer than those between the artery and the posterolateral portals, indicating the lateral position of the artery in accordance to the posterior septum. The distances were measured from the anterior margin of the popliteal artery, having placed the caliper toward a posterior direction. Thus, we gave distance intervals even if the worst-case scenario has happened (posterior direction of the needle, blade, or cannula), especially when posterior portals have to be installed by a surgeon who is not so familiar with their use. Moreover, it is shown that establishment of a transseptal arthroscopic portal between 90° and 120° of knee flexion is relatively safe in relation to the popliteal artery whether the direction is lateromedial or mediolateral.</p>
<p>Certain limitations have to be considered including the relatively aged specimens that were used, the cadaveric nature of the study, and the need for dissection, which can influence the original anatomic pathways of the examined neurovascular bundles. However, this is the first report in the literature in which the distances from posteromedial, posterolateral, and transseptal portals to the popliteal artery were directly measured under arthroscopic conditions. Another strength can be considered in that the measurements between the nerve trunks and the portals were made, having in place not only a 21-gauge needle but also a No. 11 blade and cannula. Further strengths of this study include the use of fresh-frozen cadaveric knees that were thawed only 24 hours before dissection and the relatively high quantity of cadaveric knees, considering the difficulties of easily finding appropriate specimens.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This cadaveric study showed that the position of 90° of knee flexion is safe to establish posterior and transseptal arthroscopic portals. The position of 120° of knee flexion is practically safe to establish posteromedial and transseptal portals, but it is unsafe to create a posterolateral portal because the risk of damaging the common peroneal nerve is high. The position of 30° of knee flexion is not recommended to establish posterior arthroscopic portals.</p>
