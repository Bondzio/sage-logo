<abstract>
<p>Studies on the substitution thesis in advanced economies show scattered results: the impact of immigration on the wages and likelihood of unemployment of the less educated varies strongly. Both studies on the substitution thesis itself and studies on the unequal post-industrial development of urban economies, suggest that this is because the substitution thesis is conditional on the type of urban economy. The empirical validity of this suggestion is tested by comparing the impact of immigration on the employment level of the less educated among 22 Dutch metropolitan areas. The findings corroborate the central hypothesis: in strong service-oriented urban economies, the impact of immigration on unemployment levels is mitigated because of high labour demand for the less educated.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>As many advanced economies have seen the immigrant share in their populations rise in recent decades, many studies have been devoted to assessing the tenability of the substitution thesis. According to this thesis, immigrants and their descendants can be substitutes for domestic workers in the market for labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011417904">Chiswick, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417904">Johnson, 1980</xref>). Some studies on this thesis find no impact of immigration on wages or unemployment levels, while other studies do. In the latter, a negative impact on the wages, and a positive impact on the likelihood of unemployment, of both lower-educated natives and immigrants is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417904">Okkerse, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent OECD study showed that the findings on the likelihood of unemployment due to immigration are conditional on the type of national institutional framework: in states with less market interference, lower-educated natives and immigrants are less likely to become unemployed due to immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417904">Jean and Jimenez, 2007</xref>). This offers an explanation for divergent findings between countries, but the scattered results in studies on the substitution thesis within countries still call for an explanation. This article tries to do so, by building on two sets of research findings that suggest that the impact of immigration on unemployment is conditional on the type of urban economy.</p>
<p>Findings of studies on the substitution thesis, and findings in urban studies on the consequences of post-industrialism for urban labour markets, suggest that labour demand at the bottom is strongest in the most service-oriented urban economies. As a result, the substitution between immigrants and lower-educated natives or former waves of immigrants is likely to be less strong in the most service-oriented urban economies. If so, this might explain why studies on the substitution thesis yield scattered results within one country.</p>
<p>This expectation is what is assessed in this paper. More specifically, this paper tries to answer the question whether the negative impact of immigration on the unemployment level of the lower educated is indeed weakest in the most service-centred urban economies. Before answering this question, the theoretical underpinnings and findings of both the substitution thesis and the urban social consequences of post-industrialism will be addressed in section 2.</p>

<title>2. The Impact of Immigration on Wages and Employment</title>
<sec id="section3-0042098011417904">
<title>2.1 The Substitution Thesis: Theory and Evidence</title>
<p>The substitution thesis applies a neo-classical economic model of supply and demand to the labour market, expecting that immigration—read: increasing labour supply—lowers the price for labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011417904">Chiswick, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417904">Johnson, 1980</xref>). Hence, immigration will lead to declining wages of workers with whom the immigrants compete, or, in the case of inflexible labour markets, to increasing likelihood of unemployment.</p>
<p>Most studies in this field of research focus on the United States, but still a substantial number address western European countries. In 2005, Longhi <italic>et al</italic>. made an inventory of the few dozens of studies on the impact of immigration on wages until 2003, and analysed their research findings in a meta study. A few years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417904">Okkerse (2008)</xref> followed with a review on the findings of studies on the substitution thesis until 2005. She stated that the</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>approaches and results [of her study] complement the ones discussed in the meta-analysis carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> on wage effects of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417904">Okkerse, 2008</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her study was more comprehensive since it took “a broader definition of labour market effects” (p. 2), as it “also question[ed] the effects of immigration on labour participation and on the likelihood of being employed or unemployed” (p. 2). Thus, her review included almost all empirical studies on the substitution thesis until 2005.</p>
<p>Despite their different approach and scope, both studies come to the same conclusions. First, “immigration negatively affects wages of less-skilled labourers and earlier immigrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417904">Okkerse, 2008</xref>, p. 24), especially the wages of the latter since “immigrants are more in competition with other immigrants than with natives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, p. 472). It needs to be stressed, however, that these effects are very small, as emphasised by these authors themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Secondly, “the probability that immigrants increase unemployment is low in the short run and zero in the long run” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417904">Okkerse, 2008</xref>, p. 24). In short, it can be concluded that the substitution thesis holds in general: immigration depresses wages of lower-skilled natives and immigrants—especially of the latter. The overall effects are weak, however, and the employment effects wither in time.</p>
<p>Studies on the substitution thesis that appeared after 2005, or were not included in the meta studies already addressed, basically show the same results: no impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011417904">Arrasco, Jimeno and Ortega, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011417904">Catanzarite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011417904">Cohen-Goldner and Paserman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011417904">Islam, 2008</xref>), or weak negative impact on the wages or likelihood of unemployment of low-skilled natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011417904">Borjas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011417904">Islam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011417904">Ferderman, Harrington and Krynski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417904">Wilson and Jaynes, 2000</xref>)—albeit that this impact is somewhat stronger on the jobs and wages of (former waves of) immigrants or ethnic minorities since those are the most direct competitors of immigrants in the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011417904">Catanzarite and Aguilera, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011417904">Reed and Danziger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011417904">Boustan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>So, although there is a great variety in findings, the ‘overall’ results of studies on the substitution thesis published between 1980 and 2009 can be summarised as follows: immigration has a negative impact on the wages of both natives and immigrants they compete with, especially on the wages of the latter. Furthermore, it can lead to unemployment for both of these categories—especially in countries with more labour market regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417904">Jean and Jimenez, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The variety in findings within nations still begs the question as to how this comes about. Two fields of research suggest that this is because the extent to which immigration leads to substitution in the labour market is not only conditional on market interference, but also on the type of urban economy. Both will be addressed in what follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0042098011417904">
<title>2.2 The Substitution Thesis and the Local Economy in the Post-industrial Era</title>
<p>Several authors who assess the substitution thesis suspect that urban economies differ in the extent to which immigration impacts on wages or unemployment levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417904">Card (1990)</xref>, for instance, assessed the substitution thesis using the ‘natural experiment’ that has become known as the ‘Mariel boatlift’. The cause of this event was that Cubans were temporarily allowed to leave Cuba in 1980. Consequently, within a time-span of approximately six months, the Miami labour market experienced no less than a 7 per cent rise in overall labour supply—a figure that is much higher at the bottom of the labour market, as most immigrants were unskilled. Despite this large influx of unskilled Cubans, there was hardly an impact on the wages and unemployment rates of low-skilled natives and former waves of immigrants.</p>
<p>Card wondered what might have caused this situation that seemingly flies in the face of the neo-classical economics’ supply and demand logic of the substitution thesis. He put forward the idea that the local economic structure was responsible for mitigating the wage and unemployment effects of increasing labour supply. More specifically, he expected that the strong presence of “immigrant intensive industries [such as] private household services, hotels and motels, eating and drinking establishments, and business services” in the Miami metropolitan economy was responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417904">Card, 1990</xref>, p. 256; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417904">Card, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Others have quite similar arguments. Wilson and Jaynes, for instance, stress that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the adjustment of local labour markets to immigration may be very quick, particularly if the inflow is modest and <italic>the economy is sufficiently diversified to allow for the absorption of immigrants in a variety of sectors</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417904">Wilson and Jaynes, 2000</xref>, p. 159, emphasis added; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011417904">Catanzarite, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011417904">Friedberg and Hunt, 1995</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A recent comparison between Amsterdam and Rotterdam corroborated this logic. In Amsterdam, that has a more service-oriented economy than Rotterdam, immigration did not lead to downward pressure on the wages of lower-educated natives and immigrants, while it did in Rotterdam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, several researchers on the substitution thesis argue, and several research findings indicate, that cities with a well-developed service sector yield higher labour demand for lower-educated labour than urban economies with a less-developed service economy. Consequently, the former cities are better equipped than the latter to integrate newcomers in the labour market without consequences for the wages or unemployment risks of natives and earlier waves of immigrants. If so, the neo-classical economics’ supply and demand logic of the substitution thesis is still basically correct, but it cannot properly be assessed by taking only the supply side—i.e. immigration—into account. It needs to be taken into consideration that urban economies might differ in labour demand for the lower educated.</p>
<p>Studies from a different research tradition point in the same direction. Several scholars in urban studies argue that the economic fortunes of cities vary considerably in the post-industrial era. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011417904">Dangschat (1994)</xref>, for instance, roughly discerned ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in the transition to a post-industrial economy. In this dichotomy, the ‘winners’ are cities that already had a substantial share of producer services in their economy before deindustrialisation started in the 1970s: New York, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, for instance. The ‘losers’, on the other hand, are those cities that still strongly depended on heavy industries back in the 1970s, such as Liverpool, Rotterdam, cities in the German Ruhr area, and, in the US, the so-called rustbelt cities such as Detroit (similar arguments can be found in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011417904">Cheshire, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011417904">Kasarda and Friedrichs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011417904">Meijer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011417904">2007</xref>). The clustering of advanced producer services in many of these industrial or rustbelt cities lags behind to this day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417904">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>What is important for the issue addressed in this paper—the conditionality of labour market substitution due to immigration on type of urban economy—is that, according to the polarisation thesis, the clustering of advanced producer services yields high labour demand for lower-educated urbanites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417904">Sassen-Koob, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417904">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417904">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011417904">Sassen, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011417904">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011417904">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417904">2006</xref>). This is why advanced producer services are often labelled as ‘growth sectors’ and their presence is considered to be an indication of urban economic viability. Cities do actually compete for companies active in these services now, and their settlement is considered a solution for alleviating unemployment problems at the bottom of the urban labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first place, this is because “almost half the jobs in the producer services are lower-income jobs, and the other half are in the two highest earning classes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2006</xref>, p. 197; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2000</xref>, p. 142). The latter are the well-educated professionals who perform the complex operations such as financial specialists, accountants and consultants; the former are lower-educated facilitators such as cleaners, clerks and security personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2000</xref>, p. 142; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417904">Sassen, 2006</xref>, p. 197). High labour demand for lower-educated urbanites is in the second place driven by the consumption pattern of the well-educated professionals employed in the advanced producer services, as this pattern yields demand for</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>an army of low-wage workers … [including] residential building attendants, dog-walkers, housekeepers for the two-career family, workers in the gourmet restaurants and food shops, French hand laundries, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417904">Sassen-Koob, 1985</xref>, p. 262; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011417904">Friedmann, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417904">Sassen-Koob, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417904">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011417904">Sassen, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011417904">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417904">2006</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And indeed, several studies show that urban economies with a strong and growing presence of advanced producer services increase the prosperity of their citizens irrespective of ethnicity and education level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011417904">Drennan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and create jobs for the highly as well as lowly educated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011417904">Elliott, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011417904">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417904">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011417904">van der Waal and Burgers, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011417904">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011417904">2011</xref>). Cities with a more industrial character, on the other hand, have to contend with high unemployment levels at the bottom of the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011417904">Elliott, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011417904">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011417904">Kasarda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011417904">Kasarda and Friedrichs, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417904">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011417904">van der Waal and Burgers, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011417904">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011417904">2011</xref>) and have witnessed a decline in the prosperity of their citizens in recent decades—especially of the lower-educated stratum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011417904">Drennan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clear that these findings in urban studies show striking similarities with the expectation in several studies on the substitution thesis that the extent of labour-market substitution due to immigration differs between cities. For, as already outlined, several labour economists expect that, in service-oriented urban labour markets, the high demand for low-skilled labour is able to absorb shocks in labour supply due to immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417904">Card, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417904">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011417904">Friedberg and Hunt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417904">Wilson and Jaynes, 2000</xref>). Consequently, the influx of immigration will hardly affect the wages or likelihood of unemployment of natives and former waves of immigrants.</p>
<p>So, just as the extent of labour market substitution due to immigration depends on the extent of market interference at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417904">Jean and Jimenez, 2007</xref>), these two sets of studies suggest that it depends on the type of urban economy. On the basis of the findings and arguments already outlined, it can be expected that the substitution between immigrants and natives or former waves of immigrants is weakest in the most service-oriented urban economies because of the high demand for low-skilled labour. This article will assess this expectation by comparing the impact of immigration on the unemployment of lower-educated urbanites between cities that differ in the extent to which they are post-industrial.</p>

<title>3. Research Format, Data and Operationalisation</title>
<p>As this article aims to assess the conditionality of labour market substitution due to immigration on type of urban economy, it is best to compare cities within a country that is known for its centralistic labour market interference. Otherwise, a different impact of immigration on unemployment of lower-educated urbanites between the cities under scrutiny might not be the result of the type of urban economy, but due to differences in labour market interference between cities.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is the country par <italic>excellence</italic> for such a research framework (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417904">Burgers and Musterd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011417904">Musterd <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417904">Newman and Thornley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011417904">Parkinson <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>): its welfare policies are highly centralistic in comparison with other Western countries, especially since the 1980s when most European countries decentralised many (financial) responsibilities to local governments. As a consequence, the increased differentiation between cities when it comes to welfare measures and labour market interference in other European countries in recent decades is largely absent.</p>
<p>To asses the central expectation of this study, I constructed my own dataset by using data on the 22 metropolitan areas in the Netherlands, which are available at the website of Statistics Netherlands (CBS).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011417904">1</xref></sup> Although these data are available from the early 1990s until 2008, for some variables addressed below the data did not fully cover this time-span. As a result, the analysis includes 22 Dutch metropolitan areas between 1998 and 2007, yielding 220 cases or, put differently, 220 city–year combinations (22*10).</p>
<p>The variable <italic>unemployment lower educated</italic> measures the share of the lower-educated working population that is currently unemployed, but is looking for a job for at least 12 hours a week—the standard Dutch definition of unemployment. It is measured two years later than the independent variables, which is a common research practice in studies on the impact of immigration on wages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) because the unemployment effects of immigration will not show themselves immediately.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>immigrant share</italic> measures the share of immigrants in the population of a metropolitan agglomeration.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>producer services</italic> is the first indicator of the extent to which a city is post-industrial. It concerns the share of the working population that is employed in firms classified in class J (finance) and class K (real estate and producer services) in the Dutch SBI 93 classification (<italic>Standaard Bedrijfsindeling 1993</italic>) that corresponds to the ‘ISIC Rev. 3.1’ (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities) of the United Nations. Put differently, <italic>producer services</italic> measures the presence of the activities that, according to the polarisation thesis underlying the central expectation assessed in this article, are the primary drivers for job growth at the bottom of the labour market: in the first place, because according to that thesis these services yield high demand for lower-educated workers themselves; in the second place, because it is argued that the presence of these services leads indirectly to high demand for these workers in other industries (see next variable).</p>
<p>The variable <italic>hotel and catering industry</italic> is the second indicator of the extent to which a city is post-industrial. According to the polarisation thesis, the consumption pattern of the professionals employed in advanced producer services boasts employment for lower-educated workers in that industry. <italic>Hotel and catering industry</italic> is measured as the share of the working population that is employed in firms classified in class H (hotels and restaurants) in the Dutch SBI 93 classification (<italic>Standaard Bedrijfsindeling 1993</italic>) that corresponds to the ‘ISIC Rev. 3.1’ (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities) of the United Nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011417904">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There is need for several control variables since the population in metropolitan areas is not completely determined by labour market logic. <italic>Age 15–24/25–34/35–44/45–54</italic> concerns four variables that measure the share of the working population by age category. These are used as to control for non-labour-market-driven settlement patterns, such as the high share of students in university cities. <italic>Share lower educated</italic> measures the share in the working population that is less educated. It is used as to control for non-market-driven settlement patterns. The share of cheap subsidised housing for instance differs by city, but is likely to be highly related to the share of lower-educated urbanites. <italic>Working population</italic> measures the total number of urbanites between the age of 15 and 66, be they employed or unemployed, in logarithmic form. It indicates the total working population.</p>

<p>As the data have a multilevel structure, 10 years within 22 cities, there is need for multilevel modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417904">Hox, 1995</xref>).

<p>Entering the control variables and <italic>producer services</italic> in model 1 corroborates earlier findings on the high labour demand for the lower educated in the most service-oriented urban economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011417904">3</xref></sup> The coefficient of <italic>producer services</italic> is negative and significant, which means that in the most service-oriented urban economies the unemployment level of lower-educated citizens is indeed lower. The negative and significant coefficient of <italic>share lower educated</italic> furthermore shows that cities with high shares of lower-educated urbanites have low unemployment levels. This suggests that the lower educated tend to settle in cities where labour demand for them is highest. Yet, their settlement is not completely labour market driven, considering that the extent to which supply meets demand at the bottom of the labour market differs among Dutch cities—some cities have to contend with higher unemployment levels than others (see Appendix).</p>
<p>Entering the variables into model 1 leads to a decline in the variance of <italic>unemployment lower educated</italic> at year level, as could be expected. This suggests that part of the differences in the unemployment level of lower-educated urbanites among Dutch cities is the result of unequal post-industrial development: in cities where employment in the advanced producer services increased most, the unemployment level of lower-educated urbanites decreased most strongly. Strikingly, the variance at metropolitan level increases, which is rather odd because entering variables normally explains part of the variance in the dependent variable. In multilevel modelling, this sometimes happens, however, and indicates an omission of important explanatory variables in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011417904">Kreft and de Leeuw, 1998</xref>). The models that follow will show whether <italic>hotel and catering industry</italic> and <italic>immigration</italic> are such important variables.</p>
<p>In model 2, however, <italic>hotel and catering industry</italic> proves not to have any impact on the unemployment level of lower-educated urbanites as it yields an insignificant coefficient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098011417904">4</xref></sup> This is contrary to what one would expect on the basis of Sassen’s theory on labour demand for lower-educated service workers due to the clustering of advanced producer services. For, according to that theory, at least part of the ‘army of low-wage workers’ that the consumption pattern of the higher-educated professionals employed in those services yields can be found in the hotel and catering industry. One could therefore expect that the coefficient of <italic>producer services</italic> would decline in strength after entering <italic>hotel and catering industry</italic> into the model. However, at least in Dutch cities, it does not seem to work that way. Two things come to mind as possible explanations for this finding.</p>
<p>First, differences in the extent to which labour markets are regulated might affect the consumption in the hotel and catering industry by the professionals in the advanced producer services. The Dutch labour market is more regulated than the one in the US, which results in higher wage levels for lower-educated service workers in the former than in the latter. Consequently, services in the hotel and catering industry are more expensive in the Netherlands than in the US and this might hamper high consumption levels. A second explanation could be that the hotel and catering industry primarily employs students and part-timers working for supplementary household income, instead of lower-educated urbanites. As a result, employment in that industry will hardly affect the unemployment levels of the latter. Whatever it might be, what is clear is that for Dutch cities only the share of employment in the advanced producer services boasts employment for lower-educated urbanites in accordance to Sassen’s theory. In what follows, it will be assessed whether this affects the impact of immigration on their unemployment levels.</p>
<p>At least one of the important explanatory variables that proved to be missing in the previous two models due to increasing instead of declining variance in the dependent variable at city level reveals itself in model 3: <italic>immigrant share</italic>. Entering this variable in model 3 leads to a substantial drop in the variance at metropolitan level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098011417904">5</xref></sup> The variance at year level declines as well. The coefficient of <italic>immigrant share</italic> is, as could be expected on the basis of the substitution thesis, positive and significant: in metropolitan areas with a high share of immigrants, the unemployment level of lower-educated urbanites is higher. Model 3 reveals more than this, however. The strength of the coefficient of <italic>producer services</italic> declines substantially, indicating that the high unemployment level of the lower educated in cities with low employment shares in the advanced producer services is partly caused by the immigrant share in their population.</p>
<p>The question remains whether the impact of immigration on the unemployment level of lower-educated citizens is weaker, or even absent, in the most service-oriented urban economies. To find out, the interaction effect of <italic>immigrant share</italic> with <italic>producer services</italic> is entered into model 4.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098011417904">6</xref></sup> The coefficient is negative and significant, which means that the impact of immigration on unemployment is weaker in cities with a high employment share in the advanced producer services than in cities with a low employment share in those services—this corroborates the central expectation of this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098011417904">7</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417904">Figure 1</xref> depicts this interaction effect. It shows that immigration in urban economies with high employment shares in the producer services hardly has any impact on the unemployment level of lower-educated citizens.</p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>After almost three decades of research, it is clear the substitution thesis sometimes holds, but that the strength of the impact of immigration on wages and the likelihood of unemployment varies by social categories and institutional frameworks. By and large, immigrants compete with lower-educated natives and former waves of immigrants in the labour market. Consequently, these competitors see their wages decline due to immigration—or, especially in countries with more labour market interference, run a higher risk of becoming unemployed.</p>
<p>This article has tried to answer the question as to why findings differ <italic>within</italic> states. The expectation derived from two fields of study—that, in the most service-oriented urban economy, the impact of immigration on unemployment is weakest—proved to be basically correct. Immigration only leads to a game of musical chairs between immigrants and natives or former waves of immigrants in less service-oriented urban economies—that is, in urban economies with low employment shares in the advanced producer services, because labour demand in these cities is simply not high enough to absorb the lower-educated labour supply settled there. Consequently, immigration aggravates the already scarce labour market opportunities in these urban economies for immigrants and lower-educated natives alike. In strong service-centred urban economies, on the other hand, labour demand is high enough to absorb supply shocks of labour due to immigration.</p>
<p>This finding is, just as the finding that in more regulated economies the unemployment effect of immigration is stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417904">Jean and Jimenez, 2007</xref>), in line with the neo-classical economics’ supply and demand logic of the substitution thesis. For labour demand, just as labour supply, varies among cities. By also modelling the demand side—i.e. the type of urban economy—this study was able to interpret different levels of substitution among cities according to the supply and demand logic of the substitution thesis. This proves that it is fruitful to consider thoroughly the theoretical underpinnings of the substitution thesis when looking for a cause of its scattered results, instead of merely discussing methods and statistics (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417904">Card, 2005</xref>, p. 321). This is not to say that the use of proper methods and statistics is unimportant (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, p. 471), but that scattered results can be corroborations of theoretical expectations instead of statistical or empirical aberrations. The nature and strength of labour demand differs between countries and between cities, and thus the impact of immigration—i.e. shocks in labour supply—on unemployment differs between countries and between cities as well.</p>
<p>Besides giving a potential explanation for the scattered results of previous studies on the substitution thesis, the research findings in this study can explain why country-level studies on this thesis often find weak substitution effects. These weak effects might be the net result of the underestimations of substitution in cities with low employment shares in the advanced producer services and the overestimations of substitution in cities with high employment shares in those services. Such weak effects often leave the authors of these studies wondering how this is possible, for the substitution logic seems so self-evident. Again, just like scattered results, weak effects might be the result of a research format that is not in accordance with the logic of the substitution thesis for it does not model local difference in labour demand, but merely local differences in local immigrant labour supply.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the only study on the impact of immigration on wages for the Netherlands as a whole, which was unable to model local differences in labour demand due to data deficiencies. Hence, in that study, “the participation rate is assumed to be <italic>identically distributed</italic> across local labour markets for each ethnic minority group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011417904">Zorlu and Hartog, 2005</xref>, p. 120; emphasis added). It concluded that “the effect of immigrants on natives’ wages is genuinely small” (p. 134), as “a 10 percent increase of ethnic minorities from non-EU countries decreases the earnings of low-skilled workers by 0.42 per cent” (pp. 120–121; see also the meta study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417904">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, p. 472). Such conclusions are in the first place misleading for they imply that the extent of substitution between immigrants and natives or former waves of immigrants can be measured effectively simply by modelling the immigrant share. In the second place, they are misleading because they depict that substitution is modest, while their findings are probably deflated, because there are no substitution effects in cities with high employment shares in the advanced producer services (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417904">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>That all said, the findings of this study evoke another question: why do immigrants settle in cities where labour demand is low? This flies in the face of the market logic that is often assumed to be driving migration to the advanced economies. Although, in accordance to this market logic, Dutch cities with high employment shares in the advanced producer services do indeed have higher immigrant shares in their population (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.291, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005, <italic>N</italic> = 220), the settlement of immigrants is not completely determined by labour demand—otherwise their unemployment levels would not differ between cities. Non-market logics such as the influence of a decommodified housing market, but also kinship, ethnic or social ties with former waves of immigrants, are probably responsible for this pattern (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417904">Zorlu and Mulder, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>All in all, it seems safe to conclude that future studies on the substitution thesis should take into account that urban economies differ in labour demand and that the settlement of immigrants does not necessarily follow market logic. If these studies do so, the research format will be more in accordance with the theoretical underpinnings of the substitution thesis and are therefore likely to yield findings that are easier to interpret. Such a format might even become more salient as cities, at least in the Netherlands, diverge in the extent to which advanced producer services cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417904">van der Waal, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417904">2010b</xref>). As this clustering proves to be the driving force for labour demand for lower-educated urbanites, local differences in the extent to which immigration leads to labour market substitution are therefore likely to grow in salience.</p>

<p>In line with Sassen’s polarisation theory addressed in this article, it would be optimal if, in addition to modelling the impact of the employment shares in the advanced producer services and in the hotel and catering industry, the impact of the share of employment in private households (class T in the ‘ISIC Rev. 3.1’ (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities) of the United Nations) could be modelled as well. Unfortunately, the latter is not available at the metropolitan level.</p>

<p>As the seven degrees of freedom (seven variables were entered into the model) yield a drop in deviance of 32.41 (598.60—566.19), model 1 is a significant improvement of the null model. According to the chi-squared distribution, there is need for only a drop of 14.067 in deviance to be significant at the 5 per cent level.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0042098011417904">
<label>4.</label>
<p>Model 2 is not a significant improvement of model 1, as using one degree of freedom yields a drop in deviance of 0.51 (566.19—565.68), which is less than minimally required (3.841 at the 5 per cent level). The <italic>p</italic> value of the metropolitan-level variance drops below 5 per cent. Yet, considering that the variance cannot be negative, there is merely a need for a one-sided test. The <italic>p</italic> value therefore needs to be smaller than 0.10 to indicate significance at the 5 per cent level; which it is. If this were not the case, testing at the 10 per cent level of significance is still very strict if one takes the small number of metropolitan areas (22) in the dataset into account. Testing at the 10 per cent level is quite common in the case of such small sample sizes.</p>

<p>Using a ‘fixed-effects model’ that controls for autocorrelation by means of city and year dummies instead of a multilevel model does not alter the findings in model 4.</p>
