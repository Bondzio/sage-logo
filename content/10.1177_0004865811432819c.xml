<p>Sociologist and former dancer, Rachela Colosi (University of Lincoln) conducted participant observation at a lap-dancing club called Starlets, located in Northern England. This ethnography is the first of its kind to explore the dancer’s relationship to the occupational culture of stripping, and in doing so, challenges previous literature that looked at lap-dancing only as a deviant profession. Colosi sites various changes in the economy of the United Kingdom as a reason for the increase in the numbers of women taking up dancing as an occupation, echoing many feminists in the United States who have also written on the presence of women in the lap-dancing profession. Colosi explores these dancer–occupation relations both at the beginning and end of dancers’ careers within the realm of dancer relations with one another, their managers, partners, motivations, empowerment, and the risks to dancers within the culture of lap-dancing.</p>
<p>Colosi situates Starlets within a context that distinguishes between lap-dancing clubs and agency clubs, the difference being that lap-dancing clubs are usually in safer environments; hence Starlets was deemed as a more desirable place to work as a lap-dancer as opposed to being a freelance stripper. She also sees these clubs in the United Kingdom as part of a global growth of leisure industries and notes that women who work in lap-dancing clubs in the United Kingdom do not have direct contact with customers, as dancers do in the United States, thus enhancing the reader’s understanding of stripping culture and laws in the United Kingdom. In this section Colosi also does a good job at examining the history of crime codes of lap-dancing venues in the United Kingdom, thus linking the negative stigma dancers can experience to the criminalization of the industry.</p>
<p>In the remaining chapters Colosi paints the scene for her readers with rich descriptions of the rules operating within the club – for example, payment of the house fee by dancers after a shift, contracts given to dancers by management, how the club manages under-age dancers, and scheduling of shifts. Colosi notes that often dancers discussed unionization in response to some of the managers’ rules, but many felt that it would not happen or indeed solve all of their problems. Instead, dancers were often found to resist management control through privileges based on the status of how long a dancer had worked at Starlets. Thus, women with senior status, or what Colosi terms, ‘Old School’ dancers often were able to negotiate shifts, dancer fees, and sometimes illegal drug use, as opposed to ‘new school dancers’ who often had to obey all the rules as a way to gain respect and status within the club.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of Colosi’s observations and fieldwork is the emotional labor and strain that can come with lap-dancing, such as stigma, customer interactions, and the effects of the work on family life. Many women had conflict with their (mostly male) partners, which sometimes resulted in them leaving the job. Colosi reports that dancers often felt various forms of insecurity, not just based on comments about their appearance from customers, but also insecurities about being fired or having their pay docked by management for offences such as being late to a shift. The use of drugs and alcohol is documented by Colosi as one way dancers try and manage the negative effects of stigma and insecurity, but this is not the only outlet for dancers. Colosi cites entertaining examples of dancers getting revenge by the use of ‘emotional rituals’ against management by mocking them.</p>
<p>The part of dancer relations I found most interesting was the process of exiting the industry, which has not been written about in previous literature on the subject. Colosi cites new job opportunities, pregnancy, and family reasons. Regarding pregnancy, many of the women in Colosi’s study who left for this reason left before they started to show, and for financial reasons sometimes came back after the baby was born. This section of the book is valuable for scholars in the field of women and work and sociology of the body in further exploring what it means to work pregnant as a lap-dancer and be allowed back to work, thus expanding our notions of motherhood within the sex industry.</p>
<p>A major strength of the book is the methods sections where Colosi describes her entry into the field, the process of becoming a researcher as a former dancer, and the balance of writing fieldnotes after interviews with women that she personally knew from her role as a dancer. However, one of the weaknesses of the methods section is that I did not get a sense of how many women she interviewed, the backgrounds of these women, and with regard to those who work at the agency clubs, a social demographic breakdown of this group. For example, I wanted to know what class, age groups, and race/ethnicity of women tended to work at the agency club versus the lap-dancing club.</p>
<p>Overall though, Colosi’s ethnography is a valuable contribution to the literature in the sociology of crime, women and work, and sexuality studies.</p>
