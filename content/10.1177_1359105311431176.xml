<abstract>
<p>This study examined the role of social belonging and self-esteem in acute physical health and mood in 159 young adolescents (aged 11 to 14 years). Standardized self-report measures of belongingness (school, home and community), self-esteem, acute physical symptoms, and affect, were completed for the previous month. Higher levels of inclusive belonging were associated with fewer physical symptoms and better affect. Domain specific belonging was independently linked to acute physical symptoms and level of affect, with pathways between belonging and outcome mediated by self-esteem. Findings emphasize the need for greater recognition of the role of belonging in physical health outcomes.</p>

<p>The importance of an individual’s social world on health has long been recognized. This understanding has generated extensive research, placing the role of interpersonal resources to manage social stressors and facilitate coping at its centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311431176">Leventhal et al., 2008</xref>). The influence of social support in buffering the effects of stressors on physiological reactivity and immune function is at the forefront of such work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311431176">Cohen and Wills, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311431176">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). However, only recently has it been advocated that these processes may be driven by a further construct, that of an underlying human need for social belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311431176">Dickerson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311431176">Baumeister and Leary’s (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431176">2000</xref>) ‘belongingness hypothesis’, human beings have a fundamental need to acquire and maintain an optimal number of positive, accepting and sustained interpersonal relationships, and will experience decrements in functioning resulting from acceptance threat or perceived social rejection. This concept of ‘belonging’, as a core human need, is recognized from a number of influential theoretical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311431176">Deci and Ryan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311431176">Maslow, 1970</xref>). The belongingness hypothesis theorized about the pervasive nature and impact of optimal belongingness levels, perceived belongingness threat and rejection, on both short- and long-term health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311431176">Baumeister and Leary, 1995</xref>). However, this inference was not tested directly with empirical data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431176">Baumeister and Leary (2000)</xref> themselves observed that the discipline of psychology has ‘underappreciated’ the importance of the need to belong. Recent research has begun to address directly the role of social belonging and threats to the social self on health symptoms.</p>
<p>Conceptually rooted within belongingness theory is the role of self-esteem as a ‘sociometer’ or ‘gauge’ of social inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311431176">Leary and Downs, 1995</xref>). The specific role of self-esteem in mediating the relationship between belonging and aversive responses has rarely been considered with regard to health. In this theory, state self-esteem is viewed as a monitor of current belongingness perceptions, and trait self-esteem as a longer-term gauge of belongingness perceptions over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311431176">Leary, 2005</xref>). Evidence and arguments supporting the theory have particular application within a health context, relating to psychophysiological reactivity, and the development of appropriate interventions to re-‘calibrate’ sociometer sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311431176">Dandeneau and Baldwin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311431176">Murray et al., 2003</xref>: 66). The mediating role of self-esteem in linking the social environment to health was supported in one piece of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311431176">Stinson et al., 2008</xref>), though alternative models were also proposed.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, evidence has emerged in support of a direct relationship between perceived belonging and psychophysiological stress responses to socio-evaluative threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311431176">Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311431176">Kudielka et al., 2009</xref>), lower cortisol responses to acute social acceptance when compared with rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311431176">Blackhart et al., 2007</xref>) and the role of individual differences following rejection manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311431176">Zoccola et al., 2008</xref>). Within a naturalistic setting, belonging support has also been implicated in lower mean salivary cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311431176">Turner-Cobb et al., 2000</xref>). Based on this research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311431176">Kemeny (2009)</xref> put forward a conceptual model linking perceived belongingness threat and chronic belongingness levels to longer-term hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and immune function. Such findings indicate links between belongingness and health which are of relevance across a wide range of settings and outcomes. The need for greater understanding of the mechanisms by which belongingness may operate to influence health, including the role of self-esteem as a potential mediator of this relationship warrants further attention, particularly given the implications for inclusion in health promotion and practice.</p>
<p>The vast majority of research to date relating belongingness to health has manipulated belongingness levels through rejection threat or overt rejection within an experimental setting. Much of this work measures negative effects of rejection per se, rather than more positive effects of perceived belonging. Such a focus is reflected in a relative absence of standard scales available to measure the inclusive construct of belongingness. Measures which do exist often reflect alternative theoretical paradigms, such as ‘self-determination theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311431176">Gagné, 2003</xref>) or ‘social connectedness theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311431176">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). An emphasis on domain-specific scales such as home, or school/work belongingness further compounds this measurement issue, given that each of these components has been recognized as contributing to a more global sense of belonging within diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311431176">Heinrich and Gullone, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One specific population for whom the role of belongingness has been found to have important outcomes is that of adolescents. Research has linked belongingness perceptions during adolescence to academic achievement and psychological adjustment; and lack of belonging to behavioural dysfunction and substance misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311431176">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311431176">Gregory and Weinstein, 2004</xref>). Yet the relevance of belongingness to physical health within this population remains neglected.</p>
<p>The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of domain specific and inclusive belongingness levels on acute physical health symptoms and mood in a sample of young adolescents in a naturalistic, non-laboratory setting. It was hypothesized that inclusive belongingness levels would be associated with self-reported physical health symptoms and positive/negative mood. Perceived belongingness within different environmental domains (‘home’, ‘school’ and ‘community’) were hypothesized to have both separable and cumulative impact on symptoms and mood. It was anticipated that self-esteem would function as a route through which belongingness levels would impact upon health and mood outcomes.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Participants completed the following self-report measures.</p>
<sec id="section4-1359105311431176">
<title>Perceived physical symptoms</title>
<p>Acute physical symptoms experienced over the past four weeks were assessed using a 21-item symptoms checklist derived from the 33-item Cohen–Hoberman Inventory of physical symptoms (CHIPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311431176">Cohen and Hoberman, 1983</xref>). Items included: ‘headache’, and ‘feeling weak all over’, rated on a five-point scale: 0 = ‘Didn’t bother me at all’ to 4 = ‘Bothered me a lot’. Reliability in the current sample (α = .88) matched that of previously reported samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311431176">Cohen and Hoberman, 1983</xref>). As the original CHIPS was designed for use in adult populations, a number of items were excluded as being inappropriate for a young-adolescent population, for example ‘weight change’ and ‘poor appetite’ (items excluded: 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 26, 29, 31 and 32).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311431176">
<title>Positive and negative mood</title>
<p>Participants reported mood experienced over the past four weeks using the ‘Positive and Negative Affect Schedule’ (PANAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311431176">Watson et al., 1988</xref>). Comprising two 10-item mood scales, 10 items related to positive affect (PA), for example ‘interested’; and 10 items to negative affect (NA), for example ‘distressed’. Each item was rated on a five-point scale: 1 = ‘Very slightly or not at all’ to 5 = ‘Extremely’. PA/NA scales report a reliability of α = .86 and α = .87 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311431176">Watson et al., 1988</xref>), and α = .80 and α = .83 in the current population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311431176">
<title>Self-esteem</title>
<p>Self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311431176">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>), a 10-item measure of self-worth answered on a four-point scale: 3 = ‘Strongly agree’ to 0 = ‘Strongly disagree’, including statements, for example, ‘On the whole, I am satisfied with myself’, exhibiting a reliability of α = .73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311431176">Laible et al., 2004</xref>) and α = .88 in the current sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311431176">
<title>Belongingness</title>
<p>Assessed using three separate measures:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105311431176" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>School – perceived belonging within the everyday school-setting was measured using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311431176">Goodenow’s (1993)</xref> 18-item ‘Psychological sense of school membership’ (PSSM) scale. Statements such as, ‘I feel a real part of … school’, were answered on a five-point scale: 0 = ‘Not at all true’ to 4 = ‘Completely true’. The measure showed reliabilities ranging from α = .77 to α = .88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311431176">Maddox and Prinz, 2003</xref>) and α = .89 in the current sample.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Community – perceived belonging within the local community was measured using the three-item belongingness subscale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311431176">Bollen and Hoyle’s (1990)</xref> six-item ‘Perceived Cohesion Scale’ (PCS). Participants responded to statements such as: ‘I feel that I am a member of the local community’, on an 11-point scale: 0 = ‘Strongly disagree’ to 10 = ‘Strongly agree’. Previous reliability for the measure was α = .94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311431176">Lim, 2007</xref>) and α = .90 within the current population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Home – taken from the 27-item ‘Family Relationships Index’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311431176">Moos, 1974</xref>), the nine-item ‘Family Cohesion Scale’ (FCS) assessed participants’ perceived belonging within the home environment. Using a two-point scale (0 = False; 1 = True) participants provided responses to statements such as: ‘Family members really back each other up’. Previous reliability for the 27-item scale was α = .89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311431176">Holahan and Moos, 1986</xref>) and α = .72 within the current sample.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Inclusive belongingness was assessed by combining scores from the PSSM, PCS and FCS, to obtain a total belongingness score. As scaling differed between measures, all scores were converted to a three-point scale. Factor analysis showed that the combined scale retained the original three component factors of ‘school’, ‘community’ and ‘home’ belonging. A reliability of α = .87 was shown.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311431176">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Following approval from the departmental ethical review panel, consent was obtained from the school head-teacher acting in loco parentis. Advance arrangements were made to carry out the research prior to contact with parents. Age-appropriate research information was conveyed in verbal and written form prior to participant consent provision. Confidential questionnaire booklets were completed in mixed-ability groups during two timetabled lesson-slots, administered by the regular class teacher under the guidance of the researcher. All sections of the booklets were read aloud to ensure participant understanding. An age-appropriate debrief sheet was provided, supplying researcher contact details and a list of school support services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105311431176">
<title>Statistical plan</title>
<p>Data were screened in order to meet normality assumptions. A small number of missing values and outliers (<italic>Z</italic>-score &gt; 3.29) were corrected via listwise-mean-substitution, and ‘one unit larger than next most extreme score’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311431176">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001</xref>: 59, 62, 71). No multicollinearity was present, all values being below the recommended level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311431176">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>Data were analysed via hierarchical regression and mediation analyses. Preliminary correlation analysis indicated associations between gender and both physical symptoms (<italic>r</italic> = .234; <italic>p</italic> = .003) and negative affect (<italic>r</italic> = .181; <italic>p</italic> = .022). Therefore, all further analyses controlled for gender, entered in block 1 of regressions. To highlight the unique contribution of belongingness variables to the outcome variables, these were entered in block 2, followed by self-esteem in block 3. Mediation analyses testing for indirect effects were carried out using bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311431176">Preacher and Hayes, 2008</xref>). A recommended ×5000 estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311431176">Hayes, 2009</xref>: 412) were used and ‘bias-corrected confidence intervals’ (BCCI) assessed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311431176">Table 2</xref> provides full descriptive and correlational details of psychosocial variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consistent with previous research relating social belonging with cognitive and behavioural responses, results supported the hypothesis of overall belongingness levels being associated with self-reported acute physical health symptoms and mood. Results were consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311431176">Baumeister and Leary’s (1995)</xref> theory and extend the application of belongingness within the health domain. Participants presenting with greater perceived belongingness reported fewer physical symptoms, lower levels of negative mood and higher levels of positive mood. As such, findings indicate that perceived inadequacy of belongingness was directly related to decrements in health and mood.</p>
<p>Anticipated cumulative effects of belongingness in different social domains were more equivocal. Relating to physical health, combined home and community belonging was associated with physical symptom reporting. However, this was not true of the relationship between domain-specific belonging and mood. Home belonging alone was associated with negative affect, and school belonging with positive affect. Interpreting these results based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311431176">Baumeister and Leary’s (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431176">2000</xref>) contention that individuals require an optimal number of close relationships, an absence of a consistent cumulative effect did not contravene the assumptions of belongingness theory. Rather, results served to highlight the importance of belongingness within particular settings (for example, home) for the physical health and mood of age-group concerned, which may in turn have protective effects beyond any immediate social environment in which adolescents find themselves.</p>
<p>Recognizing the widespread literature linking social support to physical health, it could be argued that the current findings merely replicate such previous research. However, this assumption would serve to underestimate the potential theoretical and practical contributions of the belongingness hypothesis for application within the field of health. In conceptualizing belongingness as a fundamental need equating to a salient social stressor when denied, chronic exposure to a perceived lack of belonging has relevant implications for physical health on a number of levels. For example, by framing belongingness within the concept of allostatic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311431176">McEwen, 1998</xref>), ongoing perceptions of low belonging or repeated rejection exposure, the psychophysiological mechanisms by which illness can occur are well recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311431176">Dickerson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311431176">Kemeny, 2009</xref>). Similarly, links between belongingness and self-regulation have implications for both health behaviours and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311431176">Blackhart et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, from a health perspective, belongingness represents an important concept warranting further research and with significant potential for inclusion in interventions to promote adolescent health.</p>
<p>Hypothesized links between perceived belonging and self-esteem, with resultant impact upon physical symptoms and mood were also shown, implying support for sociometer theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311431176">Leary and Downs, 1995</xref>). Extended in the current research to highlight physical health as an end-point, self-esteem mediated the relationship between inclusive belonging and both physical health and mood. While interpreting results with caution, it could be argued that in influencing levels of self-esteem, belongingness operates through self-esteem to impact upon physical symptom levels. Though further longitudinal work is required to confirm this relationship, the implications for theoretically driven, health-related intervention designs are apparent. Use of self-esteem boosting interventions, particularly promoting healthy behaviours in adolescents is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311431176">Bos et al., 2006</xref>). However, whether such interventions are directly impacting self-esteem, or acting upon belongingness levels as a determinant of self-esteem has yet to be fully considered. A greater understanding of the mediation processes linking belonging to health has a vital role to play in informing future intervention design.</p>
<p>Despite the novel application of these findings, the data reflect initial associations which require more substantial validation of relationships between belongingness and health. Importantly, it is acknowledged that the study design is cross-sectional and neither causality nor directional predictions can be made. Future research with longitudinal designs capable of making more substantive claims regarding causality and direction of effects is crucial.</p>
<p>Within the study, although physical symptoms and mood were conceptualized as separate outcome variables, this was not to imply that mood and physical health acted independently of one other. There is wide recognition of the links between negative mood and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311431176">Cohen et al., 1993</xref>), and links between these variables were shown in current findings suggesting that negative mood might underlie symptom-reporting regardless of belongingness. However, inclusive belonging and negative mood were also associated, implying that belonging had partial influence over negative mood levels themselves. Speculatively, the effects of belongingness might contribute to negative mood which in turn carry over these effects to impact upon physical health outcomes. Belongingness alone could not fully explain negative mood levels however. Other contributing factors and intervening processes would likely explicate negative mood and resultant effects on health in greater detail. Further research, applying more extensive analytical modelling of these inter-relationships is necessary in order to explore these intricacies and the specific implications of belongingness for health more fully.</p>
<p>The use of combined scales to derive an inclusive level of belonging across social domains appeared effective in tapping overall belonging in relation to health. However, while school and community measures were rooted in concept of belongingness, home belonging measured the overlapping construct of family cohesion. Reflecting the absence of adequate belongingness measures currently available, the need for development of a theoretically driven generic measure of global belongingness is apparent. Distinguishing belongingness as a global construct and fundamental need related to health outcome is necessary in considering development of future measures. Whether belonging can be conceptualized as a higher-order structure in which social support is nested and whether all social support carries with it an element of belonging is yet to be fully explored. The potentially differential effects of social support versus inclusive belonging were not tested in this study, and social support as a component of belonging might have contributed to health outcomes reported. Future research is needed to distinguish more concretely between belonging and social support and to define these boundaries in order to delineate clearly differences in health outcome. In the present study, lack of belongingness was taken to infer greater physiological stress, but this was not directly measured. Future work would benefit from including direct measures of self-reported and physiological stress in order to test the ability of belongingness to protect against stress and in what way that is distinguishable from the buffering effects of social support. Furthermore, the use of self-report measures is subject to potential response bias. Use of objective measures such as clinical examination of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311431176">Turner Cobb and Steptoe, 1998</xref>) and other sources (e.g. parents, teachers, peers) is recommended in future research. Similarly, the results are not generalizable beyond the age-group studied and cannot be applied to similarly aged adolescents outside mainstream education (e.g. due to ‘home-schooling’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311431176">Ystgaard, 1996</xref>). Despite these limitations, the current project was effective in highlighting the need for more widespread recognition of the belongingness hypothesis and its relevance to adolescent health symptoms and mood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study builds upon previous work investigating the impact of social belonging on psychological functioning, and links between rejection threat and psychophysiological responses. In showing the significant associations of perceived belonging on physical symptom reporting and mood within a naturalistic setting, results reflect a growing awareness of the contribution of belongingness to physical health. Extending this theory to highlight the role of self-esteem in mediating the effects of belongingness, results provide a unique insight into one mechanism by which belongingness might operate. Findings emphasize the relevance of belongingness as a fundamental need and self-esteem’s role as a social gauge, with both theoretical and practical applications directly relevant to health-related social and emotional functioning in early adolescence.</p>
