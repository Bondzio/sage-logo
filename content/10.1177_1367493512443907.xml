<abstract>
<p>The focus of children’s healthcare literature has been the delivery of services to children and their parents, little attention has been paid to how children cope with receiving such care. In this paper we use a literature scoping method to bring together the literature on how medical talk can engage or isolate children, consider the environmental factors which can help children to be engaged and discuss an ethical symmetry approach. We propose that an ethical symmetry approach would provide a framework for healthcare teams to explore how to optimize children’s engagement with their healthcare.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many healthcare professionals would prefer not to work with children; they often express admiration for those who do by saying ‘I don’t know how you do children’s care, I know I couldn’t do it’. Delivering healthcare to children takes particular psychological toughness, for medical interventions are often painful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512443907">Carter et al., 2002</xref>), embarrassing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512443907">Meerabeau, 1999</xref>) and, arguably, as de-humanizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512443907">Liaschenko, 1998</xref>) for children as they are for adults. Those who elect to deliver care to children often evolve defence mechanisms to compensate for inflicting painful, embarrassing and de-humanizing medical treatment on children. Chief amongst these defence mechanisms is that medical interventions are intended to deliver benefit to the child. Arguably another defence mechanism is a collective denial, in that there seems to have been little focus in the children’s healthcare literature on how practitioners can ameliorate the effects of delivering medical interventions upon children.</p>
<p>We assume a position in which children are recognized as full social actors, who are competent growing humans, capable of forming opinions and, given help and support, of expressing their own views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512443907">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512443907">Mayall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512443907">Prout, 2001</xref>). We recognize the rights of children to be heard when developing healthcare which is designed to meet their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512443907">Moules, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367493512443907">United Nations, 1989</xref>). A position in which the child is seen as an expert in understanding how they feel and in what they believe they understand about their medical care.</p>

<title>Literature scoping</title>
<p>The discussion which follows is based on a scoping review of the literature using the method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512443907">Arksey and O’Malley (2005</xref>). Our purpose being to summarize and disseminate the broad range of studies related to how children cope with receiving healthcare, not to evaluate methodologically similar studies and attempt to generalize or transfer findings. The question we attempt to answer is: <italic>What research exists concerning how children cope with receiving healthcare interventions? </italic>Electronic databases and personal contacts of both authors were used to search for relevant literature. Studies written in English published between 1991 and 2011 and relevant to the topic were included (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512443907">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Medical talk</title>
<p>The child is often silenced or restricted within medical talk, not acknowledged as an expert about themselves, or encouraged to participate in medical consultations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367493512443907">Tates and Meeuwesen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367493512443907">van Dulmen, 1998</xref>). It is the child’s experience, their understanding of how they feel, which should position them as expert, but all too often does not. When children are not active participants, when they are not recognized as capable, not only do their opinions not get shared, their talk, which is rich in information to support diagnosis and treatment options, understandings and abilities to cope gets lost.</p>
<p>Not fully engaging children in medical interactions leads them to being less likely to actively engage, manage and cope with their own medical condition and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512443907">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>), and suggests that adults do not view them as competent or knowledgeable. Waksler (1991) suggests there are two prevalent beliefs regarding children’s competencies which are suggestive of why children are not included in medical talk.</p>
<p>Similar to the thoughts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493512443907">Stivers (2001</xref>), the first belief is that adults think of children as immature, as ‘not knowing’. The second belief is that ‘children are routinely wrong, in error, and don’t understand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367493512443907">Waksler, 1991</xref>: 76). The immaturity belief stems from understandings of developmental age-related norms, based on Piagetian beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512443907">Hedegaard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512443907">Piaget and Inhelder, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493512443907">Walkerdine, 1993</xref>), and Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493512443907">Walkerdine, 1993</xref>). Prevalent in healthcare, these supposed norms do not take into account the lived experience of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493512443907">Vygotsky, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Developmental age-stage beliefs and Developmentally Appropriate Practice either under- or overestimate the abilities and competencies of many children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512443907">Alderson et al., 2006</xref>), and do not acknowledge the ability of children to recall events they have experienced with significant clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367493512443907">Zwiers and Morrissette, 1999</xref>). Although detail may be lacking, children as young as three years of age are able to recall and describe experiences which have some meaning for them.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals say they do not engage children or that children are not able to be engaged because children do not have the language, or cognitive ability to articulate their view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493512443907">Stivers, 2001</xref>), they do not know how to talk with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493512443907">Smith and Callery, 2005</xref>) and they believe that children do not understand medical talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512443907">Hallowell, 2008</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493512443907">Wassmer et al. (2004</xref>) suggest that children can be engaged in their medical care and supported to cope with medical procedures if they are included in the medical interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512443907">Alderson et al. (2006</xref>) found that children as young as four years of age were able to understand their medical condition and were able to make decisions related to managing, engaging and coping which were viewed as competent. The children were seen as experts in how they felt and became experts in how to manage their own health care.</p>
<p>The paediatric medical consultation exists as a triad – a child patient, a parent and a healthcare professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512443907">Bury et al., 2004</xref>). In adult medical consultations it is a dyad – the adult patient and the healthcare professional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493512443907">Stivers (2001</xref>) showed that in a paediatric medical consultation, no matter how questions were directed, within a short time frame, the parent will intervene and the consultation about the child is then had between the parent and the healthcare professional The child no longer is in a position to tell their story or share their knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512443907">Alderson (2007</xref>) has shown that the information given by child and parent differ significantly and may not represent the child’s feelings and understandings and ability to engage. Given that parents’ views are not a proxy for those of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367493512443907">Scott, 2008</xref>), it can be argued that healthcare professionals have a responsibility to educate children in matters that concern their health and with coping related to medical procedures. Children in dyads had access to more knowledge and information than children who were silenced by the fact that their medical interaction occurred as a triad, with a parent in the interaction. The response of the child was competent as it related to understandings of him or herself and coping. Giving accounts of their own experiences children are reliable informants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512443907">Lamb et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature and clinical evidence suggests that children do want information related to medical procedures, enabling them to make decisions about medical treatments, engagement and coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512443907">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>), but are frequently unable to obtain that in a meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493512443907">Smith and Callery, 2005</xref>). When unable to get the information they need, children will seek out information from a variety of formats including listening to conversations of adults in which the constructs and language does not take into account the child’s understandings nor their need to know, with no opportunity for corrections and connections to be made. Information passed on by a healthcare worker reduces the chances that information is sought from unreliable sources such as friends or television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367493512443907">Rugg and von Baeyer, 2000</xref>). Misinformation results in poor understandings of medical procedures. Inappropriate or misunderstood language can exacerbate this situation. Language used when preparing children for medical procedures needs to be clear and appropriate to the child. Expressions used by children to express pain or discomfort vary with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367493512443907">Stanford et al., 2005</xref>). There is merit in providing information to children using the words they understand as opposed to the words it is thought they understand. Vygotsky (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512443907">Daniels, 2005</xref>) talks of children being able to internalize words and understand them before they spontaneously use them. It is not suggested that healthcare workers should try to share the most technical aspects of their knowledge with children; it is suggested that the knowledge most pertinent to the child’s understandings of conditions and treatments should be conveyed and delivered in a way that is readily understood. Clinical experience suggests that in the main, information imparted by healthcare providers, is currently done in ways that hinder understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512443907">Hallowell, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Paulo Freire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512443907">1970</xref>), critiques a model of education in which teachers deposit knowledge and directives into passive recipients as though they were empty vessels or bank accounts. Freire advocated instead a relationship between the teacher and learner that acknowledges what learners can impart to teachers. His model is one in which learning travels in both directions. Applying this to the relationship between children and healthcare workers recognizes the unique store of expert knowledge possessed by children, suggesting they are competent beings, which can be as crucial for positive treatment outcomes as is the expert knowledge of health workers.</p>
<p>Although children want to be consulted in matters which effect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493512443907">Smith and Callery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367493512443907">Stafford et al., 2003</xref>), all too often they are not included in the medical consultation. Providing children with information about medical procedures supports them in being able to engage with the medical procedure, becoming active participants rather than passive recipients of their care. Children who are better informed, receiving appropriate and timely information, generally have better healthcare outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512443907">Claar et al., 2002</xref>)</p>

<title>Helping children cope: designing the environment</title>
<p>Informing children about impending medical procedures should not be thought of as a single isolated intervention, with information being passed from the health professional to the child. It should be seen as a social process with interactions between the child and his or her environment. A process of continuing communication, information provision, commences when a child first learns or discovers something about an impending procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512443907">Jaaniste et al., 2007</xref>). Questions and concerns arise as the child tries to integrate new information with existing understandings. Some concerns may be addressed pre-emptively. Others require an environment in which children’s questions and concerns may be raised and discussed.</p>
<p>Accurate information provision leads to more accurate expectations of the medical procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512443907">Claar et al., 2002</xref>), including the sights, sounds and smells of the space where that procedure will occur. When expectations match the procedure, healthcare professionals find that the child is more cooperative and the medical procedure is more easily managed (Mahajen et al., 1998). Being able to accurately assess the potential of the medical experience gives space to focus on other aspects of the medical procedure such as active coping strategies, positioning and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512443907">Comfort Kids, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Providing medical procedure information to children requires time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512443907">Jaaniste et al., 2007</xref>), and specifically should:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>provide the child with information to identify and refine the most appropriate strategies to engage with the procedure</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>give children opportunities to make choices where appropriate. Choice can be related to positioning for procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512443907">Comfort Kids, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367493512443907">Sparks et al., 2007</xref>), use of mask or cannula for induction, the type of distraction to be used or the decision to use or not a local anaesthetic cream.</p>
</list-item>

<p>support the child to develop accurate expectations of the procedure</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>be conducted in a time frame, which allows the child the opportunity to assimilate information and consider options to engage with coping strategies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>contain procedural and sensory information of the procedure itself and the environment it will occur in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367493512443907">Spafford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367493512443907">Tak and van Bon, 2006</xref>). The addition of detailed sensory information has been shown to be more effective than procedural information alone.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Information can be provided in a variety of ways, from a conversation with a healthcare worker, to the discussion of a picture storybook or to medical preparation sessions. Accurate, relevant information may result in improved child coping/engagement which allows procedures to be less stressful and easier to manage.</p>
<p>The medical preparation process includes the child being able to engage or disengage, seek further information or avoid it. Signalled by the child’s questions and their non-verbal behaviour, information can be expanded on or withheld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367493512443907">Snow, 1999</xref>). Medical preparation requires specificity to support identification and refinement of information related to healthcare information. Environment includes the physical, the equipment provided and the personnel – that is, who is delivering the information.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the efficacy of information provision is improved if carried out by an authoritative adult, rather than a well-informed parent, this is yet to be tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512443907">Jaaniste et al., 2007</xref>). What has been shown is that peer modelling of medical procedures is more effective than adult modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493512443907">Ryalls et al., 2000</xref>). Words used to describe a medical procedure may be spoken, but also written with the use of children’s picture books, specific to the location and process of the procedure becoming more commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512443907">Manworren and Woodring, 1998</xref>). Picture books are more appealing and therefore more likely to be engaged with than written text, and give access to dual coded information – information in written and pictorial formats which enhances comprehension and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512443907">Brookshire et al., 2002</xref>) and improves retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512443907">McGuigan and Salmon, 2005</xref>). All too often medical procedures are described in less than optimum circumstances, such as when the child is in the waiting room, or as it fits in best with the healthcare provider’s timetable or with the available space. Alternatively, information is mailed to the child’s home, with little or no opportunity for follow-up related to understanding and the ability to engage. Although it is unknown how far in advance information about medical procedures should be given to a child, it is suggested that timing can influence how readily a child is able to attend to, process and act on information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512443907">Rollins et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Ethical symmetry: a total cultural approach to child-centred care</title>
<p>In practical terms, healthcare for children needs to be refocused, such that healthcare services are re-designed from the perspective of the children who receive the healthcare interventions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512443907">Randall (2011</xref>) has argued that currently children’s nursing care is shaped by gendered political and professional agendas. He proposes that ethical symmetry can be used to construct care which is child focused. Ethical symmetry was first outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512443907">Christensen and Prout (2002</xref>) in relation to researching with children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512443907">Randall (2011</xref>) has applied the concept to children’s nursing. Ethical symmetry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512443907">Randall (2011</xref>) argues, can provide a philosophical basis for developing children’s healthcare. It has three principles, firstly that adults reject their assumptions about children. This critical approach to adults’ understanding about children’s abilities seems particularly useful in understanding how children can cope with healthcare interventions. Rather than relying on developmental-psychology-staged approaches to children’s cognitive abilities, adults would look to the second principle which is that rather than accepting assumptions about children, adults explore the abilities of children and their individual ways of communicating within communities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512443907">Christensen (2004</xref>) has termed how children communicate within social contexts as ‘cultures of communication’. She points out that this includes non-verbal communication, image making, that which is left unsaid, as well as spoken language. Finally, the third principle requires adults to understand their interaction with children within a social context of the child’s childhood and social/cultural context. Ethical symmetry suggests symmetry between how adults are treated and how children are treated, however the third principle sets this symmetry in a social context. Asymmetry, or the difference in the approaches to children’s healthcare, may be justified as children are not mini adults, but developing competent humans living a socially and politically constructed childhood.</p>
<p>Thus using ethical symmetry requires healthcare workers to think critically about their assumptions, to understand how children communicate and to place a symmetrical approach in a social context. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512443907">Randall (2010</xref>) found that for some children receiving nursing care from a nurse of the opposite sex caused embarrassment. Popovich’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512443907">2000</xref>) survey of nurses would suggest that they assume that sexuality develop in children in later adolescence, yet observation of children in hospital and community settings suggest that much younger children are embarrassed by healthcare interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512443907">Popovich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512443907">Randall, 2010</xref>). Using the first principle of ethical symmetry healthcare workers would question whether delivering an intervention is embarrassing to children. They would use the second principle to observe whether children are communicating their discomfort at receiving the intervention, this might include observing how children avoid or delay receiving an intervention. Applying the third principle, it may be helpful to explore with children their views of receiving care from healthcare workers of the opposite sex. Some children may understand adult health conventions (i.e. that allowing access to one’s body and disclosing intimate details is accepted within a patient–professional relationship), for other children this may not be the case and the delivery of healthcare by the opposite sex may have implications in the child’s understanding of sexual conventions and socially acceptable behaviours. For some children, avoiding embarrassment during the delivery of health care may have wide implication for the child’s social and sexual development.</p>
<p>Putting ethical symmetry into action requires a cultural shift in health organizations: away from care which is constructed on consumerist and professional agendas to viewing the care offered and received by children through a lens which accounts for children as they live their childhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367493512443907">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Staged developmental models and theories have promoted a view of children as incompetent adults (James et al., 1989), beings becoming rather than competent developing humans living a childhood. Because healthcare workers have adopted these staged psychological developmental theories they have often excluded children from involvement in their own healthcare. We have argued in this paper that a new lens is required to view healthcare for children from the perspective of those children who receive healthcare. This lens would allow health workers to examine the assumptions they make about children’s abilities, and explore how children’s own resourcefulness can be encouraged to support their efforts to cope with medical and health interventions which may cause pain or embarrassment or be de-humanizing. To successfully switch to viewing healthcare from the perspective of the children receiving it requires a cultural shift away from viewing parents or carers of children as the proxy patient, and away from a professional agenda towards understanding how healthcare interventions are experienced from the child’s perspective. Ethical symmetry provides a framework of principles, which could underpin such a refocusing of healthcare.</p>
<p>Understanding that children are full social actors and people with their own human rights means that healthcare professionals take on a responsibility to provide healthcare which respects children as human beings. Faced with the fact that much of what they do in delivering healthcare is painful, embarrassing and may leave children feeling violated, health workers have a duty to act to mitigate these effects. It may not be possible to provide pain-free, non-stigmatizing and entirely positive healthcare for children, but it must be a priority to try.</p>
