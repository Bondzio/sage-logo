<abstract>
<p>Hyperammonemia is a metabolic derangement that can be potentially fatal. Primary hyperammonemia due to urea cycle enzyme deficiency is usually discovered in neonates but rarely can present in adulthood. Late-onset manifestations of urea cycle disorders can go unnoticed, until they become life threatening. The authors report a 28-year-old man who developed hyperammonemia in the hospital following parenteral nutrition (PN), leading to cerebral edema, which was fatal despite resolution of the hyperammonemia with cessation of PN and the use of continuous renal replacement therapy.</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A 28-year-old man was admitted with a history of fever, chills, dysuria, and altered mental status. Per his family, his oral intake had been poor since childhood, and he was always lagging behind his peers in weight. He had been advised multiple times by his physician to increase his protein intake, but the patient was nonadherent, complaining that high-protein foods “taste bad.” Past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus and paraplegia with neurogenic bladder and bowel, secondary to a gunshot wound 7 years previously, complicated by recurrent urinary tract infections and decubitus ulcer.</p>
<p>Upon admission, his blood pressure was 96/72 mm Hg with a heart rate of 112 beats/min, he was afebrile, and his body mass index was 16 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. He was found to have stage IV decubitus ulcers on the sacrum, which appeared clean, with an in situ urinary catheter. He was alert and oriented but had severe muscular atrophy of the calves and thighs. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. His hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL (12–15.0 g/dL) (numbers in parentheses = normal range), white blood cell count was 16.7 k/mm<sup>3</sup> (3.5–10.6 k/mm<sup>3</sup>), platelet count was 306 (150–450 k/mm<sup>3</sup>), serum sodium was 146 mmol/L (135–147 mmol/L), serum potassium was 2.8 mmol/L (3.5–5.3 mmol/L), serum urea nitrogen was 1 mg/dL (7–20 mg/dL), serum creatinine was 0.5 mg/dL (0.4–1.2 mg/dL), serum albumin was 0.7 g/dL (3.5–5.2 g/dL), serum magnesium was 1.4 mg/dL (1.6–3.0 g/dL), and serum phosphorus was 1.8 mg/dL (2.3–5.0 mg/dL). Serum transaminases were normal. His urine analysis showed 1+ protein, with a spot urine protein/creatinine of 0.6 g protein/g creatinine. On admission, he also had a computed tomography (CT) scan of his brain that was normal. In view of his hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, he was treated with normal saline boluses, potassium and magnesium replacement, and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Over the course of the next 2 days, there was significant improvement of urinary symptoms with normalization of white blood cell count and return of mental status back to his baseline. In view of his poor nutrition status and to improve healing of his chronic decubitus ulcers, he was offered a high-protein diet, which he did not consume. He was then started on parenteral nutrition (PN; FreAmine, Braun Medical Inc) with a protein content of 1.85 g per kilogram bodyweight in 24 hours. One day, after the patient was initiated on PN, he was found unresponsive in his room with respiratory distress and hypotension. He was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated to protect his airways. He had a repeat CT scan of the brain that showed diffuse brain edema along with medial displacement of the temporal lobe and downward displacement of the tonsils. Signs of arterial compression were also noted. He was found to have mixed severe respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis with an arterial blood pH of 7.615 (7.35–7.45), arterial blood PCO<sub>2</sub> of 23 mm Hg (36–45 mm Hg), arterial blood PO<sub>2</sub> of 184 mm Hg, and arterial blood gas bicarbonate of 25 mEq/L (22–28 mEq/L) with a corresponding anion gap of 6 mmol/L. His workup for sudden-onset altered mental status revealed a blood ammonia level of 503 µmol/L, which increased to 683 µmol/L (11–32 µmol/L) over the course of the next 4 hours. His transaminases, bilirubin levels, and coagulation profile were within normal limits. His serum phosphorus and potassium were within normal limits. In view of his rapidly worsening neurological status, along with worsening ammonia level and hypotension, his PN was stopped, and he was initiated on continuous renal replacement therapy. He was also started on IV L-arginine HCl 10% 200 mg/kg/d, along with sodium phenyl acetate, and sodium benzoate 250 mg/kg/d to facilitate ammonia metabolism through the alternate pathway. To protect the brain from deleterious effects of hyperammonemia, a hypothermia protocol was also initiated. In view of worsening neurological status with radiological evidence of brain edema, he was also started on IV mannitol. Over the course of next 36 hours, his blood ammonia level came down to 58 µmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112447815">Figure 1</xref>). He had a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast showing mild fatty liver without any evidence of any intestinal obstruction. His hepatitis virus panel was negative. To rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus, he had electroencephalogram monitoring, which showed only generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy. Review of his past medical records for the past 10 years showed that his serum urea nitrogen had always been low in the range of 1–4 mg/dL. Sudden-onset altered mental status with hyperammonemia, a history of persistently low serum urea nitrogen (which had been attributed to low protein intake), and severe respiratory alkalosis with normal transaminases and coagulation profile, in the setting of administering high-protein PN, pointed to the possibility of an inherited urea cycle disorder. The possibility of a portasystemic shunt was ruled out, as he had a normal upper endoscopy 5 months back. Workup for urea cycle disorders was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112447815">Figure 2</xref>) and revealed that he had a low serum citrulline level of 12 µmol/L (16–55 µmol/L), low serum arginine level of 17 µmol/L (21–157 µmol/L), high serum glutamine level of 1120 µmol/L (42–760 µmol/L), and low urine orotic acid of 1 µmol/mol creatinine (1–11 µmol/mol creatinine). His urine organic acidosis screening was negative. Because citrulline is almost exclusively produced in the enterocytes from glutamine and arginine, serum citrulline can be used as a marker of normal enterocyte mass. Our patient had no history of any bowel surgeries and had a normal CT scan of the abdomen, which ruled out the possibility of any enterocyte dysfunction as the cause for low citrulline. All these results suggested a urea cycle enzymatic disorder, either carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency (CPS1) or its cofactor N-acetyl glutamate synthetase. To differentiate between these two, a confirmatory test would have been a liver biopsy with enzymatic study, but unfortunately, his neurological status continued to worsen. A repeat CT scan showed increasing cerebral edema with tonsillar herniation. Repeat neurological evaluation showed evidence of brain death, and the family decided to withdraw care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with acute hyperammonemia have significant morbidity as well as mortality. Ammonia metabolism involves production as well as degradation. The majority of ammonia production is from the gut, but it is also produced from the kidney as well as muscle. Ammonia generation in kidneys is in response to maintenance of an acid base balance.</p>
<p>Metabolism of ammonia to urea happens in the liver through the urea cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112447815">Figure 3</xref>). A person can develop hyperammonemia when the liver is dysfunctional, when the ammonia production exceeds the metabolic capacity of the liver, or when there are enzymatic disorders of the urea cycle. Hepatic etiology is the most common cause for hyperammonemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112447815">1</xref></sup> In patients with normal liver function, like our patient, we should consider other possible causes such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, medications (valproic acid, salicylates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112447815">2</xref></sup> carbamazepine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112447815">3</xref></sup> ribavarin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112447815">4</xref></sup> sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112447815">5</xref></sup> and glycine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112447815">6</xref></sup>), urease-producing bacterial infections (<italic>Klebsiella, Proteus</italic>), gastric bypass, hyperalimentation, multiple myeloma, and urea cycle disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112447815">7</xref></sup> Whenever a urea cycle disorder is suspected, quantitative plasma and urine amino acids, urine organic acid, and urine orotic acid should be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112447815">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Urea cycle disorders are genetic disorders due to the deficiency of the urea cycle enzymes usually present in infancy and early childhood. Rarely, it can present in adulthood when patients are exposed to increased protein intake or certain medications and infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112447815">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112447815">9</xref></sup> Urea cycle disorders have a reported incidence of 1 in 25,000–30,000 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112447815">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112447815">11</xref></sup> Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and CPS1 are the two most common urea cycle disorders diagnosed in adults.</p>
<p>CPS1 is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of the urea cycle with an estimated prevalence of around 1 per million. CPS1 catalyses is the first step in the urea cycle in which ammonia is converted to carbamyl phosphate with the help of cofactor N-acetyl glutamate (NAG), which is synthesized by N-acetyl glutamate synthetase (NAGS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112447815">9</xref></sup> The CPS1 gene is located on chromosome 2. Around 14 mutations have been described in the CPS1 gene. Usually, it presents in children, but it has been reported in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112447815">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112447815">9</xref></sup> Deficiency of NAGS mimics CPS1 deficiency because it is a cofactor to activate CPS1. Complete deficiency of NAGS usually presents in childhood, but partial deficiency can present in adulthood when exposed to stresses such as valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits CPS1 by increasing propionic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112447815">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>CPS1 deficiency in infancy presents with poor feeding, irritability, somnolence, persistent vomiting, and respiratory distress. CPS1 deficiency in adulthood can include asymptomatic or mild symptoms such as protein aversion, mild intellectual impairment, or learning difficulty. Most cases in adults with CPS1 symptomatic hyperammonemia are precipitated by stresses such as an intercurrent illness, pregnancy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112447815">12</xref></sup> or high protein load.</p>
<p>The immediate goal in hyperammonemia is rapid removal of ammonia to prevent cerebral damage. When the liver is unable to metabolize ammonia, elimination of ammonia is dependent on kidneys, muscles, and brain. The kidneys respond to hyperammonemia by increasing its elimination, whereas muscle and brain convert ammonia to glutamine. In the setting of acute hyperammonemia, astrocytes rapidly metabolize ammonia to glutamine, causing increasing intracellular osmolarity along with swelling and damage of the astrocytes. Cerebral blood flow increases, along with loss of autoregulation and decreased cerebral metabolism, leading to cerebral edema. Most of these changes happen when the arterial ammonia level is &gt;200 µmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112447815">13</xref></sup> Also, in acute hyperammonemia, venous, arterial, and brain ammonia levels correlate with each other, unlike in chronic hyperammonemia; the arterial ammonia level also has direct correlation with glutamine level in the brain, which is responsible for increased intracranial pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112447815">14</xref></sup> Specific modalities to reduce cerebral edema include hypothermia (by decreasing free radical production, astrocyte swelling, and inflammation and improving autoregulation), N-acetyl cysteine, and mannitol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112447815">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Immediate management of hyperammonemia will include elimination of protein, along with glucose (12%–30%) and lipid infusion (20%), to provide supranormal calorie intake in the acute phase to enhance anabolism and IV infusion of sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate, which enhances metabolism of ammonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112447815">9</xref></sup> Lactulose, which is effective in chronic hyperammonemia, has not shown to have any effect on mortality in acute hyperammonemia. If the ammonia level is still &gt;100 µmol/L, management directed at rapid clearing of ammonia by extracorporeal circulation may be considered. All modalities such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112447815">8</xref></sup> and continuous venovenous hemofiltration have been reported to be effective. Early continuous venovenous hemofiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112447815">15</xref></sup> appears to be the most effective modality with removal of 12,600 µg of ammonia per hour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112447815">15</xref></sup> Once the acute hyperammonemic crisis is resolved, the mainstay of treatment will be dietary protein restriction with arginine or citrulline supplement, as well as facilitating ammonia metabolism using sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate. Further follow-up with serum glutamine will be able to predict hyperammonemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112447815">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Orthoptic liver transplantation should be considered in patients with a urea cycle disorder if they have severe disease (who present in the newborn period), progressive liver disease (argininosuccinate lyase deficiency), recurrent episodes of decompensation (despite optimal medical management), and poor access to tertiary care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112447815">16</xref></sup> Morioka et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112447815">17</xref></sup> reported a 5-year survival rate of 90% at 5 years after liver transplantation in 51 patients with urea cycle disorders. The need for dietary restriction and the need for ammonia scavengers such as sodium benzoate and sodium acetate were totally eliminated after liver transplantation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Urea cycle disorder is a heterogeneous group of disorders that, although commonly manifesting in infancy and children, can rarely manifest in adulthood. Adult patients may be totally asymptomatic until they are exposed to stresses such as infection or a high-protein diet, which can unmask the hyperammonemia and be fatal. Although our patient did not have any overt clinical manifestations, the fact that he had protein aversion and that his serum urea nitrogen had been very low for the past 10 years might have pointers to a possible urea cycle disorder. His exposure to high-protein PN may have been the main culprit for his acute decompensation with hyperammonemia. This case report is of significant importance, considering the fact that these disorders are very rare in adults and, therefore, not suspected. Our case also emphasizes the importance of instituting continuous venovenous hemofiltration, which will help in rapid clearance of ammonia.</p>
