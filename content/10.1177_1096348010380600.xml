<abstract>
<p>Casinos are important travel attractions, but they are often overshadowed by hardcore gambling behaviors. Although gambling has been found as a key tourism driver, it is unclear how casinos, as hospitality service providers, are able to fulfill other travel needs. This article highlights an emerging but under studied phenomenon in tourism and hospitality research: casino tourism. Based on empirical data collected in the world gaming capital, Macau, the results reveal that tourists’ casino excursions are primarily motivated by five factors: entertainment and novelty seeking, leisure activity, escape from pressure, casino sightseeing, and socialization. The findings suggest that although gambling is part of the casino experience tourists seek, mainland Chinese tourists are looking for assorted travel and leisure experiences. These experiences can further be classified into two segments: entertainment-for-socialization seekers and sightseeing-for-relaxation seekers. Demographic differences in addition to two- and three-way interactions of the motivational factors are also discussed.</p>

<p>When most people hear the names of major casino properties, such as the MGM Grand, the Venetian, the Wynn, and the Sands, they probably conjure an image of Las Vegas, Nevada. However, all these properties are also established in the world’s largest casino gambling market, located in a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong, namely, Macau, China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1096348010380600">Vong, 2009</xref>). Indeed, these world-class integrated casino properties have been serving as major travel attractions visited by tourists seeking a variety of travel and hedonic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010380600">C. Lam &amp; Vong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010380600">Luxury Travel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010380600">Rothrock, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although marketing and tourism researchers are beginning to discuss demographic inflows of tourists from mainland China into Macau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010380600">Hobson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010380600">Song &amp; Witt, 2006</xref>), we still lack an empirical understanding as to mainland tourists’ motivations for visiting casinos in this tiny strip of land that was once renowned for prostitution and gang battles. Yet popular press is laden with articles that seem to mystify Macau as the gold mine for major casino operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010380600">Chu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010380600">Gu &amp; Gao, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A review of the literature suggests that much research focuses the gaming affinity of the Chinese as based on their desire for financial rewards and willingness to take risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010380600">Ozorio &amp; Fong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010380600">Zeng &amp; Forrest, 2009</xref>). Studies from the gaming literature seem to suggest that Chinese are, by and large, fanatic about gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010380600">Fong &amp; Ozorio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010380600">Papineau, 2005</xref>). It is true that Macau is the only jurisdiction in China that legalizes casino gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348010380600">Vong, 2004</xref>), and the mainland Chinese burgeoning outbound market has been growing in a rapid pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010380600">Kim, Guo, &amp; Agrusa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1096348010380600">Zhang &amp; Heung, 2001</xref>). However, only 7% of Chinese visitors flock to Macau for hardcore gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348010380600">Macau Statistics and Census Service, 2009</xref>). Hence, the emergence of integrated casinos, which have been able to attract a huge influx of tourists, suggests that a more in-depth research effort with a broader population is needed.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is threefold. First, this article highlights an emerging but understudied phenomenon in tourism and hospitality: casino tourism. The tourism literature provides extensive coverage on motivational appeals to understand why excursionists visit specific places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010380600">Baloglu &amp; Uysal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010380600">Iso-Aloha, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380600">Lee, Lee, Bernhard, &amp; Yoon, 2006</xref>). This research applies the tourism motivation theory to explore Chinese mainlanders’ underpinning drivers on their casino visits. Second, this research aims to address the question of why Chinese flock to casinos in Macau. In doing so, we try to bridge the gap between travel research and hospitality research by illustrating how hospitality service establishments can be able to fulfill people’s travel needs. Third, to gain further insights, this research explores the main and interaction effects of the sociodemographic characteristics on casino visitors’ travel motives. Gaming operators and tourism planners alike could greatly benefit from understanding the psychological motivations that encourage mainland tourists to visit casinos, as their financial impact on favored gaming destinations will be noteworthy. This information will help marketers to better understand the Chinese casino tourists and to incorporate this data into strategic planning that can benefit the gaming cities that woo Chinese tourists, such as Macau, Las Vegas, Singapore, and Manila.</p>
<p>The plan for this article follows. First, we present a literature review that provides an overview of why tourists select specific destinations and the sociopsychology of gambling. We use this review to formulate key research questions concerning Chinese casino tourists. Next, we answer these questions from data collected from Chinese tourists in Macau. The results diminish the mystique of the Chinese gambling tourists; our conclusion shows that their motivations to travel to casino properties in Macau, such as to gamble, experience new, opulent hotels, shop, engage in fine dining, see the famed Cirque du Soleil show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1096348010380600">Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland, 2010</xref>) mirror many of those of Americans traveling to similar establishments in Las Vegas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010380600">Anonymous, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348010380600">Salomon, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1096348010380600">
<title>Travel Motivation</title>
<p>How could one possibly explain why 20 million Chinese visitors would travel to a tiny strip of land measuring 29 square kilometers? To answer this question, tourism researchers may turn to extant travel motivation studies to understand how tourists formulate travel destination choice decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010380600">Mansfeld, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380600">Pearce &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). In fact, a person’s motivation represents a force that underpins all travel activities in some manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010380600">Bieger &amp; Laesser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010380600">Crompton, 1979</xref>). Hence, it is not surprising that travel motivation influences tourists’ decisions and the experiences they seek.</p>
<p>The extant literature has acknowledged that tourists are generally motivated by both push and pull factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010380600">Baloglu &amp; Uysal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010380600">Iso-Aloha, 1982</xref>). Push factors are sociopsychological drivers that engender travel needs, such as the desire to acquire a variety of novel experience, to escape from daily life and obligations, and to seek opportunities to socialize with friends and family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010380600">Crompton, 1979</xref>). Pull factors are specific appeals that are used to induce an oasis tourism experience, such as well-designed architectures, shopping outlets, entertainment centers, and world-class services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010380600">Baloglu &amp; Uysal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010380600">Crompton, 1979</xref>). When these experiential travel needs are fulfilled, tourists are likely to be satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010380600">Kau &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348010380600">Ross &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1991</xref>) and hence increase their revisit propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010380600">Huang &amp; Hsu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010380600">Rittichainuwat, Qu, &amp; Leong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010380600">Schofield &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1096348010380600">
<title>Sociopsychology of Gambling</title>
<p>The literature has consistently suggested gambling and casino experiential needs as one important travel motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380600">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348010380600">McCartney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010380600">Park, Yang, Lee, Jang, &amp; Stokowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010380600">Rittichainuwat, Hailin, &amp; Mongkhonvanit, 2008</xref>). Prior research has offered extensive discussions of sociopsychological perspectives on gambling. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380600">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> identify socialization and learning, challenge, escape, and winning as benefits that gamblers seek. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010380600">Platz and Millar (2001)</xref> note that pathological gamblers are motivated to participate in gambling for winning, excitement, risk taking, autonomy, independence, escaping daily routine, exploration, being with friends, competence testing, control and power, and more. Although recreational gamblers are also looking for these benefits, pathological gamblers score significantly higher in these attributes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010380600">Cotte (1997)</xref> outlines a typology for gambling motives: economic, symbolic, and hedonic. The economic motives focus on mere financial rewards. Symbolic motives include perceived sense of control and escape from boredom. Hedonic motives include entertainment, play, diversion, self-esteem, self-image, positive reinforcement, and pleasure induction. Using an ethnographic approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010380600">Cotte (1997)</xref> develops an integrated framework that delineates gambling motives and behaviors in a purpose × focus × nature-of-consumption matrix. The matrix identifies gamblers’ cognitive and behavioral traits as means for learning and evaluation, rush (excitement), competing, commuting, self-definition, risk taking, cognitive self-classification, and emotional self-classification. Furthermore, the author suggests that gambling has been converged into an experiential consumption process as gamblers are increasingly searching for novelty, excitement, social gathering, and self-fulfillment. Hence, gambling is becoming a mainstream leisure activity as recreational gamblers are seeking to fulfill their hedonic and symbolic experiential needs that are similar to those of ordinary leisure participants (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348010380600">Loroz, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1096348010380600">
<title>Casino Attraction</title>
<p>Although research from social psychology and tourism literature commonly acknowledges that casino gambling is motivated by an array of push factors such as winning, excitement, socialization, learning, novelty seeking, and escape from ordinary life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010380600">Cotte, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380600">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010380600">Platz &amp; Millar, 2001</xref>), it is unclear how pull factors inspire casino tourism. The sprawling integrated Las Vegas–style casinos have been documented to provide tourists with a total travel experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010380600">Anonymous, 1994</xref>). For example, with European architectural design, a Venice-like river wall and river ride, ample high-end and mid-range boutiques, and streetmosphere and other live entertainment performances, the Venetian Macau has turned itself into the world’s busiest leisure attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010380600">Fowler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is consensus in the literature that the built environment and various hedonic leisure offerings—including shopping, entertainment, and dining—have enticed tourists to travel to popular gaming destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010380600">Anonymous, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1096348010380600">Yeskel, 2006</xref>). A pleasant and well-crafted service environment creates an atmospheric experience that could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010380600">Johnson, Mayer, &amp; Champaner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010380600">Wakefield, 1994</xref>). Therefore, the physical environment provides customers a place to fulfill their functional and practical needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010380600">Bitner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum, 2006</xref>), such as novelty seeking, leisure entertainment, and sightseeing in the context of tourism. In addition, researchers believe that commercial service settings can serve as third places for patrons who seek social and emotional supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum, 2006</xref>). For example, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010380600">2009a)</xref> reveals that customers relish restaurants, gyms, and hair salons because they perceive these places as ideal for socialization. These service establishments also help customers to restore their life and values as these places “permit their patrons to escape from their external roles and to enter into associations with others that are not premised on the social qualification of the people involved” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum, 2009b</xref>, p. 177). Based on the aforementioned literature, we believe that Chinese tourists flock to casinos in Macau goes beyond a desire for hardcore gambling but to satisfy an array of travel needs instead.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1096348010380600">
<title>Instrument Development</title>
<p>Because a complete understanding of tourist motivation in casino visit is missing, we used both qualitative and qualitative methods to develop the motivational scale of interest. We followed the scale development methodology suggested by Churchill and other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010380600">Churchill, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010380600">DeVellis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1096348010380600">Walsh &amp; Beatty, 2007</xref>) and generated the instrument in two phases: (a) scale generation and initial purification and (b) scale refinement and validation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1096348010380600">
<title>Item Generation and Initial Purification</title>
<p>To develop an instrument that is applicable to Chinese casino tourists, we first specified the research domain by considering potential motivational scale items from the travel literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010380600">Baloglu &amp; Uysal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010380600">Goeldner &amp; Ritchie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010380600">Kau &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010380600">Pearce &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1096348010380600">Zhang &amp; Lam, 1999</xref>). To determine the dimensions of the instrument, we interviewed 30 mainland casino customers to clarify why they visited the properties. Next, we purified the items from the interviews by asking a panel of Chinese business professors and students, all from a major university in Macau, to agree on these items. Based on group consensus, we identified 30 items that were plausible motives for explaining why mainland Chinese tourists might sojourn casinos.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1096348010380600">
<title>Data Collection for Scale Refinement and Validation</title>
<p>We administered the 30-item motivational questionnaire to 500 mainland Chinese tourists in five major casinos in Macau by means of person-administered face-to-face interview. The mall-intercept data collection method was adopted in the study, and respondents were intercepted outside of the selected property by means of convenience sampling. We also raised a filter question and included only mainland Chinese visitors in the sample. Respondents were asked to rate the motivational items on a 7-point Likert-type scale, anchored from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Each respondent received a small gift for participating in the study. A total of 312 respondents were able to complete the survey, which corresponds to a 64% response rate.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1096348010380600">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Of the respondents, 59% were male and 41% female. More than half of the respondents held a bachelor’s degree and 27% of them had some high school education. In terms of age, about 40% of the respondents were younger than 35 years and a quarter of the respondents were between 36 and 45 years. About 70% of the respondents were married and 30% were single. Respondents also represented tourists from 20 of the most developed regions in China, including Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai. The majority of respondents originated from nearby provinces such as Guangdong (21%), Zhejiang (15%), and Guangxi (13%). The majority of the respondents earned less than RMB 4,000 per month whereas 13% of them earned more than RMB 10,000 per month. A great majority of the respondents stayed in Macau for 2 days or fewer (79%), spent less than RMB 2,000 on their trip (75%), and were first-time visitors (54%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010380600">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Scale Refinement and Validation</title>
<p>Of the 30 statements asked, two items had a consistent poor response rate and were eliminated from the data analysis. To uncover the underlying motivational factors, we split the data set into two samples. The first sample was subjected to a principal component analysis with a varimax rotation. The components were refined by examining the pattern coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380600">Thompson, 2004</xref>). For an item to be retained, it had to have a primary loading of .50 or higher and secondary loadings of .30 or lower. The final rotated and refined solution supported a 16-item, five-dimension solution, which accounted for 64.35% of the variance, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1096348010380600">Table 2</xref>. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sample adequacy was .67, which indicated that the sample size was sufficient. In addition, each scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .70 or higher, which illustrates internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010380600">Churchill, 1979</xref>). We labeled these five dimensions as <italic>entertainment and novelty seeking, leisure activity, escape from pressure, casino sightseeing</italic>, and <italic>socialization</italic>. Our decision on the factor labels is based on the factor structure as well as our understanding of the literature, the research context, and the aforementioned interviews.</p>

<p>Entertainment and novelty seeking, a push motive, suggests that mainland Chinese consumers travel to casinos in Macau to improve knowledge about the gaming capital, to indulge in a fantasy lifestyle, to engage in hedonic pleasures of gambling, to relish high-end casinos, and to experience night activities. Socialization, a second push motive, reveals that Chinese tourists relish casinos in Macau because it enables them to develop closer family relationships and to spend time with family during their vacations. Escape from pressure, which is another push motive, suggests that Chinese flock to Macau’s casinos to escape family responsibilities and the doldrums of everyday life. Leisure activity, a pull motive, indicates that Chinese tourists are motivated by the quality of entertainment, shopping, and accommodation opportunities offered by casino properties. Finally, casino sightseeing, a second pull motive, highlights that many mainland tourists visit casinos to view the latest architectural wonders and to experience the grandiose service environment that may not otherwise be available in the mainland.</p>

<title>Scale Validation</title>
<p>To examine the model fit and to validate the measurement model, we tested the five-structure solution in confirmatory factor analysis using the second sample. The results reveal appropriate overall fit with comparative fit index = .94, root mean square error of approximation =.05, and standardized root mean square residual = .07. These fit statistics supported the conceptualization of five motivation dimensions. In addition, we cross-validated the scale by randomly splitting the original data set again into two samples and assessed full metric invariance by constraining the factor loadings of both samples equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010380600">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010380600">Thompson, 2004</xref>).

<title>Relationships Between Casino Motivations</title>
<p>To gain insight for scholars and practitioners, we performed Pearson’s correlation analysis to show the relationships between the five motivational factors, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1096348010380600">Table 4</xref>. The results suggest that patrons who seek entertainment and novel experience from casinos are likely to be attracted by high quality casino leisure offerings and social opportunities. On the other hand, they are unlikely to visit casinos as a means to escape from pressure and to sightsee. In addition, patrons who are motivated by the casino leisure activities are more inclined to sightsee the casino property, perhaps to enjoy the luxury facilities and to shop. These visitors are more likely to utilize casinos for family gatherings than to relax from pressure. The findings further suggest that casino visitors are not homogenous in that they have different motives for their casino excursion.</p>

<title>Cluster Analysis of Casino Visitors</title>
<p>After investigating the underpinning motives of casino visitors, we clustered these visitors by their motivations to explore meaningful segments. We employed the two-step cluster analytical method in this study because it provides researchers with the Bayesian information criterion and produces an optimal number of unique clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010380600">Fraley &amp; Raftery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1096348010380600">SPSS, 2001</xref>). Based on the lowest (1055.04) with the largest distance change (56.71), the data show that respondents could be classified into two groups. After analyzing the means of the five scales, we classified 169 (54%) respondents as <italic>sightseeing-for-escape seekers</italic>, 136 (44%) respondents as <italic>entertainment-for-socialization seekers</italic>, and 7 (2%) respondents as unclassified. The means of the five motivation factors for the two clusters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1096348010380600">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<p>We performed discriminant analysis, and the results show that only one discriminant function with an eigenvalue of 1.23 (Wilk’s lambda, Λ = .44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) was retrieved; and the function was able to explain 55% of the variance of the group variable. We also performed a series of <italic>t</italic> tests to show group differences between the two casino visitor segments. The results indicate significant travel motivation discrepancies between these two groups. In sum, the sightseeing-for-escape seekers tend to enjoy casino sightseeing as a means for relaxation and escape from mundane life. On the other hand, entertainment-for-socialization visitors tend to focus their excursions on seeking new casino experience and entertainment activities to fulfill their social needs.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the differences of the two segments by means of respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics, travel companions, and travel information sources through Pearson’s chi-square test of independence. The results reveal discrepancies in regard to visitors’ age and education, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1096348010380600">Table 6</xref>. The findings suggest that entertainment-for-socialization seekers are younger and more educated than their sightseeing-for-escape counterparts. This finding is interesting as it shows that the entertainment-for-socialization casino visitors match with the demographic profiles of type typical Chinese middle class: relatively young, well-educated, looking for quality of life, and more inclined to seek new experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010380600">Gadiesh, Leung, &amp; Vestring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010380600">He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1096348010380600">Unger, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, entertainment-for-socialization seekers are more likely to travel with family members or friends than sightseeing-for-escape seekers. On the other hand, sightseeing-for-escape visitors tend to travel alone or with relatives more than do their entertainment-for-socialization counterparts. Furthermore, sightseeing-for-escape visitors are more inclined to acquire travel information from the Macau public media as well as friends and relatives than are visitors of the other segment.</p>

<p>A series of post hoc ANOVAs were performed.

However, this phenomenon is reversed for female visitors (<italic>M</italic><sub>female_26-35</sub> = 4.50 vs. <italic>M</italic><sub>female_56+</sub> = 4.94). Male visitors’ motives on escape from pressure are similar in all age categories; however, older female visitors are more inclined to seek escape by visiting casinos than the other age groups. Male visitors are increasingly likely to enjoy sightseeing casinos as they age but female patrons are not.</p>
<p>With regards to the gender-by-education interaction, we find that females with secondary and bachelor’s education are more likely to seek novelty and entertainment experience from casinos, whereas male visitors are fairly consistent in this aspect regardless of their educational background. Females with primary education or below are significantly more likely than any other groups to relish the chance to escape from mundane life. It is important to note that we also find that age and education are negatively related, χ<sup>2</sup>(12) = 47.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; this may explain why older (<italic>M</italic><sub>female_56+</sub> = 4.87) and less educated (<italic>M</italic><sub>female_primary</sub> = 4.97) female patrons are more inclined to relax from pressure than other groups. In addition, females with low education (i.e., no college education) are more inclined to enjoy the casino leisure activities, whereas males with some college education are more likely to seek such leisure offerings. Finally, we also find a three-way interaction between gender, age, and education, <italic>F</italic>(50, 1203) = 1.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, on the casino sightseeing motive. The results reveal that females with some college education are less likely to enjoy casino sightseeing when they age (i.e., 56 years or older); yet females with primary or lower educational background are more likely to sightsee casinos when they are young. However, their male counterparts remain fairly consistent in regard to casino sightseeing regardless of their age and education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The article reveals that the influx mainland Chinese tourists flock to casinos in Macau to enjoy its novel casino/gambling offerings, to treasure vacation time with their families, to escape everyday life, to acquire high quality leisure offerings, and to experience the casino service environment. Thus, these results reveal that, by and large, the drivers that encourage mainland Chinese tourists to travel to casino properties in Macau are similar to those that propel Americans to visit Las Vegas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1096348010380600">Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland, 2010</xref>); even to the point where Macau has been dubbed the Las Vegas of the East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010380600">Luxury Travel, 2008</xref>). That is, gambling in both Macau and Las Vegas become inextricably linked to “mega-themed” resorts that appeal to entertainment, shopping, family-fun, whereas a continual stream of new development tantalizes tourists with a sense of visual exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010380600">Anonymous, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of sister-properties such as the Venetian, the Wynn, and MGM in both Las Vegas and Macau creates a unique and permanent bond between these two destinations.</p>
<p>Although it is true that Macau also shares similarities with Monte Carlo in the sense that both locales have acquired fame and fortune by being surrounded by larger political entities that prohibit gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010380600">Leiper, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348010380600">Vong, 2004</xref>), Monte Carlo differs from Macau in two aspects. First, its historical casino properties have not transformed into monolithic, ersatz themed properties; and second, Monte Carlo still appeals to the gambler as well as the beach seeker. Although Macau appeals to the former, it lacks the ability to target the latter.</p>
<p>In addition, this article shows that the impressive growth of Macau’s tourism industry may be overshadowed by casino attractions. Themed shopping malls, grandiose gaming floors, luxury hotel accommodations, and renowned Vegas-style architecture are some of the pull motives that lure millions of visitors to the enclave. Indeed, Chinese casino tourists are similar to tourists in other destinations who are looking for a variety of tourism appeals that could fulfill their travel needs.</p>
<sec id="section16-1096348010380600">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>This article reveals that mainland Chinese tourists pay visits to Macau primarily driven by the casino attractions to satisfy their travel needs that might not be available in other parts of the world. Although the mature gaming destination counterparts could offer a similar experience to these tourists, geographic and language barriers help constrain these mainlanders to concentrate primarily on the Asian version of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Prior literature emphasizes the push factors of gambling motivation and studies the psychological characteristics of gambling behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010380600">Cotte, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010380600">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010380600">Ozorio &amp; Fong, 2004</xref>). This article takes a different look at casino gambling and explores the underlying motives for casino excursions. Hence, this research focuses on the casino as a whole rather than gambling specifically. Our findings shed light on the interrelationship between casino offerings and tourists’ sociopsychological factors that predispose them to visit a place. This article, therefore, contributes to the travel and hospitality literature by identifying both push and pull factors that conceptualize tourists’ casino visit motivation. We also extend the gaming literature by providing a different perspective on casino gaming among Chinese consumers. Indeed, our findings suggest that the emergence of integrated theme park-like casinos has fostered a new travel phenomenon: casino tourism. This implication is important as it could help bridge the gap between travel research and hospitality research by disclosing how private service establishments serve as major travel attractions. Perhaps the travel literature should start investigating the role of hospitality providers in fulfilling visitors’ travel needs, particularly the interrelationship between pull motives and service offerings.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that many tourists view casino touring and experiencing casino properties as a major value proposition to their travel experience. Hence, a commercially built environment is not simply a place where business transaction takes place but also a major means for tourists’ travel experience. The phenomenon suggests that integrated world-class casino properties are perceived as core value propositions that could potentially fulfill tourists’ excursion needs. Rosenbaum and colleagues suggest that a commercial “place” can provide patrons with physical, social, and emotional needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010380600">Rosenbaum, Ward, Walker, &amp; Ostrom, 2007</xref>). This study firmly supports their arguments. In addition, we believe that the development of sprawling integrated casinos is becoming a third place where tourists can fulfill their assorted travel needs.</p>
<p>In addition, this research also reveals that the gender, age, and education discrepancies in tourists’ motivation are not as straightforward as most travel literature suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010380600">Kau &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1096348010380600">Zhang &amp; Lam, 1999</xref>). Indeed, the findings indicate two- and three-way interactions among these demographic variables. The moderating role of gender is particular salient in tourists’ novelty-seeking and pressure-escape motives. Understanding how various variables moderate motivational differences could yield invaluable insight and bring a greater depth to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010380600">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that the reason why mainland Chinese tourists flock to casinos in Macau goes beyond hardcore gambling. The results shed new light on both the casino gambling industry and gaming destinations. As China’s outbound market continues to expand at a rapid pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1096348010380600">Zhang &amp; Lam, 1999</xref>), mainland Chinese tourists have become an extremely important segment to many destinations, particularly in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010380600">Hsu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010380600">T. Lam &amp; Hsu, 2004</xref>). Hence, emerging travel gaming locales such as Macau, Singapore, and Manila will be able to gain a great competitive advantage over rival destinations. The current findings can help casino operators to justify their nongambling service offerings as they become important value propositions for casino tourists. The developing multibillion sprawling integrated projects, such as the Macau Cotai Strip, the Marina Bay Sands, and the Manila Bay Entertainment City, will not only be a “cash cow” for hardcore gambling but also crucial attractions for the at-large Chinese mass market visitors.</p>
<p>Based on their visit motivations, Chinese casino patrons could be classified into two meaningful segments: <italic>entertainment-for-socialization seekers</italic> and <italic>sightseeing-for-escape seekers</italic>. Although these two segments share similar sociodemographics and visitation profiles, entertainment-for-socialization seekers are more likely to be middle class while the other segment is more likely to be older and less educated. Perhaps a more important differentiation between these two casino segments lies in their underlying travel motives. Our findings indicate that entertainment-for-socialization seekers are prone to seek excitement and adventure, to consume high-end leisure offerings, and to nurture family relationships. The rise of the Chinese upper middle and wealthy classes brings compelling business opportunities to the travel and hospitality industries. Not only are they willing to shell out a premium for quality, but they are also willing to pay for providers who can satisfy their needs. This study, therefore, paints a picture of how various factors push and pull visitors to sojourn casinos. More important, it portrays the interrelationship between these push and pull motives. For example, although casino patrons take trips to Macau for the unique casino experience, they are increasingly prone to use this opportunity to build a stronger family bond and to indulge in leisure activities. Integrated casinos will be able to benefit greatly from their expanded leisure entertainment offerings and meet the ever-growing needs of this group of Chinese visitors.</p>
<p>Another important finding is the moderating role of gender in visitors’ demographic differences. Despite the literature contents that Chinese men have a strong affinity for casino gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010380600">Fong &amp; Ozorio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010380600">Lai, 2006</xref>), we do not find enough evidence to suggest this phenomenon in the case of casino visit in Macau. Rather, our findings indicate older females are more inclined to enjoy casinos for novelty seeking and relaxing from pressure. Hence, casino managers must consider the interaction effects of tourist demographics to gain a better vantage point on their target customers.</p>
<p>Given that novelty seeking, such as experiencing casinos and nightlife entertainment, is a major driver for mainland Chinese tourists to Macau, the special region’s travel authority needs to tout new product/service offerings, as the mainland Chinese tourists may become bored with the place after the first visit. In developing new casino and entertainment facilities, gaming operators and the local government should collaborate to provide casino tourists with both novelty and leisure entertainment in their travel experience. The zone’s burgeoning building along the Cotai Strip, with numerous hotels and casinos in various stages of construction, should be able to continue to send streams of mainland Chinese tourists to the former Portuguese colony as tourists seek new experiences. However, with limited land reserves and a highly regulated foreign labor policy, Macau may soon encounter a roadblock to gaming and tourism development. Scholars and policy makers should investigate how sustainable development could be achieved given these conditions.</p>
<p>The finding regarding the importance of taking a family excursion to Macau, suggests that some casinos may want to emphasize a family theme, perhaps a “bounce-back” weekend. Other promotions may want to emphasize how Macau may permit mainland tourists to escape to another world, one filled with new casinos, spas, entertainment, nightlife activities, and luxury shopping, all at a reasonable price. Astute casino operators, such as the Venetian, are now building an imitation Venice Grand Canal and a replica of St. Mark’s Square to draw visitors to their properties. Yet the majority of casinos in Macau are still based on the traditional hardcore gambling business model. Findings from this study suggest that gambling only plays a small part in the total casino experience tourists seek. With intensified competition, it is prudent for traditional non-Vegas casino operators to reconsider their current business strategy to focus more on hedonic leisure offerings that could ultimately satisfy the at-large Chinese consumers.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>The findings of the current study must be interpreted with caution. First, generalizability may be limited to mainland Chinese in Macau. In light of this limitation, the results may not be able to represent the entire mainland Chinese outflow market because of nonrandom sampling. However, we tried our best to collect data from customers at different casino properties as well as tourists from different regions of China. Given the theoretical and practical importance of the results, we believe that the contributions of this study outweigh the limitations.</p>
<p>Future researchers and practitioners are encouraged to expand the proposed 16-item motivational scale and to explore how various casino service offerings may be able to satisfy tourists’ travel needs. For example, given that casino tourists seek socialization opportunities in their casino visit, researchers may want to explore which specific casino offerings could better fulfill this need. In addition, since casinos are commonly perceived as a haven for crime and prostitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010380600">Papineau, 2005</xref>), future research should investigate the consequences of casino excursions on tourists’ overall travel satisfaction. Furthermore, academics and casino operators may want to study the roles of casino service environment and service delivery on customer satisfaction. Future research efforts should also examine the interrelationship between casino satisfaction/revisit intention and travel satisfaction/revisit intention to understand how various hospitality offerings affect tourists’ behaviors.</p>
<p>Finally, we encourage researchers to engage in cross-cultural, empirical studies to explore the similarities and differences among tourists traveling to famed gambling locales, including Macau, Las Vegas, and Monte Carlo. Despite these limitations, this research reveals that travelers’ motivations for a Macau sojourn are not unique to the Chinese and are quite understandable; after all, it is all about novel experience, entertainment, and relaxation.</p>
