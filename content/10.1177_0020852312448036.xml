<p>The European Commission (Commission) has undergone at first ‘failed’ attempts at reform (during the 1990s) and then ‘successful’ attempts at managerial reform (the ‘Kinnock reform’ as ‘mission accomplished’, in the terms employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312448036">Kassim, 2008</xref>), that have led to substantive administrative change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852312448036">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to contribute to providing interpretations for the transformation of the administration of the Commission, this symposium focuses on two aspects: the politicization and the de-politicization of, respectively, the elected and the tenured officials in the Commission, and the behavioural logics prevailing within Commission services, after the managerial reforms of the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges is as follows. First, as widely discussed in the contribution by Anchrit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312448036">Wille (2012)</xref>, modern EU Commissioners, unlike their predecessors, are political professionals that have made their political career a permanent one: political professionalism characterizes the EU executive – although it should be noted that this transformation appears to be the result of changes in EU politics unrelated to the managerial reforms of the Commission that have occurred in the 2000s. Second, as shown by Michael Bauer and Jörn Ege in their contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312448036">Bauer and Ege, 2012)</xref>, tenured officials in the Commission, although they are highly sensitive to the political side of their job, are less politicized after the Kinnock reforms than they used to be before. These two findings may usefully be seen in conjunction: while the College of the Commissioners seems to have become more politically responsive to its supranational peers and national governments, the Commission’s bureaucracy can be qualified as less politicized than before. This first part of the picture is compatible both with a reassertion of the traditional Weberian bureaucratic model and with the neo-Weberian model in the form proposed by the debate in public management by Pollitt and Bouckaert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312448036">2004, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312448036">Pollitt et al., 2008</xref>; for a perspective from the standpoint of administrative reform in Southern European countries, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312448036">Ongaro, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This quite linear picture of a Commission transformed from a ‘technocratic’ authority administering regulatory policies aimed at the building up of the internal market into a full-fledged Weberian bureaucracy characterized by a politically responsive apex and a ‘neutral’ bureaucracy relatively autonomous from it is, however, likely to be severely incomplete. The process of managerialization, and specifically the introduction of a ‘Management by Objectives’ logic into the functioning of the administrative machinery may be conducive to an instrumental (rather than a neutral/autonomous) notion of the bureaucracy – a trait more properly associated with managerialism, rather than with Weberianism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852312448036">2</xref></sup> and (we would argue) neo-Weberianism (models which are closer to conceiving of the bureaucracy as autonomous and neutral, however flexible and oriented to the adoption of managerial tools it might be). At another level of analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312448036">Georgakakis (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312448036">2010b)</xref> has pointed out that the managerialization of the Commission administration (and particularly another element introduced by managerial reforms, namely the new recruitment procedures) has had another major effect: it has challenged the collective identity of Commission civil servants as a social group, whose process of reproduction was sustained (also) by the public selection procedures that were used before the reform of the 2000s. In this perspective, managerial reforms have engendered a crisis of reproduction linked, among other factors, to an important symbolic matter, which consists in a deconsecration process of the Commission’s administrative body. If such interpretations hold, one implication of this process is that such a process is undermining one of the loadbearing walls of the ‘old’ (Weberian?) administration of the Commission.</p>
<p>A third major piece of the overall picture is provided by the analysis conducted by Jarle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312448036">Trondal (2012)</xref> on the behavioural logics (hierarchical vs portfolio) operating within the Commission. Of special interest here is the finding that suggests that the impacts of managerial reforms are modest when it comes to transforming some core behavioural logics among Commission officials: in the words of the author, ‘Commission officials remain primarily guided by an unreconstructed Commission bureaucratic architecture’. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of not overestimating administrative change to the detriment of continuity, and of situating managerial reforms in the broader setting of the changes in European governance, and the European administrative order.</p>
<p>Jointly, the articles reported in this symposium<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020852312448036">3</xref></sup> provide another angle from which to consider administrative change and continuity in the ‘Commission of the twenty-first century’, thus contributing to a flourishing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312448036">Ban, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312448036">Kassim et al., forthcoming</xref>; and for a look both backward, to past reforms of the Commission administration, and comparative, with public management reform in other international bureaucracies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312448036">Bauer and Knill, 2007</xref>) rooted in a public administration perspective to the study of the EU.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0020852312448036"><label>1</label><p>There are a number of reasons why the study of the administration of the Commission is worth pursuing. First, because policy-making processes also have an organizational basis, and the policy entrepreneurship role associated to the Commission and sustained by its policy initiation prerogative makes the study of the administration of the Commission potentially an important contribution to our understanding of European public policy-making; to illustrate the importance of the issue, it may be considered that it has been questioned whether the organizational bases for performing such a policy entrepreneurship role are still there, after administrative reforms that have been deemed to have led the Head of Units to the status of ‘deprived policy entrepreneurs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312448036">Bauer, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312448036">2009</xref>). Second, because any understanding of the EU as a governance system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312448036">Peters and Pierre, 2008</xref>) cannot stand without an understanding of the organizational transformations occurring in the institution that is usually considered to be in a unique position as the hub of numerous highly specialized policy networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312448036">Peterson, 2008</xref>), as well as being the actor in the EU governance that retains ‘virtually a free hand in creating new networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312448036">Marks et al., 1996</xref>: 359). If we hold the basic assumption that effective governance may produce greater integration, while at the same time higher levels of integration may increase the capacity to govern, but also that these virtuous cycles may be mirrored by a downward spiral into governance failure and disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312448036">Peters and Pierre, 2008</xref>), then the organizational capacities of one of the key organizations that operate in the governance system of the EU represent a factor that should not be underestimated – hence the understanding of the model of administration towards which the Commission is heading is an important contribution to EU governance studies.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn3-0020852312448036"><label>3</label><p>The preparation of this symposium has benefited from a meeting that was held at the University of Pavia (Italy) on 28 June 2010, hosted by the Faculty of Political Science. I am very grateful to Professor Fabio Rugge for his support and commitment to facilitate this joint intellectual effort.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
