<abstract>
<p>The description of ionic currents that flow across the membrane of the squid giant axon during an action potential sparked an interest in determining whether there were similar currents in vertebrates. The preparation of choice was the node of Ranvier in single myelinated fibers in frog. José del Castillo spent 3 years on the United States mainland from 1956 to 1959. During that time, he collaborated with Jerome Y. Lettvin and John W. Moore. I discuss how these individuals met one another and some of their scientific discoveries using the voltage clamp to study squid giant axons and frog nodes. Much of this work was conducted at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and I attempt to convey a sense of the unique scientific “melting pot” that existed at the Marine Biological Laboratory and the broader effect that del Castillo had on “modern” neuroscience.</p>

<p>One example of a technological innovation that revolutionized membrane biophysics is the patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858412446971">Neher 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073858412446971">Neher and Sakmann, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858412446971">1992</xref>). This technique has remained an essential tool for measurement of currents of single ion channels for 36 years. Since the patch clamp is a specialized version of the voltage clamp, it is critical to remember that this earlier technological breakthrough was the underpinning for the patch clamp. The description of macroscopic ionic currents that flow across the membrane of the squid giant axon during an action potential occurred in the early 1950s with the advent of the voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858412446971">Hodgkin 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858412446971">Huxley 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858412446971">Marmont 1949</xref>). The discoveries of Hodgkin and Huxley sparked an interest in determining whether similar currents flowed across neuronal membranes in vertebrates. The preparation of choice was the node of Ranvier in single myelinated fibers of frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858412446971">Cahalan 1978</xref>). Not only was this a difficult preparation to dissect but the inability to insert wires into the vertebrate axon as was done in the squid giant axon presented special challenges that required modifications of the voltage clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858412446971">Cahalan 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858412446971">Moore 1959a</xref>).</p>
<p>José del Castillo (1920–2002) is best known for his discovery with Bernard Katz (1911–2003) of the quantal composition of the postsynaptic response at the frog neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858412446971">del Castillo and Katz 1954</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858412446971">Augustine and Kasai 2007</xref>). However, little is known about his participation in voltage clamp studies from 1956 to 1959 when he worked on the United States mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858412446971">Fig. 1</xref>), prior to accepting an appointment at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858412446971">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073858412446971">Zuazaga 2009</xref>). In searching for such information about del Castillo, I found that he worked with Jerome (Jerry) Y. Lettvin (1920–2011) at MIT and with John W. Moore at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA. I presented my time line of all del Castillo references to Moore and asked him to search his memories and refine or elaborate what he had reported about Lettvin and del Castillo in his autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858412446971">Moore 2011</xref>). John has graciously provided much of the details about the interactions of these “three musketeers” that I relate here. I first provide some background of how the relationship between these scientists evolved and then discuss how their interactions led to a number of scientific discoveries using the voltage clamp that inform “modern” neuroscience.</p>

<title>Lettvin and Moore</title>
<p>Lettvin first met Moore on one of his visits to the Kenneth “Kacy” Cole (1900–1984) laboratory at the NIH. They became instant friends and collaborators because of their common interest in biophysics and in the use of electronics in the study of the nervous system. Moore relates, “He was a very, very lovely person. He could visit me at the MBL or at Duke; we would walk the streets, and he would know many more people (even poets and philosophers) at both institutions than I did.”</p>
<p>At the time, the importance of the use of electronics in “the study of biological and medical systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073858412446971">Moore 1959b</xref>) was being appreciated and was highlighted in a special issue of the <italic>Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers</italic> (IRE) that Moore edited (Volume 47, Number 11, November, 1959). As part of that volume, Moore early in 1959 had asked Lettvin to write an article on measuring membrane potentials with microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858412446971">Gesteland and others 1959</xref>). During the spring meeting of FASEB that year in Washington, DC, Lettvin and Moore crossed paths in the airport; Lettvin was arriving and Moore was leaving. Lettvin told Moore about a very exciting paper that he wanted to be published as soon as possible and asked whether it might be included in the special edition of the <italic>Proceedings of the IRE</italic>. Moore responded that it was a possibility as long as he wrote the microelectrode article that he had been assigned.</p>
<p>That summer Lettvin traveled from Boston to visit Moore at his cottage in Woods Hole with his manuscript. Moore read this extraordinary paper and immediately accepted the text, reluctantly agreeing to the additional authors (Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts) because Lettvin said that it was an established laboratory policy that all members’ names would be listed as authors. However, Moore <italic>rejected the title outright</italic> because it was so “stuffy” that no one would want to read the paper. Because it did not sound at all “like Jerry,” John suspected that one of the additional authors had contributed the title and demanded that Lettvin give his own title. Lettvin immediately burst out with “What the Frog’s Eye Tells the Frog’s Brain.” Moore scratched out the original title, replaced it with Lettvin’s and, as Guest Editor, immediately sent in the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858412446971">Lettvin and others 1959</xref>) for publication. Although this classic paper was published in 1959 in an obscure journal for neuroscientists, it is now widely known and referenced and even posted at more than one site on the Internet.</p>

<title>del Castillo and Lettvin</title>
<p>After collaborating with Katz from 1950 to 1956 at University College, London, del Castillo accepted a Visiting Professorship of Physiology at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center. The visiting professorship program was initiated years earlier by Chandler McCuskey Brooks (1905–1989) to bring senior scientists to assist younger faculty with a research emphasis on neurophysiology and cardiac physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858412446971">Koizumi and Vassalle 2009</xref>). del Castillo worked with E. E. Suckling on subthreshold voltage changes from single nodes of Ranvier, a preparation he had used in London a few years before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073858412446971">del Castillo and Stark 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858412446971">Fig. 1</xref>). Specifically, he and E.E. Suckling described the “quantal” nature of subthreshold responses at the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073858412446971">del Castillo and Suckling 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>During the summer of 1957, del Castillo collaborated with Lettvin in the Laboratory of Electronics at MIT to study nodes of Ranvier of single myelinated axons isolated from frog sciatic nerve. The axon was placed across three pools of Ringer’s solution so that a single node of Ranvier was in each pool and the internodes were between pools. The internal potential of the node in the central pool was measured as the voltage difference between electrodes in the central and right hand electrolyte pools. Measuring the potential at the node in this way of course required that the external longitudinal resistance between pools (i.e., resistance along the outside of the myelin of the internode) be much higher than the internal (axoplasmic) longitudinal resistance to reduce the current flowing along the outside of the fiber from adjacent nodes. To increase the external longitudinal resistance, Lettvin isolated the node in the central pool from those in the other pools with air gaps over the internodes, a technique developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073858412446971">Tasaki (1956)</xref>.</p>
<p>Lettvin and del Castillo tried to extend this air gap method to voltage clamping the central node, injecting the required control current into the left-hand pool and measuring the voltage between the electrodes in the central and right-hand pools. They knew that the technique required a low axoplasmic resistance to current flow (“series” resistance) in order for the clamp to control the membrane potential effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858412446971">Cole and Moore 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858412446971">Moore 1959a</xref>). The axoplasm, however, appeared to have too large a series resistance. Lettvin was new at voltage clamping and unsure about their results, so he asked Moore, who had years of experience with the voltage clamp technique, to check out their method and sent del Castillo to work with him at the NIH.</p>
</sec>

<title>del Castillo and Moore</title>
<p>Immediately on del Castillo’s arrival in John’s lab, the two scientists formed a strong and long-lasting bond of respect and friendship. As they tried to work with the Tasaki air gap method, they quickly realized that the series resistance of the intracellular axoplasm (through ~1 mm length of the internode) sorely limited the quality of the voltage control. del Castillo suggested that he could simply shorten the length of the axon, thereby reducing the length of the internode and thus reduce the internal series resistance. But when del Castillo cut the axon in this manner, showing his considerable experimental skill, the resistance increased rather than decreased, exacerbating the anomalies in the current recordings! Initially this result seemed counterintuitive until the two men realized that by cutting the fiber they had compressed and constricted it (as in cutting a tube of toothpaste) and thereby increased the series resistance. Moore teased del Castillo with “and how are you going to undo your increasing the problem?” del Castillo replied, “watch this” and proceeded to place a fine needle in the end of the fiber to open it, reducing the series resistance by orders of magnitude! Moore recounts that his awe and admiration increased by the same magnitude, and he never teased del Castillo again. del Castillo took this new, improved method back to MIT where his extraordinary skill allowed him and Lettvin to publish the first records of nodal voltage-clamped currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858412446971">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858412446971">del Castillo and others 1957</xref>).</p>

<p>Nodal voltage clamp currents of single myelinated fibers were independently recorded in Bernhard Frankenhaeuser’s (1915–1994) laboratory in Stockholm during the same period and reported in a short note (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858412446971">Frankenhaeuser and Persson 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>del Castillo continued to work with Moore in Cole’s Laboratory of Biophysics at the National Institute of Health from 1957 until 1959 during del Castillo’s tenure as Chief of the Section of Clinical Neurophysiology at the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness. del Castillo and Moore tackled the limitations of the “flaky” air gap technique—the problem of having the internode region as dry as possible (to reduce the external longitudinal leakage current) but not so dry that the nerve would degenerate. Moore had observed Tasaki alternatively fanning air, literally with a Japanese fan, and, even stranger, puffing his moist breath on the drying axon, as he sought to make stable potential measurements! A more controlled technique seemed necessary. Frankenhaeuser had developed an application of negative feedback to electronically minimize the external, longitudinal current along an internode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858412446971">Frankenhaeuser 1957</xref>; Frankenhaeuser and Perrson 1957; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858412446971">Moore 1959a</xref>, p. 1875–8). On his return from Stockholm in the fall of 1958 Fred Dodge visited the Rockefeller Institute’s electronic shop at the MBL to check on amplifiers being modified for his voltage clamp setup (F. Dodge, personal communication). He most likely shared nodal clamp results from the Frankenhaeuser laboratory that were in press with Cole and Moore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858412446971">Dodge and Frankenhaeuser 1958</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858412446971">Moore and del Castillo (1959a)</xref> adapted Frankenhaeuser’s design using two negative feedback configurations and the Vaseline gap method to record resting and action potentials at the node, as well as the potential changes resulting from the injection of external current, coining the term <italic>electronic electrode</italic> to describe this compensating circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858412446971">Moore 1959a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858412446971">Moore and del Castillo 1959a</xref>).</p>
<p>del Castillo and Moore continued their collaboration during the summer of 1958 in Cole’s lab at the MBL (del Castillo was listed as an Independent Investigator; MBL archives). They had the luxury of pursuing questions of their choice since Cole was not actively involved in experiments at that time. In one project, they studied the effect of the anesthetic procaine on voltage-clamped currents in the squid giant axon, finding that procaine decreased the peak of the sodium current as well as the steady-state potassium current. Although this work was carried out by del Castillo and Moore, it was later published with Cole’s blessing by another member of the lab who did not do the work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073858412446971">Taylor 1959a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073858412446971">1959b</xref>), an incident that triggered John’s departure from Cole’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858412446971">Moore 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>del Castillo and Moore then turned their attention to testing an important assumption in voltage clamping the squid axon: that a uniform voltage (a “space clamp”) was achieved by inserting an axial wire, short-circuiting the axon’s interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858412446971">Cole 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858412446971">Cole and Moore 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858412446971">Hodgkin and others 1952</xref>). In a simple, elegant experiment, they inserted two microelectrodes into the squid giant axon about 16 mm apart before inserting the axial wire. After stimulation of the axon at one end, they recorded an action potential at the first electrode and, about 1 ms later, the propagating action potential at the second electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858412446971">Fig. 4A</xref>). They then inserted the axial wire and stimulated the axon. The action potentials recorded from the two electrodes now superimposed, and indeed the only way to distinguish them was to lower the gain a bit on one recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858412446971">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>The results, a complete validation of what had been assumed, were first presented in February of 1959 at the annual meeting of The Biophysical Society in Pittsburgh, PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858412446971">Moore and del Castillo 1959b</xref>) followed by a full paper in the <italic>Journal of Physiology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858412446971">del Castillo and Moore 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>While studying conduction velocity of the squid giant axon, del Castillo and Moore noticed changes in the shape of the action potential at the transition region near the end of the axial wire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1073858412446971">Fig. 5</xref>). Since the axial wire simulated an increase in diameter, these preliminary observations suggested that changes in axon potential shapes were not due to membrane properties but rather to lower internal resistance, the equivalence of increase in axon diameter. These initial observations by del Castillo and Moore were extended by Moore with collaborators at the MBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858412446971">Ramón and others 1976</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858412446971">Moore and Westerfield 1983</xref>).</p>

<p>The 1950s were an exciting time in neurophysiological research with the advent of the voltage clamp. Members of the Lettvin and Cole laboratories were working in the United States and members of the Frankenhaeuser laboratory were working independently in Stockholm on applying the new voltage clamp technology to studies of vertebrate nodes of Ranvier. del Castillo contributed to solving a number of challenges presented when the voltage clamp technique used in squid had to be modified for use on vertebrate nodes. Members of both laboratories demonstrated that the ionic conductances underlying the action potential of frog nodes were very similar to those of the squid giant axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858412446971">del Castillo and others 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858412446971">Dodge and Frankenhaeuser 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858412446971">Frankenhaeuser and Persson 1957</xref>). Their results provided the foundation to allow comparison to mammalian nodes of Ranvier (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858412446971">Kocsis and Waxman 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858412446971">Röper and Schwarz 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073858412446971">Schwarz and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858412446971">Vogel and Schwarz 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073858412446971">Waxman 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>del Castillo and collaborators set an example for challenging commonly held assumptions. The accuracy of current recordings in voltage clamp mode depends on the control of voltage across the patch of membrane being studied. The use of a chlorided silver wire placed into the interior of a squid giant axon provided isopoteniality and along with the use of electronics eliminated longitudinal voltage gradients, creating a “space clamp” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858412446971">Marmont 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858412446971">Moore 2011</xref>). The common assumption was that a space clamp eliminated propagation in the squid giant axon. del Castillo and Moore’s results supported the assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858412446971">del Castillo and Moore 1959</xref>). The importance of testing this seemly trivial assumption is highlighted by a similar assumption of isopoteniality using the somatic voltage clamp that has gone unchallenged until relatively recently. Theoretical studies that predicted a lack of uniformity of voltage into the dendritic tree using somatic voltage clamp have been confirmed experimentally raising questions about the ability to use this technique for quantitative studies of neurons with dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858412446971">Bar-Yehuda and Korngreen 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073858412446971">Spruston and Johnston 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858412446971">Williams and Mitchell 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The confluence of the lives of Moore, del Castillo, and Lettvin led to lifelong friendships and scientific collaborations. Common interest in the application of electronics to the study of the nervous system was one factor that brought them together. However, the conduciveness of the laboratory environment to foster collaboration was the most important determinant to the success of their research. For example, the Moore and del Castillo families would frequently go to Nobska beach near the MBL at lunchtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1073858412446971">Fig. 6</xref>). After a swim, lunch, and time with the children, the collaborators would walk down the beach and scratch in the sand the experimental results obtained that morning. Often they realized that their morning’s approach had been misguided. The ability to ask a better question that afternoon and conduct the experiment was in large part due to del Castillo’s incredible intellect and dissection skills. Moore remembers: “He was so adept with his hands. He could dissect squid axons far faster than I could—really clean and in the best physiological shape.” As a result, they would be able to go back to the laboratory the same day, quickly conduct experiments redesigned at lunch, and be home for dinner.</p>

<p>The scientific interactions of del Castillo and his collaborators resulted in fundamental neuroscience discoveries but the broader interactions that occurred, especially in the greater neuroscience community of the MBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073858412446971">Thomas, 1974</xref>), were possibly even more important. During his short stay on the United States mainland, del Castillo contributed his wonderful personality, ideas, energy, and skills to the neuroscience community.</p>
