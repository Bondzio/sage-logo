<p>In this issue of <italic>Economic and Industrial Democracy</italic>, several of the articles discuss various aspects of trade unionism and globalization. Ann Westenholz, Copenhagen Business School, is, for example, the author of ‘Is the Scandinavian way of organizing challenged by the growing Chinese economy?’ in the Current section in this issue. We would like to encourage more authors to consider contributing also to this section of the journal.</p>
<p>Among the articles, Peter Holland and Amanda Pyman, Monash University, Australia, discuss the role of trade unions in Australia in the article ‘Trade unions and corporate campaigning in a global economy: The case of James Hardie’. The authors look at the role of trade unions in a situation of globalized capital and a weaker position for the trade unions in workplaces. The example of corporate campaigning is discussed in a high profile case concerning asbestos. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and their efforts to claim full compensation for asbestos are analysed.</p>
<p>The second article, ‘The diffusion of alternative dispute resolution practices in Ireland’, by Paul Teague, Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland, Bill Roche, University College Dublin, Ireland, and Deborah Hann, Cardiff University, Wales, investigates alternative resolution practices in Ireland. Such practices, called ADR, and their diffusion to countries outside the US, is of particular interest for the authors. The authors’ findings show that ADR practices have been of limited use in the Irish case. When ADR was used, it was more common in high commitment HRM workplaces, and in firms owned by US interests. Also, the group was addressed rather than individual dimensions. The reasons behind the limited diffusion of ADR practices are discussed in terms of institutional differences.</p>
<p>Richard Croucher, Middlesex University Business School, UK, Geoff Wood, University of Sheffield, UK, Chris Brewster, University of Reading Business School, UK, and Michael Brookes, Middlesex University Business School, UK, discuss the role of employee turnover from a comparative perspective in the article ‘Employee turnover, HRM and institutional contexts’. Differences in employment relations were studied from a micro-level perspective, and the findings show that there is a difference between countries where exit is usual, often in market-based settings. Voice, on the other hand, is more common in Scandinavian countries. Such institutionalized voice seems to be related to a lower frequency of employee turnover. The authors not only further emphasize differences between various types of capitalism, but also point to the internal diversity.</p>
<p>The role of unions in Sweden is discussed by Abby Peterson, Mattias Wahlström and Magnus Wennerhag, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, in their article ‘Swedish trade unionism: A renewed social movement?’ The authors discuss the impact of social movement unionism among Swedish trade unions. They find that there is an interest among the unions towards social movement unionism, but they also find that the actions of the unions are still dominated by traditional means of activism.</p>
<p>The role of the unions is also addressed in the article ‘The limits and prospects of union power: Addressing mass redundancy in the steel industry’, by Dean Stroud, Cardiff University, UK, and Peter Fairbrother, RMIT University, Australia. The article interprets how various information channels are used in times of mass redundancy. Further, the article shows that the role of the unions is important, in terms of actions taken. Some strategies might result in demobilization of union members. The weakness of response especially in relation to the management’s framing of the redundancy is discussed in detail.</p>
<p>The article ‘Struggles on the frontier of professional control: Leading cases from Canada’, by Shelagh Campbell and Larry Haiven, Saint Mary’s University, Canada, describes and analyses three cases of labour disputes in terms of professional workers. The limits of professional workers are discussed against a background of changing professions, and strategies of how to maintain professional exclusions are analysed.</p>
<p>The issue of stress and burnout is discussed in the article ‘Employees’ job demands–resources profiles, burnout and work engagement: A person-centred examination’, by Anja Van den Broeck, HU Brussels, Belgium and Work, Organizational and Personnel Psychology, KU Leuven, Belgium, Nele De Cuyper, Work, Organizational and Personnel Psychology, KU Leuven, Belgium, Koen Luyckx, School of Psychology and Child and Adolescent Development, KU Leuven, Belgium, and Hans De Witte, Work, Organizational and Personnel Psychology, KU Leuven, Belgium and Vanderbijlpark Campus, North West University, South Africa. After using cluster analysis on a sample of Flemish community employees, the findings suggest that employees with demanding jobs also are experiencing a high burnout as well as low job satisfaction. Increasing job resources might be useful, the authors suggest.</p>
<p>The final article in this issue also discusses the unions. ‘Global Unions as imperfect multilateral organizations: An international relations perspective’, by Elizabeth Cotton, Middlesex University Business School, UK, and Rebecca Gumbrell-McCormick, University of London, UK, interprets Global Unions from an international relations perspective. The authors identify strategies which might strengthen such Global Unions’ actions. Especially the problem of coordination and interaction is discussed in terms of international relations and collective action.</p>
