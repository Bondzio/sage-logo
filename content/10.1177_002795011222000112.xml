<abstract>
<p>This study looks at the recent development (1998–2009) in the number of years of schooling that a 6-year old can expect to attend until their 30th birthday for the EU-27 countries. All countries have seen an increase in the number of expected years of schooling, which is driven mainly by increased tertiary enrolment rates. At the same time the education gap vis-à-vis the US has been closed. The dispersion of expected length of education among EU countries has also decreased. Thus, by this measure, education among countries has become more equal. In spite of this progress, some countries will find it difficult to meet their national targets for tertiary educational attainments for 30–34 year-olds in 2020. This is largely because the tertiary education participation rates of young males have been falling behind those of females in many countries. Focussing on the tertiary educational attainments of 30–34 year-olds leaves governments with little time to pursue policies with substantial impact. It would be preferable to supplement the educational attainment target for 30–34 year-olds with an enrolment target for 20–24 year-olds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Educational attainment and associated quality attract a lot of attention from policymakers and researchers. The level and quality of education affect long-term growth perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-002795011222000112">Barro and Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-002795011222000112">Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008</xref>, 2009). It is one of the core focus areas in the European Commission's Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011222000112">European Commission, 2010</xref>). This study looks at the recent trends in educational attainment across the EU-27 countries. It is concerned with quantity of schooling and does not touch upon quality. Clearly, the effects of education will depend on both the quantity and the quality. The quantities for each country presented in this study can serve as a starting point for constructing quality adjusted school attainment indices, eg using the methods discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-002795011222000112">Mortensen <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref>; however, this is beyond the scope of the present work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-002795011222000112">1</xref></sup> The main interest here is in the number of years of schooling that a six-year-old can expect to attend until he reaches age 30, and the percentage of the population in relevant age groups that is enrolled in or has graduated from tertiary education. Data are available from Eurostat (2010) for the period 1998 to 2009. We also look at gender differences and discuss the usefulness of the Europe 2020 target for tertiary educational achievement together with an assessment of which countries are likely to fulfil their target and which will fail to do so.</p>

<title>Expected number of years of schooling</title>
<p>One way to measure the average level of school attainment for a given age level in a given country is to calculate the expected number of years of schooling an individual will have attained upon reaching the specific age level. This measure will typically be subject to the assumption that the individual at each future age level will attend school with the same probability that individuals at the given age level attend school today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-002795011222000112">Mortensen, 2008</xref>). The number of years of schooling a six-year-old can expect until he reaches the age of 30 can thus be defined as:</p>

<p>where <italic>share</italic>(<italic>educ</italic><sub>age, c</sub>) is the share of individuals with age level <italic>age</italic> attending school in country <italic>c</italic>. For young individuals aged 6–15 years this share will be close to one, whereas it will drop off when looking at older individuals. The cut-off at the 30th birthday is dictated by data availability, but also reflects the fact that the great majority of individuals have finished formal education by the age of 30.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-002795011222000112">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-002795011222000112">Figure 1</xref> shows the estimated number of expected years of schooling for the EU-27 member states and the US in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-002795011222000112">3</xref></sup> The EU-27 average is 15.7 years which is no different from the figure for the US. There is substantial variation within the EU, with values ranging from less than 13 (Luxembourg) to 17.4 (Finland). In Scandinavian countries people tend to be enrolled in school for a longer period than in other EU countries. For the new member states from Central and Eastern Europe the average number of expected years of schooling is usually lower than the EU average, but there are notable exceptions, such as Slovenia, Poland and Lithuania. Of the large member states, the UK and France stand out with relatively low levels of expected years in schooling, close to the performers at the bottom of the league.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is interesting to note that the length of compulsory schooling in a country does not seem to influence the number of expected years of schooling. The correlation between the latter measure and the number of years in compulsory education after the age of six is very small and statistically unimportant. There does seem to be a relevant relationship between expected length of education and public spending on education in per cent of GDP (taken from the Eurostat database). Finland, Denmark and Sweden are all among the top five education spenders in terms of the share of GDP. Relating public spending on education in per cent of GDP to the expected length of education suggests that, on average, an extra year of schooling is associated with increased public spending in the order of one third of a percentage point. Of course, this ignores the fact that some education systems rely more heavily on private spending than others (e.g. the UK).</p>
<p>While the starting age of six years for counting the number of years a child can expect to be in education is justified by the fact that most countries start compulsory schooling from this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-002795011222000112">OECD, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011222000112">European Commission, 2011</xref>), there is nevertheless a potential issue related to differences among countries with respect to the starting age in pre-compulsory school activities (also known as early childhood services, ISCED level 0, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-002795011222000112">OECD, 2006</xref>). However, including pre-compulsory school activities carries the problem that the quality of and access to early childhood services among countries is likely to vary to a larger extent than it does for compulsory education in EU countries. In some countries early childhood services are connected with primary schools and last a full school day while in others kindergartens, not connected with the school system, are the norm.</p>
<p>In appears that measuring the expected number of years from different starting ages does not change the relative picture for more than a few countries. The correlation between the rankings of countries when measuring at five years rather than at six years is 0.99. If we measure from the age of four years, only three countries move more than three places in the overall ranking of countries relative to the ranking of countries if the starting point is six years (the correlation between these two rankings is 0.96). Estonia and France both move four places up in the table, whereas Poland moves seven places down the list of countries.</p>
<p>Access to early childhood services for three-year-olds differs widely within the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-002795011222000112">OECD, 2006</xref>). As a consequence there are some differences in the ranking among countries when measuring the expected stay in educational services at three years compared to six years of age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-002795011222000112">figure 2</xref>). The solid line marks the ranking of countries when measuring expected length in education from the perspective of a six-year-old, with Finland ranked highest and Luxembourg lowest (as previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-002795011222000112">figure 1</xref>), whereas the squares mark each country's ranking when measuring from the perspective of a three-year-old. In particular Greece and Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-002795011222000112">4</xref></sup> (where few children are registered as attending early childhood services at the age of three) and Poland (where less than half attend early childhood services) fare worse in the ranking when expected years of schooling are measured at age three.</p>

</fig>
<p>Overall, the message is that the age level from which the expected number of years in schooling is measured does not make a large impact on the ranking of the EU countries, save for a few countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-002795011222000112">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-002795011222000112">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-002795011222000112">4</xref> present the development in the expected number of years of schooling between 1998/2000 and 2009 (the years where data are available) comparing first the EU-27 with the US and then the differences in trends within the EU. In the past decade the EU has caught up with the US in educational attainment measured by the expected number of years in education. The earlier expansion of tertiary education in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-002795011222000112">Jorgensen and Fraumeni, 1992</xref>) led to a positive gap in educational attainment relative to the level in the EU. This significant gap of more than half a year in 2000 was closed by 2009. In that period the EU increased expected education length by more than three quarters of a year, whereas the same measure for the US only increased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-002795011222000112">figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The corresponding developments in the period 1998–2009 for the EU member states at the country level are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-002795011222000112">figure 4</xref>, ordered by expected years of schooling in 2009. The first thing to note is that the tendency towards longer education spells is universal among the 27 EU countries, although for Luxembourg the increase is marginal. The largest changes have taken place in countries which all had below EU-27 average expected lengths of education (Romania, Lithuania, Greece, Slovenia, Latvia, Cyprus and Hungary). These countries all added more than two years to the number of expected years in schooling for a six-year-old pupil. The Eastern European countries have in general done very well in expanding average education length. Of the eight Eastern European countries joining the EU in 2004, and Bulgaria and Romania, nine are in the top half measured by expansion of average education length. Only Estonia, which was already well above average expected education length in 1998, is not in the top half of countries measured by education expansion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of expected years in education differs significantly between these countries. Romania had one of the lowest values of expected years of schooling (12.5 years) at the age of six in 1998 and is still in the lower group by 2009, even though the number of expected years of schooling has increased up to 15.2 years. Other countries, such as Latvia and Hungary, started from a low level in 1998 and have reached the average EU level of number of expected school years by 2009. Poland, Lithuania and in particular Slovenia were able to catch up with the top group with over sixteen expected years of schooling at the age of six.</p>
<p>The dispersion of the expected number of years in education among the EU-27 countries, measured by the coefficient of variation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-002795011222000112">6</xref></sup> has decreased by around 10 per cent in the period under consideration. By this measure, education outcomes, measured by the expected number of years in education, have become more equal across the EU-27 countries. Leaving out Malta and Luxembourg – countries with low expected number of years in schooling and scant improvement in the period – inequality, measured by the coefficient of variation, has decreased by 30 per cent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-002795011222000112">
<title>Expansion of tertiary education</title>
<p>The measure of the number of expected years of schooling is agnostic about when – or at which age level – schooling takes place. An increase in the number of expected years of schooling can come about both by increasing participation in primary and secondary schooling and/or by an expansion of tertiary education. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-002795011222000112">Figure 5</xref> shows the increase in the number of expected years of schooling at the EU-27 level distributed over age groups.</p>
<fig id="fig5-002795011222000112" position="float">
<label>Figure 5.</label>
<caption><p>Contribution to total change in number of expected years of schooling 1998–2009 by age, EU-27</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000112-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Around three quarters of the total change in years of schooling is added after fifteen years of age. The age of sixteen is also when the school enrolment rate starts to drop off from 100 per cent. Whereas 99 per cent of all fifteen year-olds attend school, only 95 per cent of sixteen year-olds do. Thus, there has been some growth in the enrolment rate of the population of secondary school age (16–18 years old) but a larger share of the increase in the number of expected years of schooling comes from the increase in enrolment rates in the age groups which primarily attend tertiary education (19+ years old).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-002795011222000112">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-002795011222000112">figure 6</xref> shows a substantial increase in the percentage of persons with tertiary education between 2000 and 2010 in the EU-27. While in 2000 17.1 per cent of the EU-27 population of 15–64 years had attained a tertiary education level, by 2010 22.7 per cent of this population group had a tertiary degree. This development seems to be omnipresent in Europe, as an increase in the tertiary education participation took place in each single country of the 27 EU member states.</p>
<fig id="fig6-002795011222000112" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000112-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Looking only at the age group of 25–34 year-olds, the increase in tertiary educational attainment is even clearer; from 2000 to 2010 the share of 25–34 year-olds with tertiary education increased by 10 percentage points from 23 per cent to 33 per cent.</p>
<sec id="section4-002795011222000112">
<title>Gender differences in school attainment</title>
<p>Starting from a historic position where females in most EU-27 and OECD countries could expect much shorter education durations than their male counterparts, there has been a long-running trend that the gender difference in length of education was narrowing and females were catching up with their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-002795011222000112">OECD, 2011</xref>). Indeed, in most EU-27 countries, except Germany, the Netherlands and Cyprus, where there is a more or less perfect gender balance, females now spend more time in education than males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-002795011222000112">figure 7</xref>). The tendency for females to spend longer, on average, in education than males had already become clear in 1998, but it has since become even more prominent.</p>
<fig id="fig7-002795011222000112" position="float">
<label>Figure 7.</label>
<caption><p>Expected number of years in education for males and females, EU-27, 2009</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000112-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the EU-27, females stay in education around half a year longer than males but, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-002795011222000112">figure 7</xref> reveals, there are vast differences across the Union. In Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Sweden, females remain in education more than one extra year compared to males. For another six countries, Denmark, Lithuania, Belgium, Slovakia, Romania and Spain, the difference is three quarters of a year. In Germany, the Netherlands and Cyprus, there is a small difference in the expected number of years in education in favour of males. For most countries the female lead over males in educational attainment has increased since 1998.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the female–male educational gap arises between the age of 20 and 24, the difference predominantly stemming from differences in tertiary enrolment rates in this age group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-002795011222000112">figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Will the Europe 2020 educational attainment target be met?</title>
<p>One of the targets in the Europe 2020 Smart, Inclusive and Sustainable growth strategy is that 40 per cent of those who are between 30 and 34 years old in 2020 should have attained a tertiary education level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011222000112">European Commission, 2010</xref>). This EU-wide target is backed by national governments' commitment to specific national targets. The Commission estimates that adding up the national targets is equivalent to an EU-27 target of around 38–39 per cent of individuals aged 30–34 having a tertiary degree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-002795011222000112">8</xref></sup> In the following we focus on the extent to which member states are likely to fulfil their national targets. Seven countries have already done so: Denmark (target “at least 40 per cent”, in 2010 the figure was 47), Lithuania (40, 44), Luxembourg (40, 46), the Netherlands (40, 41), Finland (42, 46), Estonia (40, 40) and Sweden (45, 46). Therefore, these countries, and the UK which has not specified a national target, are excluded from further analysis.</p>
<p>One noteworthy feature of the educational attainment target is that – even if it is a mid- to long-term target – it does, in fact, leave national governments with only a few years to act in a substantive way. The reason for this is that after 2014 increasing tertiary enrolment rates – and hence future tertiary attainment rates – for persons below 24 years will not affect the tertiary attainment rates for 30–34 year-olds in 2020. Furthermore, increasing tertiary enrolments for eighteen and nineteen year-olds will not affect national governments' ability to reach the target in 2020, since these individuals will be younger than the 30–34 year age range specified for that target. This is important since, throughout the EU-27, close to 80 per cent of people enrolled in a tertiary degree are below 25 years old. The number would be likely to be higher than 80 per cent if data were available for enrolments into first tertiary degrees, since a substantial number of older individuals are likely to be enrolled for their second tertiary degree, and thus will not count towards an increase in the education attainment target. Although one should probably recognise that the 2020 targets serve more as inspiration and guidance for policy action in important areas than for very strict goals that must be fulfilled, it would have been preferable to supplement the attainment target aimed at 30–34 year-olds with an enrolment target for 20–24 year-olds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-002795011222000112">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a simple framework for evaluating what tertiary education attainment for the 30–34 year-olds in 2020 will look like, we decompose attainment in a given year (for 30–34 year-olds) into three components: the attainment of 20–24 year-olds ten years earlier, the enrolment rate of 20–24 year-olds ten years earlier, and a component reflecting that some individuals obtain a first tertiary degree after their 25th birthday without being enrolled when they are between 20 and 24 years old.

<p>Below we use equation (3) to make an assessment of the likely level of tertiary education attainment in 2020. However, first a number of caveats are in order. Data are only available for combined first and second tertiary education, but equation (3) relates strictly to first tertiary educations. Some double counting may therefore arise if 20–24 year-olds enrol in a second tertiary programme after completing a first tertiary programme. Additional double counting may arise because graduation is typically mid-year. Thus, an individual can be enrolled and have a degree in the same year. Data on the completion rate are not available. It is set to equal one which will lead to a degree of overestimation of attainment in 2020. Finally, we do not have reliable data on the <italic>C</italic> factor. We assume it to be constant, but it is likely that an increase in the enrolment rate (<italic>E<sub>20Y</sub></italic>) will diminish the contribution from the <italic>C</italic> factor. All these factors point in the direction of a slightly optimistic assessment below.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the attainment rate in 2010, combined with the change in enrolment and attainment rates for 20–24 year-olds between 2000 and 2010, does not bring a country close to its national target, then it would have to make substantial progress in increasing tertiary completion rates and/or enrolment and graduation rates among individuals aged 25–34 in the coming years (a positive contribution from the <italic>C</italic> factor).</p>
<p>Among the nineteen countries whose targets have not yet been reached, a number of countries will most likely reach their national targets, whereas for other countries it will be an enormous achievement to come close to their targets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-002795011222000112">Figure 9</xref> shows the gap between the relevant attainment rate in 2010 and the target (the distance between the black square and the bottom black outlined area). Cyprus, Belgium, Latvia, Spain, Greece and Hungary are all within 5 percentage points of their national targets. However, three countries – Slovakia, Portugal and Austria – have a gap of 15 percentage points or more.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-002795011222000112">Figure 9</xref> also includes changes in enrolment rates (red outline) and attainment rates (red) as laid out above. Based on this metric an additional number of countries will likely fulfil their national targets. Cyprus, Belgium, Latvia, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Poland and Czech Republic should all manage to do so, as will Italy, and even Slovakia – with its very ambitious target given its starting point. Malta and Bulgaria might get within reach of their national targets. For Spain the gap to close is not large at little more than 3 percentage points; however, both the enrolment and attainment rates among the 20–24 year-olds have decreased in the period between 2000 and 2010. This trend will have to be turned around in the near future if Spain is to reach its target. France, with its already high attainment rate in 2010, faces the same decline in enrolment rates for 20– 24 year-olds (and only a marginal increase in attainment among this age group).</p>
<p>Other countries not on track to reach their national targets are Portugal, Austria, and, probably, Ireland. Ireland already has the highest educational attainment rate for the relevant age group, but is unlikely to reach 60 per cent in 2020. Austria has a fairly large gap of 14 percentage points between current educational attainment rates and their national targets and is unlikely to fulfil its target, although data are missing on changes in attainment rates. Finally, Portugal has a very ambitious target given its low starting point and enrolments for the 20–24 year-old age group have barely moved in the previous decade. An enormous effort would be needed to come close to the national target.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the likely failure of France and Ireland to meet their national targets is in large part due to how ambitious the targets are. The same goes for Portugal, given its starting point and the fact that Portugal is spending below the EU average (in terms of per cent of GDP) on its education system. This is also true of Austria, although spending on education is higher there. The target for Spain may be reachable if public spending reaches the EU average. Currently, Spain is committing significantly less resources as a percentage of GDP to the education sector than the EU average.</p>
<p>It is revealing of the gender gap in tertiary education to look at the attainment target from a gender perspective. Judged by the metric presented above, almost every country either has fulfilled or is on a clear track to fulfil the tertiary attainment target for women (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-002795011222000112">figure 10</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig10-002795011222000112" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Exceptions to this are France and Spain, which will marginally miss their targets, and Austria, which is missing the target by around 6 percentage points, and Portugal, which even for women is short of its national target. In Portugal the enrolment rate of female students in the age group 20–24 has even declined slightly over the period considered. For many countries fulfilling their national targets on tertiary educational attainment is really about persuading young men of the benefits of a tertiary degree.</p>
<p>An interesting question is whether the current economic crisis and, in particular, the recent increases in youth unemployment, will act as a catalyst for enrolment in tertiary education. If there is a positive association between (youth) unemployment and the tendency to pursue higher education it might not change the above analysis much since it covers the crisis years 2008–10. Nevertheless, if high unemployment rates persist, it could potentially draw more people in the 25–29 age group into university. In theory, both positive and negative effects of the level of unemployment on further investments in human capital can be identified. First, a larger probability of being unemployed lowers the opportunity cost – in terms of foregone earnings – of pursuing further studies. However, if unemployment is also increasing at higher education levels, the return to additional education will also diminish. Second, there might be negative wealth effects deriving from parents' probability of unemployment and, hence, lower ability to support young adults in education or make necessary initial investments (i.e. enrolment fees, moving costs etc.). With imperfect capital markets this would tend to lower educational enrolment.</p>
<p>The net effect on enrolment rates will depend on education institutions, welfare policies and the composition of unemployment, and is therefore likely to vary from country to country. Probably for these reasons the empirical literature reaches mixed conclusions regarding the effect of unemployment levels on the tendency to pursue education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-002795011222000112">Handa and Skolnik (1975)</xref> find a ‘very weak’ effect of youth unemployment on enrolment in university education in Ontario, Canada, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-002795011222000112">Card and Lemieux (1997)</xref> – using data from the US and Canada – find a positive effect of weak local labour market conditions on educational enrolment for 16–24 year-olds. In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-002795011222000112">Clark (2011)</xref> shows that higher regional youth unemployment positively affects enrolment in post-compulsory education in England; the same conclusion as reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-002795011222000112">Rice (1999)</xref> for England and Wales. For Spain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000112">Fernandez and Shioji (2001)</xref> find that regional unemployment of non-graduates positively affects university enrolment rates – at least in the short term – whereas the longer-term effect may be negative due to the wealth effect.</p>
<p>An informal look at EU cross-country data on unemployment/employment and enrolment data for the period from 2007–9 (the latest year available) does not suggest that youth unemployment is a large driver of tertiary education enrolment. The increase in the overall tertiary enrolment rate for the EU-27 has been less than 1 percentage point, which is less than the trend for the period 2000–9. Most Mediterranean countries have seen little in the way of increased tertiary enrolment – Greece being an exception. On the other hand, Lithuania has seen a 3 percentage point increase in the enrolment rate on the back of a 21 percentage point increase in youth unemployment. A simple correlation between the change in number of employed young people and the change in the enrolment rate across the EU-27 shows a small negative but insignificant correlation.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that things may have changed considerably since 2009, the analysis above points to a potential role for public policy in promoting individual investment in further education – especially tertiary education. For some countries this would help towards reaching their national target for tertiary attainment in 2020. While the scope of any public policy programmes will be dictated by government finances, it should be kept in mind that with youth unemployment high in most countries, such programmes are comparably cheaper than when demand for labour is strong.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has looked at recent developments in the number of years of schooling that a six-year-old can expect to attend before his 30th birthday for the EU-27 countries. All EU-27 countries have seen an increase in the number of expected years of schooling for a six-year-old child. This is mainly driven by an increase in tertiary enrolment rates, as would be expected since primary enrolment rates are very close to 100 per cent. As a result, the education gap vis-à-vis the US has been closed in the past decade. In addition, there has been some increase in the age group at which individuals are most likely to attend secondary schooling. The gender gap in favour of females has further increased – in most countries – or has stagnated in a few countries. This is driven mainly by a gender gap in tertiary enrolment at all age levels. Educational attainment across the EU-27 has become more equal by the measure of the coefficient of variation. Looking at the Europe 2020 target for tertiary educational attainment for 30–34 year-olds, we find that most countries either have already or are likely to reach their national targets for 2020. Five countries are unlikely to meet their targets: Portugal, Austria, Spain, France and Ireland (the German target could not be evaluated). In addition to those come Bulgaria and Malta which might or might not succeed. These countries' failure to reach their targets is mostly due to ambitious targets, given the respective starting points and insufficient educational spending. Looking only at female students, all but a few countries have either fulfilled their national targets – and some with a substantial margin – or are likely to fulfil or come very close to fulfilling their Europe 2020 national targets. Exceptions to this are Portugal and Austria. For many EU countries the focus should be on persuading young males of the benefits stemming from tertiary degrees. It is further argued that the target's focus on the 30–34 year-old age group leaves governments with little time to pursue policies with substantial impact. Supplementing the educational attainment target for 30–34 year-olds with an enrolment target for 20–24 year-olds would be preferable.</p>
