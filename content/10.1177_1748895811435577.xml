<p>It is over 20 years since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811435577">Robert Reiner (1991)</xref> carried out the first detailed study of Chief Constables in England and Wales. Since then major changes to policing have taken place and continue to take place under the current Coalition government. Bryn Caless does not profess to repeat Reiner’s seminal study, but he certainly pays homage to it. In Caless’s case it is not Chief Constables, but the whole of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) – Chiefs, Deputies and Assistants – who form the basis of his study. In so doing, he states that he is providing ‘rich detail of chief officers’ views’ (p. xv) on a wide range of policing themes, relations and developments. What results is an interesting book, which for a number of reasons does not quite fulfil its promise.</p>
<p>Right from the start Caless admits that he is not trying to write a work of sociology or criminology. However, he does not provide the reader with a wholly convincing framework for the book. By avoiding the disciplines of both and neglecting a more rigorous method, he reduces the potential impact of what is an important piece of work. The problems start with an absence of good demographic data about his interviewees. He has interviewed 43 per cent of serving officers of ACPO rank – a very high response rate for any set of semi-structured interviews – but we are never provided with a clear idea of which 43 per cent were included in the study. If a second edition of the book is to be published then this omission needs addressing. We need to know, at the very least, the gender, ethnicity, age, education, force and rank of the Chief Officers to be able to assess the potential selection bias and judge the validity of his conclusions. At one point, he himself admits ‘in retrospect, it might have been helpful to ascertain’ (p. 187) whether the views were biased by age and experience.</p>
<p>The second major flaw is the absence of a discussion about the questions chosen for his study. There are some really curious omissions. Given that the interviews were with ACPO officers, it is most peculiar that there was no question devoted to their views about the institution itself, instead of a rather oblique review of the way Chief Officers function within their national ACPO roles. Given that ACPO itself has been recently under so much political and media scrutiny, it would have been helpful and timely to have had some qualitative data on Chief Officers’ views about their own Association and its future. It would have been even better had there been a more criminological review of the issues in policing which was then used to provide context and priority to the questioning framework.</p>
<p>The third and final major flaw is the factual accuracy of some of the material presented. At one point Alan Milburn is credited with having been Home Secretary (when the author clearly meant Alan Johnson!) and there is a string of references to ACPO having taken over training and leadership from the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which are not (yet) reflective of current arrangements. These inaccuracies are compounded by far too many heavy footnotes under the main text.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is an important book worth reading for one chapter alone. Chapter 4, which covers Chief Officers’ relationships with their Police Authorities, Her Majesties Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Home Office, is riveting and tells us why radical reform of the tripartite constitutional structure of police governance is overdue. Even I, as a former Chief Constable, was astonished by just how negative the views of the Chief Officers were about all three relationships. For example, over 85 per cent stated that their relationship with the Home Office was ‘bad’. The latter figure demonstrates just how ‘corrosive’ the tripartite system has become, with Home Office tinkering with every detail of policing and the short-termism of policy initiatives having created an almost complete breakdown in trust between the Home Office and Chief Officers.</p>
<p>The most spectacular passages of the book are like a gripping comedy sketch. The Association of Police Authorities refused to respond to Caless’s offer of a response to Chief Officers’ criticisms of Police Authorities, but the Home Office put up a senior official to provide its response. Caless very adeptly lets this official’s words speak for themselves. They eloquently convey the reasons why the relationship between the department and some of its most critical stakeholders has reached rock bottom and why the department remains ‘unfit for purpose’, as it was famously described by former Home Secretary, John Reid in 2006.</p>
<p>A key strength of the book is the way that it lets the Chief Officers narrate the process of their own professional development. Caless manages to show how tough the selection process is, how it produces a very competitive breed of Chief Officers (with obvious consequences for how they manage the organization and the competitive behaviour between forces) and how important operational expertise is as a guarantor of credibility. He goes on to cover this issue again in a section on the question of entry to the police service, which is now very timely given that the UK government has revived policy interest in multiple points of entry to senior ranks. Related to these debates, Caless provides some important commentary on how the role of Chief Officers has developed, as well as the changing nature of their relationships within the policy network of policing. Caless’s own background in the military and higher education allows him to use the material to make some significant comments on the need for change to the training and development process for policing. His data show that educational standards among senior police managers have increased hugely since Reiner’s pioneering study and there has been a significant shift in the direction of a more professional service. The findings therefore provide further evidence to support the general direction of travel recently recommended by the <italic>Review of Police Leadership and Training</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811435577">Neyroud, 2011</xref>), which documented an increasingly professional police institution emerging in the context of more structured relations between police training and higher education.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is well worth reading, providing a unique insight into the senior ranks of the British police service at a time of major change. It provides some useful evidence for those thinking about the future of the service and some very worrying material for those already alarmed by the intrusion of politics into operational policing decisions. On the evidence of this book, that horse has already bolted. It is clear from the responses that Chief Officers already feel that they are vulnerable to national political interference. The impending arrival (scheduled for late 2012) of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners – who will have a crucial role in the governance of local policing and community safety – seems likely to relegate them still further to the role of Chief ‘Operating’ Officers subordinate to and ‘at the will’ of elected politicians, many of whom are likely to be ambitious to make their mark before moving on to national politics. If the relationships are corrosive now (and Caless provides incontrovertible evidence that they are), it is predictable that they will be far worse in the not too distant future.</p>
