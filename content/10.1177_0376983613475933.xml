<p>The National Book Trust has rendered a commendable service to nationalist historiography in India by bringing out a fresh edition of the freedom fighter Lajpat Rai’s book <italic>Young India</italic> which they had published earlier in 1965 conjointly with the Indian Publications Division. The book had originally seen the light of the day in 1916 in the USA, which had at that time been the heaven of the fugitives from the British ‘rule of law’. Lajpat Rai had the boldness to question the fetish that the British had been making of this ‘rule of law’ and prosecuting Indian nationalists for trying to subvert that ‘rule of law’ even in those days by asking ‘By what Law?’ and ‘Who made that Law?’ (p. 82). The purpose of writing this book was to reach out to the Western world that lay outside the pale of the British sceptre and expose the tyrannies perpetrated by the British on their Indian subjects. Compared to the British their Mohammedan predecessors on the throne of India had been much better rulers in the assessment of Lajpat as the Mohammedans had made India their home and spent all their tax collections from India in the country itself so that the country as a whole benefitted even from their luxuries and extravagances. The liberal British doctrine of free trade on the other hand was an instrument of oppressing the cotton weavers of India who suffered the terrible consequences of de-industrialisation. Lajpat was surprised that the Bengal Muslims opposed Swadeshi during the partition years as boycott of English mill products would have helped the cause of Muslim weavers as the import index of Lancashire cotton in India exhibited during those years. He lamented the divisive impact of British propaganda and British policy of favouritism to the Muslims since 1888 in education grants and job reservations to split the nationalist opposition down the middle. Lajpat truly recognised the strength of combined Hindu–Muslim movement in 1857, which was ‘national as well as political’ (p. 83). He attributed the failure of the uprising of 1857 to the successful diplomatic postures of the British, whereby they could convince the nobility, the aristocracy and the general populace about the fearful prospects of anarchy in the countryside that the success of the mutineers portended. ‘British conquest of India was not a military conquest in any sense of the term. They could not conquer India except by playing on the fears of some and the hopes of others, and by seeking and getting the help of Indians, both moral and material’ (p. 82). In this context Lajpat explained in detail how the British worked assiduously on the Guru Teg Bahadur myth prevalent among the Sikhs of the Guru’s curse about the Mughal capital’s destiny to be ravaged by the <italic>Guruji ka Sikhs</italic> to avenge the ruthless murder of the Guru by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and enlisted their services to bring about the defeat of the Bengal Army.</p>
<p>Lajpat’s pen was equally proficient in tracing the mentality of the ‘Bengali Babu’ whom the British could utilise for quelling down the ‘Mutiny’ and the subsequent settling down of the countryside. English education and jobs in the subordinate service of the British had brought the whole of northern India under the domination of the Babu which had made them sympathisers of British rule and led them to fear its subversion by the uncouth northerners. But disappointments in securing higher berths in the civil service and the clever British ploy to exclude the civil service aspirants by holding the examinations in England and lowering the maximum age for sitting in those examinations soon opened the eyes of the Bengali Babu about the equality of the rule of law. Henceforth the elites of the three coastal Presidencies began to sympathise with the rough rural folk of the rest of the country and the nationalist movement began to gather a new momentum.</p>
<p>Lajpat was not a supporter of violence and terrorism that began to characterise the course of nationalism after the Congress was gripped by extremism, but he had been deported to Rangoon in 2007 for extremism. He understood why the ‘Christmas Conferences’ (here Lajpat quoted Aurobindo Ghosh p. 167) of the Indian National Congress did not gather much popular support initially but during its later stages he acknowledged the Indian National Congress’s potentiality to emerge as a national rallying point. Lajpat tried to dispel the British propaganda that the people of India were illiterate and therefore not fit for self-rule. He devoted several pages of his book in conjuring up images of the good administration India had experienced in the golden ages of the Mauryas and the Guptas. Lajpat always drew upon indigenous inspirations for nationalism like Guru Gobind Singh, Guru Ramdas and Sivaji. Like the Slavophiles of Russia he spoke of the immense potentialities of the Indian village communities, which contained the seeds of self-rule and he quoted the former viceroy Sir John Lawrence’s accolades in favour of the village communities being little republics. Lajpat wanted Indian nationalism to be truly national and to embrace Muslims, Hindus as well as the Sikhs. British repression in Egypt, Persia and Turkey had awakened the Muslims to the real nature of British imperialism. The Sikhs had also begun to recognise the cruel face of British imperialism since the Komagata Maru incident and the treatment of the Sikhs in Canada. Thus Lajpat could hope for a united and truly ‘national’ movement in India. He began to sympathise with the movements of repressed nationalities all over the world, with the Poles, Finns, Egyptians, Persians and the Irish. His heroes were not merely Cavour, Garibaldi, Mazzini or Bismarck. He could look beyond them to Kossuth, Emmet and also Parnell. For a person of Lajpat Rai’s age it was actually quite in advance of his age to recognise the efficacy of the movement of the English proletariat against the industrial capitalists.</p>
<p>After all these, however, Lajpat could not aspire after much more than self-rule within the Empire. Both Reverend Sunderland of the US in his 1916 introduction and K.L. Tuteja in his 2011 introduction had to admit that. Like Tagore, who had been presenting his ‘Nationalism’ lectures in the US exactly in the year 1916 and whom Lajpat had acknowledged in his writings, Lajpat could only plead for self-rule within the penumbra of British rule. In 1916 complete independence was still a far cry. Yet Lajpat should be credited with having identified where exactly the weaknesses of Indian nationalism lay and he exhorted his fellow travellers on the path of nationalism to strive to eliminate them.</p>
