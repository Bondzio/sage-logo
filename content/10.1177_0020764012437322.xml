<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Fifty years ago, nations of the world including India (UDHR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764012437322">United Nations, 1998</xref>) joined together to issue a document designed to protect the basic rights of all citizens: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But today its promises remain unfulfilled for certain vulnerable groups, especially those with mental illness. Human rights protect individuals’ ability to meet their basic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764012437322">Buchanan, 2004</xref>). People with mental disorders around the world are exposed to a wide range of human rights violations in the areas of employment, health, education and housing. Many are denied basic human rights such as the right to vote, to marry and have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764012437322">World Health Organizaton, 2005</xref>). A free India is no exception. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare estimates that 6%–7% of India’s population suffers from mental disorders and about 25% of people with mental illness are homeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012437322">Bharathi &amp; Swaminathan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2006, India was one among the many countries that signed the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which provides treatment, protection against human rights abuses, and equal opportunities for people with disabilities (including people with mental illness). In reality, there is weak compliance with human rights laws, which is evident from the fact that patients continue to be kept under inhuman conditions in mental asylums, rehabilitation centres, and religious and healing centres. In a recent incident, 27 psychiatric patients died in a fire in 2001 at Moideen Badhusha Mental Home at Erwadi Dharga, because they had been fettered and could not escape. Today, nine years later, and despite the existence of laws against such practices, nothing has changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012437322">Bharathi &amp; Swaminathan, 2010</xref>). In a recent survey, an obvious correlation was noted between mental illness and human rights violations and human dignity was reported to be almost absent in the life of people with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012437322">Sane and Enthusiast Volunteers’ Association of Calcutta, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There is an interesting link between literacy and human rights. Literacy has been recognized not only as a right in itself but also as a mechanism for the pursuit of other human rights. Literacy enables a person to think rationally, to be understanding, to be more responsible, to demand protection and to make their own decisions. Illiteracy is the mother of all issues as it gives birth to many other issues like poverty, unemployment and delay in help-seeking behaviour. While the constitution of India provides free and compulsory primary education, actual delivery remains patchy. India has 35% of the world’s total illiterates and has been ranked 105th in the Global Monitoring Report (GMR) 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764012437322">Singh, 2009</xref>). Lack of education and little access to law and their own citizenship rights still remain as challenges to people with mental disabilities in the state, in spite of 61 years of Indian Independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764012437322">Swadhikaar Center, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>People with mental illness experience a lot of stigma and discrimination and those with illiteracy and mental illness are doubly discriminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012437322">Lincoln et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012437322">Murthy, 2004</xref>). Mental illness and illiteracy can contribute towards staggering economic and social costs. In developing countries, up to 90% of people with psychiatric disabilities live with their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012437322">Krahl, 2000</xref>). The extent of family support for people with psychiatric disabilities has often been cited as a major factor in the rehabilitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764012437322">Stanhope, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764012437322">Wig, 2000</xref>) and family environment serves as a protective factor in recovery. In India, family is an important social agency that meets the various needs of its members. Therefore it has to provide an environment that protects the basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of people with mental illness, which is essential to the prevention of relapse and the promotion of mental health. In reality this is not occurring because of illiteracy and negative attitudes towards mental illness.</p>
<p>Currently, little or no research exists about how people with mental illness and illiteracy perceive human rights needs at the family and community level compared to literates with mental illness.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0020764012437322">
<title>Design and setting</title>
<p>This was a descriptive study carried out at a tertiary care centre, among recovered psychiatric patients from August 2010 to November 2010.</p>
<p>Study participants were selected through a random sampling method of the database of patients attending the outpatient department of a psychiatric hospital. All these patients had already been seen in detail by a junior resident, senior resident and consultant. They also had a detailed medical chart of their history, diagnosis, treatment and outcome on each follow-up. These patients were selected for randomization for the study. Those who met the inclusion criteria were interviewed. The study criteria were recovered psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of either schizophrenic or mood disorders in the past, based on the criteria of the ICD-10. In the present study, recovered patients meant a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012437322">Guy, 1976</xref>). The study sample comprised 100 recovered psychiatric patients and covered an age span of 18–60 years. We excluded symptomatic and cognitively impaired patients. Hence, recovered persons with mental illness who are symptom free may be the true representative of the target population because in the absence of mental illness, they can ascertain and defend their rights.</p>
<p>The following definitions were adopted to define literate and illiterate. Illiterates were those who had not had any formal education and were unable to read and write in any language. Literates were those who had received formal education and were able read and write in any language. We defined human rights violations as abuse to right to life, liberty, freedom, education, health and so forth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764012437322">
<title>Measurement tools</title>
<p><italic>Clinical Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI-I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012437322">Guy, 1976</xref>)</italic>. This is a standardized assessment tool used to rate the severity of illness, change over time, and efficacy of medication, taking into account the patient’s clinical condition and the severity of side effects. The CGI-I is rated on a seven-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) to 7 (among the most severely ill patients).</p>
<p><italic>Socio-demographic schedule.</italic> The socio-demographic details taken were age, gender, educational status, marital status, employment, residence, religion, monthly income, type of family, diagnosis and duration of illness (in months).</p>
<p><italic>Needs assessment questionnaire.</italic> This questionnaire comprises two sections. Section A was developed by the researchers, based on the UDHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764012437322">United Nations, 1998</xref>) and a review of the literature, to assess the human right needs in the family domain. This tool has 57 items under five dimensions: physical, emotional, religious, social and ethical needs. This is a four-point (ordinal) scale, rated 0 (never) to 3 (always). There are no right or wrong answers.</p>
<p>The items in the physical needs dimension (18 items) focus mainly on article 25 in the UDHR to assess the right to a decent life, including adequate food, clothing, housing and medical care services (e.g. availability of light, electricity, safe drinking water, food common for family members, etc.).</p>
<p>The items in the emotional needs dimension (17 items) were based on article 5 (No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) and article 12 (No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation) of the UDHR to evaluate emotional needs (e.g. family environment helps to maintain dignity, commenting on physical appearance, privacy in terms of opening mails, monitoring phone calls, etc.).</p>
<p>The items in the religious needs dimension (4 items) assess the religious rights of the participants based on article 18 (Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion) of the UDHR (e.g. Forcing to practise other religious and witchcraft/black magic activities, etc.).</p>
<p>The items in the social needs dimension (8 items) were based on article 13 (Everyone has the right to freedom of movement) and article 20 (Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association) of the UDHR to measure social and economic rights (e.g. allowing the participants to go out of the home, keeping them from going to a job/school by their family members, allowing them to handle money, etc.).</p>
<p>The items of the ethical needs dimension (10 items) were based on articles 1, 2, 3, 16, 17 and 26 of the UDHR to assess the right to equality in dignity, right to live in freedom and safety, right to marry, right to own property and right to education.</p>
<p>In section B, the researchers used a modified version of <italic>Taking the Human Rights Temperature of your Community</italic> developed by World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012437322">Flowers, Bernbaum, Rudelius-Palmer, &amp; Tolman, 2000</xref>) to assess human rights needs of people with mental illness in the community domain. This scale contains 25 items with a five-point scale, rated 0 (don’t know) to 4 (always). The above-mentioned instruments were developed in the English language and administered in the format of face-to-face interview.</p>
<p>This tool was modified to suit to the Indian context (related to mental illness), without losing the essence of questions. For example, ‘My community is a place where residents are safe and secure’ was modified to ‘My community is a place where mentally ill patients are safe and secure.’ Items 12, 17, 18, 21 and 22 were completely changed as suggested by the experts. According to the Indian constitution and international covenants (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), right to vote, right to continuing education and right not to be discriminated against are given more importance, and exploring these issues were more relevant to the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020764012437322">
<title>Validity and reliability of the tools</title>
<p>The needs assessment questionnaire was validated by 11 experts from various fields such as nursing, psychiatry, psychiatric social work, psychology, human rights and statistics. The final questionnaire was modified according to the experts’ suggestions. The scale’s reliability assessment was done by using the test–retest method. The researchers administered the tool on 10 recovered psychiatric patients at the follow-up outpatient department over a two-week period and found that the study was feasible. Any modifications deemed necessary were made. The reliability coefficient for the structured questionnaire was 0.96.</p>
<p>Data were collected by the primary author through face-to-face interview, in a private room at the treatment facilities where the participants were recruited. It took approximately 45 minutes to complete the structured questionnaire. The researchers educated the family members in groups regarding the rights of persons with mental illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0020764012437322">
<title>Ethical consideration</title>
<p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the concerned hospital. Written consent was obtained from the participants and they were given freedom to quit the study. Participants’ confidentiality was respected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0020764012437322">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Responses of the negatively worded items were reversed before data analysis. The data were analysed using SPSS version 16 and the results were presented in narratives and tables. Descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential statistics (<italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> test) were used to interpret the data. Wherever numbers were less than five in a category, those categories were clubbed for <italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020764012437322" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 100 recovered psychiatric patients of whom 53 were men and 47 were women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764012437322">Table 1</xref>). Mean age (<italic>M</italic> ± SD) of participants was 34.68 ± 10.69 years (range: 18–60 years). The number of literates (57%) was higher than illiterate participants (43%). The majority of the men were literate (<italic>n</italic> = 35, 61.4%), whereas the majority of the women were illiterate (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 58.1%). Most of the sample was married (68%). Surprisingly, 36.8% of the literates were unmarried compared to 20.9% of the illiterate participants. A large number of participants from both groups were Hindu (86%). An insignificant number of them were Muslims and Christians (9% and 5%, respectively). This is in parity with the distribution of the population of India with respect to religion. The average income (<italic>M</italic> ± SD) of participants was 4,919 ± 5,724 rupees. The majority of the literates (<italic>n</italic> = 48, 84.2%) were above the poverty line (APL); the corresponding figure for illiterate participants was 30 (69.8%). In the present study, the poverty line was considered to be a participant’s family income of 1,700 rupees a month (approximately $1.23 a day). This criterion was defined according to the hospital policies where the study took place and follows the World Bank poverty estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more literate participants (<italic>n</italic> = 24, 42.1%) were self-employed than illiterates (<italic>n</italic> = 14, 32.6%). Most of the participants came from urban areas (<italic>n</italic> = 24, 55.8% of illiterates; <italic>n</italic> = 30, 52.6% of literates) and belonged to nuclear families (58%).</p>

<p>More than three-quarters (<italic>n</italic> = 44, 77.2%) of the literate participants, and significantly more than the illiterate, were abused verbally by family members (<italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 17.759, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000).

<p>Although no significant differences were seen in the responses of literate and illiterate participants in ethical needs dimension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764012437322">Table 2</xref>) and in the community domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020764012437322">Table 3</xref>), it is obvious that human rights violations exist there.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Assessing the perceptions of the recovered psychiatric patients in meeting their human rights needs identified an important area of research in recent times. To our knowledge, this is the first innovative study from developing countries among this disadvantaged population to focus mainly the role of education in meeting their human rights needs at the family and community level. In the present study, the participants were well aware of their diagnosis and were currently in remission. Hence they were able to contribute to the study by providing consistent information.</p>
<p>In a comparative study, the staff members’ and psychiatric patients’ attitudes towards the rights of psychiatric patients during their hospitalization were assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012437322">David, Daniel, Weishut, &amp; Moshe, 2002</xref>). However, this study did not focus on the human rights of psychiatric patients at the family and community level. Some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012437322">Arvidsson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764012437322">Badger, McNiece, Bonham, Jacobson, &amp; Gelenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764012437322">Perreault et al., 2005</xref>) were also conducted among symptomatic psychiatric patients to assess their views in meeting their basic needs; however, the responses from the acutely ill patients were questionable. In addition, a qualitative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012437322">Lawska, Zieba, &amp; Nicka, 2006</xref>) explored the asymptomatic patients’ expectations from others, but this was only in a psychological dimension. In contrast, the present study examined comprehensively the human rights status of people with mental illness and the role of education in meeting their basic needs at the family and community level.</p>
<p>In the present study, 57% of the participants were literate. It could be argued that more participants with literacy were able to utilize mental health services than illiterate participants. These findings are congruent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012437322">Christensen &amp; Grace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764012437322">Miles &amp; Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764012437322">Parikh, Parker, Nurss, Baker, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref>) that explained that limited literacy is an added barrier to accessing and using mental health services effectively. Furthermore, alternative mental health systems, such as ayurveda, faith and religious healing and native medicine, are an integral to illiterate people in India, especially in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012437322">Murphy, 2004</xref>) where mental health services are not easily accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764012437322">Kapur, 1975</xref>). Besides, a vast majority of people in India attribute symptoms of mental illness to supernatural phenomena, drug use, stressful life events, heredity or personality deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764012437322">Srinivasan &amp; Thara, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In India there is a wide disparity in literacy between the male and female population, with literacy rates of 75.96% and 54.28%, respectively. Likewise, in the current study, more men (<italic>n</italic> = 35, 61.4%) than women (<italic>n</italic> =22, 38.6%) were literate. The social system in India promotes education for males while the female population, especially in the deep interiors of the country, is kept away from schools. According to a 1998 report by the US Department of Commerce, the chief barriers to female education in India are inadequate school facilities (such as sanitary facilities), shortage of female teachers and gender bias in the curriculum (the majority of female characters being depicted as weak and helpless) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764012437322">Velkoff, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Marriage is one of the most important life events, affecting social status as well as the psyche of an individual. It is estimated that over 75% of Indians, rich or poor, believe that marriage is a cure for mental illnesses such as manic depression, bipolar affective disorders and even schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012437322">Barat, 2002</xref>). The present study is consistent with this estimation as 68% of the sample was married. More of the literate (<italic>n</italic> = 21, 36.8%) than illiterate participants were unmarried. Similar to other studies, more men (<italic>n</italic> = 20, 37.7%) were unmarried than women. Studies show that patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia) are more likely to remain single and unmarried than patients in other diagnostic groups. This is particularly true of male patients and can probably be explained by the fact that women tend to be younger than men when first married and are less likely to have experienced an initial psychotic episode. Single males appear to be over-represented in schizophrenia samples, including epidemiological studies such as the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 10-country study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764012437322">Jablensky et al., 1992</xref>). However, there were no substantial studies to compare these findings.</p>
<p>Most literates were self-employed and more lived above the poverty line than did illiterate participants. Education raises earnings and employability, which protects well-being and also reduces risk of poor mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012437322">Searle, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, majority of the people with illiteracy works as daily wagers or labourers and are not able to fulfil their basic needs because of their low socio-economic status. Certainly, recovered people with mental illness have no exception in this regard.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study indicate that people with literacy are more likely to have access to electricity and safe drinking water than people with illiteracy. Electricity access is well established within the framework of human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437322">Marks, 2004</xref>). There are certain basic needs that are essential for a dignified life, indeed for life itself. Water is one of these essential human needs and recognized as a fundamental human right. The issue of the right to basic water was well illustrated by the statement at the Mar del Plata conference: ‘All people have the right to have access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764012437322">United Nations, 1977</xref>, p. 1). People with illiteracy and mental illness suffer from ignorance of healthy practices such as the importance of safe drinking water and they are not aware that safe drinking water is one of their fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Family is the first space in which persons with mental illness expect to be treated equally with others. More of the literate (42.1%) than illiterate participants felt that they were separated from their family because of mental illness (<italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 13.118, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .004), were afraid of their family members (<italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 13.388, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .004) and were abused verbally using filthy nicknames (<italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 17.759, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000). This could be because people with illiteracy may not be able to exercise their right to self-determination as literates do. The concept of karma or ordained fate is very strong in the Indian ethos and especially for people with illiteracy; they blame themselves and suffer human rights violations silently. On the other hand, people with education report unequal treatment by their family members. These findings were similar to a recent survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764012437322">Swadhikaar Center, 2009</xref>) conducted in Andhra Pradesh to observe the human rights of people with disabilities (including mental illness). The above findings indicate that the family members violating the right to live with dignity could be because of their negative attitudes towards the people with mental illness. Stigma is painful and humiliating and worsens the lives of people with mental illness. In other words, stigma can be highlighted by using words such as ‘loony’, ‘psycho’ and ‘crazy’; they may seem harmless but they can be spiteful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012437322">Sinha, 2010</xref>) .</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012437322">Lawska et al. (2006)</xref> provided evidence that people with mental illness want to be treated in the same way as other people; namely with respect, good manners and kindness. They also long for empathy and for a positive attitude to be taken towards them. The present study supports previous research that has highlighted the deficits in emotional support for people with chronic mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764012437322">Bronowski &amp; Załuska, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012437322">Clinton, Lunney, Edwards, Weir, &amp; Barr, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the impact of stigma upon individuals with mental disorders is multi-faceted and devastating. Stigmatization also contributes to the isolation of psychiatric patients from the people around them. Authors of a recent paper demonstrated that for individuals with bipolar disorder, elevated concerns about stigma directly correlated with a lower degree of integration into social circles outside the family. In turn, this poorer social adjustment will inhibit recovery of mental health. Even within the smaller and more intimate sphere of family relations, the perception of stigma can be damaging. Relatives of a person with mental illness often feel shame and worry about stigma against the family as a whole; this distress will negatively impact the ill family member and may exacerbate symptoms of the mental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012437322">Perlick, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Religion is an important force in India and visible in many aspects of life. More of the literate (68.4%) than illiterate participants in the current study were more likely to be allowed to go to temple, church, mosque, etc. These findings clearly point out that illiteracy is not only a violation of the right to education, it is also one of the major obstacles to the effective enjoyment of the other human rights.</p>
<p>In the present study, more of the illiterate (<italic>n</italic> = 18, 41.9%) than literate participants reported that they were not friendly with their family members. The importance of social support for people with mental illness has been increasingly emphasized in recent years. This has resulted from studies showing that family and professional support plays an important role in preventing re-hospitalization and in improving the quality of life of patients with major psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764012437322">Gorna, Jaracz, &amp; Rybakowski, 2004</xref>). Families caring for relatives with mental disorders require information from professionals about the nature of the illness and the current treatment plan, so that they can care for their relatives effectively. Nurses, being primary health care providers, should take active initiation in educating the families regarding the importance of providing an environment that respects and protects the basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of people with mental illness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was no significant association observed between people with and without literacy to the statements in the ethical needs dimension and in the community domain.</p>
<p>To summarize the findings, in recovered patients, illiteracy seems to be associated with decreased access to physical needs, such as electricity and water; whereas literacy seemed to be associated with deficits in meeting psychological needs for support and emotional comfort. People with illiteracy and mental illness were not satisfied in meeting their physical needs (electricity and safe drinking facilities), social needs (being friendly with family members) and religious needs (going to temple, church, mosque, etc.), whereas people with literacy and mental illness reported a deficit in the meeting of their emotional needs by their family members.</p>
<sec id="section16-0020764012437322">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The current study has certain limitations. The sample was restricted to patients who attended a follow-up outpatient department at a tertiary psychiatric hospital and a smaller sample size made it difficult to draw conclusions. Hence, future research should focus on a large sample and employ a qualitative approach to understand in depth about the human rights issues among this underprivileged population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of the present study suggest that it is high time to protect the rights of people with mental illness, especially in case of people with illiteracy and mental illness, as they are defenceless and unable to exercise effectively their human rights. Psychiatric nurses can particularly help this vulnerable population in meeting their needs by promoting awareness of the human rights of people with mental illness among family members and in the community. In a nutshell, empowering people with mental illness by providing an adequate opportunity to pursue education will play an important role fulfilling the obligation of UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Mental Disabilities.</p>
