<title>Background:</title>
<p>Venous thromboembolism is common in patients with cancer and the risk increases with advanced disease. Evidence-based treatment is administration of low-molecular-weight heparin daily by subcutaneous injection. Clinical uncertainty exists as to whether treating venous thromboembolism in advanced disease is in the patient’s best interests.</p>

<title>Design:</title>
<p>Qualitative, in-depth interview study using framework analysis.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Organisational constraints served to act as barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of this patient group. Issues were identified around access to diagnostic testing. A cancer-associated thrombosis patient having to wait for a scan as an inpatient was sometimes deemed unnecessary. Patient ambulance transport (especially transportation of hospice patients) was often viewed as inflexible and bureaucratic. Low-molecular-weight heparin prescribing had sometimes led to tension between the acute, community and hospice sectors about whose prescribing responsibility this was, with different areas having divergent ‘rules’ and practices.

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Multiple logistical barriers are hindering best patient care for people with cancer-associated thrombosis.

<title>Background</title>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and confers a poor prognosis compared to patients of similar cancer stage without VTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312461678">1</xref></sup> The malignant process increases the thrombotic state through the direct and induced release of procoagulants, such as tissue factor, while cancer treatments such as surgery, hormone treatment and chemotherapy are associated with increased VTE rates even in ambulant patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312461678">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The management of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) differs in several ways to that of non-cancer patients. First, the role of D-dimers in the diagnostic process is of limited utility since they are frequently raised in the malignant process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312461678">3</xref></sup> Second, while warfarin is recognised as the first-line treatment of VTE in the general population, its use in CAT has been associated with an increased rate of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis.</p>
<p>Current guidelines recommend that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be given for at least 3–6 months to prevent recurrence or extension of VTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312461678">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312461678"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312461678">6</xref></sup> Compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the rate of recurrent VTE by a further 50% without increasing the risk of bleeding. The management of VTE in patients with advanced malignancy, in particular metastatic disease, appears to pose further challenges for clinicians; cancer progression is associated with an increase in the rate of re-thrombosis and bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312461678">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, LMWH requires a daily injection to be administered, and although this has been reported to be acceptable to palliative care patients, the health economic impact of using LMWH over warfarin has not been evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312461678">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312461678">8</xref></sup> Finally, the studies demonstrating superiority of LMWH over warfarin in CAT treatment were conducted in a patient population fitter than those typically seen by palliative care teams. While over 40% of the patients in each study had metastatic disease, exclusions to recruitment included prognosis of less than 3 months, poor performance status, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, brain metastases, weight less than 40 kg and renal impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312461678">6</xref></sup> To date, no trials have looked specifically at the palliative care population, and the evidence base supporting LMWH is limited to case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312461678">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312461678">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Registry data from the United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312461678">11</xref></sup> show that despite the evidence to support the use of long-term LMWH for secondary prevention of VTE in cancer patients, only 9% received LMWH for longer than 30 days and only 5% for longer than 90 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312461678">11</xref></sup> This inconsistency of practice and poor compliance to clinical guidelines is reflected in an ongoing registry of over 40,000 patients from 21 countries across the globe, having previously been identified in a survey of clinicians from 74 countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312461678">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312461678"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312461678">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Uncertainty may exist among clinicians as to whether treating VTE in advanced disease is in the patients’ best interests. There is sometimes a view that ‘a big pulmonary embolus’ provides a quick death, which prevents the patient facing a painful demise from progressive cancer. Some clinicians worry about the acceptability of long-term injections and the generalisability of clinical trial evidence to patients with poor performance status. These opinions are known to influence clinical decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312461678">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312461678">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers that exist with regard to doctors putting recommended guidelines into practice in people with advanced disease and CAT. This article reports the logistical issues, which influenced doctors’ diagnosis and treatment of this patient group.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article is based on a two-stage, wider study, which investigated how doctors make decisions regarding advanced cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312461678">17</xref></sup> In stage 1, 46 doctors took part in a ‘think aloud’ exercise followed by stage 2, in which 45 doctors participated in an in-depth interview to explore the barriers experienced by doctors when diagnosing and treating this patient group. This article focuses on the theme of logistical barriers, which arose from the stage 2 interview data. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines for conducting and reporting qualitative research have been followed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312461678">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics approval was obtained in March 2010 from Leeds East NHS Research Ethics Committee [10/H1306/13], and the Research Governance approval from 7 NHS Trusts and 3 Welsh Health Boards was granted between July and September 2010.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269216312461678">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 doctors in England and 15 in Wales (45 in total). Doctors who had taken part in stage 1 were e-mailed and asked whether they would be interested in participating in stage 2 (on which this article is based). Thirty-two participants were recruited in this manner (13 declined to participate). The rest were recruited by snowball sampling, seeking to maximise variation in the sample. Fieldwork took place between September 2010 and January 2011.</p>
<p>Participants were purposively sampled by their specialty (oncology, palliative medicine, or general/family practice) and grade (consultant/attending physician or specialist registrar/resident). The specialties chosen were those that either were likely to be involved in the diagnosis and management of CAT fairly often or involved in the care of people with advanced disease. The sample is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312461678">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Oncologists were recruited from two large teaching hospitals, two oncology hospitals and two district general hospitals. The palliative medicine physicians worked in some of the hospitals mentioned previously and a wide range of hospices (some had a dual hospital/hospice role). Variation within specialties was maximised by ensuring a mixture of senior and junior staff. Participants ranged in age from 28 to 58 years with 26 women and 19 men.</p>

<sec id="section10-0269216312461678">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>L.S. and H.P. – both experienced health services researchers – interviewed participants. Interviews began with the broad question: ‘Can you tell me what you think the barriers are to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients with VTE?’ A topic guide was used during the interviews. The topic guide was restructured and amended as a result of pilot work and throughout the fieldwork as new themes emerged. Questioning centred on diagnosis and treatment of VTE; anticoagulation; logistical, clinical, institutional or attitudinal issues and positive facilitators. Questioning was based on pilot work and also findings arising from stage 1 of the study and was adaptive to the responses of the participants.</p>
<p>Interviews were largely conducted at the participants’ place of work. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to taking part in the study. Interviews lasted between 20 and 70 min. The interviews were digitally audio recorded, and the file was transcribed. The interviewers made aide mémoir field notes during and after the interviews, as appropriate. All places and names in quotations are pseudonyms.</p>

<sec id="section11-0269216312461678">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used framework analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312461678">19</xref></sup> while maintaining the notion that analysis is ‘constantly iterative’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312461678">20</xref></sup> Framework analysis begins from the aims and objectives of the study yet is inherently grounded in the opinions and experiences of the population studied. D.D. and L.S. independently scrutinised the same six transcripts, which were selected for maximum variation. The initial coding framework was devised after comparison of resulting draft frameworks, discussion and subsequent revision. L.S. and H.P. coded all the interviews and reached full agreement on coding after four interviews, thereafter coding all subsequent interviews independently. ATLAS.ti was used to manage the data. L.S. conducted the two final stages of analysis: charting, mapping and interpretation. This creative process involves defining concepts and mapping polarities to identify the range and extent of a phenomenon. Themes were written up describing the similarity and variation between participant’s experiences.</p>

<sec id="section12-0269216312461678">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>We provide a holistic ‘real-world’ account of the management barriers facing advanced cancer patients with VTE, within the health-care systems of those interviewed. The importance and relevance of these findings, to other countries, shall be outlined in the discussion. Logistical and organisational issues arose as a theme from the interview data. Within this theme, four specific areas were identified and discussed here: diagnostic testing, patient transport, prescription of LMWH and the role of nurses.</p>
<sec id="section13-0269216312461678">
<title>Diagnostic testing</title>
<p>The usual diagnostic pathway for clinically suspected VTE is for the patient to attend the acute service (usually their local hospital) for appropriate imaging: computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) for a pulmonary embolism (PE) and a Doppler ultrasound for a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Access to diagnostic testing for advanced cancer patients with suspected VTE was mentioned by the majority of participants, although there was great variability in access. Almost half the participants said the service was good (although there were caveats to this), while over a quarter felt that the service needed improvement. A minority had mixed experiences. Some doctors felt that access to a Doppler was very swift – most were carried out the same day as referral – within their local acute service. In contrast, access to a CTPA was considered to be slow and bureaucratic by others. This variability was mostly due to different organisational systems in different hospitals. A considerable range was reported for the length of time that patients may have to wait for a CTPA, from just a few hours to 5 days. In some sites, an innovation in the way services were organised was perceived to have improved access. An oncology director explains how a new ‘oncology assessment unit’ was particularly effective, illustrating a relevant clinical example:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we’ve done is reconfigured the in-patient base and now nominated one ward as the acute admissions ward … and attached to that oncology admissions ward is an oncology assessment unit which I would basically described as having our own little casualty next to our own oncology admissions unit and it’s unfortunately not open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It’s open 12 hours a day, I think 6 days a week but if a patient was to phone up saying – so I took a phone call this morning from a GP and instead of saying, a Hightown patient as well, so I could have said, ‘well go to Hightown Casualty’ and I know that if I send that person to Hightown Casualty anything could happen because you get a junior doctor not knowing they’ve got cancer or whatever and probably admitted to a geriatric ward where 3 days later they do a Doppler ultrasound and get confused and muddled by all manner of the rest of her case versus ‘oh just tell her to come to Ward 100’. I’ve rung Ward 100 and when she gets to Ward 100, I said ‘send her straight down for a Doppler ultrasound and if it’s negative send her home and if it’s positive put her on tinzaparin [LMWH] and send her home’. (England, ID 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the above participant states, the recent reorganisation within the hospital where he worked was part of a direct drive to reduce inpatient admissions for patients waiting for scans. However, this was not the experience of the majority of the participants, and hospitals varied as to their policy regarding whether a patient with suspected VTE should be admitted while waiting for a scan or not. This was particularly the case for those waiting for a CTPA. Inpatients could be waiting for 2 or 3 days on a ward, consequently perceived as ‘bed blocking’, taking up valuable time of the patient at the end of life when they would rather not be in hospital. In addition, some doctors who worked in hospices expressed the opinion that it was frustrating for a patient to be sent to an inpatient ward merely to wait for a scan if all their needs were being addressed effectively in the hospice, as this junior palliative medicine physician explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>It didn’t seem appropriate to get her admitted to the hospital for it because she was having other issues that we were managing and it would have been a disaster to move her before the weekend because we were just getting on top of the pain and we would have upset all of that management which was actually more important to her than the chance that she might have had a small clot. (England, ID 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A palliative medicine consultant/attending physician put forward her view about multiday inpatient stays for those waiting for scans:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would love there to be a same day service for people with a limited prognosis and actually in some ways I think it’s a bit short-sighted of hospital Trusts not to have that because actually there’s a cost saving to them in not having the patient lying around in a bed on their ward. Send them back to the third sector! (England, ID 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, for those hospitals who operated on an outpatient model, some participants felt that the outpatient department was not set up for seriously ill people and that an afternoon spent ‘hanging round’ waiting for a scan could be detrimental for advanced cancer patients. A senior general practitioner (GP)/family physician expresses the following viewpoint:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think one of the main barriers is that the service [outpatient department] isn’t set-up for the seriously ill. … the patient has to make their own way there and there is a lot of hanging around. They go for a scan, they go for a blood test, they see a nurse … It’s not the sort of setting you want to be transferring a chronically ill patient up to. So actually getting the diagnosis is quite a thing … You wouldn’t want somebody with a serious illness sort of hanging around in out-patient departments all day waiting for it all to be sorted out. (Wales, ID 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result of this, participants highlighted ways in which they tried to ‘work around’ the system. One senior GP/family physician in England phoned the bed manager at the hospital directly to stipulate that the patient has advanced cancer and should be seen as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Some areas did not allow doctors from outside the hospital to refer patients directly to radiology, with patients having to go to the emergency department to be assessed. A palliative medicine consultant in Wales described this system as ‘hideous’ for patients with advanced cancer. One radiology department in Wales operated an ‘open access’ model, whereby scans were conducted ad hoc every morning based on referrals from the previous day. The aim was to avoid unnecessary inpatient admissions and bypass the patient being assessed again in the emergency department. Some doctors thought that it would be better for GPs to be able to liaise directly with the radiology department without involving the emergency department.</p>
<p>Many of the doctors who thought access to diagnostic testing was good in their locality explained that this positive opinion was almost entirely related to the service provided by radiology during working hours (usually Monday–Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Concerns were raised about patients who presented with a possible DVT or PE outside of these hours and the inevitable wait that would occur. A referral on a Friday afternoon may see the patient waiting until the following Tuesday, Wednesday or even Thursday for their scan. The key issue here was whether the doctor should anti-coagulate the patient based on suspicion alone. Some said they would start treatment over the weekend, but there was ambivalence about this when the patient was known to have a bleeding risk. This uncertainty worried some doctors more than others, more so for junior doctors where a minority felt placed in a significant dilemma. Overall, it was felt that urgent access to a scan at any time would alleviate the need for empirical treatment, which could be risky for the patient, yet the expense of offering such a service was acknowledged, as this palliative medicine registrar describes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe there isn’t the demand for it out of hours in terms of staffing and resources. I imagine it is quite expensive to offer that out of hours service. I would imagine they have looked at the amount of scan requests you would get out of hours and it is small. And is there any harm in waiting until the next day? Probably not. So I understand completely why it is but in that moment you feel, if it was clear cut that the benefit significantly outweighed the risk to treat anyway then that is fine but in this patient population there are so many other factors that often the risks are fifty fifty. And that is when you feel that to have access to a diagnostic test quickly or sooner would help, when the risks are very finely balanced. (England, ID 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the oncology consultants/attending physicians interviewed pinpointed a specific issue with colleagues in radiology when trying to refer a patient for an urgent scan, whereby lengthy negotiations had to be entered into in order to secure an immediate CTPA. This was described by one participant in Wales as a ‘palaver’ and felt to be an unnecessary drain on his time. Another participant had an informal agreement with the radiology department that urgent CTPAs or Dopplers were to be performed if he requested them (at consultant level) as this would indicate a high index of suspicion for VTE. However, most oncologists found their radiology department accommodating and receptive to their requests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216312461678">
<title>Patient transport</title>
<p>Palliative medicine physicians – especially those working in hospices – often had additional organisational hurdles when accessing scans for their patients. Transporting the patient from the hospice to the hospital was said to be the main logistical problem particularly in relation to the ambulance service. Ambulances had to be booked at least 24 h in advance and before midday for transportation the next working day, which was considered to provide an inflexible service. Patients had to wait for an ambulance to take them to and from the hospital which – for some hospices – could arrive anywhere in a pre-booked 4-h time slot. Frustratingly, some patients had missed the time slot for the ambulance back to the hospice because the time for their scan had been delayed by the hospital resulting in another day as an inpatient. A complicated situation had arisen in some areas with only a paramedic crew considered able to transport seriously ill patients to hospital for their scan, which had led to it becoming a squeezed resource. The ambulance journey was considered difficult and an upheaval for a seriously ill patient, and some palliative medicine physicians were hesitant about the patient being taken out of the hospice environment because of this, as a consultant explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if there is evidence, but anecdotally, well most palliative care doctors will say, somebody with a short prognosis, difficult [ambulance] journeys, can affect prognosis. And then there is the issue of making sure that the patient is comfortable while they’re transferred as well and once they get there to because you’re sending them to somewhere [hospital] that doesn’t put the patient’s comfort quite as high a priority as we would here. So if that patient is breathless and in pain, it’s always a slightly leap of faith that the photocopied drug chart that you send with the patient will be transcribed accurately and that the patient will get analgesia, you know, that is a worry, the patient’s comfort at the other end. (England, ID3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, a senior GP/family physician expressed similar concern about patients in the community being transported to hospital:
<disp-quote>
<p>But with your person who’s got a terminal illness, who is in bed maybe, who is not easily able to get out of bed and get there, there is all the huge decision making about how you get them to the hospital? Whether or not their family can take them? Do they have a wheelchair to get them in? Do you ring an ambulance which could take 2 hours and the service is only 9 to 5 or 9 to 4 whatever, so you have an additional concern that you’re putting a person who is maybe stuck in bed or stuck in the chair and just about managing, you know, with family help, how do you get them into the hospital and back out? … They could be on trolley or sitting there for half the night and so that’s the issues for us in general practice is how kind do you want to be to your patient versus how much the treatment is going to make a different to their life? (Wales, ID 36)</p>

<p>Those patients who had a relative or partner to take them to the hospital were at an advantage compared to those who did not, although some hospices used their own hospice day transport or volunteers. The hospice where one participant worked had a patient ambulance that was shared between two hospices and arrived at a specific time, which was said to be greatly beneficial. The difficulties in accessing a scan for some hospice patients had led to a few doctors treating empirically and not accessing a scan to confirm or exclude a PE. Similarly, the intense organisation required to send a hospice patient to the hospital for scanning had led a few doctors to treat the patient for a differential diagnosis first to see whether there was any improvement in symptoms. These actions illustrate that transportation is a significant barrier for doctors working in hospices. Three palliative medicine physicians thought that a Doppler machine in the hospice would be useful as patients with a suspected DVT would not need to be transported to hospital for a scan.</p>
<p>Rurality was a specific factor that was said to hinder patients’ access to scans. Two GP/family physician practices in rural locations were almost an hour away from the nearest hospital. One hospice in England was a half-an-hour drive away from the nearest hospital meaning that patients had to be well enough to be able to withstand the ambulance journey. One senior GP/family physician commented that ‘there’s no doubt that rural patients are disadvantaged’ (England, ID 16).</p>

<title>LMWH prescribing</title>
<p>A clear tension existed regarding LMWH prescribing, which was most evident between oncologists and GPs/family physicians, although some palliative medicine physicians also described the problem. The primary tension related to the cost of LMWH prescribing, and under whose prescribing budgets, this cost would be met. The issue of cost had led to the development of bureaucratic procedures in a few areas. When a PE or DVT had been diagnosed in the acute hospital, it was sometimes then viewed organisationally as the acute hospital’s responsibility – and their financial burden – to prescribe and monitor the patient from that point forward. During the period of fieldwork for the study, LMWH prescribing in general/family practice across South Wales was restricted by the Local Health Authority, although some GPs interviewed in Wales did not seem clear as to why this was the case. In England, restriction varied from region to region with some GPs/family physicians taking full prescribing responsibility for LMWH, while in other areas, community LMWH prescribing was not permitted. This meant the acute hospital service had to maintain prescribing responsibility, which led to patients having to attend monthly oncology appointments in order to receive their LMWH prescription. A number of oncologists felt this was unnecessary when community services could have prescribed instead. A few palliative medicine consultants/attending physicians had experienced GPs/family physicians being unwilling or unable to continue a LMWH prescription initiated in the hospice setting and so the responsibility had fallen on them to provide ongoing treatment and monitoring. Where GPs/family physicians did prescribe anticoagulation, warfarin was sometimes prescribed rather than LMWH. Oncologists, who referred to their own experiences with some GPs/family physicians, felt that this was cost related, but this was not alluded to by any GPs/family physicians interviewees.</p>
<p>Conversely, some doctors had no problems relating to LMWH cost/continued prescribing with GP/family physician colleagues, and one palliative medicine/attending physician in England said that she was ‘lucky’ that GPs/family physicians in her area did not have a problem. Two GPs/family physicians discussed their own in-house anticoagulation clinics (both using warfarin as a first-line agent) and how this service had greatly reduced administrative errors and inconvenience for patients. The overall tension regarding cost and the bureaucracy associated with LMWH prescription can be demonstrated by excerpts from the participants. An oncology director outlines at length this tension and the resident complexities:
<disp-quote>
<p>So because it’s [LMWH] a community prescribed treatment in the long term, GPs think that they should have the say of how you manage the patient and they don’t know the complexities of anticoagulation therapy in cancer patients, so you know, we would just tell them what to do … Patients will say, ‘my GP wants me to go on Warfarin’. Why? ‘Oh I don’t know, they say it’s more convenient for me’. Well that’s rubbish. They want you to go on Warfarin because it’s cheaper … I wouldn’t dream of telling a GP how to handle someone’s hypertension, they know how to do that, I don’t. They don’t know how to handle VTE in cancer patients as well as I do … It will be a very sad day when they stand up and say, ‘well I did this because it was cheaper’. (England, ID 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An oncology consultant/attending physician describes an incident that could have affected patient care:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve had one patient who nearly didn’t get treatment over a bank holiday weekend because the GP was refusing to prescribe it and they weren’t due to see us until after the bank holiday weekend and their prescription was running out beforehand and there were lots of faxes going backwards and forwards and we finally managed to get them a few day’s supply from the GPs. So they almost didn’t get treated over that weekend. But apart from that normally it’s just inconvenience rather than another dangerous thing like that … It’s happened 2 or 3 times though in the last year and that’s just me. I think other consultants have had problems. (Wales, ID 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, a palliative medicine consultant/attending physician highlights in his opinion how warfarin prescribing on the basis of cost alone is a false economy:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes there is an awareness that colleagues in general practice may need some persuading because the treatment is going to cost £70 a week, £280 a month for about four months for a treatment that is going to cost two thirds of sod all, about 90p for a month. Until you explain that one admission to hospital with a warfarin induced bleed will cost £1500 to £5000 and all the inconvenience to the patient of having frequent INR tests and the very volatile INRs that are associated with warfarin in advanced malignancy. But a lot of GPs just hear the upfront thing of £280 a month for treatment with enoxaparin [LMWH] and don’t want to pursue it thereafter. And especially when you are saying that this is <italic>ad infinitum</italic> until either death intervenes or for whatever other reason you have to stop it. … But at the end of the day the GP is the prescriber and it is coming off his or her budget, then ultimately it is the GPs choice and responsibility. (England, ID9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Doctors felt communication could be improved between specialties regarding treatment. Various administrative errors were outlined that had led to substandard treatment for patients. Good co-ordination between specialties was said to be critical, especially between primary and secondary care in order to avoid patients missing doses of LMWH or being prescribed the incorrect dose. Here, a palliative medicine director discusses how in her opinion the monitoring of patients on LMWH lapses over time:
<disp-quote>
<p>The difficulty I have sometimes is, are people actually reviewing it? People are very good at starting it and when I say reviewing it, for our group of patients whether anticoagulation is still appropriate or not … I have patients who come to my clinic where the anticoagulation has been started by the oncologist but who is monitoring them? Nobody. … Because no-one is reviewing the patient except me I will have to regard them. I’ve had recently a patient who was started on clexane [LMWH] somewhere else but because she was coming to my clinic, her weight had dropped from sixty to fifty kilos but nobody had addressed whether we should reduce the dose. If I don’t do it then nobody else will do it. (England, ID 29)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A few doctors felt that care for terminally ill patients was too fractured across a spectrum of specialties and sectors. A contradicting negativity was attached to this. While patients could fall between the gaps, as demonstrated in the above example, others were sometimes simultaneously engaging with multiple concurrent teams – oncology, palliative medicine, general/family practice and district nursing – leading to continual assessment and duplication.</p>

<sec id="section16-0269216312461678">
<title>The role of nurses</title>
<p>The role of nurse specialists was commented on by a number of doctors. DVT nurse specialists were viewed as important both in their acute and community roles in the treatment and management of patients with VTE. Central to this was the co-ordinating role, which bypassed problems that tended to occur when there was no one dedicated person to liaise between specialities and departments. DVT nurse co-ordinators in hospitals were able to make services run smoothly and alleviated a number of organisational and bureaucratic barriers. A palliative medicine physician outlines her viewpoint about a nurse co-ordinator at the local hospital and the importance of having a dedicated role for patients with VTE:
<disp-quote>
<p>I found out about [DVT nurse co-ordinator], it was like, ‘God why didn’t we have this ages ago?’ because normally what you get is the x-ray answer-phone and the patient’s in day hospice and you’ve got a driver waiting for them and everybody is getting more and more fraught and nobody could contact the husband to say that they’re not going to be home when expected. How is the patient going to get home if they miss our transport? And all these other things come into it. Are we going to have to anticoagulate them overnight until they can be fitted in x-ray? All those things. But as soon as you got through to [DVT nurse], she could actually say, ‘I haven’t got any slots left for ultrasound, you anticoagulate them overnight and let them come at 10 in the morning’. I mean you got an immediate ‘this is what we need to do’ and you could do it. Whereas the x-ray answer-phone, then you’re waiting, has anybody picked it up, is it too near 5 o’clock that they’re not going to pick it up at all? What shall I do? Shall I wait? Shall I tell the patient to wait, you know, so she was terrific but whether there are resources for that sort of thing now, trust me it’s the icing on the cake, isn’t it. (England, ID 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The role of district nurses was discussed in many interviews. Comments were made about how it was a drain on district nursing time and budgets to administer LMWH injections in the community. It also restricted patients to their houses until the district nurse had arrived and administered the injection. Consequently, many doctors strongly encouraged their patients to self-inject or be injected by a partner or relative. Doctors in rural areas were particular advocates of this as travelling to patients homes could be an hour round trip for some district nurses. Conversely, some doctors felt reassured that seriously ill patients were engaging with a district nurse on a daily basis. This oncology consultant/attending physician outlines both viewpoints:
<disp-quote>
<p>I must admit on the ward we quite like it if a patient goes home on Fragmin [LMWH] because we quite like having to get the district nurses in because the district nurse will be looking after them every day and it does mean that you’re getting somebody coming in every day but that’s a huge burden on district nursing … and getting worse the amount of patients we’re sending out with Fragmin. We think, great district nurses. Every day that is good from our point of view on the ward but I think from the community point of view, it must be quite a pain. (England, ID 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although LMWH was considered a burden on the time and budget of district nursing, a number of oncologists talked about the importance of avoiding hospital inpatient admissions merely to administer LMWH. It was considered a hindrance not only to both acute services but also to the patient themselves for this to take place but in a few instances had occurred in out-of-hours situations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section18-0269216312461678">
<title>Principal findings</title>
<p>The main thematic findings were (1) access to diagnostic tests (and some patients’ needs potentially not being adequately addressed in acute settings), (2) patient transport, (3) LMWH prescribing and (4) the role of nurses. This area of medicine has had scant attention in the literature, and there is little guidance to aid doctors in their decision-making. This study is one of the very few that explore the barriers for the diagnosis and management of the CAT patient group. Inherent in the findings of this research is the attention that must be paid to the immediate context and situation of the patient, as this may be the main driver that influences practical decisions. The views expressed in this article also demonstrate that a ‘one size fits all’ approach is inappropriate for this patient group; such simplistic suggestions for change would hinder some patients at the benefit of others. This may especially be the case for patients who are at the end of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0269216312461678">
<title>What this research adds</title>
<p>The management of CAT is complex, even more so in the advanced cancer population. Even though clinical guidelines reflect the strength of evidence by recommending LMWH over warfarin, the management of CAT appears to be inconsistent and for many patients, suboptimal. Despite differing health-care systems across the world, suboptimal treatment does not appear to be isolated to one particular health-care system or country. The potential benefits and limitations of clinical guidelines have been studied extensively in the literature and barriers to implementation have been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216312461678">21</xref></sup> These include attitudinal barriers to accepting validity of recommendations, implementation barriers in incorporating recommendations into practice and reinforcement barriers in maintaining a commitment to guideline adherence over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312461678">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216312461678">23</xref></sup> Specific to the management of VTE, a survey of 315 participants from internal medicine, cardiology, orthopaedic surgery, family practice and emergency medicine suggested the most significant barrier to implementation of VTE guidelines were attitudinal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216312461678">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>We sought to understand the barriers facing doctors across different specialities when diagnosing and treating patients with advanced cancer and VTE. It was interesting to note that we found little evidence that lack of knowledge or physician attitudes were major barriers to best practice, indeed, we found that doctors with similar attitudes of careful consideration for best CAT management could come to opposite management plans. When a patient has advanced cancer, their clinical condition is taken into consideration by the doctor as to whether they are well enough to tolerate diagnostic testing; both the travelling and time spent in hospital is weighed, with the concern that this can be detrimental. Therefore, the proximity and accessibility of acute services, and the coherence and streamlining of diagnostic procedure, plays a significant role about whether a patient is sent for assessment.</p>

<sec id="section20-0269216312461678">
<title>Implications for clinical practice</title>
<p>The experiences and opinions of the doctors interviewed in this study suggest that optimal care for CAT in people with advanced disease is hindered in part by local organisational procedures and ‘rules’. Examples show that there is scope for some of these factors to be usefully amended. Improved organisation of services should improve patient care. Practical, feasible recommendations aimed at services, which can be put forward on the basis of the findings of this research, and the anticipated benefits are detailed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216312461678">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>Many of the participants were familiar with the principal investigators through their clinical work. Therefore, some participants – especially those working closely with the principal investigators – may have modified their response to interview questions that related to best practice. This is a general problem in some areas of qualitative health research and not specific as such to our area of interest. The use of a non-clinical researcher and the reassurance of strict confidentiality attempted to ameliorate this. Furthermore, investigators did not have access to complete transcripts of interviews conducted with their close colleagues to prevent identification by virtue of personal opinions or descriptions of patient caseload.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that since the study was conducted in England and Wales (where the health services are funded centrally through the NHS), some of the barriers described may not be experienced in other countries. Health-care systems that are primarily funded through insurance may experience financial constraints to meeting the costs of LMWH in the palliative patient based on the limited evidence base specific to advanced cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216312461678">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, the daily budget available for patients in the hospice system may make LMWH prohibitive in some countries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study identifies many issues for those clinicians looking after advanced cancer and VTE will face, regardless of country or health-care system. Wherever optimisation of patients’ quality of life is paramount, health-care professionals will face challenges in the process of investigating and subsequently treating CAT. Our study found that there are multiple logistical barriers that hinder best patient care for people with CAT and advanced disease, spanning diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For the management of palliative care patients with CAT to improve, several developments need considering. Organisational arrangements and individual services may need to be improved to overcome some of the logistical barriers that currently influence clinicians to under-diagnose and hence under-treat VTE. Suggestions for changes that could improve both patient care and patient experience have been described. The funding streams for the treatment of CAT in people with advanced disease need to be reviewed in some settings to reflect the changing specialty and increase in available therapies. Finally, the evidence base for treating CAT in patients with advanced metastatic disease and poor performance status, thrombocytopenia, bleeding and cachexia should not be overstated, but the role of LMWH should neither be denied nor administration withheld when appropriate.</p>
