<p>‘Sharing secrets’ comes to my mind when I explore the gospel readings for February. Secrets are special messages that are shared between friends, especially between best friends. They usually are whispered carefully into eager ears. They usually are meant to be kept safe.</p>
<p>God is our friend and has shared a secret with us. God’s secret is Jesus; though Jesus is a special kind of secret. <italic>Jesus is the sort of secret that God wants us to share with everyone</italic>. God wants us to whisper carefully into the ears of our friends and families, and to shout from the rooftops and from the streets so everyone can know God’s secret.</p>
<p>The first three Gospel readings in February each has a secret component to it. As we move through the month we discover that God’s secret cannot be kept hidden but is destined to be shared. It might be fun to share these stories in a whisper that gets louder and louder each week.</p>
<sec id="section1-0014524611426064">
<title>February 5<sup>th</sup>: Mark 1:29-39</title>
<sec id="section2-0014524611426064">
<title>Secret component: Jesus is hidden and his followers search for him</title>
<p>Jesus does wonderful things. He helps people who are feeling poorly. He helps people think clearly. He calms people’s minds. Jesus is like a doctor or a teacher or a parent. People are very excited about what Jesus does for them. I wonder if any of the younger members of the church has ever felt poorly. Has a parent or a teacher or a doctor or even a minister helped them feel better?</p>
<p>One night Jesus disappears. He hides from the needy crowds and goes to a secret place to pray. The followers of Jesus know how wonderful Jesus is and how needy the crowd is. They hunt for Jesus and they find him. I wonder if any in the church has played ‘hide and seek’. It is a game where people hide and others go looking for them. Sometimes Jesus is like a person hiding in a secret place waiting to be found. And Jesus is easy to find! Whenever the followers of Jesus search for him they find him. God wants us all to keep searching for Jesus because when he is found he does wonderful things for everyone.</p>
<p><bold>Sharing the secret:</bold> Perhaps the leader can hide something in the church for the children to find. Maybe it is a picture of Jesus, or a picture of someone who is in need. Maybe it is both. When Jesus is found it is always to be a friend and helper to others.</p>

<title>February 12<sup>th</sup>: Mark 1:40-45</title>
<sec id="section4-0014524611426064">
<title>Secret component: It’s impossible to keep good news a secret!</title>
<p>In today’s Gospel reading we hear about someone who is helped by Jesus. There are many reasons why someone might need to be helped by Jesus. Perhaps someone is sick and wants to feel better. Perhaps someone is lonely and wants a friend. Perhaps someone is bullied and wants to feel loved and safe. The person who Jesus helps in the story today felt all these things: sick, lonely and bullied.</p>
<p>The person who Jesus helps has leprosy. Leprosy is a sickness and makes people feel poorly. People with leprosy were not permitted to live with their families or friends. They were also treated badly by others. I wonder if any in the church has ever felt bad, lonely or bullied. I wonder if any in the church has ever helped someone who feels bad, lonely or bullied.</p>
<p>In our story Jesus reaches out to help the person with leprosy. Jesus does not want to make a big deal out of it. Jesus knows that doing good things is enough; he does not need special attention. Yet the person who Jesus helps cannot keep it a secret; that person goes out and spreads the word that Jesus is a friend and a helper to the sick, lonely and bullied. It is impossible to keep such good news a secret!</p>
<p><bold>Sharing the secret:</bold> Have the children imagine Jesus as their friend and helper in their minds or hearts. Next allow the children to whisper that Jesus is a friend and helper in a neighbour’s ear. Finally have the children shout aloud that Jesus is a friend and helper.</p>

<title>February 19<sup>th</sup>: Mark 9:2-9</title>
<sec id="section6-0014524611426064">
<title>Secret component: The time for secrets is over!</title>
<p>In our story today Jesus takes his followers on a hike. We can see amazing things on hikes. I wonder if any in the church has ever hiked to the top of a mountain or large hill. The followers of Jesus see some amazing things on the mountain top where they are standing. They see Elijah and Moses and they see a talking cloud. I have never seen a talking cloud. It must have been amazing! The most amazing thing they see, however, is not Elijah or Moses or a talking cloud. The most amazing thing they see is Jesus.</p>
<p>In our story Jesus starts to glow on the mountain top. Jesus, who is a friend and a helper to so many, begins to glow and a voice tells the followers of Jesus that he is God’s Beloved Child.</p>
<p>I wonder why Jesus starts to glow. Perhaps it is because being a friend and a helper to people who are sick, lonely and bullied makes Jesus special in God’s eyes. Perhaps it is because when God looks at Jesus God sees a Beloved Child, and God’s Beloved children cannot be kept secret; they glow.</p>
<p>God wants us all to glow like Jesus glows. We can glow by being a friend and helper to others. We can also help others glow by telling them that they are God’s Beloved Children.</p>
<p><bold>Sharing the secret:</bold> Have the children whisper in their neighbour’s ear that they are God’s Beloved Child. Have the children turn and share this wonderful secret to the whole church aloud. Watch the church begin to glow!</p>
<p>As Lent begins at the end of February we learn that the time for secrets is over. Now we must share it (confess it!) with everyone we meet as Jesus did following his baptism (Mark 1:9-15). There is so much good news to share. There are so many good things to do. May we, who are God’s Beloved Children, join together to say and do these good things through Jesus Christ our Friend and Helper. Amen.</p>
