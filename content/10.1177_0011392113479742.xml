<p>In the context of the wave of protests that shook the Arab world, Morocco is a particularly interesting case to address the problem of collective action and transformation of hybrid political regimes. This article describes the historical trajectory of recent protests in the country, the emergence and structuring of the 20th February Movement (M20F) and the neutralization strategy pursued by the Moroccan political regime. Taking up the idea that the success of collective action to transform a political regime is related to the ability of its promoters to legitimize their cause beyond their original base, the main argument is that both the nature of the 20th February Movement – marked by a profound heterogeneity and dualism – and the hybrid configuration of the Moroccan political regime – which offers a variety of repertoires of legitimation for the management of the protests – favoured the failure of the protest movement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The wave of protests that shook the Arab world in early 2011 has held the attention of the media, the public eye and analysts outside the region due to the protests’ ability to challenge authoritarian regimes that had endured for several decades. The fact that Islamist movements were not the instigators of the protests also contributed to increasing that interest and projecting an image of a departure from the exceptionalism by which the region is commonly characterized by Orientalist assumptions. The extent and intensity of the protests have varied from one country to another, and each regime has responded with its own survival strategies using repression and/or reforming some aspects of their governance. The case of Morocco illustrates these different dynamics. The protests carried out by the 20th February Movement and the handling of them by the Moroccan political regime offer the opportunity to reflect on such mobilizations within the framework of hybrid political regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392113479742">Diamond, 2002</xref>), which is to say political regimes where there are institutional arrangements that are based on principles of democratic legitimacy as well as civil rights and civil liberties, but which are distorted by a series of legal restrictions and subordinated to an authoritarian configuration and exercise of supreme power.</p>
<p>The case of Morocco raises several issues, among which the conditions for the possibility of collective action within authoritarian regimes and the reciprocal influence created by the interaction between collective action and the political regimes’ responses are prominent. Many researchers have addressed these issues by analysing different movements within the framework of various types of regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479742">Tilly and Tarrow, 2006</xref>), but few have approached them with a focus on the hybridization of political regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479742">Camau and Massardier, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In political regimes where those who hold political power do not consider the possibility of competing with opposition forces, and where both laws and discretionary measures supported by alliances with the security forces allow expressions of dissent to be suppressed, hybridization is embodied by the coexistence of this configuration of limited access to and wielding of power with a pluralist and selective opening up towards certain actors and the use of the legitimacy they bring to manage policies or public problems. This kind of pluralist opening up that can be found in the case of Morocco renders obsolete the perception of many regimes as being monolithic. Instead of a vision of a monopolistic state, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479742">Camau and Massardier (2009)</xref> underline, a reality emerges that is made up of partial regimes with state regulation that allow for specialization through and competition between various representative and participatory institutions at different territorial levels as well as the incorporation of multiple non-governmental actors into public policies. The supreme power tries to control the access to and the hierarchy and decisions of these institutions at the same time as seeking ‘from above’ a subordinate legitimation ‘from below’ that is based on its own repertoires of representative democracy, indirect government through the spokespeople for interests and certain other groups, and the knowledge of experts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this hybridization benefits from being labelled ‘good governance’ by the international financial institutions and western governments that many of these countries depend on to gain access to credit. The reward for the hybridization process is aid programmes, and those offering international cooperation seek a certain legitimacy through supporting projects aimed at consolidating civil society that could in turn translate into giving it greater control over public institutions.</p>
<p>Morocco represents a particularly interesting case to address the issue of collective action in the context of authoritarian political regimes and helps to answer the question of how the hybridization of these regimes functions when they have to make adjustments under the pressure of protests. On 20 February 2011, thousands of ordinary citizens, activists and groups speaking out for multiple causes gathered in many different parts of the country to demonstrate. They were responding to a call from a group of young people to demand a series of reforms relating to, among other things, democratizing the political regime, governance of public affairs, recognizing social and identity pluralism and access to health services, education and employment for the population. The 20th February Movement that emerged as a result of this call caused a proliferation in the number of protest demonstrations over the following year, to which the Moroccan authorities responded with different repertoires of action. The analysis of both phenomena and the interaction between them requires contextualizing them within the recent historical development of social and political mobilizations in Morocco. Through doing so the potential continuities and discontinuities they present can be examined. In addition to confirming the unprecedented nature of the phenomenon as well as the heterogeneity of its initial composition, the structural dualism of the grassroots of the 20th February Movement, between the young people that drove the protest and the organizations that joined the demonstrations, raises a number of questions about the true nature of the movement.</p>
<p>The leading role played by young people in driving the 20th February Movement and the political inexperience that has been attributed to them caused high expectations for the regeneration of Moroccan society – in terms of political and social participation within it – to be attached to the initial demonstrations. An initial hypothesis is proposed here that argues that the structural dualism characterizing the composition of the 20th February Movement is a reflection and product of an intergenerational gap that has resulted in distinct cultural and political practices, which have had an impact on shaping the movement’s identity. Despite starting out from differing premises, perspectives and terminologies, numerous analysts have converged in stressing the relationship that exists between the success of collective action in transforming a political regime and its ability to put an end to the sectionalism of its social base – that is, to ‘de-sectionalize’ it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479742">Dobry, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479742">2000</xref>), to obtain the ‘certification’ of other groups or institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479742">Tilly and Tarrow, 2006</xref>) or to project an inclusive identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392113479742">Della Porta and Diani, 2011</xref>). In other words, for the arguments made by a collective-action movement to gain legitimacy beyond its proponents it is usually necessary for the movement to successfully overcome the original organizational and identity affinities of its participants by developing a new identity. Actions are therefore not legitimated as attempts at social transformation in the interest of particular groups, but rather in the interest of society as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392113479742">Tejerina, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, both the discrepancies within the 20th February Movement – which are also to be found in Moroccan society – between those who support, albeit reluctantly, reforms backed by the Monarchy and those who advocate a process of change that rejects the influence of the Monarchy in the configuration of the future regime, and the opening of a constitutional review process led by the King have weakened the potential for the demonstrations to become more widespread. This leads on to a second hypothesis that argues that the hybridization process of the Moroccan regime has allowed the King to take the initiative in launching a series of reforms and has contributed to the demobilization of social and political actors who have a role to play within the mechanisms of political representation and participation in public policy.</p>
<p>In short, this article is based on the premise that the Moroccan political system is fundamentally hybrid in nature. To manage the protests that this hybridization tolerates within certain limits, the regime has many resources to ensure its survival, the use of or access to which rely on different types of repertoires of legitimation. From this formulation three propositions can be made: first, that the diversity of repertoires made available by the hybrid configuration of the Moroccan political regime explains the method for managing the protests that was chosen at a given critical juncture; second, that this hybridization has contributed to satisfying sectional interests through its effects on political representation and this representation’s ability to articulate those interests; and third, that the heterogeneity and structural dualism of the 20th February Movement’s grassroots are phenomena that have stifled the desectionalization of its different causes and replicated the tendency for its representatives to become sectionalized.</p>
<p>This is not to underplay the contingent nature of the emergence of collective action and the management of it, or the heterogeneous and diverse reasons that push the actors involved to adopt a particular form of behaviour in unfolding critical situations – either continuing to mobilize or accepting the solutions provided by the system. These situations provide opportunities for the different actors involved to take action, but these actors have limited possibilities to innovate. This is because, on the one hand, they usually base their actions on what they have learnt from their own past or by imitating other situations that are unlike their own but which they have knowledge of; and, on the other hand, because the actors’ own actions are influenced by social and economic structures, as well as the configuration of the political regime. A dynamic set of interactions that is able to have an impact on these structures and configuration arises, and at the same time the structure of interactions is also able to feed back into and influence the evolution of collective action itself.</p>
<p>This study is based on the observations made and interviews conducted in the city of Rabat at different times, viewing videos posted on the Internet, monitoring the blogs and walls of actors and social networks that were both in favour of and against the movement, reading the Moroccan and foreign press and reviewing the literature produced in the heat of events. This study first of all presents some of the features of the recent history of protests in the country and the hybrid configuration of the Moroccan political regime, as well as the possible cross-influences between the two. Second, it analyses the structure and functioning of the 20th February Movement and its innovative features. Third, it addresses the strategy and methods to neutralize the movement developed by the regime to show that they correspond to the different repertoires made available to it as a result of its hybrid nature. It finally considers the underlying logic that gives coherence to these repertoires.</p>

<title>The recent history of protests and the hybrid nature of the political regime in Morocco</title>
<p>Analysing a protest movement like the 20th February Movement reveals a fairly common feature of social movements: the mixture of ‘new’ and ‘old’ actors and conflicts. The fact that the domino effect set off by the protests in Tunisia and Egypt was foreseeable makes particular sense when considered in light of the history of the protests that have rocked Morocco over recent years.</p>
<p>Most of the collective action the country has experienced has not been characterized by a politicization of conflicts with the authorities, but by trying to respond to the population’s specific needs and demands. Moreover, since 2005, collective action at a local level has been the focus of the state’s attention. King Mohammed VI promoted a policy of reducing poverty whose implementation fell to associative networks. At the same time as this approach moulds and selects the organizations responsible for channelling public participation, it also encourages their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392113479742">Bono, 2010</xref>). This policy helped to institutionalize a certain type of dialogue between the authorities and the population, in which local associations play an intermediary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392113479742">Bergh and Jari, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the handling of social issues through associative networks has not stopped public protests about the high cost of living, the unemployment of college graduates, corruption in awarding public contracts and public sector jobs and the contempt of certain state representatives for the population’s rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479742">Bennafla and Emperador Badimon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479742">Emperador Badimon, 2011</xref>). Instead, specific and localized movements expressing popular outrage have proliferated, resulting on some occasions in riots and violent clashes with the security forces. These violent episodes contrast with the self-limiting nature of the demands, the ritualizing of demonstrations and the negotiated control of protests, which reflect a certain level of pacification of relations between the different sides in comparison with an earlier phase that was characterized by a propensity for systematically using repression to manage protests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479742">Vairel, 2005</xref>). This trend is partly explained by the presence of activists who have political and associative experience, who often play a significant role in the process of articulating the demands of the population, in building local coordination efforts to create a network of the different organizations involved, in entering into dialogue with the authorities, in using the media and social networks for publicity purposes and in depoliticizing the causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392113479742">Bennani-Chraïbi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392113479742">Catusse and Vairel, 2010</xref>). A politicization of the causes has perhaps been more frequent when the territorial scope has changed, for example through the development of nationally coordinated efforts based around a common cause. However, this change of scope has given rise to serious disputes between grassroots activists, who fear a loss of control, and those who favour national organizations taking over from movements that originated at the periphery.</p>
<p>Among the various mobilization campaigns that have emerged over the last 10 years, four seem to be clearly politically charged. These are: the defence of human rights in general, and, in particular, campaigning for a transitional justice that would seek to rehabilitate victims of political repression and hold the implementers of that repression to account; promoting the rights of women with a campaign to revise the Family Code; officially recognizing the Amazigh language and culture; and demanding independence for Western Sahara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479742">Feliu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479742">Vairel, 2005</xref>). To all these causes, which he inherited from his predecessor, Mohammed VI has provided different answers. But these answers all had in common the fact that the Monarch, on the one hand, monopolized each initiative and its final form and, on the other, created institutions (such as the Royal Institute for Amazigh Culture in Morocco and the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs) or ad hoc committees outside the influence of democratic institutions (for example, the Consultative Commission for the Reform of the Family Code, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission and the Advisory Committee for Regionalization). These institutions have allowed certain matters to be considered closed and leaders and social organizations to be coopted. However, these outcomes are not usually definitive, and although causes may be put in abeyance, it is possible for them to re-emerge both from inside and outside these institutions. This policy has fuelled debates about democratic transition in Morocco, while the opposition has pointed out that this relaxation of authoritarianism does not translate into any constitutional reform, that the Monarchy still controls the various branches of power and plays an increasingly central role in the country’s economy, and that civil liberties remain restricted. Finally, there have been repeated cases of violent repression of demonstrations, particularly of those held by supporters of Saharan independence. Leaving aside evaluating the scope of these reforms, it is clear that they have contributed to periodically reactivating debates, mainly within the opposition, on the need for constitutional reform.</p>
<p>The Constitution of 1996, which was in force until 1 July 2011, introduced, as did its predecessors, a hybrid regime. The interpretations and applications of the text reinforced its authoritarian features, to the detriment of free expression of social and political pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479742">Bendourou, 2011</xref>). The Monarchy has been afforded a monopoly over constituent power, supremacy over the representation of the nation, headship over the faithful and the role of protector of freedoms. This concentration of power was legitimated on the basis of different repertoires (genealogical-religious, dynastic and nationalist ones) that were effective because of fruitful alliances with powerful, stability-providing groups (such as the army, large technocratic bodies of the state, the comprador bourgeoisie and rural caciques) and close relations with France, the United States and the monarchies of the Persian Gulf. However, the authoritarian power of the Monarchy and its technocratic representatives – the royal councillors in the palace and governors on the territorial level – recognizes various institutional mechanisms for representation and political and social participation, with different repertoires of legitimation, types of remit and degrees of subordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479742">Desrues and Hernando de Larramendi, 2011</xref>). In some cases, the legitimacy of the members that make up these mechanisms rests on universal suffrage, as is the case with the House of Representatives, while in others, such as advisory councils and commissions, it is derived from the cooption of the spokespeople for collective causes or fields of expert knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392113479742">Fernández Molina, 2011</xref>). The political regime also displays different attitudes to collective action, variously repressing, ignoring or listening and attending to its demands, although in the latter case often reformulating and reappropriating them.</p>
<p>The authorities’ recognition of their opponents’ legitimacy is distorted by a series of ‘red lines’ that cannot be crossed, relating to the fundamental questions of the configuration of the monarchical regime and its head, the Moroccan Sahara, Sunni Islam and the security forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479742">Desrues and Hernando de Larramendi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479742">Feliu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479742">Vairel, 2005</xref>). The first result of this inclusion/exclusion dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392113479742">Saaf, 1996</xref>) that should be noted is that the Monarchy recognizes the pluralism of Moroccan society at the same time as awarding itself a monopoly over deciding how it can be legitimately expressed, as well as who can participate in public affairs and how. In this sense, the sovereign occupies a position as the arbiter between the centripetal forces that exist within the population. However, this arbitration role is a very powerful one, and the King has not hesitated to intervene through his monopoly over defining the rules of the game.</p>

<title>The nature of the 20th February Movement: The contradictions between the logics of a social forum and those of a coalition movement</title>
<p>The 20th February Movement is a decentralized protest movement which, on the one hand, reorganizes a wide variety of ideological tendencies and causes and, on the other, displays a fundamental duality. This dualism means that we must distinguish between, first, the youth of the movement and, second, the personalities and groups that accompany them. This generational distinction affects not only the issue of identification of the 20th February Movement, but also the practices and tactics of every actor involved in it; and it suggests at the same time how the protests might be categorized as a social movement or as a coalition movement.</p>
<p>Those who, in January 2011, started to reflect upon the need to take advantage of the window of opportunity opened by the demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt, which would lead, from February onwards, to vigorous protest, had several things in common: their youth, a certain fondness for the new information and communication technologies and the fact that they were connected physically through biographical experiences of shared activism or episodes of earlier protest, or virtually through social networks enabled by Web 2.0. Although many of them describe themselves as ‘independents’ and it is difficult to list the number of possible affiliations that have joined the protests, the following groups are strongly represented among the youth: activists of leftist parties (Democratic Way, Unified Socialist Party, Democratic Socialist Vanguard Party), the anti-capitalist and liberal globalization movement (the association for the valuation of financial transactions and help for citizens), grassroots student unionism (National Union of Moroccan Students) and different human rights organizations (Moroccan Association of Human Rights). Also represented are activists of the ‘critical communities’ that have broken with the official culture over the issue of individual freedom and civil rights (Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms), rebellious members of student sections of parties that adopt a position of conformism with the Monarchy’s custodianship of the political arena (Socialist Union of Popular Forces, Progress and Socialism Party, Justice and Development Party), activists of the Amazigh cause, who demand rights pertaining to their status as an aboriginal people; and there are also young Islamists, a majority of whom are members of the powerful illegal association Justice and Charity, which is the main force opposing the Monarchy. The last-mentioned group are distinguished from those of Salafist faith, who find in the demonstrations an opportunity to demand the release of hundreds of detainees from among their ranks arrested after the terrorist attacks carried out in Casablanca in 2003.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity is a common factor in social movements. However, it raises serious problems when it is synonymous with ideological incompatibility. In the case of the 20th February Movement, the young instigators closest to left-wing or libertarian tendencies have had to deal with the contradictions between an inclusive will and openness to the participation of other tendencies, particularly the many Islamist activists. In attempting to go beyond previous affiliations and promote a shared identity around an agenda of protest that they identify with the voice of the people, local groups have drawn up a series of principles inspired by the World Social Forum and the groups that have arisen in recent years to fight against the high cost of living. This involves participating by subscribing to the protest agenda in an individual way, the deliberative operation of the assemblies, consensual decision-making, the rotation of functions, a refusal to acknowledge official leaders and spokespersons, and the autonomy of each local group.</p>
<p>So the local groups are a physical space of horizontal deliberation, of shared knowledge and broadly encompassing identity-building that is manifested in consensual demands and actions. However, this consensus is often forged at an earlier stage when discussions take place in Web 2.0 social networks. This perception of the 20th February Movement makes it seem more like a forum or social space where social networks made up of young individuals and the organizations to which they belong gather. In this way different types of networks are linked through diverse causes and regions. The fact that this forum is set in motion, that is, that it embodies its consensus in public protest actions, carries with it the extension of participation to organizations to which many young people in the forums belong or are close to.</p>
<p>The social question, distributive policies, employment, education, health or the fight against corruption were fundamental elements in the construction of a frame of inclusive injustice that linked with other recent demonstrations and was able to refer to factors which are important in the life of the majority of the Moroccan population. In this sense, an inclusive identity was conferred upon the 20th February Movement. By contrast, given the popularity enjoyed by Mohammed VI, the resonance of this frame of injustice among the population might be lessened due to the difficulty of connecting it with the need to modify the regime’s monarchical character and the role vouchsafed to the King. Nevertheless, its dissident side can be seen here in the fact that the movement has called into question several ‘red lines’ and pointed to the political dimension underlying many earlier demonstrations.</p>
<p>The first identifying feature of the 20th February Movement, that is, its diverse youth networks, contrasts with a second feature relating to a coalition of parties and associations that joined the demonstrations and supported the initiative led in some cases by young activists in their ranks. Around 100 civil society organizations formed the National Council for Support of the 20th February Youth Movement. Although this council was conceived as a mere logistical and financial support mechanism for the youth, joining in with the marches and other public demonstrations, a debate about the strategy to be followed arose within it from the outset, between the members who advocated the merging of the two entities and those who preferred to opt for a role of logistical support and to preserve the autonomy of the young people in the direction of the movement. The prominent role some organizations began to acquire helped to arouse suspicions that they were making use of their supportive function to pursue their own agendas.</p>
<p>This brief presentation shows that the 20th February Movement is the heir to earlier demonstrations and the culmination of a broad process in which a space of protest was formed. The internal structure of the movement has been called into question by the dissent that arose regarding the list of demands and, in particular, the issue of the institutional modalities of the constitutional change and the form of the resulting regime, the civil status of the state, equality of gender, etc. The zeal shown by the young instigators of the 20th February Movement in maintaining control of the direction of protest activities and of the forums that furnished spaces to the groups revealed the generation gap between the young people and older activists and the demand for recognition of their leading role. It also revealed the strategy they both shared: to promulgate the image of a movement of defiant regeneration.</p>
<p>Beyond its public presentation of itself as a youth movement with no activist wing, spread across various places throughout the country and coordinated through the use of Internet and mobile telephony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392113479742">Desrues, 2012</xref>), the 20th February Movement’s first demonstrations had shown that assembling antagonistic political tendencies together was possible and that they could collaborate despite their differences. The young people managed to transcend the latter by means of a deliberative culture foreign to the organizations that joined the protests. Nevertheless, the population remained in the position of spectators. The heterogeneity and dualism of the movement contributed to give credit to its opponents’ arguments with respect to possible manipulation by some organizations with a long tradition of opposition to the regime.</p>

<title>How the challenges presented by the 20th February Movement were handled</title>
<p>Responses to the challenge of the movement’s emergence have been diverse and have evolved in terms of their repertoire. But the logic underlying the Moroccan political regime’s handling of the protests was either to slow down the dilution of the main segments of Moroccan society or to fragment the social groups and spaces that make up those segments in order to prevent further legitimation of the 20th February Movement. The designated adversaries of the movement have carried out a labour of deconstruction of its identity and of its demands (counter-framing). They have done this by using devices and repertoires that rely on different types of legitimation and connect with vested interests or dominant cultural affinities in the population. An analysis of this handling of the protests also tells us about the reality of how power is exercised and how forces in Moroccan society are related.</p>
<sec id="section5-0011392113479742">
<title>Fostering the sectionalism of different groups in the Moroccan society</title>
<p>The preventative measures taken before 20 February by the political regime attempted to stem the risk that the ‘Arab Spring’ would infect Morocco. They tried, first of all, to discourage the ‘dangerous classes’ from aligning themselves with the protest, by subsidizing basic foodstuffs to alleviate the hardship of daily life. The government promised to satisfy some of the demands of other groups that continued to enjoy a significant attraction among the populace and might become recalcitrant, such as the movement of unemployed graduates and the unions. The pro-human rights organizations and the main parliamentary opposition party, the Islamist Justice and Development Party (JDP), also received tokens of good will from the regime.</p>
<p>This work of splitting the opposition was accompanied by acts of intimidation and disinformation against the visible leaders of the 20th February Movement in an attempt to make them cancel the demonstration of 20th February. A hostile campaign unleashed on the Internet and in media sympathetic to the regime disseminated doctored images of some young people which framed them as unbelievers (drinkers of alcohol, Christian converts) and unpatriotic (sympathetic to the Polisario Front). The campaign reached its climax when the official news agency issued a press release announcing the cancellation of the 20th February march. The press release, signed by three young promoters of the first list of demands published on the Internet, denounced the influence of extremist organizations within the 20th February Movement and extolled the virtues of returning to the path of the reforms, only this time under the leadership of Mohammed VI. These arguments, reiterated like a leitmotiv by the government’s spokesperson to the media, sowed doubts about the true nature of the movement, its unaffiliated identity and its commitment to peaceful and orderly change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392113479742">
<title>The King’s offensive: A constitutional reform</title>
<p>On 9 March, Mohammed VI gave a speech, in which he announced a constitutional review; the speech made no mention of the 20th February Movement. He presented a road map that was framed as a deepening of the reforms that he had promoted during the 10 years of his reign. The constitutional review would include issues that were part of the 20th February Movement’s demands. However, it omitted the fundamental question of the democratic election of a Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>People sympathetic to the cause of the Amazigh people, human rights, the promotion of gender equality, the consolidation of the rule of law and the role of civil society interpreted in the road map a willingness on the part of the Monarchy to consider their demands. Along the same lines, they noted the acquiescence to the demands of some of the main political parties – Istiqlal, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces and the Party of Progress and Socialism – that had ceased their opposition to the regime in the 1990s, in the hope of being rewarded through the powers of the parliament, the government and the prime minister being reinforced.</p>
<p>An Advisory Committee for Constitutional Reform (ACCR) was placed in charge of submitting a document on reform to the King within a time limit of 100 days. The King appointed 19 members, chosen primarily from academics and figures from civil society who would be able to express in this text the feelings of the interest groups to be consulted – within the limits of what the King was open to. This ‘epistemic community’ asked political parties and civil society forces to submit their proposals. Alongside the ACCR a mechanism for political monitoring was established which invited political parties and trade unions to express their opinions on the draft texts that they would be presented with before the final document was drafted.</p>
<p>In its content and creative methods, this offer of reform provided a certain level of satisfaction to different groups and guaranteed a new step on the path of a slow and progressive change under the Monarchy’s tutelage, removed from the uncertainty of the outcome of ‘revolutionary’ processes that the various interest groups, collectives and social groups, who were aware of the limits of their ability to appeal to society, feared so much. This relative satisfaction indicated a population that remained frightened by the memory of the waves of repression that had marked the Years of Lead (1965–1990). There was therefore a reinforcement of the traditional arbitrational role of the Monarchy in matters relating to defining the identity and limits of the Moroccan political community. It was a role based alternatively on authorizing or disallowing, on protecting or persecuting, or rather on legitimating or otherwise both social behaviours and practices as well as the affiliations of the King’s subjects to different national, ethnic, linguistic, religious, civil and cultural communities. In this regard, disputes about freedom of conscience and the status given to religion and official languages in the Constitution showed the high potential for political tensions surrounding these definitions.</p>
<p>The ACCR invited the 20th February Movement to formulate its proposals. However, as a government spokesman pointed out, this recognition was only extended to young people ‘with demands made in good faith’, which is to say to those prepared to rule out any demand for a democratically elected Constituent Assembly. The 20th February Movement youth and the organizations that supported them were divided over the attitude they should adopt. A minority decided to participate in the constitutional reform process, while the majority opted for a boycott and renewed mobilizations with the goal of keeping up the social pressure on the ACCR to have their demands met. The conversion of the election of a democratically elected Constituent Assembly into a non-negotiable demand resulted in the 20th February Movement staying within a logic of protest, and provided arguments to its opponents as they continued with their work of ‘counter-framing’ the movement as radicalized and unrepresentative. In addition to splitting the movement’s youth, this counter-framing accentuated a dividing line between groups fighting for the end of a monarchic regime – Democratic Way and the Islamist Justice and Charity – and the other left-wing forces within the coalition that called for a parliamentary monarchy, e.g. the Unified Socialist Party, the National Congress Party and the Democratic and Socialist Vanguard Party.</p>
<p>Having opened the process of constitutional review, King Mohammed VI regained the initiative and appropriated demands for reform, turning them into a counter-offer of reform whose process, content and scope he controlled. The promise of satisfying specific demands and the consultative process allowed the political and associative spheres to be sectionalized once again, with the deadlines, pace and methods of the dialogue preventing a broad and deep debate from opening up. A formula of negotiation replaced a deliberative one. The majority of the forces involved in the consultative process played the role, first and foremost, of staging a show of Moroccan political and social pluralism. They accepted this role in the hope that the Monarchy would reward their conformity. Furthermore, the July 2011 referendum for the ratification of the Constitution gave popular legitimacy to reforms and undermined continuance of the mobilizations. The democratic repertoire was mobilized once again through bringing the elections to the House of Representatives forward to November 2011. The victory of the Islamist Justice and Development Party, which was allowed for the first time to lead the process of forming a government, conveyed an image of a process of change that had popular legitimacy and did not carry any apparent risk of political instability, something that stood in contrast to developments in neighbouring countries. Also, the support received from the European Union and the monarchies of the Cooperation Council for the Gulf States strengthened a regime that often outsources the financing of its public policy initiatives. However, the fact that the Moroccan authorities were able to create the impression of controlling the course of events that arose as a result of the 20th February Movement does not mean that they limited themselves to measures based around the resectionalization and differentiation of the social and political spheres.</p>

<sec id="section7-0011392113479742">
<title>Strategies to neutralize the public demonstrations: Police control and the rule of law</title>
<p>In managing the 20th February Movement, the police simultaneously developed coercive, persuasive and informational strategies. Police pressure created through arrests, intimidation or visits to homes, and the summoning of 20th February Movement activists to police stations occurred during the mobilizations. While a model of negotiated control seems to have taken priority in the management of the first large demonstrations of 20 February, 20 March and 20 April, from the month of May a more forceful model was favoured. Depending on the city, the types of gathering, the routes of the marches, the institutions being targeted and the date, there was either selective or blanket repression, which was carried out either by state-controlled organisms or the 20th February Movement’s opponents.</p>
<p>The systematic use of force to disperse attempts to carry out sit-ins highlights the symbolic value that certain areas or locations where protests are held can acquire, as was the case with Tahrir Square in the Egyptian capital. Following the terrorist attack on Marrakesh that took place on 28 April, the fear among members of the 20th February Movement that the security forces would take advantage of the event to put an end to the demonstrations, whether through a wave of arrests or arguing for increased security measures, pushed them to take the offensive and convene a sit-in in the vicinity of the headquarters of the Territorial Security Directorate (DST). Organized for the highly significant date of 15 May, the eve of the anniversary of the 16 May 2003 bombings, the protests denounced the practice of torture as part of a dirty war against domestic and international terrorism, something which the regime did not admit to. The demonstrators did not consider the potential for confrontation that organizing this protest would bring; it ended with a brutal dispersal of people who were trying to reach the meeting place for the protest and opened a cycle of repression that would last until the constitutional referendum was held on 1 July.</p>
<p>The forces of law and order did not have a monopoly over pressuring and repressing the 20th February Movement. On several occasions, counter-demonstrators were contracted to harass 20th February Movement marches as they were in progress, with some participants even being physically attacked. In the course of their activities these counter-demonstrators recorded the people they were attacking in order to report them to the authorities in the event that they responded with violence. Not all of the counter-demonstrators had the goal of intimidating those who participated in the 20th February Movement’s marches, however. During the referendum campaign public demonstrations were organized in support of the Monarch and the Constitution; these did not seek to physically confront the 20th February Movement, but rather to demonstrate that it did not represent the feelings of the majority of the population.</p>
<p>To justify breaking up demonstrations, the authorities turned to arguments of legal compliance. The legislation concerning public gatherings requires ‘a prior notification [of] all processions, parades, and in general any demonstration on a public thoroughfare’. The only groups permitted to do so are ‘political parties, trade unions, professional organisations and legally declared associations’. The 20th February Movement was therefore excluded under these provisions. The argument of ‘unauthorized marches’ was reinforced by other arguments based on the damage caused to residents and nearby businesses along the routes of the marches, or in the case of the accusations launched at the DST headquarters, with the creation of an enquiry commission headed by the recently formed National Committee for Human Rights.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The analysis shows that, in Morocco’s case, collective action is possible and can yield results that affect the political regime. Although the emergence of the 20th February Movement cannot be understood without the earlier wave of protests in Tunisia and Egypt, and without the background of social protest in recent Moroccan history, it introduces innovative elements as a youth protest promoting a political counter-culture through interconnectedness and deliberation in the forums and spaces furnished by local social youth groups. This dynamic could have resulted in the formation of an unprecedented social movement. However, the antagonistic forces regained strength owing to the regime’s handling of the situation. The coalition of organizations split over attitudes towards the ACCR’s invitation to collaborate, the modification of the agenda of demands and competition for the rank and file of the 20th February Movement, thus reinforcing the dual and plural nature of the movement.</p>
<p>Our analysis therefore reveals both the segmentation that runs through Moroccan society and the existence of possible bridges between social and political forces. Nevertheless, those bridges are fragile and the regime made use of those same segments in society in its attempt to neutralize the 20th February Movement. This reinforced the image of an active minority that was hardly representative.</p>
<p>The resources belonging to the different repertoires of legitimation that make up the hybridization of the Moroccan regime are: democratic (popular ratification of the constitutional referendum and elections), those belonging to the rule of law (compliance with the laws on the right to demonstrate in the public space) and authoritarian (the discretional nature of the reform process and repression of the 20th February Movement). They have all been exploited by the Monarchy, which has adopted them according to the pressure of critical situations that have arisen as the protests have developed (the publication of an agenda of demands; the boycotting of the constitutional revision process; threats to the state security services; the continuation of protests during the referendum campaign).</p>
<p>In short, there is a conjunction of two variables that must be taken into account when analysing ‘the Moroccan exception’ with respect to the development of the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes in 2011. One is the dual nature of a protest movement that combines, not without tensions, a social youth movement with a coalition movement; the other is the hybrid nature of the political regime. This does not mean that the 20th February Movement has failed completely. It has managed to legitimate the demand for a parliamentary monarchy might put an end to the hybrid nature of the existing regime.</p>
