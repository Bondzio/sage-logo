<p>Credibility is a major component of leadership. People follow leaders who have earned the respect and trust of their followers. <italic>Credibility: How Leaders Gain and Lose It, Why People Demand It</italic> by Drs. James Kouzes and Barry Posner explores the concept of credibility by explaining what leaders must do to earn and maintain their followers.</p>
<p>Kouzes and Posner are two of the most distinguished educators in the field of organizational development. Previous joint book publications include the following: <italic>The Leadership Challenge</italic> (4th ed., 2007), <italic>Encouraging the Heart: A Leader’s Guide to Rewarding and Recognizing Others</italic> (2003), and <italic>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership: When Leaders Are at Their Best</italic> (2000). This most recently revised edition, <italic>Credibility</italic>, is based on a longitudinal study of leadership practices found in an array of organizational settings. Since the early 1980s, the authors surveyed more than 100,000 people to identify the most commonly identified characteristics of an effective leader and, since then, have added additional data that further complement the essentials of good leadership. While the content can be used as a coaching tool for a variety of audiences in both nonprofit and for-profit settings, the vignettes offer leaders a chance to learn and grow in today’s complex global environment.</p>
<p>The book is organized into nine chapters, of which six chapters correspond and are devoted to the disciplines of becoming a credible leader: “Discover Your Self,” “Appreciate Constituents,” “Affirm Shared Values,” “Develop Capacity,” “Serve a Purpose,” and “Sustain Hope.” The authors define the word <italic>discipline</italic> as representing a way of learning. In essence, credibility is not an inherited trait, but one that is learned over time. Therefore, successful leaders must be committed to a lifetime of learning.</p>
<p>The focus of the chapter “Discover Your Self” is on the leader as an individual. Self-discovery, competence, and character play important roles in defining the individual as a leader. Personal reflection helps a leader evaluate his or her values on an individual and professional basis to determine whether there are any performance gaps that need to be addressed. Competence is seen as an essential feature of leadership, as one must have a good understanding of an organization’s system to successfully guide it.</p>
<p>The “Appreciate Constituents” chapter examines the importance of understanding one’s values and how they align with those of constituents. Emphasis is placed on understanding the collective values of the leader and his or her followers, so a strategy can be developed that will best suit an organization’s objectives. In the “Affirm Shared Values” chapter, importance is stressed on leaders using their skills to develop a common ground on which to build a shared vision. A shared vision makes it easier for an organization’s followers to affirm, believe, and achieve the mission of any organization.</p>
<p>The “Develop Capacity” chapter focuses on the organization as a learning community. A leader is the catalytic agent who provides the tools needed for followers to succeed. He or she acts as the facilitator who guides constituents on a path to lifelong learning and the achievement of their own self-actualization. Developing the capacity to lead cannot be realized without acknowledging the importance of accountability. In the “Serve a Purpose” chapter, leaders are seen as individuals who not only act on the basis of organizational policies, but in a manner that is ethically and morally correct. Credible leaders are those who are willing to risk their personal careers to confront critical inconsistencies within an organization’s environment. In the final chapter “Sustain Hope,” the focus is on the leader as an inspirational person. Credible leaders are seen as compassionate and understanding individuals who are willing to motivate and guide their followers to succeed.</p>
<p>Overall, this book focuses on the development of a leader’s emotional intelligence as the key to successful leadership. Drs. Kouzes and Posner show how mindfulness and compassion are central to the development of great leaders. The examples provided in this book serve as great sources of critical reflection for anyone interested in developing or improving skills as a leader in today’s complex environment. To develop and maintain institutions that will survive, leaders are required to engage in constant renewal and rebuilding processes, and this book will clarify those processes.</p>
